BEL;2010;8;1;84. The European Union had always been a strong supporter of the technical cooperation programme, to which it was one of the main contributors. Addressing the global challenges of hunger, disease, poverty and water resource management and creating a cleaner and safer environment was of particular significance to developing countries, and the Agency’s efforts in those areas were valued. While it was important to ensure fair access to technical cooperation funding, there was a great need for technical assistance in the least developed countries. The commitment of a beneficiary country was a key factor in achieving a successful outcome in technical cooperation projects. The European Union underlined the importance of technical cooperation activities that contributed to achieving and sustaining solid nuclear and radiation safety and security infrastructures at all levels. Technical cooperation management and project implementation needed to become more efficient, effective and accountable, for the benefit of all Member States. The European Union supported transparent project management based on verifiable performance indicators and believed that regular and transparent interaction between the Secretariat, Member State representatives and national institutions would help accomplish clear project objectives and achieve sustainable results. In order to maximize the socio-economic impact of the technical cooperation programme, it was crucial for the Agency to further develop partnerships with other organizations, where appropriate, taking into account the fact that it did not have the leading mandate in every field in which it was active;1;TC
BEL;2010;8;1;85. The Medium Term Strategy for 2012–2017 should reflect those areas where the Agency had a leading mandate and should focus on strategic goals, objectives and activities to provide practical guidance for formulating major programmes. It also needed to include specific targets for efficiency, effectiveness and transparency with clear performance indicators.;1;ADM
CAN;2010;10;1;127. He applauded the Director General’s work to broaden understanding of the Agency’s work outside the area of non-proliferation. Canada remained a strongly supporter of the Agency’s technical cooperation activities, which made a positive contribution to global peace, security and prosperity, and it was a major contributor to the TCF. He commended the efforts of the Department of Technical Cooperation to improve transparency, accountability and results-based management and encouraged it to continue those efforts.;1;TC
MYS;2010;6;0;129. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia) said that technical cooperation should be based on Member States’ needs and requests, be formulated in accordance with established guidelines and, given that countries’ capabilities, needs and priorities varied, should be in line with their respective legitimate national development requirements. In addition, regional and interregional projects should be formulated with a high level of transparency in consultation with Member States.;1;TC
AFG;2010;NA;0;199. Mr HAKIMI (Afghanistan) said that his Government regarded the work of the Agency as playing a key role in helping to enhance global scientific and technical cooperation and ensure nuclear safety and security. It appreciated the fact that the Agency carried out its mandate with independence, objectivity and transparency. Securing energy supplies while counteracting climate change would remain high on the organization’s agenda, as would joint efforts on nutrition, potable water and health care. He thanked the Secretariat for publishing the Programme Performance Report for 2008–2009 (GOV/2010/40) and congratulated the staff of the Agency on the favourable results that had been accomplished in that biennium. It was important to ensure that sufficient resources continued to be allocated for Member States — and especially for developing countries — interested in introducing nuclear technology. His country continued to support the Agency’s work and was interested in increasing further its level of cooperation with it.;1;ADM
NLD;2010;10;1;119. As a strong supporter of the Agency’s technical cooperation activities, the Netherlands had pledged its full target share to the TCF for 2011. Through its technical cooperation programme, the Agency could make a real contribution to such global issues as health, food, water and the environment, and help achieve sustainable national and international development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. However, with a view to making the most of the funds available, the management and transparency of the programme needed to be improved and brought into line with established United Nations standards. Also, cooperation with relevant international organizations should be intensified. The least developed countries needed to be better represented in the technical cooperation programme as they had the greatest socio-economic development needs. In addition, the programme’s statutory and policy framework for safety, security and safeguards should be fully implemented to prevent unnecessary risk to the health of the public, workers and patients, or to the environment. The danger of material ending up in the wrong hands also had to be addressed.;1;TC
KWT;2010;-7;0;133. Kuwait reaffirmed the inalienable right of all States without distinction to possess and develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. In March 2009 it had pledged a sum of $10 million for the establishment of a nuclear fuel bank under the Agency’s auspices. It supported the continuation of a transparent and constructive dialogue aimed at the development of a multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle and the establishment of supply assurance mechanisms, including a nuclear fuel bank that would serve as a last resort for countries wishing to benefit from such fuel. At the same time, Kuwait called on the Director General and the Secretariat to continue studying the proposal and to assist in reconciling different views by submitting a further paper on the matter.;1;ADM
LBN;2010;7;1;138. Lebanon was deeply grateful to the Agency for its assistance under the technical cooperation programme and for the transparency and assiduity it had displayed in seeking the best possible results. His country was, for its part, fully committed to compliance with the Agency’s standards and guidelines.;1;TC
IRL;2010;10;1;192. As the burden on the Agency increased in the years to come, it was incumbent on Member States to ensure that it had the political, technical and financial support it needed to carry out its responsibilities. It was equally incumbent on the Agency to improve the efficiency, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and transparency of its structures and practices.;1;ADM
CUB;2010;-7;0;34. Cuba endorsed the statement made recently to the Board of Governors on behalf of the NAM and the Group of 77 and China on the issue of nuclear fuel supply assurances 2 . Any analysis of that crucial matter should be inclusive and transparent and related decisions should be agreed by consensus. Her country rejected any attempt to use the supply of nuclear fuel as a means of political or economic coercion, as a means of discrimination or as a mechanism for preserving the monopoly of a few .;1;ADM
CUB;2010;-7;0;37. The climate of lack of confidence that had arisen with respect to the Agency’s verification activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic, as a result of geopolitical interests and double standards, was a cause for deep concern. Verification activities should, above all, respect the sovereignty and national interests of the Member States, and Agency inspectors and staff should act with impartiality and professionalism and not be subject to any pressure. She called on the Secretariat to continue its efforts to foster a climate of understanding, impartiality, confidence and transparency in which a solution could be found once and for all to the safeguards issues under consideration by the Board of Governors and the General Conference. Cuba supported the Director General’s efforts to facilitate the supply of fuel for the Tehran research reactor, based on the agreement signed by Brazil and Turkey with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it urged the Vienna Group to respond positively to that proposal. It also supported denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through a negotiated solution. The elimination and total prohibition of nuclear weapons, and the threat they posed, was the only guarantee for human survival.;1;SG
AUT;2006;10;1;19. It was worrying to learn from the Nuclear Safety Review for the Year 2005, which her country had welcomed, that avoidable nuclear incidents continued to occur. The Agency should strengthen its activities to ensure the utmost transparency and exchange of information among all Member States.;1;INSTR
NGA;2006;4;0;9. He welcomed the special event on assurance of supply and non-proliferation which was being held during the General Conference. The initiatives in that area seemed to be enjoying growing support among Member States and Nigeria was prepared to join the discussions on the understanding that the legal and technical implications would be explored in a transparent manner.;1;ADM
CUB;2006;7;0;21. Cuba shared the frustration of a large number of countries regarding the lack of progress with respect to disarmament and the prevailing tendency to focus efforts on non-proliferation. Disarmament and non-proliferation had received special attention at the recent 14th summit of Heads of State or Government of the NAM held in Havana. The documents from that meeting would be distributed shortly but he wished to highlight some of the views expressed on disarmament and the Agency. The NAM Heads of State or Government had reaffirmed their positions of principle on nuclear disarmament, which continued to be NAM’s highest priority, and the related issue of nuclear non-proliferation. They had emphasized their concern regarding the threat to humanity posed by the existence of nuclear weapons, their possible use, or the threat of their use. They had expressed profound concern over the slow progress towards nuclear disarmament and the lack of progress by the nuclear-weapon States toward eliminating their arsenals. They had reaffirmed the inalienable right of developing countries to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and had expressed concern over continuing excessive restrictions on the export of material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes to developing countries. They had emphasized that proliferation concerns would be better met through multilateral, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements, that non-proliferation agreements should be transparent and open to all States, and that no restriction should be imposed on access to material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes required by developing countries to further their development. They had rejected the attempts of any Member State to use the Agency’s technical cooperation programme as a political tool in violation of the Agency’s Statute. They had emphasized the positive role played by NAM members in the Agency and had noted the need for all members to respect the Statute. They had stressed that the Agency’s activities should not be subjected to any pressure or improper interference, especially in the area of verification, that could jeopardize the organization’s efficiency and credibility. They had recognized that the Agency was the only competent authority to verify compliance with obligations entered into under safeguards agreements and had reaffirmed the need to make a clear distinction between such legal obligations and voluntary commitments. Finally they had congratulated the Agency and its Director General on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005 and had expressed their full confidence in the impartiality and professionalism of the Agency. Following the summit, Cuba was taking over the presidency of NAM for the coming 3 years and, consequently, would be coordinating the work of the Vienna Chapter. He thanked Malaysia for its leadership of NAM in recent years.;1;SG
IDN;2006;8;1;35. His country appreciated the work undertaken by the Agency in the area of nuclear safety and security, and safeguards and verification to ensure non-proliferation. However, proliferation concerns and safeguard issues were best addressed through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory agreements. Non-proliferation control arrangements should be transparent and open to the participation of all States and should not impose restrictions on access to material, equipment and technology. As a party to the NPT and a safeguards agreement and additional protocol, Indonesia supported the inalienable right of all States to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with the NPT. Nothing in that Treaty should be interpreted as affecting that right, which constituted one of its fundamental objectives. Each country’s decision in that regard should be respected, without jeopardizing its policies, international cooperation agreements, arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy or its fuel cycle policies.;1;SG
MAR;2006;-6;0;69. Morocco had supported all initiatives to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, had encouraged all efforts to achieve disarmament and the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and had promoted the introduction of a credible Agency verification regime. It therefore welcomed the conclusion of new safeguards agreements and additional protocols that strengthened the universality of the safeguards system. In cooperation with the Agency, it had organized a seminar on the additional protocol in December 2005 for African officials responsible for safeguards-related issues. The credibility of the safeguards system depended both on its capacity to detect illicit activities and on its universal, transparent and just implementation. Therefore, ways had to be found to encourage States that had not yet done so to adhere to the safeguards system and the additional protocol.;1;SG
SYR;2006;-7;0;63. Participants in the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute should show flexibility, transparency and objectivity in adopting recommendations and should avoid interfering with the aspirations of developing countries, in particular to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. As the Committee was advisory, its recommendations should be adopted by consensus. Developing countries were being denied access to nuclear technology on the pretext of non-proliferation. While his country strongly supported the non-proliferation regime, some countries could not be allowed to monopolize nuclear knowledge and technology at the expense of others.;1;SG
CAN;2006;10;1;117. Her country attached considerable importance to an effective and efficient safeguards system that was responsive to new verification challenges and continued to provide the basis for credible safeguards conclusions. It supported a system that utilized a State-level perspective and was both transparent in its processes and non-discriminatory in its implementation. Canada looked forward to continuing to work with the Agency to strengthen the safeguards system in general, and to implement an effective and efficient State-level integrated safeguards approach in Canada.;1;INSTR
BEL;2006;10;1;84. Events had unfortunately demonstrated that comprehensive safeguards alone could not provide conclusive proof of the absence of undeclared nuclear activities. The additional protocol, which should be concluded by all States, enabled the Secretariat to verify State declarations fully. In the event of any serious doubt about whether a State was meeting its commitments, that State should automatically make every effort to cooperate transparently with the Agency to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.;1;SG
SGP;2006;-2;0;26. In defending the right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, the Agency also had to ensure that that right was exercised in compliance with States’ non-proliferation obligations under Articles I, II and III of the NPT and Agency safeguards, and with the utmost transparency. The safeguards system had to remain able to respond to new challenges in a credible and effective manner and the Agency’s verification regime should continue to play a central role in providing the necessary safeguards assurances. Singapore was working to put in place the instruments required to ratify the additional protocol, which it had signed in September 2005, and to modify its SQP in the near future. It advocated the universalization of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols and urged Member States that had yet to undertake such commitments to do so at the earliest opportunity.;1;ADM
DNK;2002;10;1;132. Recruitment and management of the Agency’s human resources were important issues. He expressed concern about emerging difficulties in the process of staff recruitment at the higher levels and stressed the need for increased transparency in that regard.;1;ADM
DNK;2002;10;1;133. As announced at the meeting of the Board of Governors in March 2002, the European Union proposed to introduce a single euro-based currency system with respect to the Agency taking effect from the 2004-2005 biennium. That would improve transparency, effectiveness and efficiency in the Agency’s management of its financial resources. The European Union looked forward to the Secretariat’s comprehensive report on the matter expected later in 2002 with a view to agreement on a proposal during the first half of 2003.;1;ADM
DNK;2002;10;1;136. The great importance attached by the European Union to technical co-operation was well demonstrated by its very high level of voluntary contributions, amounting to approximately 35% of the total contributions in 2002. Those important activities needed adequate financing and the European Union would contribute constructively to the Board of Governors’ review of the funding mechanism for technical co-operation in 2003. Technical co-operation funds should be used in the most cost-effective, efficient and transparent way possible and it was important that the Secretariat provided a detailed breakdown of the Regular Budget expenditure on technical co-operation in all its departments and programmes. He expressed concern at the some $7 million owed in outstanding assessed programme costs as at June 2002, representing nearly 10% of the target figure for 2002 for the TCF. That debt posed a serious impediment to implementation of the technical co-operation programme. The European Union strongly supported the revised strategy paper on technical co-operation which emphasized a demand-driven approach and clear priority-setting, and welcomed the approach the Secretariat had taken in recent years in devoting considerable efforts to supporting countries in selecting and prioritizing their projects. That had led to fewer and more focused projects which better reflected the needs and priorities of Member States. Also technical assistance could serve as a catalyst for national efforts to ensure the safety and security of nuclear material and other radioactive sources.;1;TC
ITA;2002;10;1;35. Italy held sixth place among the major contributors to the Agency’s Regular Budget and honoured its financial commitments on time every year. It expected that commitment to be reflected by more careful consideration in the Secretariat’s recruitment policy. For the recruitment of high-level and senior staff, in particular, more transparent selection criteria would benefit management and would eventually lead to a greater spirit of ownership and participation among Member States.;1;ADM
ARM;2002;5;0;199. Commenting upon remarks made by the delegate of Azerbaijan in the Plenary the previous day 3 , he said that the Agency owed its effectiveness to its technical and scientific competence, the transparency of its operations and the objectivity of its assessments, but also to its efforts to remain above political controversy. He was therefore disappointed to note that Azerbaijan’s recent accession to the Agency had not given it a sense of moderation or responsibility, but had merely provided it with yet another forum in which to criticize Armenia. In reply to Azerbaijan’s specific accusations about the safety and security of Armenia’s nuclear facilities, he could state that the Armenian nuclear power plant and all activities related to it had been subjected to the most thorough safety evaluation. Since 1994, some 30 missions from the Agency and elsewhere, involving over 100 experts and inspectors each year, had examined every aspect of Armenia’s nuclear energy programme. Azerbaijan had been invited to join those inspections. Its constant repetition of the same accusations could only be a sign of bad faith.;1;ADM
CAN;2002;10;1;55. The events of 11 September 2001 had led to renewed concerns about nuclear security and safety. The Agency had played an important role in allaying such concerns by informing the public about its mandate and activities in an open and transparent manner. Canada particularly welcomed the Agency's comprehensive programme to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism and would be making an additional contribution in support of the Agency's work relating to IPPAS missions. The threat of nuclear terrorism could be successfully addressed through the combined efforts of the Agency and individual Member States. It was important to acknowledge that nuclear security was the shared responsibility of all States. However, to be sustainable that programme should be included in the Agency's Regular Budget. It was pleasing to note that the Agency's efforts had provided an impetus to complementary initiatives, notably the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction in whose development Canada had played a key role;1;ADM
ZAF;1998;9;1;"81. The situation was less encouraging where the formal entry into force was concerned - for obvious reasons such as the changes in national legislation that needed to be effected. However, his delegation believed that another important problem might be uncertainty about the practical aspects of implementing the protocol, in other words, the so-called ""integration of current and new measures"". The IAEA and its Member States would have to make a transition from a situation of restricted information and access (albeit compensated by very accurate materials accounting) to a situation of total nuclear transparency, which amongst other things would involve substantially more information and wider access. It was a difficult transition from a culture of ""nuclear secrecy"" with a highly quantitative implementation approach to a culture of openness where the only restriction would be the need to protect confidential commercial information. It was incumbent upon Member States to make that transition consciously, but also upon the Secretariat to be open and clear on how safeguards conclusions would be formulated in future on the basis of more qualitative judgements and more use of random access and verifications while taking into account the very different fuel cycle activities of Member States.";1;SG
RUS;1998;3;0;6. The Russian Federation supported the Agency's initiative to establish a special fund for nuclear disarmament. However, the additional resources should not be restricted to purposes relating to the transparency of nuclear disarmament only, but should also be devoted to the optimum use of plutonium removed from nuclear military programmes.;1;INSTR
CAN;1998;10;1;97. In playing its crucial role in the fight against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Agency's main objective had always been to verify, through its safeguards system, the compliance by States with the commitments they had made to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. During the present session, Canada would sign an additional protocol to the safeguards agreement which it had concluded with the Agency and he was pleased to see that several other States intended to do likewise. All Member States should conclude and implement such protocols as soon as possible, hi applying the strengthened safeguards system, the Agency should first try to make it more effective and more efficient by integrating the traditional measures and the new measures. It should also establish priorities and concentrate its efforts on the most important aspects of the prevention of proliferation. In addition, national statements on the Agency's safeguards activities in the country concerned should be prepared in a systematic and transparent manner.;1;SG
SVN;1998;10;1;117. All Member States should bear in mind that further efforts needed to be made to achieve additional savings without affecting the Agency's ability to meet its programme objectives. The Agency had already demonstrated transparency in that area and he was sure that the Director General would continue to move in the same direction. Member States should take part in those efforts. Prompt payment of assessed contributions would help to improve the Agency's financial situation and ensure a greater degree of implementation. Slovenia was in the process of effecting budgetary reforms in order to improve its financial situation. In the light of the importance that it attached to the Agency and despite Slovenia's strict budgetary constraints, Slovenia would continue to support co-operation with the Agency.;1;ADM
CHL;1998;8;1;122. Chile had vigorously supported the strengthening of the Agency's safeguards system, because it was sure that that system would bring greater transparency to the nuclear activities of countries. It hoped to be able to enter shortly into consultations with the Agency with a view to signing an additional protocol.;1;SG
CHE;1998;10;1;130. The Agency's study on the radiological situation of the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls had shown that the fears expressed on the subject had been unfounded. France had demonstrated transparency in requesting the Agency to conduct a study of the test site and Switzerland hoped that other States with such sites would do likewise.;1;INSTR
NOR;1998;10;1;144. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material was an international problem and Norway was participating actively in various projects to strengthen systems for prevention and detection. It appreciated the initiatives taken by the Agency in that area and recommended that efforts be stepped up, including efforts to assist various countries in establishing legal frameworks and systems of transparency to improve detection and law enforcement. Fanatical terrorist groups were becoming more and more cynical in the methods they used to promote their causes. Their use of nuclear or radioactive material in future actions could not be ruled out. In order to avoid such scenarios, it was essential to give high priority to safeguards, physical protection, illicit trafficking and legal frameworks.;1;INSTR
SVN;1998;10;1;25. The first unit of the Mochovce power plant had reached criticality on 9 June 1998, and the commissioning of unit 2 was planned for 1999. The Mochovce nuclear power plant was an example of international co-operation to achieve internationally acceptable safety standards, with companies from France, Germany, the United States, the Russian Federation, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as the Agency, having been involved. The Agency's services in particular were an essential component of international transparency in all safety-related matters.;1;INSTR
IRQ;1998;-9;0;20. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) noted that seven years had passed since the Agency had been authorized by the Security Council in section C of resolution 687 to destroy, remove and render harmless the former Iraqi nuclear programme. During that time, the Agency had carried out all the missions assigned to it, yet as a result of pressure by the United States, the Security Council had not yet taken a decision to transfer the nuclear file from the disarmament stage to the monitoring stage. The Agency had regrettably reinforced such pressure by stating in its report to the Security Council on 27 July 1998 that the non-existence of indications of the availability of prohibited equipment, materials or activities did not rule out their existence. It had also raised doubts about Iraq's co-operation and accused it of lack of full transparency;1;INSTR
CHN;1994;-7;0;114. China supported the Agency's endeavours to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system and believed that the system should be just, objective, reasonable, transparent and practicable. It should be able to deter and detect any noncompliance, and redress any such instance. China had always maintained that the underlying aim of improving the effectiveness of safeguards should be to build confidence. Any measures adopted should be in strict conformity with the Statute and other relevant international legal instruments, should respect State sovereignty, and ensure the equal status, rights and obligations of all countries. In view of the complex nature of international relations, a vigilant guard should be kept against the possible abuse of environmental monitoring;1;SG
KOR;1994;6;0;33. With regard to recent press reports on the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials, he welcomed the European Union's initiative in raising the issue and reiterated his delegation's concern that the Agency should take a more active role in the storage and management worldwide of sensitive fissile materials. Individual national authorities should also strive harder to prevent the unauthorized circulation of nuclear material. An international system should be established under the auspices of the Agency in order to monitor such activities and help guarantee full nuclear transparency. His delegation was willing to participate actively in whatever measures the Conference might wish to recommend.;1;INSTR
MEX;1994;4;0;85. From the point of view of building international confidence in non-proliferation, transparency was acquiring increasing importance as a guiding principle in all the multifarious aspects of the Agency's work and the Member States' activities. In the area of administration, the harmonization of financial documents and reorganization of the budget would lend the Agency's management processes greater transparency, while also facilitating evaluation of its activities and enabling it to make the most rational use of its scarce resources.;1;ADM
MEX;1994;4;0;86. The designation of members of the Board, a process of the utmost importance and complexity, was no exception to the transparency rule. In order to establish such transparency, it was necessary to follow the lines laid down in Article VI of the Statute and to establish clear and precise criteria for comparing the levels of nuclear development attained by different countries. Revision of Article VI was a prerequisite for strengthening the Agency and, to that end, the composition of its policy-making organs needed to be modified to reflect the new international situation, the Agency's increased membership and the political regrouping of countries and regions. That fundamental step would equip the organization to meet the demands of heterogeneous societies with diverse and changing interests, while at the same time enabling it to transmit technological advances more even handedly and safely by means of improved mechanisms for guaranteeing the peaceful use of nuclear energy.;1;GOV
SVN;1994;10;1;89. With regard to the other main functions of the Agency, his country appreciated the Agency's activities in the field of nuclear safety - particularly international review mission programmes such as OSART, ASSET, ASCOT, IPERS and INSARR, which regularly demonstrated the transparency of Slovenia's nuclear activities. With regard to the Nuclear Safety Convention, the Director General and the Group of Experts and its Chairman were to be thanked for their efforts and their professional approach. Slovenia was honoured to be among the first Member States to sign the Convention, and his delegation was pleased to note that a large number of Member States had signed it on the first day, ensuring its entry into force in the very near future.;1;INSTR
NGA;1994;-7;0;120. His delegation had noted the steps taken by the Secretariat to implement General Conference resolution GC(XXXVI)/RES/581, which requested the Director General to ensure harmony and compatibility between the Agency's programme and budget documents and its annual reports and accounts in order to facilitate comparison. He welcomed those efforts and urged that the change from an organization-based to a programme-based appropriation system be carried out as rapidly as possibly, since it would eventually result in improved transparency and better management.;1;ADM
PHL;1994;8;1;"120. That ""political"" decision was inextricably linked with the issue of transparency in the workings of the Board of Governors. Everyone knew that the Agency had always set great store by transparency in its activities, particularly in the field of safeguards. The Board had adopted resolutions calling on Member States to make full disclosures of information on those of their activities about which the Agency was concerned. With regard to designations, however, some members of the Board had consistently refused to be transparent. Although the Board had decided in 1958 that the list of members proposed for designation should be in alphabetical order, at least the criteria applied should be made known to all.";1;GOV
NZL;1994;10;1;183. Also, New Zealand welcomed other initiatives already undertaken by the Agency in order to promote transparency regarding nuclear activities. Since the previous General Conference session, his country had formally become a participant in the voluntary reporting system for nuclear material and specified equipment and non-nuclear material, and it would like all countries to participate in the system.;1;INSTR
PHL;1994;8;1;52. Mr. ARCILLA (Philippines) commended those who had also voted against the motion for their courage and sense of fairness and thanked those who had abstained from voting, thereby indicating that they were in sympathy with the thinking behind the draft resolution submitted by the Philippines. The aim of the draft resolution had been to create greater transparency in the workings of the Board of Governors, something which many of those who had voted for the motion often claimed to favour.;1;GOV
HUN;1990;10;1;65. His delegation welcomed the keen interest which had been shown by all participants at the Fourth NPT Review Conference in the role played by the Agency in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Despite the failure to reach consensus on a final declaration, due to differences of opinion on a number of questions related to disarmament, a positive evaluation of the Agency's activities had emerged from the general debate and the report of the committees. With regard to the role and future activities of the Agency, a number of proposals, suggestions and expectations had been formulated on issues as important as strengthening of the safeguards system, improvement of the safeguards information policy, international co-operation on nuclear safety, and technical assistance and co-operation. Among the proposals particularly deserving of the open-minded attention of the Agency's Member States were those aimed at evaluating the experience acquired in 20 years of safeguards implementation or at studying the scope and modalities of special inspections in cases where the non-proliferation commitments of any State Party to the Treaty had come into question. His delegation was also in favour of increasing the transparency of the Safeguards Implementation Report, which would help to maintain, or even strengthen, confidence in the safeguards system.;1;SG
USA;1982;10;1;73. Secondly, they must commit themselves to continued improvements and reforms in the safeguards system. The United States supported the Director General's interest in the question of the transparency of the safeguards operation and encouraged increased transparency to the extent that it did not compromise the legitimate right to have commercial information protected.;1;SG
FRA;1982;8;1;98. Agency safeguards had so far fully met their objectives and were proving reliable. There was, however, also room for improvement since safeguards had to be constantly adjusted to advances in technology and applied to a growing number and variety of installations. His delegation therefore welcomed the detailed discussion of safeguards which had been scheduled for the series of Board meetings in February 1983. The time had come to ponder over the very concept of the safeguards strategy which should keep pace with the technical development of the countries concerned and not consist merely in applying mathematical criteria to each installation. Similarly, the scope of safeguards could be usefully enlarged in some cases, technical resources improved, full use made of the inspection procedures provided for in the relevant agreements and a greater degree of transparency introduced into safeguards activities and reports.;1;SG
TUN;1982;-8;0;50. Tunisia noted with satisfaction the growing interest of the Secretariat and Member States in studying the problems of evaluating technical co-operation and making the Agency's technical co-operation policies more transparent. It shared the feeling that it would be wise to strengthen the administrative and technical procedures used in evaluation and to try to make the Agency's basic promotional work altogether more coherent. A point to be stressed, however, was that that exercise must not lead to the application of new conditions to, or additional constraints on, technical assistance.;1;TC
POL;2002;10;1;He commended the Agency for its public information policy and thanked the Secretariat for issuing the Nuclear Technology Review 2002. He also commended the Agency for its promotional activities in Johannesburg during the World Summit on Sustainable Development which had contributed to global awareness of the Agency’s work by highlighting the contribution of nuclear applications to human health, agricultural productivity, water management, environmental protection and energy production. Poland had recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In November, a regional public information seminar would be held in the country, organized under the auspices of the Agency, to promote the benefits of nuclear energy.;1;ADM
CAN;1998;10;1;"96. The Agency was continuing its work in the key sectors of non-proliferation, nuclear safety and technical co-operation in order to increase the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. However, 1998 had been marked by several events which ran counter to the efforts that were being made to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It was likely that public opinion, particularly with regard to nuclear non-proliferation, safety and radioactive waste management, would continue to influence the future use of nuclear energy. Since the Agency was the main instrument for the elaboration of international law and the main guide in those key areas, the public should be kept regularly informed about its activities. In that respect, the ongoing review by the Agency of the role and management of public information was particularly useful, as well as the development of its Internet site and the production of the film entitled ""The Nuclear Age"". The Director General's suggestion to set up an expanded programme of public information seminars was also extremely interesting.";1;ADM

In conclusion, he stressed the importance which the Chilean Government attached to the measures described by the Director General aimed at strengthening the internal management of the Agency and creating a ""single Agency"" culture. Those measures were aimed at raising the levels of efficiency and effectiveness in all the Agency's activities through the adoption of a medium-term strategy. For that to succeed, it would need to be accompanied by a re-evaluation in Member States themselves of the Agency's role with regard to decision-making, financing and implementation of activities and, in particular, as regarded its perception by the public. In that connection, the measures adopted by the Secretariat to strengthen its public information programmes in order to heighten awareness of the true extent to which nuclear energy could contribute to development were extremely pertinent and would promote interaction among Member States and between them and the Agency. Chile had been working towards that objective for more than 15 years and was putting its experience at the disposal of the Agency and the other Member States. It now appealed to them all to join in that endeavour because only by working together could success be attained.";1;ADM

The Agency should in particular publicize the improvements achieved in nuclear safety in Member States and use the most modern and effective tools, such as the Internet, and high-quality materials and publications to help promote a positive attitude towards nuclear energy among the public. In that connection, he noted that the international public information seminar hosted by Slovakia earlier in the year had been a great success.;1;ADM
PRT;1998;10;1;66. More than 60% of technical co-operation expenditure related to sectors such as food, agriculture, health, water resources and industrial applications and it seemed unlikely that public opinion was aware of the extent and variety of the non-power applications of nuclear energy. The Agency's public information initiatives were therefore very important, especially the provision of information via the Internet, and via other media in areas where Internet access was not widespread.;1;ADM
BGD;1990;-5;0;79. Public confidence in nuclear power had been shaken by several accidents. The Director General, in his introductory statement, had referred to the present stagnation in the construction of new plants and stated that public confidence could only be restored if the Agency gave urgent attention to three issues, namely the safety of nuclear installations, the safe management and storage of nuclear waste, and non-proliferation, and established an appropriate balance between them. The Agency should renew its efforts to gain public confidence in nuclear power, and in that connection his delegation welcomed the plan of action for public information which the Agency had set up with the help of a special contribution from the Japanese Government.;1;ADM
TZA;1990;-6;0;85. Finally, as scientists and Governments around the world strived to make nuclear reactors safer and more efficient and as the Agency prepared to embark on a public information campaign to make nuclear energy acceptable in industrialized countries, the needs of the developing countries should be given equal attention and nuclear energy should be made available and affordable to them, since the current world energy crisis required a global response and strategy.;1;ADM
GBR;1990;10;1;142. The importance of public information for nuclear power had been underestimated in the past. In his country, the nuclear industry had recently brought together its public information activities in a Nuclear Electricity Information Group, whose task was to explain the facts of nuclear power - for the debate on nuclear power must be based on facts. Given the international dimension of that debate, the Agency also should undoubtedly assign high priority to its own public information work.;1;ADM
IRN;2010;-7;0;94. The issue of confidentiality was one of the issues that had caused Iran deep concern with regard to the Agency’s performance. Member States should not find their national security endangered and under no circumstances should their classified information be disclosed. The matter required close scrutiny, particularly with respect to recent developments at the Agency.;1;ADM
EGY;2010;-3;0;63. The Middle East remained a special case in efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons, as demonstrated by the consensus achieved at the 2010 NPT Review Conference on the convening of a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in that region. The Agency’s credibility depended to a large extent on the seriousness with which its Member States addressed the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Middle East and the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region. Although 18 years had elapsed since the adoption by the General Conference of a resolution calling on all States in the Middle East to apply comprehensive safeguards, Israel had taken no steps to achieve that objective. The Agency should fulfil the mandate assigned to it under the resolutions adopted at the 53rd session of the General Conference and disclose whatever information it possessed concerning Israeli nuclear facilities that should be placed under Agency safeguards.;1;SG
EGY;2010;-3;0;87. NAM had looked forward to the Director General’s strong and active involvement in implementing that resolution, and to comprehensive reporting on the issue to both the Board of Governors and the General Conference which would not only reflect the views of Member States but would also disclose all information available to the Secretariat on the nature and scope of Israeli nuclear facilities and activities that would be covered by any comprehensive safeguards agreement concluded with that country, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to it, and which would outline how the Agency viewed the way forward, inter alia identifying all necessary measures to be undertaken by the parties concerned.;1;SG
COL;2006;7;1;49. Colombia remained concerned about the existence of an illicit trafficking network in radioactive material and equipment, and the associated risks. The Agency should continue its efforts, together with the assistance of Member States, to disclose its structure and membership. The threat of proliferation, terrorism and illicit trafficking required a joint effort at all levels. The collective security system must be based on full respect for States’ rights and the fulfilment of their obligations and should take account of the needs of developing countries. A firm commitment to disarmament, nonproliferation and the promotion and transfer of nuclear science and technology would enable the international community to rise to the current threats and challenges. It was the only way to build a future devoid of nuclear threat, where atomic energy was used exclusively for peaceful purposes and the only way to realize the dream of “atoms for peace” and sustainable development.;1;ADM
