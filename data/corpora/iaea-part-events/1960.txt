The establishment of basic safety standards for application to Agency operations and

assisted operations was studied by a panel of experts which met in November 1960, after

which draft provisional standards were circulated for comment to Member States. These

comments will be considered by the panel when it meets again in June 1961. This method

of preparation is designed to ensure that the basic safety standards will not be inconsistent

with existing national and regional standards and may also provide guidance to those Member

States who have not yet drawn up national health and safety regulations connected with the

peaceful uses of atomic energy. It is expected that before the end of 1961 draft basic
