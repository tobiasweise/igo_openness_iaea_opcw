financed from contributions to the $250,000 fellowship fund approved by the

General Conference at its first session. By 30 June 1958 $125,140 had been

pledged or contributed to the fund. The second type consists of fellowships

which Member States have offered the Agency for training or research in

institutions in their own countries. By 30 June 1958, 268 subsidized or

fully paid fellowships of this type had been placed at the Agency's disposal

for the years 1958 and 19595 140 are available in 1958.

B. Exchange and training of scientists and experts

Background

124* The initial programme emphasizes that, in the light of the acute

shortage of atomic energy specialists, particularly in the less-developed

areas of the world, the Agency's exchange and training programme should form

a major part of the assistance it gives to Member States, In view of the

interest and activities of other international organizations and the limited

resources available to the Agency, the Agency's programmes should, however,

be closely co-ordinated with those of the United Nations and the specialized

agencies
Back

followed in submitting applications for fellowships. These fellowships

will be awarded for.;

(a)

General techniques training, to develop skills in the use of some

fundamental techniques in the domain of nuclear energy^

(b)

Specialist training, to prepare specialists in the theoretical and

experimental aspects of the science and technology of nuclear

energy| and

(c)

Research training, including active participation in research work.

The procedures outlined in the brochure follow closely those evolved by the

United Nations and the specialized agencies for the administration of their

own fellowship programmes. 
Back

1957 [ 86489: 87240] 

, It is proposed to expand the exchange and training programme of the

Agency in 1959 "to include the award of research as well as training fellowships.

It is also proposed to place special emphasis on arrangements for

the exchange of scientists, teachers and specialists. If the 1959 budget

recommended by the Board is approved and the relevant target for voluntary

contributions in reached, the Agency will be able in 1959 to make available

one hundred type I fellowships, at least 128 type II fellowships, and fifteen

research fellowships, and to make approximately twenty arrangements for the

exchange of scientists, teachers and specialists. The estimate for type II

fellowships in 1959 is based on offers for 1959 made by 30 June 1958.

145. It has been arranged that the Director General will make ona of the

opening addresses at the Conference and heads of three of the Agency's

departments will present scientific or general papers, these will cover the

use of isotopes in research and the physical sciences, the training of scientific

personnel, and the development of international co-operation in the

peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
Back

1957 [101449:101833] 

In the formulation of the Agency's exchange and training programme,

special attention is being given to the training of health and safety

specialists with a view to ensuring that the development of atomic energy

programmes is not retarded by a shortage of key personnel in this field.

Information has been obtained on the availability of suitable training

facilities.

While many of the activities of the Agency under its training, information

These include the provision of expert advice

holding of conferences, seminars and colloquia.

Amongst the activities

being considered in this domain is the holding in 1959 of one or more

meetings or seminars on waste disposal problems, which would also deal with

marine waste disposal. A seminar on waste disposal is also planned by

WHO for 1959 ,but it appears that this will deal with the medical aspects

The working group consisted of members of the Secretariat and of experts

made available, free of charge, to the Agency by France, the United Kingdom

and the United States of America. One representative of the United Nations

Economic Commission for Latin America and two representatives of OAS participated

in the survey to which both organizations had given valuable support.

The working group began its operations at the end of May and it is expected

to assemble in Vienna in July after completion of the survey.

A ccnference between exports from various national agencies on the one

The object of this meeting would be to ensure that leading scientific

institutions are aware of the problems of atomic energy industry in relation

contribute to their solution.

The Board is considering a variety of proposals for securing external

these teams, which will consist of consultants made available by various

Member States as well as members of the Agency's technical secretariat,

should make short exploratory visits to Member States to obtain first-hand

knowledge of local conditions and requirements, and to help them determine

these needs for Agency assistance, thereby facilitating the submission of

requests which will become the basis of Agency projects

Thus, during January and March 1958 it

was possible to begin initial consideration of questions arising from the

offers of fissionable, source and other materials made by Member States under

Article IX of the Statute, and to discuss the outline of the Agency's fellow-'

The only operation for which the General Conference made provision at its

first sossion, in accordance with Article XIV B.2 of the Statute, was the

financing of a limited Agency fellowship programme. For this purpose it

appropriated an amount not exceeding $250,000 from the Goneral Fund in 1958

provided that sufficient voluntary contributions wero forthcoming. 
Back

1957 [ 68862: 69777] 

Pending the final formulation and the approval of such

rules it has, however, been necessary for the Board to establish certain

general principles to be applied provisionally to voluntary contributions

made to the General Fund for the fellowship programme. These principles

provide that,

(a)

Contributions shall be made without limitation as to use in a specific

country or for a specific project}

(b)

All contributions shall be paid in the currencies of Member Statesj

and

(c)

In order to permit the widest choice of educational and training

facilities and full use of funds contributed, payment of contributions

should, as Â£ar as possible, be made in freely convertible

currencies. Contributions in currencies of limitod convertibility

will also be accepted in the hope, however, that, if the neod should

arise, conversion facilities could be arranged for at least part of

such contributions.

. At the end of April 1958 all Member States were provided with full

details of the rules governing the Agency's fellowship programme and of the

resources available to the Agency at that date. At the same time they were

asked to nominate candidates for Agency fellowships and 1 July 1958 was set

as the last date for receiving nominations for awards during the current

year. This deadline was subsequently extended to 1 August. Arrangements

wore also made, in accordance with the Relationship Agreement between the

United Nations and the Agency, to enlist the services of Resident Representatives

of TAB in assisting Mombor States to select and nominate their candidates

The preparation and distribution of standardized radioactive

Back

1957 [ 15638: 16161] 

The use of radioisotopes in certain countries is already widespread

and the initial programme stresses the need for the Agency's assistance in

promoting their full use in less-developed areas. It has therefore prepared

a provisional manual on radiation protection and a special expert panel has

been convened. Work has also begun on a general code of regulations taking

into account the current revision by the International Commission on Radiological

Protection of its recommendations on maximum permissible dosages.
