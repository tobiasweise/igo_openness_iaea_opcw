Clinical research using human beings as experimental subjects is more difficult to

plan in advance and to co-ordinate than research with animals or plants. Nevertheless the

contracts awarded by the Agency deal increasingly with such research, and in particular

certain topics to which priority was assigned in 1962 by a meeting of experts in which WHO

participated.

Progress in the use of isotopes and radiation in plant pathology has been slow; the

Agency therefore convened a panel of experts in September 1963 to study the problem. The

panel recommended that, since there was a shortage of qualified scientists, especially in
