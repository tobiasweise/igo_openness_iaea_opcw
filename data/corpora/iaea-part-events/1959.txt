A start has been made with a novel type of assistance in the form of arrangements

for the evaluation by an international group of experts of the hazards of

a given nuclear installation. The first evaluation made was that of the DIORIT

reactor in Switzerland and since then there have been further requests from the

Swiss atomic energy authorities and several enquiries and requests from other

Member States.

Much of the planning of the Agency's work is done by convening selected international

panels of leading experts on the subject to be discussed. In the period

under review, 18 such panels[3] were called together on topics ranging from the

metrology of radionuclides and physics of heavy water lattices to the transport

of radioactive sources of high activity and of fissile materials.

Standards of safety for Agency operations have been prepared in draft form and

On the recommendation of SAC the results of this study will be considered

by a panel of experts during the latter half of 1960. In this connexion, the Agency

supported a meeting of experts which took place in April 1960 in Oxford, England, which

considered the question of the radiation effects of strontium-90 in bone and prepared a

report which the Agency will submit to UNSCEAR at its autumn session in Geneva.

Another study begun in the early part of 1959 dealt with the use of large radiation

sources, such as radiocobalt and radiocaesium units., betatrons and linear accelerators,

in radiotherapy. The results of this study were submitted to a panel of experts, jointly

convened by the Agency and WHO, in Vienna in August 1959. Pursuant to the recommendations

of this panel, the Agency has published an International Directory of Radioisotope

Teletherapy Equipment, other supplementary information and the recommendations themselves,

which were also published in some of the leading radiological journals of the world.

In December 1959 the results of a market survey of the requirements for the isotope

calcium-47 to be used in radiobiological studies of the metabolism of certain fission

Although each of these three approaches is important it has been found advisable to

follow the first initially. Thus, a panel of experts on nuclear power costing was convened

from 14 to 18 March 1960 to which observers of international and non-governmental

organizations were also invited. The panel decided, as a first step, to prepaie a document

reviewing the methods of nuclear power costing, with particular emphasis on questions

relevant to less developed areas. The document will be revised at another session which

the panel will hold in the latter part of 1960.

The Panel on Civil Liability and State Responsibility for Nuclear Hazards met in

Vienna three times in the course of 1959, and, after an additional exchange of views by

correspondence, submitted a report to the Director General in February 1960; annexed to

this report is a Draft Convention on Minimum International Standards regarding Civil

Liability for Nuclear Damage, as well as an article-by-article comment thereon. The

panel considered that action was necessary in the field of liability for nuclear damage

attributable to fixed nuclear installations and to carriage of nuclear materials. Its

proposals reflect a large measure of agreement among experts from different countries and

different legal systems on essential provisions of a future convention in this field.
