With regard to the Seibersdorf and the Headquarters laboratories, the ad hoc committee

considered that they could make substantial contributions to peaceful nuclear

energy programmes, both in developing countries and in advanced countries, in

helping to solve scientific and technical problems of common interest to many

nations which cannot be adequately solved by national organizations alone, or even

by groups of organizations. It considered also that the training activities, in particular

the fellowship programmes, were very valuable activities of the laboratories

and should be continued at least at the same scale; and

With regard to the Monaco Laboratory the committee considered that the activities

of this laboratory should be continued on a broader basis. It emphasized the role

that the laboratory could play in the development and assessment of methods and

techniques in the analytical chemistry of trace elements in a marine environment.

The committee also considered that the training role of the laboratory should be
