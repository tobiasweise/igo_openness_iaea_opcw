An important development took place at the end of the year, when a joint

FAO/IAEA/WHO expert committee on the wholesomeness of irradiated food reached the

conclusion that no toxicological hazard is caused by irradiating any food up to an overall

average dose of 10 kGy (1 Mrad), which is at present the highest dose used in the most

important food irradiation applications

One of the main developments in the use of nuclear technology in food preservation

was the conclusion reached by the Joint FAO/IAEA/WHO Expert Committee on the Wholesomeness

of Irradiated Food that no toxicological hazard is caused in any kind of foodstuff

by irradiation up to an overall average dose of 10 kGy[6] (1 Mrad[7]) and hence that foods

treated in this way no longer need be tested for toxicity (the dose range normally used for

food preservation purposes is 0.05-10 kGy)
