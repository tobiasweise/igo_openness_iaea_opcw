The delegation of Ireland, speaking on behalf of the delegations of Austria, Canada, Greece, Ireland, Switzerland and New Zealand, stated that in agreeing to join consensus in the Conferences adoption of the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Council of the OPCW, these delegations wished to state that they considered that Rule 22 and Rule 57 of the said Rules were so drafted as to be potentially open to a restrictive interpretation and could, in practice, inhibit the ability of members of the Organisation -which were not at that time members of the Executive Council -from the opportunity of making their views known to the Council in an appropriate way.
