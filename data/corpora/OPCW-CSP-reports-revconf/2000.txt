The Conference noted the report by the Director-General on the status of submission 
of initial declarations and notifications as of 11 May 2000 (C-V/DG.8, dated 
12 May 2000). The Conference noted with approbation that its own expressions of 
concern, and those of the Council, had resulted in effective action which meant that, 
as of 11 May 2000, all States Parties had submitted their initial declarations as 
required under the Convention. The Conference encouraged the Director-General to 
give favourable consideration to applying the techniques which had produced such 
good results in this area to other areas in which a significant proportion of States 
Parties were not in fulfilment of the requirements of the Convention. The Conference 
requested the Council to continue to monitor the fulfilment by States Parties of this 
important obligation under the Convention throughout the subsequent period, and to 
report back to it at its next regular session. The delegation of the United States of 
America submitted a national paper on this subject (C-V/NAT.2, dated 18 May 2000).

Convention throughout the subsequent period, and to report back to it at its next 
regular session.

two-year multiple entry/exit visas to inspectors/inspection assistants

inspection assistants in the case of a challenge inspection or an investigation of 
alleged use (C-V/DG.3, dated 28 April 2000). The Conference requested the Council 
to continue to monitor the fulfilment by States Parties of this important obligation 
under the Convention throughout the subsequent period, and to report back to it at its 
next regular session. 
Legislation, cooperation, and legal assistance 

10.4 
The Conference noted with concern from the relevant information contained in the 
annex to the report by the Director-General on the status of submission of initial 
declarations and notifications, submitted to the Conference at this session, that the 
proportion of States Parties which had fulfilled the requirements of the Convention in 
relation to legislation, cooperation, and assistance had barely increased since the

C-V/6 
page 6 

implemented their obligations under Article VII of the Convention, including enacting 
penal legislation with respect to prohibited activities, and informing the Organisation 
of the legislative and administrative measures taken, to do so promptly. The

Parties of this important obligation under the Convention throughout the subsequent 
period, and to report back to it at its next regular session.
