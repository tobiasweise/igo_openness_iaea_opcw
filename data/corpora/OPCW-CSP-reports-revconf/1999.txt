10. 	AGENDA ITEM NINE - Status of implementation of the Convention 
Submission of declarations 
10.1 	In the light of the serious concern which it had expressed at its Third Session on the importance, in relation to the significant number of States Parties to the Convention which had submitted no initial declarations or initial declarations in part only, of the full implementation by all States Parties of all their commitments under the Convention and of adherence to all its provisions without conditions, the Conference took cognisance of the Note by the Director-General on the status of initial declarations and notifications (C-IV/DG.10, dated 21 June 1999), as well as the report by the Director-General on experiences in implementing the provisions of Parts VII and VIII and Section A of Part IX of the Verification Annex within the verification regime for other chemical production facilities, and containing detailed data requested by the Council (C-IV/DG.6/Rev.1, dated 23 June 1999, and Corr.1, dated 1 July 1999). The Conference requested the Council to monitor closely the fulfilment by States Parties of this important obligation under the Convention in order to enable the Council to consider recommendations to the Conference at its Fifth Session with a view to redressing the situation. 
Procedures for the handling of confidential information 
10.2 	The Conference noted that the issue of the procedures for the handling of confidential information had been discussed by the Council at its Fourteenth and Fifteenth Sessions, and strongly endorsed the concern, expressed by the Council at its Fifteenth Session, that, as of the date of that session, the majority of States Parties were not yet in compliance on this important matter regarding confidentiality. The Conference noted the information on this subject contained in the report by the Director-General on the status of implementation of the regime governing the handling of confidential information by the Secretariat (C-IV/DG.8, dated 17 June 1999), and requested the remaining States Parties to provide this information to the Secretariat forthwith.  The Conference requested the Council to monitor closely the fulfilment by States Parties of this important obligation under the Convention in order to enable the Council to consider recommendations to the Conference at its Fifth Session with a view to redressing the situation.     
Status of assessed contributions 
10.3 	In the light of the concern which it had expressed at its Third Session on States Parties which were in arrears with their financial contributions to the OPCW, the Conference took cognisance of the most recent Note by the Director-General on the status of assessed contributions as of 31 May 1999 (C-IV/DG.5, dated 11 June 1999, and Add.1, dated 30 June 1999).

The Conference took cognisance of the recent Note by the Director-General on the status of reimbursement of verification costs under Articles IV or V of the Convention (C-IV/DG.4, dated 11 June 1999), and requested the Council to closely monitor the fulfilment by States Parties of this important obligation in order to enable the Council to consider recommendations to the Conference at its Fifth Session with a view to redressing the situation.    
Status of implementation of the requirement for States Parties to provide two-year multiple entry/exit visas to inspectors/inspection assistants 
10.5 	The Conference noted the report by the Director-General on the status of implementation of the requirement for States Parties to provide two-year multiple entry/exit visas to inspectors/inspection assistants (C-IV/DG.3, dated 10 June 1999).

10.6 	Article VII of the Convention requires each State Party to adopt the necessary measures to implement its obligations under the Convention, including enacting penal legislation with respect to prohibited activities, and to inform the Organisation of the legislative and administrative measures taken. The Conference noted from the annex to the Note by the Director-General on the status of submission of initial declarations and notifications that, as of 15 June 1999, only 34% of States Parties had met this obligation.  The Conference urged States Parties: (a) to complete, where necessary, the legislative and administrative measures to implement the Convention in their jurisdictions; and (b) to inform the Organisation of such measures taken.   
10.7 	Recalling its request, at its Third Session, for a seminar on national implementation and legal cooperation (subparagraph 19.3 of C-III/4, dated 20 November 1998), the Conference noted the Secretariat document entitled Proceedings of the Thematic Workshop on Developing and Strengthening National Legislation and Policies for the Sound Management of Chemicals, 22 -25 June 1999, Geneva (S/127/99, dated 1 July 1999), and the planning for a second seminar on cooperation and legal assistance, as well as the national paper by the Islamic Republic of Iran on the process of compliance with Article VII: a case study (C-IV/NAT.11, dated 1 July 1999).
