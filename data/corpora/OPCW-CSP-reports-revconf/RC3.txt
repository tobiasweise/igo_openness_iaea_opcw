The States Parties also noted that the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of key aspects of the Convention remains to be achieved and in this context expressed their: 
9.7 	Concern regarding the Director-Generals statement in his report to the Sixty-Eighth Session of the Executive Council, provided in accordance with paragraph 2 of C-16/DEC.11, dated 1 December 2011, that three possessor States Parties, namely Libya, the Russian Federation, and the United States of America, have been unable to fully meet the final extended deadline of 29 April 2012 for the destruction of their chemical weapons stockpiles (EC-68/DG.9, dated 1 May 2012); 
9.8 	Determination that the destruction of all categories of chemical weapons shall be completed in the shortest time possible in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and its Annex on Implementation and Verification, and with the full application of the relevant decisions that have been taken;

9.12 	Commitment to foster, and to further develop and enhance actions for, international cooperation amongst States Parties in the peaceful uses of chemistry, and also to implement the provisions of the Convention in a manner which avoids hampering economic and technological development for purposes not prohibited under the Convention. 
The States Parties furthermore underlined their: 
9.13 	Intention to continue providing the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) with the support that it requires in order to achieve the object and purpose of the Convention, to ensure the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of its provisions and to deal more effectively with future opportunities and challenges;

The States Parties also: 
9.18 	Recalling the Thirty-Second Meeting of the Executive Council, reiterated their deep concern that chemical weapons may have been used in the Syrian Arab Republic and underlined that the use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances would be reprehensible and completely contrary to the legal norms and standards of the international community.

Part B: Review of the operation of the Chemical Weapons Convention as provided for in paragraph 22 of Article VIII, taking into account any relevant scientific and technological developments 
The role of the Chemical Weapons Convention in enhancing international peace and security and in achieving the objectives as set forth in the Preamble of the Convention 
9.20 	The Third Review Conference recalled that the Convention is a unique multilateral agreement banning an entire category of weapons of mass destruction in a non-discriminatory and verifiable manner under strict and effective international control, and noted with satisfaction that the Convention continues to be a remarkable success and an example of effective multilateralism. 
9.21 	The Third Review Conference noted with satisfaction that implementation of the Convention makes a major contribution to international peace and security. 
9.22 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed the commitment by all States Parties to achieving the object and purpose of the Convention, as set out in its Preamble and provisions. 
9.23 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed that the obligation of the States Parties to complete the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles as well as the destruction or conversion of chemical weapons production facilities (CWPFs) in accordance with the provisions of the Convention and its Verification Annex, and under verification by the Technical Secretariat (hereinafter the Secretariat), is essential for the realisation of the object and purpose of the Convention. 
9.24 	The Third Review Conference stressed that the destruction of all categories of chemical weapons is a fundamental objective of the Organisation. 
9.25 	The Third Review Conference reiterated the obligation to destroy or otherwise dispose of old chemical weapons. 
9.26 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed the obligation to complete the destruction of abandoned chemical weapons in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and the decision taken by the Council at its Sixty-Seventh Session (EC-67/DEC.6, dated 15 February 2012). 
9.27 	The Third Review Conference noted with concern that, along with the threat of the possible production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by States, the international community also faces the danger of the production, acquisition and use of chemical weapons by non-State actors including terrorists.  These concerns have highlighted the necessity of achieving universal adherence to the Convention, as well as the high level of OPCW readiness. 
9.28 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed that the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of all Articles of the Convention makes a major contribution to international peace and security, through the elimination of existing stockpiles of chemical weapons and prohibition of their acquisition and use, and provides for assistance and protection in the event of use, or threat of use, of chemical weapons and for international cooperation for peaceful purposes in the field of chemical activities. 
9.29 	The Third Review Conference noted the importance of adequate funding from the regular budget for the full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of all Articles of the Convention, while also noting with appreciation the voluntary contributions made to support its implementation, including for verification and international cooperation and assistance. 
9.30 	The Third Review Conference noted with concern that, although the number of States Parties has risen from 183 in 2008 to 188 in 2013, eight States have still to join the Convention, including some whose non-adherence is a cause for serious concern. 
9.31 	The Third Review Conference recalled that in terms of Article XIII of the Convention nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as in any way limiting or detracting from the obligations assumed by any State under the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare, signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925.  The Third Review Conference also recalled that the Convention excludes completely the possibility of the use of chemical weapons thereby complementing the obligations assumed under the 1925 Geneva Protocol.  It appealed to all High Contracting Parties to the 1925 Geneva Protocol to observe strictly its principles and objectives and called upon those States Parties that continue to maintain reservations to the 1925 Geneva Protocol related to the Convention to withdraw them and to notify the Depositary of the 1925 Geneva Protocol accordingly.  The Third Review Conference invited States Parties to inform the next regular session of the Conference when a reservation to the 1925 Geneva Protocol is withdrawn. 
9.32 	The Third Review Conference noted the impact of scientific and technological progress on the effective implementation of the Convention and the importance for the OPCW and its policy-making organs of taking due account of such developments. In that context, it stressed that the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) should continue its role in advising the Director-General and expressed appreciation for the report of the SAB prepared for the Third Review Conference that identifies a number of issues relevant to the operation of the Convention (RC-3/DG.1, dated 29 October 2012). 
Ensuring the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention 
9.33 	The Third Review Conference reiterated that the universality of the Convention is essential to achieving its object and purpose and to enhancing the security of States Parties, as well as international peace and security.  The Third Review Conference underlined that the objectives of the Convention will not be fully realised as long as there remains even a single State not Party that could possess or acquire such weapons. 
9.34 	The Third Review Conference called for the adequate funding for the OPCWs universality activities, through the regular budget and voluntary funding. 
9.35 	The Third Review Conference welcomed the fact that five additional States (the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Guinea Bissau, Iraq, and Lebanon) had joined the Convention since the Second Special Session of the Conference of the States Parties to Review the Chemical Weapons Convention (hereinafter the Second Review Conference). 
9.36 	The Third Review Conference noted that there remain eight States not Party to the Convention, including some whose non-adherence is a cause for serious concern. 
9.37 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed the importance of the Action Plan on Universality (EC-M-23/DEC.3, dated 24 October 2003) and the subsequent decisions of the Conference to regularly review the results and implementation of it and to take any decision it deems necessary addressing, in particular, the status of those States not Party whose non-adherence is a cause for serious concern.  It also recalled that States that remain outside the Convention are not able to take advantage of the benefits that it offers to States Parties. 
9.38 	The Third Review Conference noted that the proposal for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East is consistent with the objective of universality of the Convention.  The Third Review Conference regretted that an international conference was not convened in 2012 and expressed the hope that an international conference will be convened for this purpose at an early date.  In this context, it welcomed the provision of background information by the Director-General that highlighted the achievements of the Convention as a model disarmament treaty. 
9.39 	The Third Review Conference, having reviewed developments in the field of universality: 
(a) 	
Strongly urged all eight remaining States not Party to the Convention (Angola, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Egypt, Israel, Myanmar, Somalia, South Sudan, and the Syrian Arab Republic) to ratify or accede to it as a matter of urgency and without preconditions, in the interests of enhancing their own national security as well as contributing to global peace and security; 

(b) 	
Requested the States Parties to intensify further their efforts with all States not Party to encourage them to ratify or accede to the Convention at the earliest, with a view to achieving full universality; 

(c) 	
Requested the Secretariat and the Director-General to make full use of all available opportunities and resources including new mechanisms such as special envoys, as and when considered appropriate by the Director-General, to pursue this goal at all levels, including in close cooperation with other international, regional, and subregional organisations; and  

(d) 	
Request the policy-making organs to continue to annually review ongoing efforts to achieve universality. 


General obligations and declarations related thereto 
9.40 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed that full, effective, and non-discriminatory implementation of Articles I, II and III is essential for the realisation of the object and purpose of the Convention. 
9.41 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed the continued relevance of the definitions contained in Article II of the Convention, which ensure the comprehensive nature of the prohibition of chemical weapons under the Convention.  The definitions contained in Article II, in particular, of the terms chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facility, were found to adequately cover the impact of developments in science and technology on the Conventions prohibitions and to provide for the application of these prohibitions to any toxic chemical, except where such a chemical is intended for purposes not prohibited by the Convention, and as long as the types and quantities involved are consistent with such purposes. 
9.42 	The Third Review Conference stressed the importance of the full and timely implementation by States Parties of all declaration obligations under Article III. 
9.43 	The Third Review Conference reaffirmed that declarations provided by States Parties under Article III, which establish a baseline for measuring progress in the elimination of all categories of chemical weapons, as well as CWPFs, need to be comprehensive and accurate.
