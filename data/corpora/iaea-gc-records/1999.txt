ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

Article VI of the Statute (agenda item 21) (continued) 

1. The PRESIDENT noted that, in addition to Article VI of the Statute, there were 
two items, Nos 26 and 27, left from the Committee of the Whole to be dealt with. 
2. Mr. GRÃNBERG (Finland), speaking on behalf of the European Union, 
welcomed the historic decision that had been taken and thanked all who had contributed to 
resolving the issue, in particular the two previous Board Chairmen, Ambassador Walker and 
Ambassador Ikeda, and the present Chairman Mr. Gregoric, for their tireless efforts. 
3. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China), welcoming the adoption of the resolution on the 
amendment of Article VI of the Statute, said that the expansion of the Board would enhance 
the representation of developing countries and increase the democracy and transparency of 
the BoardÂs decision-making processes. He thanked all concerned for their relentless efforts 
to solve the problem, in particular the countries and area groups that had made difficult 
concessions in a spirit of compromise, and hoped that such a spirit would prevail in the 
AgencyÂs work in the future. He hoped that all countries would demonstrate flexibility and 
co-operation in accepting the amendment in accordance with their national constitutional 
processes, and looked forward to the Director GeneralÂs report on the progress made towards 
the amendmentÂs entry into force. 
4. Ms. MXAKATO-DISEKO (South Africa), having congratulated all concerned on 
finally bringing the matter of the amendment of Article VI to a successful conclusion, said 
that, although the formula developed undoubtedly involved intricate trade-offs and sacrifices, 
the Agency had made a substantial gain and now led the way towards the democratization of 
decision-making processes in international institutions. In her delegationÂs view, the 
President had followed the only course possible for resolving the issue. At all events, the 
Conference could not have chosen a more fitting manner to crown the achievements of the 
Agency on the threshold of the next millennium. 
5. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that there had been a lack of 
transparency in the procedures followed concerning the amendment of Article VI, and he 
wished to record his countryÂs reservations. Syria would have legal difficulties in accepting 
the amendment, and would reserve the right to return to the matter in the future. 
6. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his delegation sympathized with 
GRULACÂs dissatisfaction over what had happened at the last meeting of the Board of 
Governors, and trusted that such events would not recur in the future. He wished to make it 
clear that Iran had felt unable to join the consensus because of its reservations concerning 
paragraph K of the amended Article VI. Further, he wished to stress that, as considered by 
the Board, due rotation of the extra designated seats on the Board should take place. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 6 

7. Mr. NIITENBERG (Estonia), expressing satisfaction that consensus had finally 
been reached on the amendment of Article VI, said that it was his delegationÂs understanding 
that the scope of the resolution adopted was strictly limited to the Agency and had no impact 
on the composition of areas or regional groups of other specialized agencies or organizations 
of the United Nations system, or of those of other international organizations. With regard to 
paragraph K of the amended Article VI, Estonia maintained that the composition of areas 
should be finalized with due regard to the positions of the Member States concerned as to the 
area in which they considered it appropriate to be included. 
8. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia), speaking on behalf of SEAP, said that while the Group 
would have been content with an expansion of six or seven seats only, it was glad that an 
agreement on eight had been reached, thus ending 25 years of rather undignified wrangling. 
The problems encountered regarding representation of the area groups had been resolved as a 
result of accommodation or sacrifice on the part of some groups, or as in the case of SEAP, by 
the exercise of absolute restraint. Finally, he expressed the GroupÂs appreciation to the 
President of the Conference, the two previous Chairmen of the Board and its present 
Chairman, and to Ambassadors Benmoussa of Morocco and Umer of Pakistan for their efforts 
to bring the issue to a conclusion. 
9. Mr. REGUIEG (Algeria) said that the Conference had achieved a historic result 
with the amendment of Article VI and he thanked the two previous Chairmen of the Board 
and the present Chairman for their efforts, and also the regional groups of Member States for 
the spirit of co-operation they had demonstrated. While the result achieved was a 
compromise, and therefore less acceptable to some than others, he hoped that all Member 
States would consider that a major objective had been achieved. The balance struck was an 
entirely acceptable one for his country. 
10. Mr. UMER (Pakistan) expressed his delegationÂs great satisfaction that the long 
and tumultuous process of the amendment of Article VI had eventually culminated in the 
consensual adoption of an agreed text. The amendment was the result of a monumental 
effort, particularly over the previous three years, and could not have been achieved without 
good faith and the genuine spirit of co-operation demonstrated by Member States and area 
groups. 
11. He was distressed that Iran and Syria had felt unable to join the consensus on the 
amendment; Pakistan sympathized with their valid concerns and wished to assure them that 
paragraph K would be implemented in complete conformity with the understandings on the 
basis of which it had been agreed. No short-circuiting of the principles enshrined in the 
concept would be countenanced, and the legitimate interests of MESA members would not be 
compromised. 
12. It was now time to look to the future and address the following issues: firstly, Member 
States should ensure the early ratification of the amendment so that the efforts made over the 
previous years were not sacrificed; secondly, paragraph K was dependent on events in the 
Middle East, and those responsible for introducing a political dimension into a purely 
representational issue carried a special responsibility to promote a just and lasting peace in 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 7 

that region; thirdly, no effort should be spared to ensure that the spirit of conciliation and 
accommodation which had led to the agreement on amendment of Article VI would prevail in 
future deliberations of the Board and the General Conference. 

13. Finally, much time had been spent in the discussion of the apportioning of seats among 
areas, and he trusted that the allocation of seats to eligible countries would henceforth be 
achieved without controversy. There was a clear-cut list of seven agreed criteria for 
designated seats on the Board and, when the Board expanded, the countries in each region 
that were the most advanced in the peaceful applications of nuclear technology should be 
accorded their rightful status. 
14. Mr. SARWAT (Egypt) thanked all concerned for their efforts to resolve the issue, 
in particular the President of the General Conference, the Chairman of the Committee of the 
Whole and the present and two previous Chairmen of the Board of Governors, and endorsed 
the comments made by the representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya on behalf of the 
African Group at the previous meeting. Recalling that a proposal by the African Group to 
expand the Board had been the starting point of the amendment of Article VI, he said he 
hoped that the amendment would work well once ratified. 
15. Mr. IKEDA (Japan) congratulated the President of the Conference and the 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole for their adroit handling of the Article VI issue, and 
welcomed the spirit of consensus and co-operation demonstrated by all delegations. He also 
paid tribute to Ambassador Walker of Canada, who had developed the package solution, and 
to the Director General and Ambassador Umer of Pakistan who had been closely involved in 
developing paragraph K and the linkage of the three elements of the package. In addition, the 
Ambassadors of Kuwait, Morocco, Algeria, India, Egypt and the United States along with 
Ambassadors from the European Union had made vital contributions in the discussions 
among the area groups. Finally, major credit was due to the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors, Mr. Gregoric for his tireless effort of consultation throughout his period of office 
to bring all the parties involved to consensus. 
16. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco) said that the amendment of Article VI could not 
have been resolved without taking a resolute pragmatic approach and overcoming the 
emotions that had obscured the issue. The amendment was a significant historical decision 
which was a credit to the Conference and to the Agency. He joined the representative of 
Pakistan in calling for all Member States to ratify the amendment as soon as possible, and 
expressed confidence that the conditions that had prompted three countries to have 
reservations would cease with the positive development of the peace process in the Middle 
East, which would enable all countries of the region to enjoy their legitimate right to peace 
and security in the future. 
17. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) commended all concerned, and in 
particular the past and present Board Chairmen, Messrs Walker, Ikeda and Gregoric, on their 
efforts to resolve the problem. The United States believed that the existing Board functioned 
effectively as a governing mechanism for the Agency, but had also recognized the desire of 
many countries to increase the scale of participation in the BoardÂs activities. He welcomed 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 8 

the decision on Article VI because it fulfilled both the desire for Board expansion and the 
United StatesÂ wish for fairer procedures in composing the Board, and not least because that 
time-consuming issue would no longer figure on the agenda. 

18. The PRESIDENT commended the spirit of compromise that had enabled the issue 
of Article VI to be successfully resolved and expressed appreciation to all those involved. 
19. Mr. GREGORIC (Slovenia) thanked the President and Mr. Benmoussa, as 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, for their contributions to the final stage of the 
negotiations. He emphasized that the successful resolution of the Article VI issue had been 
the result of a collective effort. 
20. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to take up the rest of the items which 
the Committee of the Whole had considered. 
Personnel (agenda item 26) 

(a) Staffing of the AgencyÂs Secretariat 
(b) Women in the Secretariat 
21. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions in documents 
GC(43)/L.11 and 10 were adopted. 
Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee (agenda item 27) 

22. The PRESIDENT said he took it that, as recommended by the Committee of the 
Whole, the Conference wished to elect Ms. Cliff of the United Kingdom as an alternate 
member of the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee in place of Mr. Raja Adnan who had 
become a member following the departure of Mr. Pecsteen. 
23. It was so decided. 
24. The PRESIDENT said that the composition of the AgencyÂs Staff Pension 
Committee would thus be: 
Members: 
Mr. Herrera Andrade 
Mr. Raja Adnan 


Alternate members: 
Mr. Bourita 
Ms. Cliff 


25. The PRESIDENT expressed appreciation for Mr. BenmoussaÂs skilful guidance of 
the Committee of the WholeÂs deliberations on some extremely sensitive issues.

IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 
RELATING TO IRAQ 
(GC(43)/16 and GC(43)/L.6 and Adds 1-3) 

26. The PRESIDENT recalled that that item had been included in the agenda pursuant 
to resolution GC(42)/RES/3 adopted by the previous General Conference. Pursuant to 
operative paragraph 7 of that resolution, the Director General had submitted a report 
contained in document GC(43)/16 on his efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 
687, 707, 715, 1051, 1060, 1115, 1154 and 1194 relating to Iraq. The matter had also been 
considered by the Board in September on the basis of the Director GeneralÂs report. The 
Conference now had before it, in document GC(43)/L.6, a draft resolution submitted by a 
number of Member States, and he invited the representative of Finland to introduce it. 
27. Mr. GRÃNBERG (Finland), speaking on behalf of the European Union and other 
sponsors of the draft resolution, said that the resolution recalled developments concerning 
Iraq since the previous General Conference, commended the Director General and his Action 
Team on their efforts to fulfil their mandate under the relevant Security Council resolutions 
and noted with concern that, since mid-December 1998, the Agency had been unable to 
implement its mandate in Iraq and was thus unable to provide any assurance regarding IraqÂs 
compliance with those resolutions. The draft resolution stressed the need for Iraq to 
implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and the need to re-establish the Action 
TeamÂs monitoring and verification activities without delay. 
28. Mr. RITCH (United States of America), commending the Agency for its 
continued efforts regarding Iraq, noted with concern from the Director GeneralÂs report that 
the Agency was unable to provide any assurance regarding IraqÂs compliance with United 
Nations Security Council resolutions. Iraq was challenging the will of the Security Council 
and should understand that relief from sanctions depended on compliance with those 
resolutions. It should therefore resume full co-operation with Security Council-mandated 
inspections, under which Agency inspections had been subsumed. While supporting the draft 
resolution, the United States delegation would have preferred a text that emphasized that the 
responsibility for the current situation was IraqÂs alone. 
29. Although the Director GeneralÂs report stated that there were only a few remaining 
questions about IraqÂs nuclear programme, it also referred to the possibility of new questions 
arising. The United States looked forward to the resumption of the full range of monitoring 
and verification activities, to enable the Action Team to answer all such questions. 
30. The representative of Iraq had declared to the General Conference that Iraq had 
implemented its obligations under Security Council resolution 687 and had called on the 
Agency to implement safeguards. However, it was the Security CouncilÂs unanimous view 
that Iraq had not complied with resolution 687; furthermore, the AgencyÂs ongoing 
monitoring and verification (OMV) plan, adopted under Security Council resolution 715, 
stated that ÂIraqÂs obligations under paragraph 12 of resolution 687 and paragraph 3 of 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 10 

resolution 707 are broader in scope than the obligations which are undertaken under the Non-
Proliferation Treaty and which are verified by the IAEAÂ1. While the approaches and 
techniques to be used under the OMV plan drew upon the AgencyÂs safeguards experience, 
the scope and intensity of verification and monitoring under that plan were much greater, in 
order to satisfy the requirements of the aforesaid resolutions and to create confidence that the 
restrictions imposed upon Iraq in the nuclear field were actually complied with. 

31. The United States would continue to give strong support to the AgencyÂs Action Team 
in fulfilling its mission and in improving its OMV plan and techniques. 
32. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq), noting the requirement in operative paragraph 2 of the 
draft resolution that Iraq implement fully all relevant Security Council resolutions, said that 
Iraq had applied resolution 687 to the letter. He pointed out that the Director GeneralÂs fourth 
progress report to the Security Council2 had stated that the IAEAÂs verification activities in 
Iraq had produced a technically coherent picture of IraqÂs clandestine nuclear programme and 
that there were no indications that Iraq had produced more than a few grams of 
weapon-usable nuclear material or otherwise acquired such material. It also said that there 
were no indications that there remained in Iraq any physical capability for the production of 
amounts of weapon-usable nuclear material of any practical significance. The report further 
stated that, by February 1994, the Agency had completed the removal from Iraq of all 
weapon-usable nuclear material and that there were no significant discrepancies between the 
technically coherent picture of IraqÂs past programme and the information contained in IraqÂs 
full, final and complete declaration - final version. 
33. The Âquestions and concernsÂ mentioned in the Director GeneralÂs present report to the 
Conference did not change the coherent picture of IraqÂs clandestine nuclear programme. The 
Agency had reported that it had destroyed and dismantled all the components of the Iraqi 
nuclear programme in accordance with Security Council resolution 687 and subsequently 
stated that it had reached the Âpoint of diminishing returnsÂ. 
34. In the Director GeneralÂs seventh report to the Security Council, contained in document 
GOV/INF/1999/6, it was stated that Iraq had provided the necessary technical support, 
particularly in connection with the IAEAÂs installation and operation of air-sampling 
equipment; also that analyses of the environmental samples taken at presidential sites had 
shown no indication of the presence of proscribed materials or the conduct of proscribed 
activities at any of the sites visited. The report further stated that the inspections carried out 
during the period 17 November to 15 December 1998 had revealed no indication of 
prohibited equipment, materials or activities. During that period, as stated in document 
GC(43)/16, the Iraqi counterpart had provided the necessary level of co-operation to enable 
those inspection activities to be completed efficiently and effectively. 
35. Since the documents cited all showed that Iraq had implemented fully the resolutions of 
the Security Council and co-operated fully with the Agency, he did not understand the 
1 See document GOV/INF/631, para. 16. 
2 See GOV/INF/827. 


GC(43)/OR.10 
page 11 

motivation behind the draft resolution. Preambular paragraph (e) stated that the Agency had 
been unable to implement its mandate in Iraq since mid-December 1998; however, the 
AgencyÂs mission had left Iraq not by order of the Iraqi authorities but under the instructions 
of Richard Butler, then head of UNSCOM, acting in collusion with the political and military 
authorities of the United States in preparation for the aggression perpetrated against Iraq by 
the United States and the United Kingdom the same month, in which buildings subject to 
verification, including equipment contained in them, had been destroyed. It was well known 
that the departure of the AgencyÂs mission from Iraq had not been subject to the consent of 
the United Nations Secretary-General, the Security Council or the Director General of the 
Agency. Again, preambular paragraph (f) was in clear contradiction with paragraph 12 of the 
Director GeneralÂs present report. 

36. Iraq had co-operated fully with the Agency to enable it to accomplish its mission and it 
was high time for the Agency to establish normal relations with Iraq such as existed with any 
other country. In conclusion, he declared that Iraq had always fulfilled, and would continue 
to fulfil, its commitments under the NPT and the safeguards regime. 
37. Mr. AL-GHAIS (Kuwait) said that the authors of the draft resolution had 
purposely watered down its language in the hope that it could be adopted by consensus. His 
delegation, which was a sponsor but not an author of the draft resolution, would not have 
taken the floor if it had not been for IraqÂs repeated claim that it had fully implemented the 
requirements of paragraphs 12 and 13 of Security Council resolution 687. Despite the 
AgencyÂs efforts, which he commended, the Director GeneralÂs recent reports to the General 
Conference showed that measures that should have been implemented by Iraq within a year of 
the 1990 invasion of Kuwait still remained to be addressed. 
38. Recapitulating the history of events, he noted from paragraph 4 of document 
GOV/INF/1999/6 that the impeding of the AgencyÂs monitoring activities from 5 August to 
16 November 1998 had severely limited the level of assurance the Agency was able to 
provide as to IraqÂs compliance with its obligations under the relevant Security Council 
resolutions. 
39. The AgencyÂs personnel had been withdrawn completely on 16 December 1998 
following unacceptable interference by Iraq with the inspection operations, and Iraq had not 
thereafter allowed Agency inspectors back into the country. 
40. Paragraph 7 of document GC(43)/16 indicated that IraqÂs actions had made it 
impossible to implement the OMV plan properly and to clarify the few remaining questions 
and concerns regarding IraqÂs clandestine nuclear programme. Paragraph 20 indicated that, 
owing to IraqÂs suspension of co-operation, the Agency had been prevented from performing 
innumerable important inspection and sampling operations, while paragraph 21 noted that 
Iraq had failed to provide either of the semi-annual reports due in 1999 under the OMV plan. 
41. The Director GeneralÂs sixth report to the Security Council (GOV/INF/1998/22) 
detailed IraqÂs denial of access to the Al Iraqi factory (footnote 2) and its obstruction of 
routine interviews provided for under the OMV plan (paragraph 8), while paragraph 13 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 12 

indicated that Iraq had also failed to implement quality-assurance measures to deal with 
generic problems regarding accuracy, completeness and internal consistency. Paragraph 16 
showed that Iraq had so far failed to enact national penal laws, as required under the OMV 
plan, paragraph 18 spoke of IraqÂs lack of full transparency in the provision of information 
and the absence of certain documentation, and paragraph 19 listed outstanding questions and 
concerns relevant to IraqÂs clandestine nuclear programme, the importance of which should 
not be underestimated. 

42. In conclusion, IraqÂs continued refusal to re-admit inspectors was most regrettable, 
given that the Agency was constantly prepared to return and that, as the Director General had 
said, the effectiveness of implementation of the OMV plan was dependent on full rights of 
access. 
43. Mr. SARWAT (Egypt) said that his country supported the draft resolution, in 
particular as it related to the implementation of Security Council resolution 687, which called 
for the removal of Iraqi weapons as a step towards the establishment of a zone free of 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. The achievement of that objective was the 
responsibility of all the different parties in the region but it was high time that the 
international community took some action to facilitate matters. Egypt had constantly 
supported efforts within the United Nations to find ways of dealing with the situation in Iraq, 
including measures providing for the lifting of the embargo, which imposed a very great 
burden on the Iraqi people. 
44. Mr. RYZHOV (Russian Federation) said that the spirit in which the present 
discussion was being conducted seemed hardly likely to lead to a constructive outcome. He 
pointed out that the current situation was by no means critical. All relevant nuclear and 
non-nuclear facilities in Iraq had been destroyed or were under Agency supervision in 
accordance with the various Security Council resolutions. Moreover the Agency had declared 
that it had a full picture of IraqÂs past programme, and did not consider that much new 
information was likely to emerge. 
45. The Russian Federation considered that the objective now should be to restore normal 
relations between the Agency and Iraq and re-establish the AgencyÂs monitoring activities. In 
view of the number of inaccuracies it contained, the draft resolution before the General 
Conference was unlikely to facilitate that objective. However, his delegation would not 
object to its adoption. 
46. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(43)/L.6 without a vote 
47. It was so decided. 
48. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco) said that, rather than dwell on the Director 
GeneralÂs report contained in document GC(43)/16, which his delegation regarded as lacking 
in certain elements, he would simply express his countryÂs position as expounded by the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation of Morocco at the fifty-fourth session of the 
United Nations General Assembly on 21 September: 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 13 

ÂThe brotherly Iraqi people have been suffering for years from the impact of an 
economic embargo that has had pernicious effects on them, especially children, women 
and the elderly. As it voices full solidarity with the fraternal Iraqi people, Morocco 
calls for the pooling of international efforts in order to lift the embargo and to find a 
peaceful settlement to this problem within the framework of international law and in 
compliance with Security Council resolutions. In this respect, we stress the need to 
preserve the sovereignty of Iraq, its security and its territorial integrity.Â 

49. He added that KuwaitÂs legitimate rights should also be duly respected and a swift end 
put to that disastrous conflict, which had torn apart the Arab family and brought so much 
suffering to the people of the region. 
50. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said his delegation was opposed to the adoption of the 
draft resolution, and would have liked the General Conference to take greater account of 
IraqÂs recent efforts to fulfil its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Without Iraqi co-operation, the Agency would never have been able to complete all the tasks 
recorded in the Director GeneralÂs reports on Iraq during the period in question. The 
resolution clearly did not reflect reality and the General Conference should realize that, by 
adopting it, it had struck a blow at 24 million Iraqis suffering from the effects of the embargo. 
51. Finally, he expressed gratitude to all the delegations which had expressed sympathy for 
the plight of the Iraqi people. 
52. Mr. TWAL (Jordan), while associating his delegation with the consensus on 
adopting the draft resolution and noting that it was in IraqÂs interest to implement the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, stressed the need to end the suffering of the Iraqi people and to 
preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq. 
APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(GC(43)/17/Add.1, Add.1/Corr.1 and Add.2) (GC/(43)/L.1/Rev.1 and Adds 1-2) 

53. The PRESIDENT said that the item had been included in the agenda pursuant to 
resolution GC(42)/RES/21 adopted by the previous General Conference. Pursuant to 
operative paragraph 9 of that resolution, the Director General had submitted the report 
contained in document GC(43)/17 and Addendum 1 on the implementation of the resolution. 
The matter had been considered by the Board in September on the basis of the aforesaid 
report. Also before the Conference, in document GC(43)/L.1/Rev.1, was a draft resolution 
submitted by the Member States listed therein. Two addenda with additional sponsors had 
also been issued. 
54. Mr. ISSA (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(43)/L.1/Rev.1, said that since the consensus approval of the original resolution by the 
1991 General Conference, Egypt had worked constantly to further the cause of safeguards 
application in the Middle East, conscious of its importance for all States and for peace in that 
region. Despite the many positive elements the resolution contained, it was regrettable that 
no concrete steps had been taken to implement them, nor to begin the process of establishing 
a NWFZ in the Middle East. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 14 

55. In the light of the current climate in the region and the recent progress made in the 
Middle East peace process, Egypt had recently held consultations with the appropriate parties 
aimed at producing amendments to the resolution designed to bring the application of 
safeguards throughout the region nearer to realization. Unfortunately, those attempts had 
failed. The current draft resolution was virtually identical to that adopted by the previous 
General Conference. The wording had been left unchanged in order not to lose the positive 
elements achieved to date. Egypt remained disappointed with the inertia shown by a certain 
party, which it hoped would change its stance soon and permit some positive developments 
before the next General Conference. 
56. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that, having often called for the creation of a zone 
free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, his country once again had to record 
its concern at the continuing existence of an Israeli nuclear programme not subject to 
international control and which was a source of immense disquiet to IsraelÂs Arab neighbours. 
Iraq continued to ask itself why double standards were being applied to Israel, allowing it to 
continue flouting the relevant international instruments and refusing to accept safeguards on 
its facilities. 
57. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that the efforts of the Agency and of 
countries such as his own to achieve the objective of establishing a NWFZ in the Middle East 
had not succeeded because of the arrogance and stubbornness of Israel. Having amassed a 
considerable nuclear arsenal and refused to sign the NPT, Israel continued to exploit nuclear 
technology for non-peaceful purposes and represented the only unchecked threat to peace in 
the Middle East. 
58. In the light of the resolutions adopted by various Conferences of Islamic Foreign 
Ministers, including Resolution 22/8P adopted by the Eighth Summit of the Organization of 
the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Tehran and Resolution 23/25-P adopted by the twenty-fifth 
Session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, and others calling for the 
establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East, it was incumbent upon the Agency and all other 
related international organizations to make Israel toe the line and accept safeguards. 
59. Mr. UMER (Pakistan) said he would like to receive an explanation from the 
Syrian delegation as to what exactly was meant by the reference to Pakistan in the letter 
addressed by the Syrian Arab Republic to the Director General contained in document 
GC(43)/17/Add.1/Corr.1. 
60. Mr. ARAR (Turkey), referring to the same letter from the Syrian Arab Republic 
to the Director General mentioned by the representative of Pakistan, said he wished to make it 
absolutely clear that there were no nuclear weapons in Turkish military bases, since that 
would be in contravention of TurkeyÂs national policy of non-proliferation and its 
commitment to the NPT. 
61. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that his countryÂs support for the draft resolution 
was based on its belief in the principle of equality of rights and responsibilities, and the 
current text was the very minimum his delegation could accept. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 15 

62. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that the main obstacle to the 
denuclearization of the Middle East was IsraelÂs continuing refusal to become a party to the 
NPT, to implement Security Council resolution 487 requiring it to submit its nuclear facilities 
to Agency safeguards, and to heed the repeated calls to that effect addressed to it by the 
United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. Measures aimed at achieving 
Israeli compliance with those requirements should take precedence over all else, if a genuine 
peace in the Middle East region was to be achieved. 
63. Mr. BOURITA (Morocco) said that his countryÂs position, reflected most recently 
in a letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation of Morocco to the Director 
General which was contained in document GC(43)/17/Add.1, was that the full application of 
safeguards in the Middle East should be treated as a separate element to be pursued 
independently of developments in the Middle East peace process and also of efforts to 
establish a NWFZ in the region. 
64. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference was ready to adopt the draft 
resolution in document GC(43)/L.1/Rev.1 without a vote. 
65. It was so decided. 
66. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the only obstacle to the 
application of safeguards throughout the region and the establishment of a NWFZ was Israel 
which stubbornly refused to comply with successive resolutions. It was high time the 
international community put pressure on Israel to sign the NPT and accept safeguards. The 
application of safeguards and the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East should not be 
dependent on the peace process and piecemeal arrangements but should be the subject of a 
comprehensive international legal agreement. 
67. Mr. AMIR (Israel) said that Israel had joined the consensus on resolution 
GC(43)/L.1/Rev.1 in spite of the resolutionÂs inherent deficiencies, because it recognized that 
a NWFZ could eventually serve as an important complement to the overall peace, security 
and arms control in the region. 
68. The resolution contained elements that contradicted IsraelÂs policy and his delegationÂs 
decision not to block the consensus should not be interpreted as an indication of agreement 
with all the provisions of the resolution. 
69. IsraelÂs policy had always been that the nuclear issue, as well as all regional security 
issues, both conventional and non-conventional, should be dealt with in the full context of the 
peace process. Moreover, negotiations on those, like all issues concerned with the security of 
the region, could only realistically be expected to take place freely and directly within the 
framework of the peace process. 
70. The basic premise of any regional security and arms control process required that the 
security margins of any participating State should not be diminished throughout the process. 
Consequently, any progress had to be based on mutual steps. All States had to participate 
because reciprocal relationships were essential for all regional parties. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 16 

71. The sombre experience of UNSCOM and the Action Team should remind the 
Conference of the stark realities of the region. A practical step-by-step approach was the only 
way forward. The process should begin with confidence- and security-building measures that 
did not detract from the security margins of any regional State. The process should then 
continue by establishing peaceful relations and achieving reconciliation. Then, in due course, 
conventional and non-conventional arms control should be dealt with. 
72. Such an approach was substantiated by the vast experience of similar processes 
elsewhere. The history of the Tlatelolco Treaty, ABACC and the ÂAsian wayÂ of dealing 
with security showed that a step-by-step, careful and, just as importantly, informal 
confidence-building process was the proven recipe for transforming conflict-ridden regional 
relationships into more stable, enduring and mutually beneficial ones. 
73. The way to build security was to aim high but start modestly and move ahead carefully, 
because confidence-building was a long process. Time was needed to encourage others to 
co-operate, to win over the hesitating bystanders, it being important not to intimidate, harass 
or ostracize those that needed time to assure themselves that their basic security interests 
would not be compromised. 
74. The debate on that item should be viewed in the context of recent developments in the 
peace process that could usher in a more benign era in the Middle East. The Government of 
Israel had made clear its commitment to the peace process in the region, and a vigorous effort 
was now under way to revitalize it. Israel believed that there was no way back from the peace 
process. Indeed, only a few weeks previously, all parties concerned had gathered in Egypt to 
sign the Sharm El Sheikh Agreement. However, there was still a long and arduous road 
ahead, and a number of regrettable statements made by some of IsraelÂs neighbours did not 
help matters. 
75. In conclusion he hoped the future would bring reconciliation, security and peace in the 
Middle East. 
ISRAELI NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES AND THREAT 
(GC(43)/8) 

76. The PRESIDENT said that item had been included in the agenda pursuant to a 
request by Kuwait on behalf of the Arab States members of the Agency. An explanatory 
memorandum was contained in document GC(43)/8. 
77. He understood that consultations had been held on that matter, as a result of which it 
had been agreed that, as President, he should read out a statement for the endorsement of the 
Conference. The statement was the result of a delicate compromise and was as follows: 
ÂOn 1 October 1999 during the tenth plenary meeting the General Conference endorsed 
the following statement made by the President: 

ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement by the President of the 36th session 
in 1992 concerning the agenda item ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ. That 


GC(43)/OR.10 
page 17 

statement considered it desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 37th session. 
The General Conference also recalls the statement by the President of the 42nd session 
in 1998 concerning the same agenda item. At the 43rd session, this item was, at the 
request of certain Member States, re-inscribed on the agenda. The item was discussed. 
The President notes that certain Member States intend to include this item on the 
provisional agenda of the 44th regular session of the General Conference.Â 

78. He took it that the Conference was ready to adopt that statement. 
79. It was so decided. 
80. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) expressed concern at IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities, which undermined the NPT. That threat affected not only countries in the region 
but also the safety and security of those situated thousands of kilometres away. The 
statement read by the Chairman did not refer to the danger posed by those arms. It was the 
AgencyÂs responsibility to reinforce peace and security in the region, and the Conference 
should insist that Security Council resolutions be applied. 
81. Syria was disappointed by the decision just adopted. The international community 
should understand his countryÂs concern in the face of the danger posed by Israel. Israel had 
to accede to the NPT and there should be no more double standards. 
82. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that all Arab countries had signed the NPT but that 
fact alone did not provide them with security in the face of the threat posed by IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities. 
83. Israel continued to flout Security Council resolution 487 of 1981, which required that it 
submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, as well as General Assembly resolutions 
over the previous two decades. Those resolutions showed that everybody wished to see a 
NWFZ in the Middle East. 
84. Successive General Conference resolutions calling for the application of Agency 
safeguards throughout the Middle East as well as the General Assembly resolution 
A/RES/52/41 ÂThe risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle EastÂ all centred around the fact 
that Israel had nuclear weapons and was a threat to the Middle East and beyond. Indeed that 
situation was a threat to non- proliferation throughout the world. 
85. He called on the international community to insist that Israel accede to the NPT and 
submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. Israel had to decommission its nuclear 
arsenal and show that it had rejected nuclear weapons. 
86. Mr. SARWAT (Egypt) said that Egypt was doing all it could to see the principles 
of non-proliferation applied throughout the world. Achieving that goal in the Middle East 
was a pressing issue because IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities posed a threat to the whole region. 
Egypt had constantly called on all countries to make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear 
weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and all Arab countries had acceded to the NPT 
and submitted their nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, thereby demonstrating their 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 18 

confidence in the non-proliferation system and their political will to establish a NWFZ. 
However, Israel had not signed the NPT and never shown any willingness to accede to the 
NPT or submit its facilities to Agency control. 

87. The international community should take good note of the flagrant contradictions of the 
situation and the fact that sincere efforts were being blocked by IsraelÂs wall of refusal. As a 
result, efforts to achieve universal disarmament were being paralysed and local and 
international safety and security jeopardized. The fact that the subject had been on the agenda 
of the General Conference for more than ten years was a reflection both of its importance and 
of the legitimate fears of some Member States. 
88. In conclusion, he declared that the elimination of nuclear weapons in the Middle East 
was in the interests of the region and the world and should be made a major topic at the 
2000 NPT Review Conference. 
REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC FORUM 

89. The PRESIDENT invited the Rapporteur, Mr. Nicholls to present the report of the 
Scientific Forum. 
90. Mr. Nicholls presented the report which is reproduced in the Annex. 
91. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Nicholls for his most useful report on the results of 
the Scientific Forum, which he was sure had achieved its aims of stimulating discussion of 
scientific and technical issues relating to the AgencyÂs activities. On behalf of the 
Conference, he commended the initiative of the Director General in holding the Forum which 
was becoming a regular feature of the General Conference. He also expressed appreciation to 
the Deputy Director General for Nuclear Energy, Mr. Victor Mourogov, and his staff for their 
excellent preparation and organization of the Forum. 
92. Mr. CHIDAMBARAM (India) congratulated the Director General for convening 
the Scientific Forum on such a vital topic. The consistently high attendance and the very 
lively and high technical level of the discussions were a clear indication of the success of the 
Forum, which had helped restore to the Agency some measure of its original scientific 
character. 
93. He urged that the question of nuclear power be addressed as a regular feature in future 
General Conferences with the emphasis on innovative reactor and fuel cycle systems geared 
to enhance safety and economy and facilitate waste management. Training was another 
crucial issue. 
94. Mr. RYZHOV (Russian Federation), commending the Director General on the 
excellent organization of the Forum, said that the discussion had shown clearly the need for 
new approaches to reactor technology, the nuclear fuel cycle and waste management. It was 
accordingly up to the Agency to spearhead a process of renewal that would make nuclear 
technology safer, ecologically and socially acceptable, and proliferation-proof. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 19 

95. Ideas emanating from the Forum should be channelled into an international project or 
projects to develop inherently safe reactors and fuel cycle technology which maximized fuel 
efficiency and minimized waste production. 
96. The experience accumulated by the Agency from scientific forums involving leaders of 
the nuclear community could be used for making an annual review of progress, steering 
international co-operation, and focusing the attention of industry, governments and research 
centres on the most important issues. 
97. Mr. RITCH (United States of America), also welcoming the Forum, said he 
believed there was a strong connection between the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol and 
the AgencyÂs work, and his delegation would actively participate in any constructive forums 
that explored that relationship further. 
98. Mr. UMER (Pakistan), acclaiming the success of the Forum, said that, whereas 
the latter had been fully attended, the general debate had been increasingly sparsely attended, 
with only 11 people present by the evening of the third day. The general debate was a very 
important component of the Agency but he questioned whether it was being conducted in the 
most effective way. Following reform of the Board of Governors, consideration should now 
be given to the management of the General Conference particularly the general debate, which 
should be comprehensively reviewed to make it respond better to the requirements of the 
Statute and the interests of Member States. 
99. He therefore proposed that the Director General should present, through the Board of 
Governors, options for making the political component of the General Conference more 
efficient, more effective, more substantive and more interactive. 
100. Mr. RITCH (United States of America), endorsing that proposal, said that the 
ritualistic aspects of the Conference should be minimized and the potential for creative and 
constructive interaction maximized. Since many highly intelligent and well-placed people 
came to the Conference, maximum advantage should be drawn from their presence. He asked 
the Director General to explore ideas on the subject informally with Resident Representatives. 
101. Mr. IKEDA (Japan), having congratulated the Director General on the success of 
the Forum, stressed the importance of interchange between policy-makers and people from 
industry, which should be maintained in the future by keeping the forum as flexible as 
possible. 
102. Ms. QUINCY (France) also commended the Forum, which constituted an 
occasion to review topical and sensitive issues that had arisen during the year, with the 
participation of people from different backgrounds. She hoped that the results of the Forum 
would be widely disseminated. 
103. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco) said his delegation had participated with interest 
in the Scientific Forum, which had provided an opportunity for very useful interaction 
between scientists and diplomats. Also, he endorsed the suggestion made by the 
representative of Pakistan to look at further ways of streamlining the work of the General 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 20 

Conference. There could be no question, however, of doing away with the plenary meetings, 
which were the appropriate forum for deliberating international policies regarding nonproliferation 
and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 

104. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia) said that there was nothing unusual about the poor 
attendance for the general debate of the plenary meetings; the same could be said of other 
UN bodies, and also national parliaments. Thus, while he was in favour of greater efficiency, 
he urged caution before rushing to change the system. 
105. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) said that, as the AgencyÂs General 
Conference lasted only one week, optimum use should be made of that time to achieve 
positive results, and that might call for some changes. 
106. Mr. REGUIEG (Algeria) said that the Scientific Forum should become an 
established feature of the General Conference. He also supported the Pakistani proposal for 
reviewing General Conference procedures. 
107. Mr. NÃMETHY (Slovakia), expressing his delegationÂs appreciation of the 
Scientific Forum, urged that in future special attention be paid to nuclear safety and waste 
management. 
EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS 
(GC(43)/33) 

108. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met the day before to 
examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. 
The report of the Committee was contained in document GC(43)/33. After extensive 
discussion, the Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft 
resolution contained in paragraph 10 of its report, with the reservations and position 
expressed in the report. Since the Committee had met, he had been informed that credentials 
in proper form had been received from Afghanistan. 
109. Mr. SARWAT (Egypt) said that his countryÂs approval of the credentials for the 
Israeli delegation did not in any way denote acceptance of Israeli sovereignty over the 
territories occupied since 1967, especially Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. Israel as a State 
meant Israel within its borders as at 5 June 1967 and the borders defined in accordance with 
peace treaties between Israel and Egypt and Israel and Jordan. 
110. Mr. TWAL (Jordan) said that his countryÂs acceptance of the Israeli credentials 
did not in any way imply recognition of IsraelÂs occupation of territories since 1967, 
especially East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, to which Security Council resolutions 
242(1967) and 338(1973) applied. 
111. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said his country had reservations 
concerning the Israeli delegationÂs credentials in view of IsraelÂs usurpation of Arab lands, its 
invasion of the holy city of Jerusalem and its expansionist policies. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 21 

112. Mr. REGUIEG (Algeria) endorsed the reservations expressed by the previous 
speakers. 
113. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(43)/33. 
114. It was so decided. 
REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION 
FUND FOR 2000 
(GC(43)/25/Rev.4) 

115. The PRESIDENT, drawing attention to document GC(43)/25/Rev.4, said that, by 
5.30 p.m. on 30 September 1999, the contributions pledged by Member States to the 
Technical Co-operation Fund had amounted to only US $7 283 619. Since then $678 170 had 
been pledged by Austria, $129 940 by Malaysia, $1 176 030 by the Netherlands, $25 000 by 
the Syrian Arab Republic, and $7300 by Yemen, bringing the total amount pledged to 
$9 300 059, which represented only 12.7% of the target. 
116. He urged those delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2000 pledges and 
also to pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, in order that the Secretariat 
might submit to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee meeting a proposed 
2000 programme based upon reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement the 
approved programme without hindrance or uncertainty. 
CLOSING OF THE SESSION 

117. Ms. PELLICER (Mexico), speaking on behalf of Ms. Lajous Vargas, President of 
the Conference at its 1998 session, expressed appreciation of the excellent manner in which 
the President had directed the proceedings of the Conference. Particularly noteworthy was 
the fact that he had steered the Conference to a consensus agreement on amendment of Article 
VI of the Statute. 
118. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco), speaking as the delegate of a developing country 
and as the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, expressed concern about the low 
percentage of the target of the Technical Co-operation Fund pledged. He appealed to 
Member States to do their utmost to pledge and pay in full and on time. 
119. The forty-third General Conference had been one of the best he had ever attended and, 
with the skilful guidance of the President promoting a spirit of mutual co-operation, it had 
produced unhoped-for results. 
120. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), speaking on behalf of the African 
Group, paid tribute to the President for his sterling performance, as well as to all those whose 
hard work had made the General Conference such a success. 

GC(43)/OR.10 
page 22 

121. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) joined the previous speaker in praising the 
leadership displayed by the President. 
122. Mr. VILOVI. (Croatia), speaking on behalf of the Eastern European Group, and 
Ms. QUINCY (France), speaking on behalf of the Western European Group, congratulated 
the President and the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole on the remarkable results 
achieved by the General Conference. 
123. Mr. Ki-Moon BAN (Republic of Korea), highlighting the harmoniousness of the 
Conference, which had concluded its business without any voting being necessary, said he 
hoped the spirit of consensus would continue to prevail. 
124. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) thanked the President for his astute 
conduct of the proceedings, and also the staff of the Secretariat for all their hard work behind 
the scenes. 
125. The PRESIDENT, thanking all participants for their co-operation, said he was 
particularly pleased about the adoption of the two amendments to the Statute. He also wished 
to thank the Director General and his staff - including the interpreters, translators, prÃ©cis 
writers, Conference Service officers, printers and documents control officers - for their 
valuable support. 
126. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the 
Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and observed one minute of silence. 

127. The PRESIDENT declared the forty-third regular session of the General 
Conference closed. 
The meeting rose at 7 p.m.

Annex

Report to the forty-third General Conference of the IAEA from the second Scientific Forum 
Sustainable Development: A Role for Nuclear Power? 

1. The Scientific Forum was extremely well attended and the presentations and debates 
were held in a very constructive and positive manner. The participants came from a wide 
variety of national and international scientific and research centres, international 
organizations and NGOs, and the nuclear industry. The freedom to express individual views 
as opposed to rigid adherence to national positions was seen to be fundamental to the success 
of this initiative of the Director General. 
2. The Scientific Forum was concerned with the role of nuclear power in sustainable 
development. There were many views on what is meant by ÂsustainabilityÂ, and clearly this 
differs depending on the perspective of the person and the time-frame being considered. Also 
at issue was whether one is debating the sustainability of the nuclear power industry, or the 
broader subject of sustainable development of the world (or country or city or village). In 
terms of the sustainable development of the world, there were several presentations on the 
framework for the debate with different perspectives on economic, energy and environmental 
considerations. However, no conclusion was reached about the bases on which to judge 
nuclear power in this context, except a strong feeling that there must be a common set of 
criteria (e.g. emission levels, economics) for all energy generation systems. The question of 
the inevitable trade-offs between the criteria was raised but was not resolved. The issue of 
global climate change was extensively discussed and there were significant disagreements as 
to whether this would become the justification for nuclear expansion or whether it would have 
any material impact on the predominantly economic criteria currently used. What emerged 
from the various presentations was a common view that electricity use would expand greatly. 
However, there were vastly divergent views on the role nuclear power would (or should) play 
in meeting this growth. 
3. The discussions covered the role of nuclear power in three general time periods. 
Fundamental to each of these, as pointed out by a number of speakers, and fully endorsed by 
all present, was the continued maintenance of the highest level of nuclear safety globally. 
4. The first period could be seen as the Ânuclear power of todayÂ. In the case of the 
OECD countries the dominant issue is the operational costs in an increasingly free market 
system for electricity. For the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Russian 
Federation and the Newly Independent States, the issue is one of safely managing nuclear 
power plant operations in Âeconomies in transitionÂ, and in the case of developing countries 
the dominant concern is that of the effective management of technology. 
5. The next period which could be called Ânuclear prospects for tomorrowÂ, extending 
from the present until about 2020, can be seen as the bridge that maintains the technology for 
future generations. It was generally agreed that, for there to be any prospects for nuclear 
power, two issues must be resolved. The first is public confidence - or at least public 
tolerance - particularly with regard to means of high-level waste disposal. The second, and no 
less important, is competitiveness, in particular in terms of capital cost and construction 

GC(43)/OR.10 
Annex 
page 2 

periods. There are also two related topics. The first is what the appropriate linkages (through 
the market-place or regulations, for example) would be between nuclear power and 
environmental issues, such as global climate change, local air quality and regional 
acidification. The second is the desire to create a globalized approach to nuclear power 
issues. Examples of this globalized approach were proposals for an international nuclear 
waste authority, and an IAEA-led initiative on innovative proliferation-resistant reactors and 
fuel cycle, and international standards for new-generation nuclear reactor designs. 

6. The last period could be called Ânuclear power for the futureÂ, running from about 2020 
onwards. The principal issue here was the central role many felt nuclear power has to play if 
greenhouse gases are to be limited, given that half the available hydro-potential appears to 
have already been exploited, and doubts over the potential for renewables. Some projections 
showed, however, that if nuclear power were indeed to assume this central role, uranium 
supplies would be inadequate unless a closed cycle was employed. There was extensive 
discussion on the proliferation potential this would generate. 
7. There were many recommendations that were proposed at the Forum. Included were 
the following: 
Â 
The Agency should take an active role in sustaining nuclear skills and expertise 
for the long-term needs of the nuclear community; 
Â 
The Agency should continue to drive international co-operation and the free 
dissemination of information in the nuclear field; 
Â 
Given the importance of nuclear safety, the IAEA should continue to establish, 
promulgate and promote the implementation of safety standards; 
Â 
The IAEA should play an important role with regard to the design certification of 
new generation reactors; 
Â 
The scientific and technical debate on the future of nuclear power should be 
continued, preferably in conjunction with the General Conference, and bring in 
participants with a broad energy background, also from NGOs, trade unions and 
industry. 
This report can be appropriately concluded by quoting the final words of one of the 
speakers from the general debate this week, which capture the mood of the Scientific Forum: 
ÂWhen future generations look back 50 or 100 years from now, let them say that we seized 
the opportunities rather than let them slip away.Â

OPENING OF THE SESSION 

1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-third regular session of 
the General Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, she 
invited delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT expressed her gratitude for the support given to 
her by the Secretariat - and in particular the Legal Division - during the forty-second session 
of the General Conference. That session had been highly controversial, taking place shortly 
after a new round of nuclear testing. Perhaps because of that the international community 
was now more aware of the dangers of nuclear proliferation and the need to proceed with 
ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. She also wished to express her 
appreciation for the support that she had received from her companions in the Latin American 
and Caribbean Group and for the co-operation of all representatives, without which the work 
of the General Conference would have been even more difficult. 
4. Every year the General Conference offered an opportunity to re-evaluate the role played 
by the Agency within the United Nations family. The past year had been marked by the 
AgencyÂs efforts to achieve a consensus on measures to cope with the proliferation potential 
of neptunium and americium. The undertaking by the Agency of measures to verify surplus 
weapon-origin fissile material was a major step and would need an appropriate legal and 
financial framework to make it credible and reliable. The support of Member States would be 
necessary for the trilateral initiative to take on an international dimension. 
5. The AgencyÂs nuclear safety programme had now assumed vital importance and she 
welcomed the results of the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety held in April 1999. It was also pleasing to note that the technical 
co-operation programme was contributing more and more to the development of States thanks 
to the new technical co-operation strategy despite the constant shortage of resources. 
6. In conclusion, she expressed the hope that with a spirit of co-operation, the issues left 
unresolved the previous year - in particular amendment of Article VI of the Statute - would be 
brought to a successful conclusion in 1999. 
ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND APPOINTMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE 

7. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President 
of the Conference. 
8. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), speaking on behalf of the African 
Group, proposed Mr. Kadri (Algeria) for that position. 
9. Mr. Kadri (Algeria) was elected President by acclamation.

10. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT, speaking on her own behalf and on behalf of 
all of the delegates, congratulated Mr. Kadri on his election and wished him success in his 
task. 
Mr. Kadri (Algeria) took the Chair. 

11. The PRESIDENT expressed his gratitude for the honour of presiding over the 
forty-third regular session of the General Conference. 
12. Since its foundation 42 years ago the Agency had played a crucial role in the global 
quest for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. His country had become a Member 
State of the Agency in 1963 and had thus been actively involved in the AgencyÂs 
achievements for over 36 years. It had acceded to the NPT in 1994 and concluded a 
safeguards agreement in 1996, thereby demonstrating its commitment to nuclear 
non-proliferation and to total nuclear disarmament. That commitment was shared by all 
African Member States and had been consolidated in the Pelindaba Treaty, establishing 
Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Another African regional instrument, AFRA, was an 
efficient tool for promoting nuclear research and development in Africa. 
13. He hoped that the forty-third regular session of the General Conference - the last of the 
century and of the millennium - would contribute significantly to achieving the AgencyÂs 
objectives and that it would respond to the expectations and concerns of all Member States. 
He would do his best to promote the AgencyÂs consensus tradition and he appealed to all 
delegations to respect that practice. The Agency had an enviable reputation as a wellmanaged 
international organization and he was sure that, with goodwill prevailing, it would 
emerge from the Conference as a strong and effective body capable of facing the challenges 
of the next millennium. 
14. Turning to the election of officers and the appointment of the General Committee, he 
recalled that under Rules 34 and 40 of its Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect 
eight Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and five additional 
members of the General Committee resulting, with himself as Chairman, in a Committee 
of 15. For the forty-third session of the General Conference, he understood that there was 
agreement that there be 16 members of the General Committee, so that the area of Africa, in 
addition to providing the President of the Conference and the Chairman of the Committee of 
the Whole, might also have a Vice-President. He therefore proposed that Rule 40 be 
suspended and that the delegates of Belgium, Canada, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
the Republic of Korea, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Peru and the Russian Federation be 
elected as Vice-Presidents, that Ambassador Abderrahim Benmoussa of Morocco be elected 
as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and that the delegates of Bulgaria, Kuwait, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, Slovakia and the United States of America be elected as additional 
members of the General Committee. 
15. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted.

APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AGENCY 
(GC(43)/2 and 28) 

16. The PRESIDENT informed delegates that the General Conference had before it 
two applications for membership - one by Honduras contained in document GC(43)/2 and the 
other by Angola in document GC(43)/28. Both applications had been endorsed by the Board 
of Governors, which had also submitted two draft resolutions for adoption by the General 
Conference. 
17. He assumed that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolutions by acclamation. 
18. It was so decided. 
19. Mr. LOY DE FIGUEREIDO1 (Angola) said that the forty-third session of the 
General Conference would be a milestone in AngolaÂs history as a sovereign State and 
responsible member of the international community. Its presence in the IAEA would give it 
the opportunity to participate in efforts to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy for the 
benefit of mankind. His country was well aware that nuclear technology could contribute to 
rapid economic progress and improvement of living conditions. On behalf of the Angolan 
Government, he wished to assure other Member States that Angola would do its utmost to 
fulfil its obligations as a member of the Agency. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS 

20. Mr. MAERTENS (Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations) 
read out the following message to the General Conference from the Secretary-General of the 
United Nations: 
ÂIt is a great pleasure to convey my warm greetings to the forty-third regular session of 
the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This session 
provides a unique opportunity to survey past results and to look ahead to new 
challenges. The IAEA has a unique role in tackling these challenges and addressing the 
larger issues of peace and security that they affect. By preventing the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, spreading a strong safety culture and helping to develop the peaceful 
use of nuclear technology for sustainable development, the Agency is playing a major 
role in advancing the highest aims of the United Nations. 

ÂLet me turn first to the AgencyÂs role in seeking to prevent the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. After the Cold War the world has become safer and more complicated at the 
same time. I refer specifically to the multidimensional nature of potential proliferation 
threats, whether from ÂbreakoutsÂ within the ranks of States committed to the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime; from States which have concluded, in the face of 
overwhelming conclusions to the contrary, that national interests are enhanced by 
pursuing the nuclear weapons option; from national or sub-national terrorist groups; 

Speaking under Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure. 


GC(43)/OR.1 
page 6 

from illicit trafficking in nuclear material; or from weaknesses in arrangements to 
ensure adequate physical protection of nuclear material. 

ÂThese are some of the issues which I expect to find discussed at next yearÂs Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT). At that time, Parties to the Treaty will be expected to give an account of their 
respective roles in seeking to implement the package of decisions adopted by the 
1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. Last year, I welcomed the significant 
progress that had been made with regard to the Additional Protocols to the safeguards 
agreements. I regret that further progress has been delayed, even in countries with 
significant nuclear facilities. I trust that all countries committed to strengthening the 
safeguards systems will be ready to turn their words into deeds and thus demonstrate, at 
next yearÂs NPT Conference, that they have played their part in equipping their 
safeguards system to deal effectively with the challenges of the twenty-first century. 

ÂI also hope that progress will be made towards nuclear disarmament. This has proven 
to be more difficult than expected. The START II agreement remains unratified, and 
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has yet to enter into force. 

ÂNegotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a ban on the production of fissile 
material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices have been stymied by 
procedural wrangling. Again, the NPT Review Conference will provide a significant 
opportunity for taking stock of where we stand with regard to the noble and ambitious 
goals which States set for themselves in 1995 and of their willingness to match their 
intentions with actions. 

ÂI am pleased to note that real progress has been made in achieving and maintaining a 
high level of nuclear safety worldwide. This has only been possible through the 
enhancement of national measures and international co-operation. The first Âpeer 
reviewÂ meeting held last April within the framework of the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety demonstrated that Contracting Parties are taking steps in the right direction. I 
encourage all Member States to do so. 

ÂSafety, in all aspects, including radiation and waste safety as well as safety of transport 
of radioactive materials, is a key to the future of nuclear technologies. The work of the 
Agency towards the establishment of a global Âsafety cultureÂ, and in carrying out 
advisory services for assisting Member States to strengthen and improve their national 
regulatory infrastructures, is an example of long-term international co-operation for the 
greater good. 

ÂAlthough effective actions have been taken to improve the security of material, the 
threat from illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources to global 
security and public health remains. International co-operation has to be further 
strengthened to prevent these criminal activities. The IAEA has a crucial role in 
co-ordinating international efforts to reinforce national systems for the prevention and 
detection of, and response to, illicit trafficking. 


GC(43)/OR.1

ÂThe IAEA also makes a valuable contribution to sustainable development, a central 
goal of the entire United Nations system. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programme offers an important tool to meet the needs of Member States in many fields: 
industry, food and agriculture, water resource and environment management and human 
health. In a world with a growing population, the application of the best available 
technologies and their transfer in an efficient, effective and safe manner is an imperative 
need. For example, results obtained with the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eradicate 
the tsetse fly in Africa or the fruit fly in South America open the way to spreading this 
experience in other geographical areas. A great deal has also been done for improving 
human health with radiation therapy services, particularly in developing countries. 

ÂI have repeatedly stressed the role of civil society in raising public awareness, alerting 
the worldÂs conscience and shaping policy. Efforts towards better communication 
between international organizations and civil society should be pursued. I appreciate 
the efforts that the Agency is making to strengthen its relationship with civil society and 
the private sector. 

ÂToday, I have highlighted some of the most fundamental aspects of the IAEAÂs role 
within the UNÂs overall mission. As we know, the challenges we have to face will not 
disappear with the new millennium but will test our international system to its limit. I 
am confident that the IAEA will do its part to help us succeed.Â 

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 

21. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that the forty-third General Conference was 
taking place on the eve of a new millennium, and presented an occasion to reflect on the past 
and plan for the future. 
22. The AgencyÂs programme was centred around the three ÂpillarsÂ that constituted its 
mandate, namely technology, safety and verification, coupled with two other important 
elements namely effective interaction with the outside world, and excellence in management. 
23. To take the first pillar, nuclear technology provided the basis for all of the AgencyÂs 
work. In that area, the AgencyÂs mandate was to maximize the ability of Member States to 
make full use of nuclear technology for their economic and social development. 
24. At the end of 1998, over four hundred nuclear power reactors in more than thirty 
countries were producing about 16% of world electricity, with sixteen countries relying on 
nuclear power for 25% or more of their electricity supply. 
25. Global energy demand, particularly for electricity, was clearly rising. A conservative 
estimate from the World Energy Council was that global electricity demand would triple in 
the next fifty years. Nuclear power was one of the few options that could help countries meet 
base load electricity demand with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions and could thus 
satisfy growing energy needs, while helping to meet the carbon dioxide emission targets set out 
in the Kyoto Protocol. 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 8 

26. While that might suggest that the share of nuclear power in global energy production 
would grow, or at least remain stable, current projections indicated that the nuclear share was 
likely to fall to about 13% in 2010 and to 10% in 2020. 
27. The assumption that environmental considerations alone would trigger a resurgence of 
investment in nuclear power generation was at best doubtful. Only if the nuclear power 
industry consistently reflected three crucial attributes - safety, competitiveness and public 
support - could it be assured of a long-term future. 
28. One of the prerequisites for nuclear power to remain economically competitive was for 
scientific and technical research to focus not only on how to improve fuel cycle technology 
but also on how to develop designs for reactors of various sizes, with higher efficiency and 
greater availability, shorter construction times and lower capital costs. 
29. Public support was vital for a revival of the nuclear power option. Nuclear science and 
technology were complex subjects but that should not justify widespread misperception. 
Public understanding was a prerequisite for public acceptance. The role of industry and civil 
society in promoting public understanding could not be overemphasized. Key factors in that 
process were objectivity, openness and transparency, and there was also a great need to reach 
opinion leaders, who might not always be better informed on nuclear realities than the general 
public. 
30. While the choice of nuclear power and of a particular energy mix was a national 
decision that could be made only in the light of national priorities, it was important that States 
considering the different energy options had the required information and tools to make 
informed decisions. In co-operation with eight other international organizations, the Agency 
had been pursuing an intensive programme to assist Member States in developing their own 
capacity for decision-making in the energy sector. Furthermore, the Agency was actively 
contributing to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was working 
with the United Nations and other organizations to prepare for discussions on energy within 
the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development in 2001. Its objective was to 
ensure that nuclear power was given a full and fair hearing in that important forum. 
31. The AgencyÂs activities in the field of nuclear power covered a wide front. Its 
international working groups would continue to facilitate the exchange of experience gained 
in the operation of different types of reactors. They would also serve as forums for discussion 
of technological advances in the nuclear field, including the assessment of new reactor 
designs or the use of small and medium-sized reactors in non-electrical applications such as 
desalination. 
32. The first pillar of the AgencyÂs work also included many nuclear applications that were 
making a significant contribution to human welfare. Drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis 
developed when treatment was ineffective or incomplete. The Agency and seven Member 
States in Africa had developed and were now field testing an isotope-based technique that 
reduced the period for diagnosis from weeks to days - a critical improvement in the efficacy 
of disease control. In Belarus, fifty thousand acres of prime agricultural land remained 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 9 

contaminated after the Chernobyl accident. Agency technical co-operation projects had 
assisted with the production of rapeseed on the land. The seed could be used for 
economically valuable end products such as cooking oil and lubricants, and qualitative 
assessments would be made of the products to ensure they met international standards. The 
result would be not only accelerated decontamination of the land, but also the return of 
farmers to their former production areas, and the creation of jobs in the community. 

33. Those examples, taken from the AgencyÂs eighty-million-dollar programme of technical 
co-operation, pointed to the future direction of the TC programme: it should be demanddriven, 
results-based and closely aligned with national development strategies. In some 
countries the Agency would have to concentrate on capacity-building and the supply of 
equipment, in others, on technology exchange and quality assurance. It would also endeavour 
to strengthen its relationship with other international organizations in the development field. 
34. Over the next few years the Agency would be seeking to meet the needs of Member 
States through an evolving, focused and responsive programme. With regard to nuclear 
energy, high priority would be given to the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle, in particular to 
measures for the safe management of waste, to small and medium-sized reactors (for both 
power generation and desalination purposes), to the exchange of information on innovative 
fuel cycles and reactor designs, and to the potential role of nuclear energy in sustainable 
development. With regard to nuclear applications, the Agency intended to redouble its efforts 
to respond to the urgent need of its developing Member States to increase food production, 
fight disease, manage water resources and monitor and protect the environment. 
35. Turning to the second of the three pillars, nuclear, radiation and waste safety, he 
observed that it was now widely recognized that a demonstrated high standard of nuclear, 
radiation and radioactive waste safety would be a determining factor for the future use of 
nuclear technology and that a good safety record relied on good technology, good regulatory 
practices and well qualified and trained staff. 
36. Nuclear accidents did not respect national borders, as witness the Chernobyl accident. 
Thereafter international co-operation on nuclear, radiation and waste safety had been 
considerably enhanced. As the global centre for that co-operation, the Agency was making an 
important contribution to the development of an effective worldwide safety regime that 
comprised three elements: international conventions prescribing the basic legal norms for the 
safe use of nuclear energy; internationally accepted safety standards; and measures to assist 
States in the implementation of those conventions and standards. In addition, technological 
solutions for improving safety were being promoted and during the past year the Agency had 
been assisting Member States in managing the Y2K readiness problem. 
37. The international effort to strengthen nuclear safety had been highlighted by the first 
review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, where StatesÂ 
reports on their safety practices had been subject to peer review. Also, participants at the 
recent International Conference on the Strengthening of Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe, 
organized by the Agency in co-operation with the European Commission and the NEA had 
agreed that considerable progress in nuclear safety had been made in the operation of WWER 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 10 

and RBMK reactors. Nevertheless, the AgencyÂs Nuclear Safety Review underlined the need 
for constant vigilance to avoid complacency, and the important roles that self-assessment and 
peer review could play in maintaining that vigilance. 

38. An area of major concern in the debate over the use of nuclear technologies was the 
safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. The Agency could assist Member 
States in that area, particularly through the development of consensus safety standards. In 
some areas, such as the near-surface disposal of low-level waste, that consensus existed, but 
in others, such as, geological disposal of high-level waste, it had been more elusive. 
39. An Agency-sponsored international symposium had recently indicated that technologies 
existed for the safe, environmentally sound and cost-effective management of radioactive 
wastes, and that high-level wastes and spent fuel could be safely isolated in certain types of 
deep geological repositories. In his view, however, only when final high-level waste 
repositories were built would the public begin to accept that the waste issue had been 
resolved. 
40. The Agency would be facing some specific challenges in the area of safety in the 
coming years. A particularly urgent concern was the threat to public health arising from 
ÂorphanÂ radioactive sources, i.e. radiation sources that, for a variety of reasons, were not 
under control by national authorities. Recently, such sources had been found in Georgia, Peru 
and Turkey. The Agency had sent missions to check the radiological impacts of the sources 
and provided assistance in taking the necessary protective measures, including emergency 
humanitarian assistance. The focus of the AgencyÂs work in that area should be on 
prevention. Its draft action plan on the safety of radiation sources and the security of 
radioactive materials, which was before the General Conference2, identified the immediate 
needs and the required financial resources. 
41. Another area of concern was research reactor safety. Out of over 600 research reactors 
which had been built, 344 had been shut down but only 106 had been decommissioned. 
Furthermore, many States operating research reactors had inadequate regulatory 
infrastructures. There were also other serious issues such as ageing, obsolete equipment, lack 
of spare parts and budgetary limitations. The AgencyÂs activities in that area had focused on 
upgrading regulatory structures and on safety review services, but more needed to be done. In 
the future, additional Agency efforts were envisaged to enhance operational safety, and 
assistance would be provided in the decommissioning of shutdown reactors. 
42. In recent years, the Agency had provided assistance to Member States in the 
radiological assessment of areas affected by residual radioactive waste, for example in 
Kazakhstan, the Marshall Islands and French Polynesia. While continuing to advise on the 
restoration of such contaminated areas, the Agency would increase its efforts in future to 
develop internationally harmonized guidance and criteria for the cleanup or rehabilitation of 
areas affected by residual wastes. 
See document GC(43)/10 and Corr.1. 


GC(43)/OR.1 
page 11 

43. The Agency expected that the implementation of the existing conventions would result 
in a better global safety record but it would continue to be vigilant in identifying areas where 
new legal norms were required or existing norms needed to be modified. It also intended, 
following the review and revision of the AgencyÂs safety standards, to focus its efforts on 
assisting Member States in their application. As regarded safety services, it envisaged that 
the development of new services and the integration of existing ones would result in a 
comprehensive set of services in which safety culture and self-assessment played a more 
central role. 
44. A concern of immediate importance was the Y2K readiness problem. Successfully 
managing the Y2K transition would be an important demonstration and reassuring signal of 
the safety of the nuclear industry. In the past year, the Agency had acted as a central point of 
information exchange and had been closely involved in assisting Member States to address 
the Y2K issue in respect of nuclear facilities and medical facilities that used radiation sources. 
That effort had included preparing guidance documents, organizing workshops for the 
exchange of information and experience, and conducting preparatory and review missions to 
nuclear power plants. 
45. The AgencyÂs Emergency Response Centre would be in a state of increased readiness 
for the millennium change at the end of December. It would be ready to answer questions and 
follow up any information or reports about Y2K-related incidents in nuclear facilities. 
46. With regard to the third pillar of the AgencyÂs work, verification and the security of 
nuclear material, Agency safeguards were central to international efforts to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Safeguards had evolved steadily since their inception as 
advances in technology had led to improvements in verification techniques and capabilities. 
A major catalyst for change, however, had been the AgencyÂs experience in Iraq. Since 1991, 
efforts had concentrated on equipping the safeguards system to provide assurance not only of 
the absence of diversion of a StateÂs nuclear material from declared activities, but also of the 
absence of any undeclared material or activities. That had culminated in the adoption by the 
Board of Governors, in May 1997, of the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards 
agreements which provided the Agency with the necessary complementary authority in that 
regard. 
47. A long-standing concern of the Secretariat was the number of States which had still not 
concluded safeguards agreements with the Agency, despite their obligation to do so. In 
anticipation of the NPT Review Conference in 2000, he urged the 52 NPT States without 
safeguards agreements in force to conclude and bring such agreements into force without 
further delay. The full potential of the strengthened safeguards system could be realized only 
through universal adherence to the Additional Protocol. That, in turn, depended upon all 
relevant safeguards agreements being in force. 
48. Since the 1998 General Conference, a further 13 Additional Protocols had been 
approved by the Board of Governors bringing the total of Additional Protocols approved 
to 45. That progress, while welcome, fell short of expectations. States had consistently 
emphasized the great importance that they attached to a strengthened safeguards system, so he 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 12 

appealed to all States which had not yet done so to conclude Additional Protocols at the 
earliest possible date. 

49. His report to the General Conference on ÂStrengthening the Effectiveness and 
Improving the Efficiency of the Safeguards SystemÂ3 described the work that the Secretariat 
had undertaken. He was confident that the new system would enable the Agency to provide 
enhanced assurance to the international community that all States with comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and Additional Protocols were using nuclear energy exclusively for 
peaceful purposes. At the same time, it was necessary to continue striving towards 
universality of the non-proliferation regime, towards nuclear disarmament and towards a 
better system of global and regional security. 
50. Turning to the physical protection of nuclear material, which was closely associated 
with the AgencyÂs safeguards and verification mission, it was important that nuclear materials 
should not be misused either by States or by subnational groups. The Secretariat would 
continue to assist States in their efforts to prevent, detect and respond to illegal uses of 
nuclear and radioactive material, and to co-operate to that end with other international 
organizations, such as customs and police organizations. The Secretariat was also convening 
in November, at the request of Member States, an open-ended expert meeting to consider 
whether there was a need to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material. 
51. In the area of nuclear arms control and reduction measures, the Agency had continued 
its work on a joint initiative with the Russian Federation and the United States, focusing on 
Agency verification of weapon-origin fissile material in the two States. A meeting of the 
three parties was to be held later that day to review the work and set goals for the coming 
year. 
52. Clearly, any new verification activities would pose a challenge for the Agency in terms 
of resource requirements, and he had submitted to the Board of Governors earlier in the year a 
document4 outlining the possible options for financing Agency verification of future nuclear 
arms control and reduction measures, including the possible establishment of a nuclear arms 
control and reduction fund based on assessed contributions. At its June meetings, the Board 
of Governors had held an initial discussion on the subject and he expected the issue to be 
pursued when the envisaged verification tasks became concrete. If the Agency were asked to 
take on new roles in the important field of nuclear arms control, it needed to be prepared and, 
in particular, the financing arrangements needed to be worked out. 
53. Some nine months had now passed since the AgencyÂs last inspection in Iraq under the 
relevant Security Council resolutions. One year ago the Agency had been cautiously 
optimistic that it would be able to proceed with the full implementation of its monitoring and 
verification plan. That had not happened, and the United Nations Security Council was still 
consulting on a mechanism for the resumption of verification activities in Iraq. Clearly, under 
3 See document GC(43)/22. 
4 See document GOV/INF/1999/9. 


GC(43)/OR.1 
page 13 

present circumstances, the Agency could not provide any measure of assurance regarding 
IraqÂs compliance with its obligations under the said resolutions. However, the Agency 
continued to be ready to resume its activities in Iraq at short notice. 

54. The Agency also remained unable to verify that all nuclear material subject to 
safeguards in the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea (DPRK) had been declared to the 
Agency. However, it continued to monitor the freeze on the DPRKÂs graphite-moderated 
reactors and related facilities, as requested by the Security Council. The measure of 
co-operation received from the DPRK continued to be limited, and, despite twelve rounds of 
technical discussions, there was still no progress on important issues such as the preservation 
of information relevant to verifying the DPRKÂs compliance with its safeguards agreement. 
As he had indicated previously, without that information it would be difficult, if not 
impossible, to verify, in the future, compliance by the DPRK with its safeguards agreement. 
55. Pursuant to the mandate conferred on him by the General Conference, he had continued 
his consultations with States of the Middle East region regarding the application of full-scope 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East with a view to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. During visits in the course of the 
year to Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and the Syrian Arab Republic, he had reiterated the 
importance of obtaining more detailed information from States of the Middle East on key 
issues relevant to his mandate. Additionally, he had written in May to the Foreign Ministers 
of Middle East States in that regard and had received a number of replies that were annexed to 
his report to the General Conference5. He had also reiterated his willingness to provide any 
assistance within his power to States of the region in seeking to fulfil the objectives of 
successive General Conference resolutions. There was clearly a common view among the 
States of the region, which was globally shared, that a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone 
would contribute to regional stability and security. It was to be hoped that the political 
climate now prevailing in the region would be conducive to progress in the attainment of 
those important goals. 
56. Proper interaction with Member States, partners and the public was fundamental to the 
AgencyÂs ability to maintain broad support and deliver its programme, and to address the 
concerns of the general public about the health and environmental effects of radiation, the risk 
of accidents, the disposal of waste and the threat of proliferation. 
57. In the past year, the Secretariat had sought to review and strengthen its ties with United 
Nations system organizations and other relevant bodies. The objective in all cases was to 
optimize synergies, encourage greater pooling of human and financial resources and avoid 
duplication of effort. 
58. In June, he had approved a new public information and outreach policy which was 
intended to enhance the AgencyÂs interaction with opinion leaders, the media and civil 
society. Part of that effort would focus on establishing a dialogue with private industry 
See document GC(43)/17/Add.1, Add.1/Corr.1 and Add.2. 


GC(43)/OR.1 
page 14 

groups, nuclear research centres, the arms control and disarmament community and other 
relevant non-governmental organizations. The public information and outreach strategy that 
had been developed should help the international community to assess objectively the 
advantages and risks of nuclear science and technology. 

59. Almost immediately after taking up office, he had initiated a process to address the 
broad question of management reform and modernization. The Agency had moved forward 
on several fronts in its efforts to ensure better planning, better implementation, and better 
evaluation of its programmes and activities. The planning area had already seen some 
substantial changes. A draft Medium Term Strategy had been prepared and was being 
considered by the Board of Governors. Formulation of the programme and budget, which 
would be based on the objectives set out in the Medium Term Strategy, would follow a 
structured process for assessing Member StatesÂ needs and priorities, and would identify 
expected results and set performance indicators. 
60. Good programme planning had to be accompanied by effective implementation, and 
that was not just a question of technical competence. It also relied on there being a clear, 
common understanding within the Secretariat of the AgencyÂs overall purpose, priorities and 
objectives - the Âone houseÂ concept that he had consistently advocated. During the past year 
he had focused on how to improve and harmonize the interaction between the Regular Budget 
and technical co-operation programmes as well as the interaction between the relevant 
Departments, with emphasis on a team approach and matrix management. The final 
component in good programme management was effective evaluation. As part of the process, 
Programme Performance Assessment System (PPAS) evaluations of the AgencyÂs activities 
under all Major Programmes would be carried out. The Agency could therefore look forward 
with confidence to improved programme planning that was based on the needs and interests 
of Member States, more effective programme implementation carried out by an organization 
with a clearly defined mission and efficient management, and more comprehensive and 
in-depth evaluation of its programme results that would ensure continued improvement, 
constant adjustment and greater relevance of its work to those whom it served - the Member 
States. 
61. In meeting all the challenges that lay ahead, the Agency remained dependent on 
Member States to provide guidance and support and, above all, the required financial 
resources. However, a budget which had remained virtually static for over a decade and 
where 27 Member States had been in arrears that exceeded their financial contributions for 
more than two years meant that the Agency could not implement all its high-priority tasks. Its 
responsibilities were growing but its resources were not. It was imperative that there should 
be a correlation between tasks and resources if it was to continue meeting Member StatesÂ 
demands and fulfilling their expectations. 
62. With regard to the Technical Co-operation Fund (TCF), there was reason for both 
encouragement and concern. The TCF had had pledges for 1998 amounting to about 
US $53 million, just less than 75% of the target. Although that absolute amount was a record, 
the percentage of the target pledged was the fourth lowest of the decade. Altogether, 75 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 15 

countries had pledged support to the TCF for 1998. That was again a record, but it fell far 
short of the total membership. 

63. While great progress had been made in the world in the last fifty years, serious global 
challenges remained, in particular those of improving social and economic conditions over 
much of the globe where 1.3 billion people lived on less than one dollar per day, curbing the 
spread and eventually eliminating the threat of nuclear weapons from a world where some 
tens of thousands of warheads continued to exist, and stopping the degradation of the 
environment. The Agency had an important role to play in helping the world to meet those 
challenges, and it pledged to do its best, with the continued support of its members. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION FUND FOR 2000 
(GC(43)/25/Rev.1) 

64. The PRESIDENT said that since 1982 the AgencyÂs policy-making organs had 
observed a practice of recommending Indicative Planning Figures to serve in fixing annual 
targets for contributions to the TCF. Subsequent to agreement reached in 1998 on target 
figures for the following two years, the Board had recommended a target figure of $73 million 
for 2000. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the 
Secretariat in planning the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programmes, and he therefore 
urged delegations in a position to do so to notify the Secretariat during the Conference of the 
contributions which their governments would be making to the Fund in 2000. He would 
report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions which had 
been pledged up to that time. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 
(GC(43)/4) 

65. The PRESIDENT, announcing that there were already over 80 delegates on the 
speakersÂ list, said that, in order to avoid prolonged afternoon meetings or even a night 
session - the total cost of the latter being over $16 000 - he wished to propose under Rule 50 
of the Rules of Procedure that the duration of speeches be limited to 15 minutes. 
66. It was so agreed. 
67. Mr. TUOMIOJA (Finland), speaking on behalf of the European Union and the 
associated countries: Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, welcomed 
Angola and Honduras as new members of the Agency. 
68. During his first full year in office, the new Director General had launched several 
commendable initiatives aimed at improving the AgencyÂs overall effectiveness and 
efficiency which the European Union fully supported. In particular, it appreciated the 
introduction of the draft Medium Term Strategy based on the three pillars of technology, 
safety and verification. It welcomed the holistic approach to strategic planning with Agencywide 
prioritization as a key element. Since priorities varied considerably among Member 
States, dialogue on prioritization, notably in the Board of Governors, was crucial. The 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 16 

phasing-out of outdated or low-priority activities would enable financial and human resources 
to be allocated to high-priority activities hitherto funded from extrabudgetary resources or 
listed as unfunded regular programme activities. The European Union held the view that all 
statutory activities should be funded from the Regular Budget. 

69. The European Union attached great importance to ensuring the highest standards of 
technical competence in the Secretariat and called for a rigorous recruitment policy to that 
end. It noted with satisfaction that in recent years the Agency had paid greater attention to 
human resource management, including internal training programmes. 
70. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the basis 
for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. The European Union continued to support the 
AgencyÂs role in safeguarding nuclear material and facilities, especially within the framework 
of the NPT, and had actively promoted the universal conclusion of Additional Protocols. It 
called on all non-nuclear-weapon States to conclude and ratify comprehensive safeguards 
agreements with the Agency as well as Additional Protocols to them. Recalling resolution 
GC(42)/RES/17, it urged those States that had no comprehensive safeguards agreement to 
negotiate Additional Protocols with the Agency, as provided for in the foreword of the Model 
Protocol and, in that connection, welcomed CubaÂs decision to sign the Additional Protocol. 
71. Although the implementation of the strengthened safeguards system was a matter of the 
highest priority, the introduction of new measures should not simply be regarded as an 
addition to existing measures: the old and new systems had to be properly integrated to 
achieve the most effective use of resources and inspection effort. The principles underlying 
integrated safeguards - qualitative rather than quantitative verification - required a shift in the 
approach to safeguards, to which some resistance within the Secretariat was inevitable, but 
the European Union was convinced that the Director General, with the assistance of the new 
Deputy Director General for Safeguards, would provide the strong leadership required to 
bring about that change. 
72. The situation regarding the implementation of safeguards in the DPRK remained a 
matter of serious concern. In spite of the AgencyÂs efforts no progress had been made on any 
of the important issues since 1994. The DPRK was therefore urged to comply as soon as 
possible with its safeguards agreement and to co-operate fully with the Director General. 
73. For nine months now the Agency had not been able to implement its mandate in Iraq 
under the relevant Security Council resolutions and was thus unable to provide any assurance 
regarding IraqÂs compliance with its obligations thereunder. It was imperative that the 
AgencyÂs monitoring and verification activities in Iraq should be re-established without delay. 
74. Ensuring a high level of nuclear safety throughout the world was of paramount 
importance. To that end, safety aspects needed to be taken into account at the earliest stage of 
design of a nuclear facility. While the responsibility for the safe design, construction and 
operation of a nuclear installation rested with the State concerned, international co-operation 
was required to ensure that internationally accepted levels of nuclear safety were in place. 
Through its PHARE and TACIS programmes as well as bilateral activities, the European 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 17 

Union contributed to international efforts to help the States of Eastern and Central Europe and 
the Commonwealth of Independent States to improve their nuclear safety. Noteworthy 
advances had been achieved but much remained to be done, and indeed progress on nuclear 
safety was an essential factor in the UnionÂs ongoing process of enlargement. 

75. The first review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety had shown the 
Convention to be a valuable tool for assessing and improving nuclear safety. He stressed the 
need for the Contracting Parties to exercise greater openness and transparency, and looked 
forward to substantial progress being reported in future meetings in areas where a need for 
safety improvement had been identified. He hoped that the example of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and its review process would encourage the early signing and ratification of 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. 
76. The European Union supported the Senior Expert GroupÂs recommendation that, once 
the current standards programme was completed, the Agency should focus on 
implementation, analysis of results and the introduction of the necessary amendments. 
77. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts in helping operators and regulators to develop 
suitable Y2K-compliance programmes, and pledged the European UnionÂs continued support 
in that direction. 
78. The TC programme was strongly supported by the European Union, as borne out by the 
high level of voluntary contributions to the TCF by its Member States - approximately 30% of 
the total in 1998. However, the TC programme as a whole should be reappraised in the light 
of existing budgetary constraints and the AgencyÂs mandate, and also taking into account the 
comments of the External Auditor. The technical assistance provided by the Agency should 
be fully in line with national development programmes and it was primarily the responsibility 
of the recipient State to ensure that that was the case. In addition, a significant contribution to 
the cost of projects should be made by recipient States to demonstrate their commitment. The 
considerable shortfall in the assessed programme costs for 1998 was disappointing and he 
called on all recipient States to pay their share of the project costs on time and in full. 
Finally, there was a need for closer co-ordination between the Agency and other organizations 
on TC activities in a country with a view to achieving synergy and avoiding duplication of 
effort. 
79. The first step in combating illicit trafficking in nuclear materials was physical 
protection, and that was entirely the responsibility of individual States. The European Union 
supported the AgencyÂs activities under that head, including the revision of its 
recommendations, the provision of advice through the International Physical Protection 
Advisory Service, and the provision of guidelines and training. It welcomed the AgencyÂs 
efforts to strengthen those activities in accordance with resolutions GC(42)/RES/12 and 18 
and encouraged it to pursue its co-operation with the European Commission, the World 
Customs Organization and Interpol with a view to developing guides. 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 18 

80. Turning to the proposed amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, he 
commended the efforts of successive Board Chairmen to resolve the issue. Although the 
European Union did not favour enlargement of the Board, it was none the less prepared to 
join a consensus on a package of proposals covering enlargement of the Board, composition 
of area groups, and designation criteria. Following the recent inconclusive discussions in the 
Board, the European Union hoped that the General Conference would be able to finally settle 
the matter. 
81. The European Union considered it especially important for fissile material no longer 
required for defence purposes to be placed under an appropriate system of Agency safeguards 
and welcomed efforts aimed at setting up verification mechanisms and further measures 
envisaged under the trilateral initiative between the Russian Federation, the United States and 
the Agency. Special consideration should now be given to ways and means for financing 
such arrangements. The decision by a number of Member States to adopt a set of guidelines 
for the management of plutonium in all peaceful activities was also welcomed. 
82. For some time the European Union had steadfastly supported negotiations on a 
multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for 
nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and it stood ready to discuss a 
verification role for the Agency in that connection. 
83. Looking ahead to the 2000 NPT Review Conference, he said the European Union 
supported and promoted the implementation of both the NPT itself and the decisions of the 
1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, in particular the decision on Principles and 
Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament and the decision on Strengthening 
the Review Process for the Treaty. The successful outcome of the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference was vital to the common endeavour to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and accelerate nuclear disarmament. 
84. Mr. HAMÂÃK (Slovakia), having welcomed Angola and Honduras to the Agency, 
said that, with the 2000 NPT Review Conference just around the corner, the current measures 
aimed at strengthening the safeguards system were vital for the non-proliferation regime and 
noted with satisfaction that more than 40 Additional Protocols had so far been approved by 
the Board of Governors. In that regard, he announced that a new safeguards agreement 
between Slovakia and the Agency and an Additional Protocol had recently been approved by 
the Slovak Government and would be signed during the General Conference. He urged other 
Member States which had not already done so to speed up the process of concluding 
Additional Protocols. 
85. Another step towards global non-proliferation was the verification of weapon-origin 
fissile material and the verification of nuclear arms control and reduction measures. For 
credibilityÂs sake it was essential that such verification be carried out under Agency auspices 
and that measures relating to nuclear arms reduction and weapon-grade fissile material 
control should be irreversible. It was regrettable that the Conference on Disarmament had so 
far failed to produce a fissile material cut-off treaty. A more flexible and pragmatic approach 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 19 

in that forum would contribute to the successful outcome of negotiations and to the effective 
implementation of Article VI of the NPT. 

86. A further component of the non-proliferation regime was the Comprehensive NuclearTest-
Ban Treaty (CTBT). In view of the forthcoming CTBT Conference, and as one of the 
countries which had already ratified the Treaty, Slovakia called on all Member States to 
follow its example and thereby accelerate entry into force of the Treaty. 
87. Slovakia supported the AgencyÂs verification activities in the DPRK, being conducted 
under difficult circumstances. While some technical progress had been made in the past 
12 months, the fact that the DPRKÂs initial declaration could still not be verified was a matter 
of grave concern. 
88. In the light of resolution GC(42)/RES/3, Slovakia was concerned about IraqÂs decision 
to suspend its co-operation with the United Nations Security Council and the withdrawal of 
Agency inspectors from the country in December 1998, and it called on Iraq to comply with 
the relevant Security Council resolutions as well as the Memorandum of Understanding with 
the United Nations Secretary-General of February 1998. 
89. The Slovak Government attached high importance to the safety of nuclear installations 
and was in the process of updating its energy strategy plan. In the medium term, nuclear 
power would remain an important source of energy for Slovakia and the foremost prerequisite 
for its use was safety. The project for the gradual reconstruction of the Bohunice V-1 nuclear 
power plant was currently nearing completion and the second unit of the Mochovce plant 
would resume operation shortly following extensive safety upgrading. 
90. Slovakia had presented its national report and answered a host of questions at the 
review meeting of the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April 1999, earning praise for its 
safety improvement programmes. At the International Conference on Strengthening Nuclear 
Safety in Eastern Europe in Vienna in June the upgrading work carried out at the 
Bohunice V-1, Bohunice V-2 and Mochovce nuclear power plants was duly recognized in the 
Conference report. 
91. The Agency had a vital role to play in improving existing safety levels at nuclear power 
plants worldwide and its extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER and RBMK 
nuclear power plants had contributed greatly to the safety improvement activities in Slovakia. 
Those activities would be fully implemented by early in 2000. A safety analysis report on the 
Bohunice V-1 plant following its reconstruction would be submitted to SlovakiaÂs Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority and it was intended to invite an IAEA mission to the plant in 2000 to 
assess implementation of the AgencyÂs safety recommendations. 
92. With regard to the Y2K issue, he noted that pursuant to resolution GC(42)/RES/11 
Slovakia had launched its Project Year 2000. Slovak experts had actively participated in 
Agency activities relating to Y2K and an IAEA mission had visited the Bohunice V-1 plant. 
By the end of October the nuclear power plants should be fully Y2K compliant. Other 
organizations dealing with radiation sources and radioactive waste had also been encouraged 
to develop contingency plans. 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 20 

93. Slovakia attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, 
particularly in the field of nuclear safety. Slovakia was currently co-operating with the 
Agency on six national and more than twenty regional projects. The AgencyÂs services were 
an essential part of international co-operation and transparency and he wished to convey his 
GovernmentÂs thanks to the Director General and his staff for their efforts in that regard. 
94. Slovakia was not in favour of amendment of Article VI of the Statute but, with a view 
to finally resolving that long-standing issue, was willing to support a proposal which would 
both be acceptable to regional groups and reflect the interests of its own region. 
95. Mr. INABA (Japan) welcomed Angola and Honduras as new members of the 
Agency. 
96. Japan had been one of the first countries to sign the Additional Protocol, the Diet had 
approved its ratification in July and the Government was currently revising domestic 
legislation to suit. He urged all Member States of the Agency to sign Additional Protocols in 
order to strengthen the safeguards system. 
97. After the nuclear testing in 1998 Japan had organized the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, which had come up with 17 major proposals for the 
reduction of strategic nuclear weapons and the cessation of the state of readiness against 
them. He hoped that all countries would consider those proposals seriously. 
98. The conclusion of the FMCT would be another important step in the direction of 
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, and he urged the Conference on Disarmament in 
Geneva to press forward with negotiations. It was important that the AgencyÂs knowledge be 
fully utilized when considering verification systems under such a treaty. Japan would also 
endeavour to accelerate entry into force of the CTBT as President designate of the 
forthcoming CTBT Conference. 
99. It was very important that plutonium removed from dismantled nuclear weapons was 
not diverted for military purposes and was disposed of safely and quickly, and Japan looked 
forward to progress in the discussions between the United States, the Russian Federation and 
the Agency aimed at enabling the Agency to monitor surplus plutonium. Japan had offered to 
provide some $200 million to help countries of the former Soviet Union dismantle their 
nuclear weapons and dispose of the resultant plutonium. 
100. Japan was also helping to resolve the nuclear issue in the DPRK by supporting the lightwater 
reactor project being managed by KEDO. However, if the latter were to reach fruition, 
it was essential that the DPRK comply fully with its safeguards agreement. 
101. In the light of current financial constraints, Japan hoped that integrated safeguards could 
be introduced swiftly and the efficiency of inspections improved in order to ensure effective 
safeguards without the need for budget increases. He therefore urged that work on 
implementation of integrated safeguards be accelerated. 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 21 

102. International co-operation in efforts to improve nuclear safety was vital, and he 
welcomed the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety held in Vienna that year. Japan would continue to support improvements in safety in 
other countries, particularly in the former USSR and Central and Eastern Europe, where it had 
assisted with the training of operating staff and with the sarcophagus for the Chernobyl 
nuclear power reactor. It also supported the RCA, and the Japan Atomic Energy Commission 
was organizing the Forum for Nuclear Co-operation in Asia, whose aim was to promote the 
sound development and use of atomic energy in that region. In addition, personnel and 
financial support was provided to developing countries through the Technical Co-operation 
Fund. 
103. Although it appreciated the Director GeneralÂs efforts to manage the Agency efficiently 
under difficult financial conditions, Japan believed that a further effort should be made to 
achieve a zero-nominal-growth budget, and that the Agency should scrutinize its work to 
ensure that funds were used to support activities that were truly essential. It also strongly 
encouraged member countries to pay their assessed contributions in full and to make greater 
efforts to pay their share of the TCF. The long-standing issue of the amendment to Article VI 
of the Statute was now approaching its final stages, and he believed that agreement should be 
reached at the current Conference. 
104. On nuclear energy prospects, he noted that his country would be implementing the 
policy of Âbest mix energy apportionmentÂ with an appropriate role for nuclear energy, in 
order to realize the targets agreed in the Kyoto Protocol for reducing the emission of gases 
causing global warming. Since Japan had to import most of its energy resources, its policy 
was to operate the complete fuel cycle. Thus the Government, while making safety a 
prerequisite, was promoting private fuel reprocessing, the use of MOX fuel in light-water 
reactors, and research and development on fast breeder reactors. It had recently amended the 
existing law to ensure that spent fuel in excess of JapanÂs reprocessing capability was stored 
appropriately away from power stations until it could be reprocessed. 
105. The development and use of atomic energy in Japan would be strictly limited to 
peaceful uses, and Japan would continue to follow the principle of retaining no more 
plutonium than strictly necessary. Transparency in the use of plutonium was being further 
enhanced through the annual publication of management status reports and listing of amounts 
of plutonium stocked. Finally, Japan was currently working on the formulation of a new 
long-term programme for research, development and utilization of nuclear energy in the 
twenty-first century. 
106. In conclusion, he pledged JapanÂs continued active participation in the AgencyÂs 
programmes. 
107. Mr. Jung-Uck SEO (Republic of Korea) joined in welcoming Angola and 
Honduras to membership of the Agency. 
108. In an increasingly deregulated energy environment, the nuclear industry was faced with 
the twin challenges of economic competitiveness and public acceptance. It was encouraging 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 22 

to note that the rapid increase in energy demand, coupled with growing concern about the 
impact of greenhouse gases, was making nuclear power more of a practical option for largescale 
power generation. The AgencyÂs role was to point the direction of nuclear technology 
development and to assist its Member States to derive the maximum benefit from that 
technology. 

109. As nuclear safety was paramount, the AgencyÂs safety role should be further expanded 
with the development of an extensive nuclear safety regime, comprehensive safety standards, 
and technical co-operation programmes offering a wide range of safety services to Member 
States. The promotion of non-proliferation was equally important, and the Agency should 
strengthen safeguards by developing national or regional safeguards systems and introducing 
advanced surveillance and monitoring methods. 
110. Thanks in large measure to Agency support, the Republic of Korea was now capable of 
designing, building and operating nuclear power plants on its own. It now had fourteen units 
in full operation, providing over 40% of its total power supply, and six further units were 
under construction. Research and development programmes were under way aimed at 
producing safer, more reliable and more economical reactor fuels, which would in turn help to 
win wider public acceptance of nuclear power. Those programmes included the development 
of the System-integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART), destined for a desalination 
project under the AgencyÂs TC programme. 
111. Nuclear power had contributed to overcoming the recent economic crisis in his country 
by reducing imports of fossil fuel for electric power generation. The Republic of Korea was 
willing to share its experience in nuclear technology within the framework of the 
TC programme and was currently preparing a comprehensive series of training courses, 
including nuclear energy planning for developing countries. 
112. His country was participating actively in the international nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen its safeguards system. It had 
recently signed the Additional Protocol and was taking the necessary measures under its 
constitution to bring it into force. Also it would shortly be hosting the Regional Seminar for 
Asia and the Pacific on Safeguards for the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy. 
113. His Government was deeply concerned about continuing failure of the DPRK to comply 
with its safeguards agreement, and again called on it to fulfil its obligations. Welcoming the 
recent announcement that the DPRK would not carry out missile tests, the Republic of Korea 
now urged it to renounce its nuclear development programme and co-operate fully with the 
Agency. 
114. His delegation attached great importance to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute 
and hoped that the issue could be resolved without further delay to enable Board membership 
to better reflect world technological advancement. In particular, it was desirable that Member 
States designated for the Board should include those States with active nuclear programmes. 
115. He welcomed the outcome of the first review meeting of the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, and hoped that all Contracting Parties would continue to strive to fulfil the objectives 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 23 

of that Convention. He also looked forward to early entry into force of the Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. 

116. He was pleased to report that the Republic of Korea had completed tests to ensure 
Y2K readiness for all of its operating nuclear power plants. Being geographically one of the 
first countries to enter the year 2000, its experience in that respect would be valuable to other 
countries, and it would be happy to pass it on to the Agency as well as to the NEA. 
117. The 20th century had seen momentous scientific and technical developments but man 
would be the victim of modern technocracy unless he utilized technology rationally for the 
benefit of all mankind. It was therefore essential for all countries to pool their knowledge and 
resources to cope with the challenges of the 21st century 
118. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco), welcoming Angola and Honduras to membership, 
said that Morocco was playing its part in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy. As 
well as having been signatory to the NPT for three decades, it was now a signatory to the 
CTBT and to the Pelindaba Treaty, and had also signed a safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. In addition, it hoped to be signing an Additional Protocol in the near future. 
119. In the Middle East region, all Arab countries now subscribed to the NPT. It was a 
matter for concern that certain other countries still refused to become signatories and still 
refused to put their facilities under safeguards, in defiance of Security Council resolutions and 
in flagrant disregard of their obligations. The safeguards system would serve no purpose 
unless it covered all countries of the region. The general application of safeguards in the 
Middle East should be effected independently of the peace process and independently of the 
setting up of any demilitarized zone in the area. In that connection, he noted that the 
strengthened safeguards system offered a unique opportunity for the Agency to monitor 
whether a particular country was indeed fulfilling its obligations to use nuclear energy solely 
for peaceful purposes. 
120. Public opinion demanded that the Agency find solutions to all the problems involved in 
the area of nuclear safety, such as the transport of nuclear waste and illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials. There was thus need for a broad-based safety system, which kept pace with 
technological advances. It was not enough just to have regulatory instruments. Equal 
emphasis should be placed on the implementation of those instruments, and the developing 
countries should be given help with the training of personnel charged with implementing 
safety regulations. 
121. In order to achieve both sustainable development and nuclear safety, countries needed 
to put in place medium-term national plans which would ensure that nuclear energy served 
the needs of development. Morocco had called on the Agency to prepare an ÂAgenda 21Â for 
the nuclear industry, which would ensure that development problems were tackled in a way 
that preserved the environment. It would be choosing nuclear power as an energy option with 
a view to minimizing the release of greenhouse gases, as required under the Kyoto Protocol 
and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

GC(43)/OR.1 
page 24 

122. Nuclear technology was crucial in overcoming water and power shortages, which were 
major obstacles to development. With the help of the Agency, Morocco had signed an 
agreement with China to develop small and medium-sized reactors to provide power for 
desalination plants. 
123. The question of increasing the size of the Board of Governors continued to be of great 
concern to his delegation. It would be unacceptable to enter the new century with a Board 
that had remained unchanged for the past three decades, and he strongly supported the 
initiatives taken by the last three Board Chairmen to secure better representation for the 
developing countries. 
124. The changes needed in the coming century in order to achieve progress while at the 
same time safeguarding the environment would have to be made through joint action by all 
nations. The Agency, as a truly international body, was thus uniquely placed to oversee those 
changes. 
The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 
(GC(43)/4) 

1. Ms. MLAMBO-NGCUKA (South Africa), having congratulated Angola and 
Honduras on their admission to the Agency, emphasized that, as the new millennium 
approached, the Agency continued to play a pivotal role, not only in advancing the uses of 
Âatoms for peaceÂ, but also in strengthening non-proliferation to rid the world of weapons of 
mass destruction. South Africa was convinced that the Agency would be able to rise to the 
challenges ahead and welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts to enhance the effectiveness of 
the Secretariat and ensure that the Agency remained an example of cost-effectiveness and 
competence, meeting the needs of Member States and remaining alert to possible new 
dangers. In that connection, South Africa welcomed the Senior Expert GroupÂs report and 
recommendations and the Medium Term Strategy developed by the Director General on the 
basis of those recommendations. The Director GeneralÂs commitment to safety was also 
worthy of praise. 
2. Just as the Agency remained pivotal in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, South Africa, the only founding member of the Agency to have destroyed its nuclear 
weapons, remained steadfast in its commitment to the work of the Agency and the ideals 
enshrined in its Statute. Furthermore, it welcomed the new thematic approach introduced at 
the previous session of the General Conference through the Scientific Forum and intended to 
participate actively in the discussions which would be held there on nuclear power and 
sustainable development. 
3. In her countryÂs view, the fact that the President of the General Conference and the 
Director General of the Agency were from Africa attested to the role that Africa played in the 
promotion of global development. As a continent, Africa had shown an outstanding 
commitment to non-proliferation. Not only were all the African countries parties to the NPT, 
they were also firmly committed to the Pelindaba Treaty. As the new millennium approached, 
the partnership between the Agency and Africa assumed particular significance for the 
renaissance of the continent. South Africa therefore encouraged the Director General and the 
Agency to continue to work closely with African Member States to ensure that technical 
co-operation made a meaningful contribution to sustainable development. 
4. Turning to the Model Projects for technical co-operation, she said that South Africa was 
strongly committed to theoretical and practical training in the area of radiation protection and 
nuclear safety and supported the establishment, in co-operation with the Agency, of an 
African regional centre for radiation protection training in South Africa. The first 
postgraduate courses had begun at the Schonland Centre of the University of the 
Witwatersrand on 26 July 1999, with the participation of graduates from several African 
countries. While South Africa appreciated the extensive assistance provided by the Agency 
in establishing that training centre, it joined other African countries in hoping that the 
Secretariat would take further initiatives to enhance the role of regional training centres. 
5. With regard to South Africa itself, she expressed her delegationÂs deep appreciation to 
the Agency for its support in the area of technical co-operation and welcomed the fact that 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 4 

technical co-operation projects in South Africa had increased significantly as a result of a 
number of successful project proposals for the 1999-2000 cycle. The establishment of a 
Country Programme Framework for South Africa was almost complete and should further the 
implementation of technical co-operation projects of vital importance to the country. 

6. Co-operation between the Agency and South Africa in the area of isotope hydrology, in 
particular through the Schonland Research Centre in Johannesburg, dated back to the 
early 1960s and the signing of the first research contract for the development of isotope 
enrichment techniques. In the following decades, other joint initiatives had been undertaken 
to further the application of isotope techniques to water problems, and South Africa had 
contributed regularly to the AgencyÂs four-yearly isotope hydrology symposia, particularly on 
the subject of arid zone problems. The most ambitious joint initiative by the Agency and 
South Africa in recent years in that area was the southern and eastern African regional Model 
Project on sustainable development of water resources, which brought together seven 
countries and fostered cross-continental co-operation and networking. The Johannesburg 
group had been designated as the regional centre for the project and was providing analytical, 
training and scientific support. The Agency was currently modernizing the centre to meet the 
increase in demand, and her delegation was deeply grateful to the Agency for its efforts in 
that regard. 
7. South Africa was pleased to announce that the work to develop the pebble-bed modular 
reactor had advanced over the previous year. As that technology was not in commercial use 
anywhere in the world, the Agency had been requested to investigate and advise on the 
technical and economic feasibility, safety and proliferation aspects of the reactor. The study 
was already in progress, and several meetings had taken place in South Africa and at the 
AgencyÂs Headquarters. It was expected that the final report would be submitted to the South 
African Government in early 2000; the Government could then take a decision and enlist 
popular support with a view to achieving the necessary national consensus on the project. 
South Africa noted the international interest and enthusiasm which the project had aroused 
and was grateful to the Agency for sharing the cost of the study with South Africa under the 
technical co-operation programme. 
8. With regard to the funding of technical co-operation in general, South Africa was 
pleased to note that new donors had emerged. Their contributions brought closer the 
achievement of one of the principles and objectives of the indefinitely extended NPT, namely 
that technical co-operation funding should be predictable and assured. After thanking the 
countries that had contributed regularly to the TCF and urging them to continue to do so, she 
called upon all Member States to pledge and pay their dues on time. For its part, South Africa 
would be pledging its full share of the target for the year 2000. 
9. South Africa was fully committed to the principles and objectives of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. It was currently addressing the issue of radioactive waste management in terms 
of legislation and strategy and should be ratifying the Joint Convention in the second half 
of 2000. The Agency should continue to help African States fulfil their obligations and 
derive benefit from the conventions on safety. South Africa also welcomed the AgencyÂs 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 5 

activities to identify and evaluate systematically the problems associated with the transition to 
the year 2000, particularly its role in co-ordinating the exchange of information among 
Member States. 

10. With regard to safeguards and verification, she noted that South Africa had participated 
actively in the conclusion of the Model Protocol additional to safeguards agreements. Her 
country, which would be chairing the NPT Review Conference in 2000, considered that the 
Agency had a key role to play in achieving the objectives of the Treaty. It shared the view of 
many countries, particularly the developing countries, that substantial progress needed to be 
made in the area of disarmament. The NPT had never meant that a small number of States 
could possess nuclear weapons indefinitely. 
11. South Africa welcomed the resumption of trilateral negotiations between the Agency, 
the United States and the Russian Federation on the dismantling of nuclear warheads in the 
Russian Federation. New responsibilities would undoubtedly fall to the Agency as a result of 
those negotiations, and the funds required would have to be provided collectively. 
South Africa would participate with interest in the discussions on the issue in the Board of 
Governors. 
12. Lastly, with regard to funding, she said that South Africa was concerned about the 
attempts by certain Member States to limit the budget of the Agency by applying the principle 
of zero nominal growth. The Agency could not be expected to meet new challenges if it faced 
such serious impediments. South Africa therefore urged the countries in question to meet 
their obligations and ensure that the Agency had adequate resources. 
13. Mr. RICHARDSON (United States of America) read out the following message 
from Mr. Bill Clinton, President of the United States: 
ÂAt the threshold of a new millennium, we still face many dangers, but the world is a 
safer place thanks to the work of the IAEA. The twentieth century witnessed the 
development of an awesome source of energy. Fortunately, the IAEA exists to help 
secure the peaceful uses of nuclear energy while combating the spread of nuclear 
weapons. As the inspection arm of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, a promoter of peaceful 
nuclear applications and safety, and provider of technical assistance, the IAEA 
contributes every day to international security and human betterment. 

ÂLooking ahead, the IAEA can help advance new priorities, such as strengthening the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and gaining full 
implementation of the strengthened safeguards system. The IAEA can also play a role 
in helping to prevent a return of the nuclear arms race by verifying materials declared 
excess to defence needs in the nuclear-weapon States and the proposed fissile material 
cut-off treaty. Together with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, these 
initiatives will further reduce the roles and risks of nuclear weapons, and ultimately 
eliminate them. The IAEA is essential to these efforts. I challenge this Agency to 
maintain and to raise the standard of excellence it has set for more than forty years.Â

14. The Âawesome source of energyÂ to which President Clinton had referred brought 
extraordinary responsibilities. The situation had changed dramatically since the beginning of 
the nuclear era. Who could have predicted the sheer scale of the arms race during the Cold 
War, or its sudden end? Who could have imagined the superpowers awash with surplus 
nuclear materials, or engaged in a new race to reduce their nuclear stockpiles? In order to 
meet the new challenges, a new agenda was required, resting on four pillars: preservation of 
the NPT regime, control of nuclear materials, promotion of the safe use of nuclear power, and 
management of the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
15. Firstly, in order to reduce nuclear risks, steps should be taken to preserve the NPT and 
ensure that the Review Conference in 2000 made a fair and balanced analysis that 
strengthened all the TreatyÂs elements. The United States was as firmly committed as ever to 
meeting the objectives of the NPT, including nuclear disarmament. It was working with 
Russia on progressive and systematic reductions in nuclear forces both within the START 
framework and through unilateral actions, and it hoped that START II would enter into force 
shortly so as to allow a quick move forward to START III which, for the first time, would 
include the elimination of warheads in the arms control process. 
16. The United States had considerably reduced its nuclear forces pushing dismantlement 
capacity to the limit. Since 1993, when START II had been signed, it had dismantled 
over 7000 nuclear weapons. Over the last decade, more than 13 000 nuclear weapons had 
been eliminated from the stockpile, almost 50% of the countryÂs Cold War peak. The 
United States was also in the process of transforming the infrastructures for nuclear-weapons 
production: the Department of Energy had recently closed, or was converting to commercial 
use, four nuclear-weapons production facilities, and it had reduced the nuclear workforce by 
one third. 
17. The Russian nuclear-weapons arsenal was also being reduced, but in the face of difficult 
economic and social conditions. During the previous session of the General Conference, he 
and Mr. Adamov, the Russian Minister for Atomic Energy, had launched the Nuclear Cities 
Initiative, which was already bearing fruit: he would be opening a new computer centre to 
serve as a magnet for commercial software development in Sarov later in the week; the 
process of converting weapons facilities and creating jobs in Sarov and Snezhinsk was being 
accelerated; and a new international business centre would be opening shortly in 
Zheleznogorsk to promote local commerce and links with industry. 
18. The United States had contributed with other countries to achieving one of the most 
difficult arms control objectives, namely the conclusion of a Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty. He was working with President Clinton to get the Treaty ratified as soon as 
possible by the United States Senate. 
19. The conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty was his GovernmentÂs next 
multilateral priority. He hoped that such a treaty would be concluded as soon as possible and 
urged all States that had not yet done so to declare a halt to the further production of fissile 
material for nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the United States could not stand by when States 
such as Iraq and the DPRK violated their obligations under the NPT and the AgencyÂs 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 7 

safeguards system. In Iraq, Agency and UNSCOM inspectors must be permitted to resume 
their operations immediately as provided for by United Nations Security Council 
resolution 687. As to the DPRK, the United States was continuing to demand the complete 
accounting of that countryÂs past nuclear activities, consistent with the requirements set forth 
in the Agreed Framework between the United States and the DPRK. There was no 
alternative. 

20. The second pillar for a safer world was the control and protection of nuclear materials. 
The end of the Cold War had revealed new dangers, including vast quantities of nuclear 
materials surplus to military needs and vulnerable to theft. The objective was to secure, 
consolidate, monitor and dispose of such materials. As part of the Trilateral Initiative, the 
United States and the Russian Federation would be submitting large stocks of fissile material 
to international verification, thus confirming their mutual pledges never again to use those 
materials for the production of nuclear weapons. For his country, completing the Trilateral 
Initiative was one of the highest priorities for the following year, and it would be making 
additional funds available to achieve that goal. However, the Initiative served global ends, 
and the AgencyÂs verification activities should therefore be financed by the international 
community. Surplus nuclear materials needed to be secured through ultimate disposition, and 
he hoped that the United States and Russia would shortly be taking a huge step towards that 
goal by signing a bilateral agreement establishing a schedule for the disposition of more 
than 60 t of plutonium removed from the military programmes of the two countries. The 
Agency would have a role to play in verifying the application of the agreement. The United 
States had invested US $200 million to assist Russia in that programme, but additional 
support from all Member States was required. 
21. Other nuclear material was also being controlled. By the end of the year, more than 80 t 
of highly enriched uranium, an amount sufficient to produce more than 3000 nuclear bombs, 
would have been eliminated under the purchase agreement for highly enriched uranium 
between the United States and Russia. In co-operation with Russia, the United States would 
also have improved the security of a further 50 t of highly enriched uranium and plutonium 
within the framework of the joint material protection, control and accounting initiative. 
22. The United States was also prepared to work with Russia and the Agency to manage 
and dispose of highly enriched uranium of Russian origin remaining in research reactors in a 
number of countries; an initial meeting of the States concerned would be held at the Agency 
in 1999 to consider that issue. 
23. There was still much to be done in the United States itself. The Department of Energy 
was currently reducing the number of sites storing surplus plutonium and highly enriched 
uranium. It was expected that the site receiving much of the plutonium - the new K-Area 
storage facility at the Savannah River Site - would be ready for Agency safeguards by 
mid-2000. 
24. Finally, it was important to focus also on the challenges of the future in the area of 
nuclear materials, and in that connection he welcomed the decision by the Board of 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 8 

Governors to authorize the Agency to monitor the separation of neptunium and americium in 
non-nuclear-weapon States. 

25. Making the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy available worldwide was a 
priority, and the United States, as a strong supporter of the Agency, had contributed 
$18 million to the TCF in 1999. However, those benefits must be provided in an environment 
that was conducive to safety; that was why safety was the third pillar of the nuclear future. 
The United States had ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety earlier in 1999, and would 
soon be ratifying the related Conventions on civil liability and on safe spent fuel and 
radioactive waste management to help pave the way for a more secure future. 
26. Although the potential of nuclear power as a clean source of energy was well known, 
steps needed to be taken to preserve its viability in the future. In order to meet that challenge, 
the United States Department of Energy had in 1998 launched a nuclear energy research 
initiative to utilize the expertise of the Government, industry and universities for the 
development of technologies that were safe, created less waste and were more 
proliferation-resistant than those currently in use. Research and development programmes 
should shortly enable nuclear reactors to be made more efficient and economical and allow 
nuclear waste to be reduced through the use of accelerators. 
27. The United States wanted to work together with the other members of the Agency to 
achieve those objectives. However, the past - the accidents at Chernobyl and at Three Mile 
Island in the United States - should not be forgotten. The Agency had a leading role in 
improving the safety of older reactors throughout the world, and his country pledged to meet 
its commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding between the G-7 and Ukraine to 
close Chernobyl permanently by the year 2000 at the latest. The United States and other 
countries were continuing their assistance to Ukraine, and he urged other Member States of 
the Agency to become involved in that vital mission. 
28. The United States welcomed the AgencyÂs workshops, field missions and guidance 
documents designed to prepare nuclear facilities throughout the world for the transition to the 
year 2000. Facilities needed to be completely ready. Where problems could not be resolved, 
contingency plans should be developed to prepare plant operators and regulators. 
29. He shared the Director GeneralÂs view that it was important to remain vigilant against 
public health risks arising from poorly stored or unprotected radiation sources that had 
become ÂorphanedÂ. The United States would be providing the Agency with a cost-free 
expert to assist in implementing the action plan to identify and remove those insidious and 
threatening nuclear hazards. 
30. The fourth pillar of the nuclear agenda should be the management of the worldÂs 
growing inventory of civil spent fuel and separated plutonium. More civil plutonium was 
being separated than was being recycled in conventional power reactors, more than 200 t of 
separated civil plutonium - all usable to make nuclear devices - was being stored around the 
world, with the quantity increasing each year, and the maximum global capacity for the 
storage of spent civil fuel had almost been reached. As the stocks of civil spent fuel and 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 9 

plutonium rose, so did the risks of proliferation. A unified vision was required to manage that 
Âback endÂ of nuclear power production. 

31. First, States should co-operate to ensure that adequate spent fuel storage capacity was 
available to obviate the need for reprocessing. The question whether consolidated, 
international storage of spent fuel and plutonium was possible should be studied. 
32. Secondly, it was important to achieve the objective set out in the international 
Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium, namely to balance civil plutonium supply and 
demand. To that end, the United States would maintain its current policy of not encouraging 
the use of civil plutonium, but at the same time not altering its existing commitments in that 
area. Those countries which had not yet decided how to manage their spent fuel the United 
States would urge to consider long-term storage and direct disposal as a means of dealing 
with the accumulation of such stocks. 
33. Thirdly, long-term strategies for reducing existing stocks of already separated civil 
plutonium should be explored. The burning of plutonium in mixed oxide fuel reactors was 
one alternative. Immobilization and direct geological disposal was another. The United 
States was working to develop the latter approach and was prepared to share the results of its 
efforts. In that connection, he suggested that a special international meeting should be held 
in 2000 to review the status of that technology and to set an agenda for future research. The 
Department of Energy would be holding an international conference on geologic repositories 
in Denver, Colorado, in the coming October - an event he had announced during the previous 
session of the General Conference which should give new impetus to discussions on the safe, 
secure and transparent disposal of spent fuel and nuclear waste. 
34. In conclusion, he said that although the responsibilities to be borne were enormous, 
there were extensive opportunities ahead which the international community should grasp for 
the benefit of future generations. 
35. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), after welcoming Honduras and 
Angola and briefly reviewing the global energy situation, considered how the challenges of 
the twenty-first century could best be met. Firstly, it would be necessary to strike a 
commercially sound balance among the various energy sources, taking into account their costeffectiveness, 
with a view to facilitating the transfer of technology to developing countries; 
that endeavour should make use of synergies among the various competent organizations and 
should aim to achieve sustainable development. Secondly, the various aspects of 
ÂglobalizationÂ would have to be regulated to ensure maximum participation of all States 
through the systematic development of the component elements of the global economy, such 
as free capital flows, trade in energy and energy consumption. Thirdly, the Agency should 
make greater efforts to foster the use of nuclear energy, particularly in developing countries, 
by establishing special international funding, and it should play a greater role in controlling 
the greenhouse effect within the Clean Development Mechanism framework of the Kyoto 
Protocol. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 10 

36. Even if some States, in response to adverse public opinion, were relying less on nuclear 
power, that should not prevent the Agency from helping to develop the technical capacities of 
other countries in accordance with Article IV of the NPT. That Treaty was based on three 
pillars - non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful use - in all of which areas deficiencies 
were evident. A determined pursuit of negotiations on global nuclear disarmament and the 
initiation of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty, universality, and the application 
of comprehensive Agency safeguards to IsraelÂs nuclear facilities might help to overcome 
those deficiencies. In addition, strict surveillance of the Middle East as a nuclear-weaponfree 
zone and, above all, the assurance of non-discriminatory access to peaceful nuclear 
technology would be necessary. In that context, the Agency should place greater emphasis on 
its role - confirmed in 1995 - as the competent authority responsible for verifying compliance 
with treaty obligations. In the meantime, the Nuclear Suppliers Group continued to assume 
the role of a control body behind the scenes. In accordance with the decisions taken in 1995, 
that Group should strive for transparency and open its doors to interested States. Its control 
of exports should not prevent States Party to the NPT from exercising their right to develop a 
peaceful nuclear capability, otherwise developing countries would continue their strong 
opposition to its activities. The Zangger Committee also should become more open in order 
to maintain its credibility among the States Party to the NPT. 
37. Turning to illicit trafficking in nuclear material and the dumping of waste, he expressed 
concern about the lack of control over the distribution of radioactive sources and urged the 
Agency to pay due regard to the unconfirmed but alarming reports about nuclear waste being 
dumped in the Caspian Sea. 
38. As to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, the reason why the matter had not yet been 
settled was that a political dimension was being given to an issue that was essentially 
administrative and legal. The initiatives and proposals to resolve the problem of the 
composition of regional groups would not succeed unless they took full account of the views 
of the States concerned and gained a consensus among them. 
39. Measures related to neptunium and americium, as well as the application of safeguards 
to fissile material from dismantled nuclear weapons, should not place an additional burden on 
the AgencyÂs promotional budget. The Agency needed to arrive at a judicious balance 
between its promotional and verification activities. 
40. He welcomed the links established with the Agency for the implementation of the 
national peaceful nuclear programme, particularly with the Department of Technical 
Co-operation in the areas of medicine, agriculture, industry and safety. His country was ready 
to coÂoperate in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy with other States in the region through 
the transfer of technology or the export of nuclear material in order to achieve one of the 
AgencyÂs main objectives, namely the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear techniques in 
developing Member States. 
41. Mr. PLACHKOV (Ukraine) said that the year that had elapsed since the preceding 
session of the General Conference had been crowded with important events: the first meeting 
to review national reports under the Convention on Nuclear Safety had taken place, and the 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 11 

process of ratification by Member States of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend 
the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage was continuing. All those instruments 
had laid the foundations for an international legal system aimed at ensuring the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy. 

42. The efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime were also worthy of 
mention, in particular the fact that over 40 States had signed Protocols additional to their 
safeguards agreements. For its part, Ukraine also had a strong desire to contribute to the 
strengthening of the safeguards system and had initiated negotiations with a view to signing a 
Protocol additional to its safeguards agreement, which it hoped to do during the current year. 
43. Noting the work on a revision of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material, he said that one of the most important aspects of nuclear non-proliferation was the 
development of effective measures to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other 
radioactive sources. Ukraine was counting on the AgencyÂs assistance with the 
implementation of a national programme in that area, and it supported unreservedly the 
AgencyÂs plan to elaborate practical measures to ensure the safety of radiation sources and the 
security of radioactive material. 
44. Ukraine shared the international communityÂs view that the problems of nuclear and 
radiation safety continued to be of pressing importance. It noted with great satisfaction the 
SecretariatÂs initiatives to evaluate the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear power plants still in 
operation in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A conference held in June 1999 had 
shown that considerable efforts had been made to improve the safety of those facilities and 
bring them to the same standard as plants in Western Europe, the United States and Japan. 
Ukraine too was making an active effort to improve significantly the safety of its plants and 
research reactors, whether in operation or under construction. 
45. Over the past year, several laws had been adopted in the first reading by the Ukrainian 
Parliament on licensing of the use of nuclear energy, physical protection of nuclear material 
and facilities, and nuclear and radiation safety regulatory bodies. Moreover, a national 
nuclear regulatory office had been set up and had started operations, which bore witness to 
the strong interest the public authorities had in that issue. 
46. The safety of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which was a source of constant 
concern to both Ukraine and the international community, had been the subject of a 
Memorandum of Understanding, signed in Ottawa on 20 December 1995, relating to the 
closure of the Chernobyl complex. Despite UkraineÂs current energy crisis, the difficult 
decision to close two units at the Chernobyl plant had been taken and implemented. The 
unloading of the nuclear fuel from the reactor in Unit 1 had now started, after completion of 
the same operation in Unit 2. Negotiations were in progress with the EBRD and EURATOM 
regarding the construction of new units at the Khmelnitski and Rovno plants. No decision 
would be taken on the final closure of the Chernobyl plant until an agreement had been 
concluded on that matter. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 12 

47. The Ukrainian authorities also attached special importance to the project on the Shelter 
that had been constructed over the remains of Unit 4 at Chernobyl after the accident in 1986. 
The project aimed at making the Shelter environmentally safe with the assistance of the 
international community, which had assigned funds pursuant to the donor conference 
organized in New York. Unfortunately, those funds were insufficient to complete the project. 
Redoubled efforts were required from the international community to resolve the pressing 
problem of replenishing the fund for the Chernobyl Shelter. The Ukrainian Government, 
which was abiding by the commitments it had undertaken under the Memorandum of 
Understanding, was concerned that the search for the funds required to carry out all the 
activities envisaged by that Memorandum was far from yielding the desired results. It 
therefore welcomed the decision taken at the Cologne summit to convene a second donor 
conference by the summer of 2000, and appealed to all Member States of the Agency to 
support that important initiative. 
48. The Ukrainian Government approved of the AgencyÂs activities aimed at creating a 
global civil liability regime for nuclear damage, and fully endorsed the principles underlying 
it. In the very near future, the Ukrainian Parliament would be adopting a draft law on 
UkraineÂs adhesion to the Joint Protocol Relating to the Application of the Vienna 
Convention and the Paris Convention. 
49. His country was deeply appreciative of the AgencyÂs efforts to solve the year 2000 
computer problem. With the help of experts from the Agency and the international 
community, the Ukrainian authorities had begun to take preventive measures in all the 
countryÂs nuclear power plants. 
50. His delegation also greatly appreciated the co-ordinating role the Agency played in the 
field of technical co-operation, and welcomed the expansion of such activities in Ukraine. 
In 1999, a new biennial programming cycle had started which included 13 projects of major 
importance for Ukraine. In addition, Ukrainian organizations were becoming more actively 
involved in regional technical co-operation projects. 
51. Ukraine approved the AgencyÂs budget for the year 2000. Owing to the economic 
difficulties it was experiencing, it had unfortunately not been able to pay its assessed 
contribution in full, but it was doing everything in its power to clear its arrears and was 
planning to contribute approximately $145 000 to the TCF for 2000. 
52. In conclusion, he welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency and approved the 
Annual Report for 1998. 
53. Ms. FERRERO-WALDNER (Austria), after welcoming the participants to 
Vienna, associated herself fully with the statement which had been made by the delegate of 
Finland on behalf of the European Union and said she wished to address two central issues. 
54. The first, safeguards, constituted a precondition for international co-operation in the 
field of nuclear technology, and Austria welcomed the conclusion of 41 Additional Protocols 
and urged all States which had not yet done so to sign a Protocol. The second issue, nuclear 
safety, could no longer be viewed from a purely national standpoint given the high risks of 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 13 

nuclear facilities. Her delegation therefore welcomed the international attention which was 
being given to certain aspects of safety, while remaining convinced that the risks of nuclear 
energy were such that they could not be acceptably contained. It also felt that the 
international conventions dealing with nuclear liability were far from satisfactory and that the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage had failed to attract 
sufficient support. 

55. However, Austria respected the different view of other countries and would continue to 
collaborate with a view to securing maximum levels of safety in all types of facilities. In that 
context, she urged all States which had not yet done so to adhere to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and expressed the hope that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management would soon enter into 
force. Austria had already signed that instrument and would be ratifying it in early 2000. Her 
country was also determined that nuclear safety should be viewed as a key element in future 
negotiations on enlargement of the European Union. 
56. Turning to the issue of research reactors, she said that after the commendable work 
which had been done, it was time to embark on the elaboration of an instrument on the safety 
of facilities of that kind, which would be applicable to a great number of countries, including 
those that did not have nuclear power plants such as Austria. 
57. The Medium Term Strategy contained some interesting thoughts, but it also raised the 
problem of defining the future role of the Agency which, in AustriaÂs view, should lie more in 
the safety and safeguards fields than in the active promotion of nuclear energy. 
58. The Agency had a particularly important role to play in the field of nuclear disarmament 
and arms control. In addition to building an integrated safeguards system, it was being called 
upon to provide new services in the nuclear disarmament area. Further reduction of existing 
nuclear arsenals would necessitate limitation and control of access to fissile material. 
Moreover, once a fissile material cut-off treaty had been concluded, the Agency would be 
well placed to act as a central verification body. 
59. All those new tasks would put an additional burden on the organizationÂs budget. In 
that connection, Austria fully supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to review all the 
AgencyÂs programmes for possible savings which could be used for operational activities, 
within the framework of a zero real growth budget. However, that would not be sufficient to 
solve the problem in the long term; rather, it would need to be tackled on a political level, 
possibly by establishing a special fund for Agency activities in the arms control and 
disarmament field. 
60. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China), addressing the issue of the promotion of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, welcomed in particular the AgencyÂs efforts to remedy water 
shortage problems, which had been yielding encouraging progress for ten years, and 
expressed the hope that those activities would continue. He also paid tribute to the AgencyÂs 
work on enhancing the safety of nuclear energy and in the verification field. In that 
connection, he pointed out that China had signed a Protocol additional to its voluntary-offer 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 14 

safeguards agreement in 1998. He also commended the Director GeneralÂs efforts to improve 
and reform internal management and planning in the Secretariat, which should help promote 
its efficiency. 

61. Reviewing activities in China in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, he 
noted that the Agency had carried out ad hoc inspections at the Shaanxi uranium enrichment 
plant and added that the Chinese Government was ready to work with the Agency to conclude 
swiftly the negotiations on the facility attachment for that plant. 
62. With regard to the role the Agency might play in the twenty-first century, he 
commended the Director General on having initiated the essential process of review and 
evaluation by setting up the Senior Expert Group, whose conclusions his delegation fully 
supported. 
63. It was important to maintain a balance between the promotion of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy and safeguards. The views of some Member States on the work programme 
and the distribution of resources, which had resulted in a certain weakening of promotional 
activities, were entirely understandable. Indeed, the growing tendency in recent years to 
make the Agency mainly a tool for verification was a cause for concern. Some seemed to 
regard promotional activities as dispensable. That was not the view of China, which hoped 
that the Agency would preserve the indispensable complementarity of its statutory functions 
and would therefore not hamper the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in 
developing countries in the name of preventing nuclear proliferation. In that connection, he 
urged all Member States to honour their obligations with regard to technical assistance and, in 
particular, the TCF. China, for its part, intended to pay its contribution to the Fund in full and 
on time. 
64. Turning to the draft Medium Term Strategy, he said that the document did not give due 
attention to the issue of nuclear power development. Despite the Senior Expert GroupÂs 
advice, the strategy contained nothing specific about the development of advanced reactors. 
For various reasons, some regions were in a favourable position as regards nuclear power 
development. China believed that nuclear power had made a major contribution to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and that the Agency, as the sole intergovernmental 
organization in the nuclear energy field, should therefore support the development of that 
energy source and its applications. 
65. With regard to neptunium and americium, Chinese experts had attended the meetings on 
that issue organized by the Secretariat. China did not contest the view that separated 
neptunium constituted a proliferation risk and should be subject to international monitoring as 
it could be used to manufacture explosive devices. Conversely, it felt there was no need to 
devote resources to monitoring of americium, where there was hardly any proliferation risk. 
Nevertheless, it had taken note of the concerns of other countries and, in a spirit of 
co-operation, had agreed to report to the Agency its exports of separated neptunium and 
americium to non-nuclear-weapon States. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 15 

66. With reference to the nuclear arms control and reduction verification fund, he said that, 
since the verification of surplus fissile material in the United States and Russia was based on 
voluntary-offer agreements between the Agency and those countries, the verification activities 
involved should be funded from the safeguards budget. Whether or not the Agency should 
take on real verification activities under other international treaties, and cover the necessary 
related expenses, would be decided during the negotiation of the treaties in question. 
67. In conclusion, nuclear weapons had not been eliminated with the end of the Cold War. 
The nuclear disarmament process initiated by the United States and Russia was again at an 
impasse after achieving limited progress. Some countries had still not joined the CTBT and 
clung to their nuclear-weapon development plans. Though the universality of the NPT had 
improved remarkably in recent years, the international community was still faced with serious 
challenges and should continue to urge countries to take practical measures to ease regional 
tensions and to accede to the CTBT and the NPT, both in their own interest and for the sake 
of global peace and security. 
68. Mr. SERRI (Italy) welcomed Angola and Honduras and endorsed the statement 
by the delegate of Finland on behalf of the European Union. His Government had always 
supported the activities of the Agency, which made a remarkable contribution to the 
economic prosperity of many countries and, through its verification activities, to the 
establishment of peace in the world. Despite its difficult budgetary situation, Italy had 
decided once again to make a substantial contribution to the TCF in order to support the 
AgencyÂs activities. 
69. Like many other States, Italy regarded the Agency as a model international organization 
and welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to improve programme delivery through the 
implementation of an action plan for the internal management of the Secretariat. Italy would 
pay even greater attention to the recruitment policy in future so as to be sure that developing 
countries and other under-represented countries were properly represented in the Secretariat, 
particularly at the senior levels. 
70. There were a number of areas to which Italy attached particular importance: the new 
safeguards measures, nuclear power plant safety, the safe management of radioactive waste 
and spent fuel, the safety of irradiated nuclear fuel, the decommissioning of facilities and the 
optimum use of spin-offs from nuclear energy in the field of technical coÂoperation. 
71. The Agency would be entrusted with challenging new tasks and the Board of Governors 
would be called upon in the near future to discuss difficult questions such as the reduction of 
fissile material quantities and nuclear stockpiles and new verification activities that could 
stem from a cut-off treaty: Italy would support all initiatives taken by the Agency in those 
areas. 
72. Every effort had to be made to prevent nuclear science and technology from being 
misused in ways which could pose a threat to mankind. Italy had worked within the European 
Union to reach a consensus on the Protocol additional to safeguards agreements, which had 
been signed in September 1998. He urged countries not belonging to the European Union to 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 16 

sign similar additional Protocols as soon as possible and he was confident that, in the 
discussions on the AgencyÂs next two-year budget cycle, the major programme on safeguards 
would receive the necessary support of Member States to ensure that the effectiveness of the 
safeguards system was not jeopardized. 

73. The international community remained concerned about the safety of the former Soviet 
UnionÂs old nuclear power plants and of nuclear waste disposal, and it was to be hoped that 
all Member States would provide the necessary technical and financial support to resolve 
those problems. As had been pointed out by the delegate of Finland, the European Union was 
providing substantial financial support to the countries of Eastern and Central Europe to 
enable them to improve their nuclear safety. 
74. At the national level, Italy had decided in 1990 to close all its nuclear power plants and 
abandon nuclear power as an energy option, while maintaining its expertise in the nuclear 
field, mainly with a view to participating in international activities. That policy was reflected 
by the active and effective participation of Italian organizations in international programmes 
aimed at enhancing the nuclear safety of reactors in Eastern European countries. In order to 
continue in that direction, international coÂoperation, especially with the Agency, was of 
paramount importance. In that connection, Italy was particularly interested in the AgencyÂs 
efforts in the field of spent fuel management and the handling, processing, storage and 
disposal of radioactive waste, especially the idea of establishing multinational waste 
repositories. 
75. Lastly, with respect to the issue of amending Article VI of the Statute, he said that Italy 
remained convinced that any change in the size and composition of the Board of Governors 
should be evaluated carefully. In 1998, the European Union had joined the consensus on the 
proposal submitted by the then Chairman of the Board, Mr. Ikeda. That proposal had 
comprised three elements which were of equal importance, though the criteria for the 
designation of Board members were particularly necessary to strengthen the AgencyÂs 
non-proliferation role. 
76. Mr. HÃGBERG (Sweden), having welcomed Angola and Honduras, associated 
himself with the statement made by the delegate of Finland on behalf of the European Union. 
Sweden and its partners would reiterate their call to the international community - already 
made at the United Nations General Assembly - to establish a new agenda for nuclear 
disarmament. The NPT Review Conference in 2000 should provide much-needed impetus for 
the interrelated objectives of non-proliferation and disarmament. 
77. The nuclear weapons tests in South Asia in 1998 had been a serious setback to the 
hopes for a world without nuclear weapons. Urging India and Pakistan once again to 
renounce their nuclear weapons ambitions, he expressed the hope that those States would 
soon resume bilateral dialogue and take the measures foreseen in the Lahore Declaration and 
Security Council resolution 1172 (1998). They and all other States which had not done so 
should accede to the NPT and the CTBT without delay. As to the five nuclear-weapon States, 
they should not forget that they had a commitment to work towards nuclear disarmament. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 17 

78. The strengthened safeguards system was an essential tool for making the international 
nuclear nonÂproliferation regime more robust and credible. The development and 
implementation of that new integrated approach was of the highest priority for Sweden, which 
provided specific assistance to the Secretariat in that area. 
79. Sweden felt that the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management 
should constitute the cornerstones of the international nuclear safety regime and urged all 
Member States which had not yet done so to accede as soon as possible to those Conventions. 
The first review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety, held in Vienna in 
April 1999, had produced very satisfactory results, and the review process had proved to be 
very constructive, in line with the incentive nature of the Convention. He assumed that the 
Contracting Parties were now working on any safety improvements that the review process 
had found necessary. 
80. The Agency clearly had a very important role to play in the area of nuclear safety and 
radioactive waste safety; in all its activities associated with the use of nuclear technology by 
Member States, it should stress that any such use involved a commitment by the State to 
apply the highest safety levels in accordance with the relevant international conventions and 
the AgencyÂs safety standards. At the same time, the Agency should continue to develop its 
review services, focusing on compliance by States with their obligations under the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention. It should also encourage the 
voluntary use of those services. In that context, Sweden welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to 
develop review activities in the area of safety culture and safety management. 
81. Sweden attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and 
had accordingly pledged its full share of the TCF for 2000. It appreciated the AgencyÂs 
efforts to co-ordinate its own activities with bilateral co-operation projects in areas of mutual 
interest such as nuclear safety, radiation protection and national systems of nuclear material 
accounting and control. He noted in particular that the Agency was endeavouring to 
harmonize its technical co-operation activities with those of other Partners in Development, 
taking into account the national priorities and plans of recipient countries. He looked forward 
to learning more about the results achieved with the Country Programme Frameworks and 
Thematic Plans. 
82. Mr. YAKIS (Turkey) welcomed Angola and Honduras and thanked the Member 
States that had provided moral and material support to his country following the recent 
earthquake. 
83. The previous year had been a very successful one for the Agency. That highly regarded 
organization had made commendable efforts to implement decisions and resolutions which 
had been adopted in the crucial area of radiation safety. The problems posed by the disposal 
of radioactive waste made the public unwilling to accept nuclear power. The AgencyÂs work 
to select suitable sites and develop safe techniques for radioactive waste disposal would make 
a valuable contribution to the development of nuclear energy in the twenty-first century. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 18 

84. At the previous session of the General Conference, his delegation had expressed a wish 
to see a continuation of the waste disposal facility demonstration programmes at the Ãekmece 
Nuclear Research and Training Center in Istanbul, and the third demonstration had indeed 
taken place in June 1999. 
85. A number of accidents involving orphan sources had occurred during recent years, 
including one in Turkey in January 1999. Fortunately, there had been no loss of life and all 
the victims had recovered. Turkey was grateful for the AgencyÂs prompt intervention and the 
medical and technical support it had provided. Moreover, the Turkish licensing authority, 
aware of the gaps in the implementation of the existing regulations, had taken serious 
measures to monitor radiation sources closely. In that context, he believed that the action 
plan proposed by the Agency in that area would be an effective way of addressing the hazards 
posed by orphan sources and accordingly hoped that the General Conference would endorse 
it. 
86. The transport of radioactive and nuclear material was also a very important issue, given 
the right of all human beings to live in a healthy environment. He was pleased to see that 
action had been taken in response to resolution GC(42)/RES/13, which had been 
co-sponsored by Turkey and adopted by consensus at the ConferenceÂs previous session. The 
Agency had already set up a Transport Safety Appraisal Service which had started to function 
effectively but would need the General ConferenceÂs support. A new draft resolution had 
therefore been submitted to the present session with a view to encouraging Member States to 
make extensive use of that service. He hoped the draft resolution would attract broad support. 
87. At the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, held in April 1999, Turkey had described the status of the Akkuyu nuclear power 
plant and had received detailed information on the safety of nuclear facilities in neighbouring 
countries. 
88. Technical coÂoperation was the AgencyÂs most effective tool for assisting Member 
States in the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In the evaluation of projects 
for that purpose, not only financial criteria, but also qualitative aspects should be taken into 
consideration. Despite the severe burden imposed by the recent earthquake, Turkey had 
pledged to pay its full share of the TCF target for 2000, amounting to $317 550. 
89. Another crucial question was the increase in global energy demand and the role nuclear 
power could play in that area. In the next century, nuclear and hydroelectric power would be 
the two most viable energy sources, producing the least greenhouse gases. The AgencyÂs 
efforts to develop small and medium-sized reactors should be supported since such reactors 
would be very useful for developing countries with small-scale grids, as well as contributing 
to the Clean Development Mechanism. 
90. In 1998, Turkey had actively participated in the implementation of the regional Model 
Project on the Black Sea. The Agency had provided financial and technical support to the 
parties involved, which had led to the signing of the Black Sea Declaration by the coastal 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 19 

countries. That project should serve as an example to other regional marine environment 
initiatives. 

91. Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials constituted a serious threat to human health and 
could run counter to the AgencyÂs non-proliferation objectives. Owing to the international 
scale of the problem, measures taken at national level would not be enough. He regretted that 
Member States had not endeavoured to find a joint solution by means of a binding 
international instrument. Although the average number of incidents appeared to have been 
declining during the past few years, the number - some 30 per year - was still too high in the 
view of his Government, which had taken various measures to control illicit trafficking: it 
had set up a national database for such incidents, had improved existing regulations and 
physical protection systems at facilities, was training its police and customs personnel, had 
introduced new articles in the criminal code and, lastly, was preparing to establish a remote 
low-level radiation detection system at customs posts and the Turkish Straits. 
92. Turkey had always endorsed the noble principles of the non-proliferation and nuclear 
disarmament regime established by the NPT and supported the idea of increasing the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Accordingly, the Turkish 
authorities had initiated discussions with the Secretariat aimed at early signature of an 
Additional Protocol. 
93. Mr. ADAM (Belgium), having associated himself with the statement made by the 
representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union, said that he would only raise some 
points of specific interest to his country. 
94. Belgium hoped that the next NPT Review Conference would, despite rather 
disappointing preparations, provide tangible results. The Agency played a key role in the area 
of non-proliferation and was very active in the area of nuclear disarmament. There was no 
doubt that, when the time came, the Agency would be fully capable of working out the 
verification mechanisms that would be needed for a cut-off treaty banning the production of 
fissile material for military purposes. It would also be called upon to verify that the fissile 
material declared by the United States and Russia as surplus to defence requirements 
remained outside military programmes. Furthermore, under voluntary-offer arrangements, the 
Agency was already applying safeguards to plutonium and highly enriched uranium from the 
nuclear weapons programmes of certain States. He hoped all the nuclear-weapon States 
would soon begin the gradual dismantling of their nuclear arsenals and bow to the same 
constraints. 
95. The Agency was constantly extending its ability to act in the area of non-proliferation. 
The programme for the strengthening of safeguards was continuing and 41 States had already 
signed Additional Protocols. Furthermore, the risks of proliferation from neptunium and 
americium, albeit small, had also been taken into account, and the Board of Governors had 
recently decided on the monitoring regime to be applied to those materials. 
96. Some States, however, continued to disregard international non-proliferation 
arrangements, thus compromising peace and security as well as the development of the 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 20 

peaceful uses of nuclear energy in their countries and hence their own economic and social 
development. Worrying as it might be, though, that situation could not justify the 
introduction of new measures to control the peaceful nuclear activities of Member States; the 
Agency now had all the means necessary to carry out its task under the NPT. It would be 
wiser to attempt to rationalize the AgencyÂs non-proliferation activities so as to make the 
most of the available resources. That indeed was the direction the Director General was 
taking in working towards an integrated safeguards system. 

97. The integrated safeguards system of the future would complement the former 
quantitative approach with a qualitative one based on the analysis of information concerning 
the nuclear activities of States. However, the integrated system should not result in the 
dismantling of the former system, which remained the cornerstone of Agency safeguards, or 
in the systematic implementation of all the measures provided for by the Additional Protocol; 
complementary access in particular, whose objectives and modalities were defined by the 
Protocol, should not become just another control measure. Analysis of the information 
provided by States under the Additional Protocol as well as the possible implementation of 
relevant complementary measures would enable the Agency to obtain additional assurances 
about the nuclear profile of States and should enable routine inspections to be reduced. Part I 
of Programme 93+2 and the Additional Protocol had been developed with a view to 
strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. However, a 
strengthened safeguards system was not just additional controls, but a mechanism 
concentrating resources on what was really necessary and eliminating duplication. Belgium 
was looking forward to the new proposals from the Secretariat in that regard. 
98. The first review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 1999 had been very 
productive and had enabled States to engage in a frank and direct dialogue conducive to the 
development of a safety culture in an atmosphere of consensus. Nevertheless, he was more 
convinced than ever that the peer review process, even if applicable to issues such as safety, 
would not be suitable for other areas such as the security of nuclear materials. 
99. The International Conference on the Strengthening of Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe 
organized by the Agency in June 1999 had provided an opportunity to evaluate the results of 
bilateral assistance efforts and the AgencyÂs extrabudgetary programme on the safety of 
RBMK and WWER reactors: considerable progress had been made, but there was still much 
to be done. For its part, Belgium was continuing to provide assistance to the competent 
authorities in Central and Eastern European countries and to support activities aimed at 
improving the safety of nuclear installations there, either bilaterally or within the framework 
of the European programmes PHARE and TACIS. In the nuclear safety area, Belgian 
specialists were paying particular attention to the management of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste. Belgium was focusing its bilateral programme on those issues and was participating in 
the contact group for international co-operation with the Russian Federation in order to help 
that country ensure the safe management of its radioactive waste. 
100. He was pleased to note that the Agency was looking into the problem of orphan sources, 
which could present a serious danger to the environment and public health, particularly in 
developing countries where the means to manage those sources were lacking. He also 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 21 

thanked the Agency for the efficiency with which the INSARR mission had been carried out 
at the BR2 research reactor at the Mol Nuclear Energy Research Centre. 

101. In 1998, all BelgiumÂs nuclear power plants had been shut down for maintenance and 
refuelling. Tihange Unit 3 had been shut down for 77 days so that the three steam generators 
could be replaced. It should be noted that BelgiumÂs energy policy had changed substantially 
since the previous session of the General Conference: the Parliament had passed a law on the 
organization of the electricity market to take account of the European directive on the subject. 
The law provided inter alia for the development of an indicative 10-year electricity generating 
programme which would be updated every three years. A committee of experts had been 
established for that purpose which had also been requested to examine the general energy 
situation and economic context as well as the electricity demand in Belgium, to review all 
technologies for producing electricity including nuclear power, and to submit a report to 
Parliament in spring 2000. Moreover, the Government had announced that it was ready to 
move away gradually from the nuclear option, taking due account of the recommendations of 
the Rio Conference on Environment and Development and of the carbon dioxide emission 
targets established by the Kyoto Protocol. Since the development of new and clean sources of 
renewable energy on a commercial scale would take time, the scenario chosen provided for 
the closure of nuclear power plants when they were 40 years old. In the meantime, studies on 
the feasibility and implementation of that scenario would have been carried out in 
co-operation with a committee of experts. Finally, the Belgian authorities were interested in 
the recycling of plutonium from the partial dismantling of nuclear arsenals as MOX fuel, and 
a Belgian company was part of an international consortium with the task of developing a 
programme for the fabrication of such fuel in the United States; Belgium would also be 
participating in a tripartite project involving Germany, France and the Russian Federation to 
establish a MOX production plant in Russia. 
102. Over the past year, the question of the fuel cycle had been left pending while different 
options were considered. Since the termination of the current reprocessing contract at the end 
of 1998, any new contract for fuel reprocessing was subject to Government approval; 
moreover, the Government had decided to maintain the moratorium on the reprocessing of 
spent fuel, though it could be stored temporarily on the sites of Belgian power plants with 
relative ease. With regard to low-level and short-lived radioactive waste, the Government had 
opted for a progressive and reversible solution, and studies would be carried out to decide 
whether to dispose of such waste on the surface or in geological formations, and to explore 
the areas and sites that might be selected. Medium- and high-level and long-lived waste 
would be the subject of an extensive programme, the main elements of which were the 
preparation of an interim report on safety and feasibility, the extension of the existing 
underground laboratory by constructing a tunnel to demonstrate the feasibility of disposal in 
geological formations and, finally, the study of a hybrid system that could contribute to the 
work undertaken at the international level on the feasibility of transmutation of actinides and 
long-lived fission products. 
103. Mr. BENAVIDES (European Commission) endorsed the statement made by the 
representative of Finland on behalf of the European Union, particularly the hope that the next 
NPT Review Conference would be a success. 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 22 

104. The process of enlarging the European Union was continuing and negotiations had 
begun in March 1998 with several candidate countries. Of course, the nuclear energy sector 
was an important topic in those negotiations and those candidate countries with nuclear power 
plants would have to make firm commitments in the area of nuclear safety: they were already 
making remarkable efforts to bring their legislation and practices in the area of radiation 
protection, nuclear safety and radioactive waste management into line with those of the 
European Union. Furthermore, at its recent meeting in Cologne, the European Council had 
emphasized the importance it attached to the application of high safety standards in Central 
and Eastern Europe. The European Union was committed to co-operating with those 
countries to help them not only improve their situation in that area in the medium and long 
term, but also to diversify their sources of energy and enhance their energy efficiency. 
105. Turning to safeguards, he said there were two aspects of particular importance for the 
European Union: firstly, the application by EURATOM, in partnership with the Agency, of 
safeguards on nuclear material in the European Union, and secondly, the progress made 
towards strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system with a view to achieving an integrated 
system. The New Partnership Approach developed to facilitate the application of safeguards 
in the European Union enabled the Agency and EURATOM to carry out their tasks in a much 
more effective and efficient manner. The ratification of the three Additional Protocols signed 
at the forty-second session of the General Conference was in progress in each of the 
EURATOM Member States concerned, and the Protocols should enter into force before 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Steps were already being taken for the full 
implementation of those Protocols. The European Commission was convinced that an 
integrated safeguards system would enable the Agency to move away from safeguards applied 
mechanically in States on the basis of previously established criteria, and to devolve more of 
its responsibilities to a regional system. 
106. The Commission played a direct role in the supply of nuclear fuels through the 
conclusion of contracts by the EURATOM Supply Agency and the implementation of a 
common supply policy. While the gap between natural uranium production and consumption 
in the West had not narrowed, supply and demand had reached an equilibrium over recent 
years as a result of imports from the Newly Independent States and the use of stocks held by 
utilities, governments and suppliers. The Commission, being responsible for the long-term 
security of supply for EURATOM Member States, was monitoring the markets closely to 
ensure diversification of sources of supply. 
107. The European Commission had been engaged for a long time in protecting man and the 
environment against the risks of ionizing radiation and was therefore particularly keen to 
develop a safety culture throughout Europe. With that objective in mind, the Council had 
decided in December 1998 that EURATOM should ratify the Convention on Nuclear Safety; 
thus the European Atomic Energy Community itself, as well as all its Member States, would 
be bound by the requirements of that Convention. Moreover, nuclear safety being an 
important issue also in the context of enlargement of the Union, the Council had decided 
on 7 December 1998 that further methods should be developed to ensure a high level of 
nuclear safety in the candidate countries. The Commission was currently developing ways of 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 23 

achieving that objective and was also working on the safety issue in a broader context, for 
example in the framework of the G-7 and G-24. 

108. In the area of radioactive waste management, an assessment of EURATOMÂs practice 
had been undertaken and the scope for further improvement and harmonization of its 
activities was being explored. In addition, the Commission was working in close cooperation 
with the Agency, WANO and the ISTC on a specific project to carry out an 
independent assessment of the situation with regard to the Y2K problem in designated power 
plants in Russia and Ukraine. 
109. No major incident associated with illicit trafficking in nuclear material had occurred in 
the European Union the previous year. Although a downward trend had been observed over 
the past three years, complacency should be avoided, and the Commission continued to 
participate actively in the work of dedicated groups established by the Agency, the G-8 or 
sectorial associations so as to be able to respond appropriately to possible cases of trafficking. 
The Commission continued to support and implement co-operation projects in the area of 
nuclear material accounting and control with countries of the former Soviet Union. In that 
connection, the question of orphan sources was an important one, and the action plan being 
developed by the Agency with a view to improving the safety of radiation sources and the 
security of radioactive material would be very useful. 
110. EURATOMÂs fifth Framework Programme (1998-2002) on research and training in the 
area of nuclear energy had been launched at the end of 1998. It was centred around two key 
areas - nuclear fusion and nuclear fission - and supported generic research in radiology. Its 
long-term objective was to exploit the full potential of nuclear energy, both fusion and fission, 
in a sustainable manner, by making current technologies even safer and more economical, and 
by exploring promising new approaches. The generic research in radiology would make it 
possible to gain a better understanding of the effects of radiation on human health and to 
improve the quantification of risk at low doses and low dose rates. The first contracts under 
the fifth Framework Programme should be awarded at the end of 1999. Furthermore, the 
EURATOM Joint Research Centre was playing a very important R&D role in areas such as 
reactor safety, safeguards, fissile materials management, safety of nuclear fuels and actinides, 
and nuclear waste management. The Centre was also contributing to the AgencyÂs work by 
supporting the Russian FederationÂs efforts to improve nuclear material accounting and 
control, having participated in the establishment of a safeguards methodological and training 
centre in Obninsk. 
111. EURATOM was also an active player on the international nuclear field. The 
negotiations begun with Japan at the beginning of 1999 on a co-operation agreement in the 
area of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy were continuing. In July 1999, the European 
Commission had signed two co-operation agreements in the areas of nuclear safety and 
nuclear fusion with Ukraine, as well as a co-operation agreement in the field of nuclear safety 
with Kazakhstan; negotiations were almost complete on the signing of an agreement on 
nuclear fusion with Kazakhstan, as well as on an agreement on safety and fusion with the 
Russian Federation. In addition, in the spring of 1999, the Council of Ministers of the 
European Union had adopted directives for the conclusion of a co-operation agreement 

GC(43)/OR.2 
page 24 

between EURATOM and Ukraine on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Finally, 
EURATOM, as a member of the Executive Board of the Korean Peninsula Energy 
Development Organization with a pledge to contribute 75 million euros over a five-year 
period up to the end of 2000, was playing an active role within that organization with a view 
to achieving stability, reconciliation and non-proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. 

112. In conclusion, he emphasized the close co-operation that existed between the Agency 
and the European Commission, which welcomed that partnership and hoped to see it 
intensify. 
The meeting rose at 6 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 

1. Ms. AMATHILA (Namibia), having expressed appreciation for the technical 
assistance provided to her country by the Agency, drew attention to - inter alia - the 
establishment, with assistance from the United States, of NamibiaÂs first radiotherapy centre; 
her countryÂs involvement in a regional project on the sustainable management of 
groundwater and the assistance provided by Japan to that project; and the entry into operation 
of a national thermoluminescence dosimetry system making it possible to monitor all 
radiation workers in the country. Equipment provided by the Agency had also made it 
possible to inspect medical facilities that used radiation equipment and to train radiation 
protection inspectors locally. Namibia was in the process of setting up a National Atomic 
Energy Board and reorganizing its National Regulatory Authority so as to ensure smooth 
co-ordination between the Government and the Agency. 
2. Welcoming the progress made within the AFRA framework, she confirmed NamibiaÂs 
readiness to host the next AFRA regional meeting, to be held in the year 2000, and invited 
AFRA participants to attend the annual meeting of the AFRA technical working group to be 
held in Windhoek; also, she invited the Director General to visit Namibia on that occasion. 
3. Namibia had set up a national committee and a number of sectoral committees to deal 
with Y2K problems. Most of NamibiaÂs biomedical equipment had been independently 
certified as being Y2K-compliant, and contingency plans had been drawn up to deal with any 
difficulties that might arise. 
4. Namibia would soon enter into negotiations on a protocol additional to its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. She called on other countries that had not yet concluded 
safeguards agreements or additional protocols to do so as soon as possible. 
5. Financial contributions to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget were essential to enable the 
Agency to discharge its statutory responsibilities. In that regard, she was pleased to announce 
that Namibia had paid both its assessed contribution and its share of the target for voluntary 
contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund (TCF). 
6. With regard to the long-standing Article VI amendment issue, she trusted that with the 
prevailing spirit of compromise it would be possible to agree upon an expansion of the Board 
of Governors - which Africa had first called for twenty years previously. 
7. Finally, having commended the Director GeneralÂs efforts hitherto, she appealed to him 
to recruit more women, particularly from developing countries, to serve in the Secretariat; it 
was time to achieve equal representation of women at all levels of Agency employment.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 

(a) 
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS FOR INITIAL 
DISCUSSION 
8. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the agenda 
for the current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in document 
GC(43)/1 and the supplementary item contained in document GC(43)/1/Add.1. 
9. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, the Committee 
recommended that all the items listed in documents GC(43)/1 and GC(43)/1/Add.1 and Corr.1 
be taken up for discussion as indicated in those documents. 
10. With regard to the order of items, the Committee recommended that the order of items 
proposed in document GC(43)/1 be maintained; the supplementary item in document 
GC(43)/1/Add.1, relating to Article XIV of the Statute, should be included immediately after 
item 10, relating to the AgencyÂs budget for 2000, with the remaining items renumbered 
accordingly. The Committee gave the President the flexibility, in the exercise of his 
discretion, to deal with the renumbered item 24 (ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle EastÂ) and item 25 (ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ) in the order and at the 
time he felt appropriate. 
11. All of the General CommitteeÂs recommendations regarding the agenda for the current 
session were accepted. 
12. 
The agenda was adopted. 
(b) 
CLOSING DATE OF THE SESSION AND OPENING DATE OF THE NEXT 
SESSION 
13. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the 
Conference set Friday, 1 October 1999, as the closing date of the forty-third regular session 
and Monday, 18 September 2000, as the opening date of the forty-fourth regular session, 
which would be held in Vienna. 
14. 
The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

15. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had had before it requests 
from Iraq and Belarus for the restoration of voting rights under Article XIX.A of the Statute. 
16. With regard to the request from Iraq, the Committee, with some reservations, 
recommended that IraqÂs right to vote during the present session not be restored. As to the 
request from Belarus, the Committee recommended that its right to vote in the Agency be 
restored until the beginning of the next regular session of the General Conference. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 7 

17. The CommitteeÂs recommendations with respect to the requests from Iraq and Belarus 
were accepted. 
18. The PRESIDENT said that PalestineÂs participation in the work of the Agency 
would be in accordance with the resolution GC(42)/RES/20 adopted by the General 
Conference the previous year, in addition to previous General Conference resolutions on the 
subject. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (resumed) 

19. Mr. BEN AHMED (Tunisia) said that his country was very interested in small and 
medium-sized reactors which could be used for the production of electricity and potable 
water. Noting TunisiaÂs participation in the work of the expert group on seawater 
desalination, and its recent hosting of an international meeting on the subject, he urged the 
Agency to redouble its efforts in the area of seawater desalination. With regard to other 
nuclear applications, he said that Tunisia had, with the assistance of France and the Agency, 
set up a semi-industrial pilot food irradiation plant. 
20. Turning to questions of co-operation, he said that the Arab Atomic Energy Agency - 
based in Tunisia - had objectives similar to those of the Agency, which should therefore 
strengthen its co-operation with that regional organization. Tunisia, for its part, was making 
every effort to strengthen co-operation with other African countries. 
21. Tunisia was committed to fulfilling its obligations vis-.-vis the Agency. It had 
consistently paid its assessed contributions to the Regular Budget and voluntary contributions 
to the TCF, and it had pledged its share of the TCF target for 1999. 
22. Nuclear, radiation and waste safety was a prerequisite if the use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes was to be further developed; illicit trafficking was also an area that had to 
be addressed. Tunisia had acceded to all international instruments aimed at ensuring nuclear, 
radiation and waste safety and to all those aimed at ensuring non-proliferation, such as the 
African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (the Pelindaba Treaty). His country was now 
considering concluding a protocol additional to its comprehensive safeguards agreement in 
order to further the objective of eliminating all weapons of mass destruction, in particular 
nuclear weapons. 
23. In that connection, Tunisia was particularly concerned at IsraelÂs continued refusal to 
accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear installations under international control within the 
framework of a safeguards agreement. His country would like to see a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone established in the Middle East. To that end, Israel must be persuaded to comply with the 
will of the international community. 
24. Tunisia, located as it was near a particularly sensitive sea route, shared the concerns of 
other countries about the danger posed by the maritime transport of nuclear waste. It 
favoured increased controls on the transport of such waste and considered that the subject 
should receive the same attention as the safety of nuclear facilities. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 8 

25. With regard to the question of amending Article VI of the Statute, he said that Tunisia 
supported the African demand for an increase in the number of Board seats allocated to 
Africa. It also supported the Arab position regarding the composition of the MESA Group, 
particularly since a minimum level of understanding and harmony among the members of an 
area group was a prerequisite for political co-ordination. 
26. Mr. GERLACH (Germany) said that, since the previous session of the General 
Conference, a fundamental change had taken place in his countryÂs energy policy with the 
GovernmentÂs decision to phase out nuclear power and to place greater emphasis on 
efficiency improvements at non-nuclear power plants, renewable energy sources and energy 
conservation. Negotiations were under way on a schedule for the decommissioning of 
GermanyÂs 19 nuclear power plants that would ensure that the utilities got an appropriate 
return on their investments, in order to avoid compensation claims against the Government. It 
was understood that, pending their decommissioning, the plants would continue to produce 
electricity in accordance with stringent safety standards. 
27. Effective safeguards were crucial to maintaining public confidence in a credible 
non-proliferation regime. The conclusion of additional protocols by all States would help to 
improve the efficiency of the safeguards system, and he was confident that the necessary 
parliamentary procedures for the ratification of GermanyÂs additional protocol would be 
concluded by the end of the current year. The efficient integration of the additional measures 
into the existing safeguards system and the new provisions regarding additional information 
and complementary access represented a good opportunity for rationalizing the existing 
procedures and improving the detection of undeclared activities. The Agency would face a 
new challenge in the years ahead with the verification of weapons-excess material. 
28. The outcome of the 2000 NPT Review Conference would depend on whether tangible 
progress could be achieved beforehand in the area of nuclear disarmament. He appealed to all 
States to sign and ratify the CTBT, especially those States whose ratification was a condition 
for its entry into force, and urged India and Pakistan to fulfil their declared intention to 
become parties to the CTBT. A treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for 
nuclear weapons was the next logical step, but it had regrettably not been possible to confirm 
the consensus reached in August 1998 to establish an ad hoc working group of the Conference 
on Disarmament and start negotiations. Verification of such a cut-off treaty should be 
entrusted to the Agency, making use of its expertise in the field of safeguards. 
29. The Convention on Nuclear Safety was helping to improve nuclear safety worldwide. 
The first review meeting - in April 1999 - had been a promising start, and the national 
reporting and review process had contributed considerably to the improvement of national 
safety programmes. The second review meeting - to be held in 2002 - should clearly 
distinguish between those obligations arising out of the Convention which had been fulfilled 
and those which had not. For its part, the Agency had long-standing experience of promoting 
national and international safety regimes through its ASSET, OSART and IRRT missions and 
was playing an increasingly important role in the development of international safety 
standards. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 9 

30. In the area of radioactive waste, Germany was currently reviewing its waste 
management policy, as there were some doubts whether the existing planned final storage 
projects were adequate, and trying to pinpoint a suitable final storage location in a deep 
geological formation. It looked forward to co-operating with the Agency and other Member 
States in developing commonly accepted waste safety criteria with a reliable scientific basis. 
31. Mr. ADAMOV (Russian Federation) said that the international community had to 
make a choice between, on one hand, the intensive development of nuclear power technology 
on the basis of new approaches from the safety, environmental and economic point of view 
and, on the other, the relegation of the peaceful atom to a secondary role in the energy sphere. 
If the latter option were chosen, the international community would not be able to carry out 
the tasks arising out of the decisions taken at the Kyoto Conference. It would be practically 
impossible to reduce emissions to the 1990 level given the current structure of the energy 
sector. 
32. While recognizing the need for the development of renewable energy sources, it was 
important to realize that the only true industrial-scale option in the twenty-first century would 
be nuclear power, provided that its economic competitiveness was improved, serious 
accidents could be prevented, ecological security could be assured and the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime was strengthened. The Scientific Forum being held concurrently 
with the General ConferenceÂs session was providing a unique opportunity to discuss such 
issues, and the Russian Federation would be submitting to the Forum a Âwhite bookÂ setting 
out its approach to them. 
33. His country believed that - from the point of view of safety, economics, 
non-proliferation and public acceptance - nuclear power based on fast reactors of inherently 
safe design and fuel not requiring separation of plutonium at any stage would be the optimum. 
The fuel cycle should provide for the burning of plutonium and for the transmutation of other 
long-lived radionuclides so as to prevent the return to the EarthÂs crust of radioactivity in 
excess of the radioactivity in the mined uranium ore. The engineering specifications for a 
demonstration model of such a reactor, the Brest-3000, with a pilot fuel cycle would be ready 
before the end of the current year. 
34. The Russian Federation would like to see the Agency assuming responsibility for 
ensuring that the right nuclear power development choice for the twenty-first century was 
taken. An international project to that end, implemented under the auspices of the Agency, 
would not only be of benefit to Member States but also confirm the AgencyÂs scientific and 
technical authority. 
35. The Russian Federation was in favour of the AgencyÂs co-operating with other 
international organizations in addressing the problems of the future development of nuclear 
power, but such co-operation should not lead to the relinquishment by the Agency of basic 
functions provided for in the Statute. 
36. Finally, he expressed the conviction that nuclear power offered mankind a chance to 
win the race against environmental degradation caused by the use of fossil fuels. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 10 

37. Mr. LUKMAN (Nigeria) said that, with the expected doubling of NigeriaÂs energy 
demand by the year 2030, the challenge to his country as an oil producer was to determine 
what role the nuclear option could play in its energy policy. 
38. The AgencyÂs activities in the field of pesticide residues, human health, water resources 
management, and the physical and chemical sciences were of direct relevance to Nigeria. 
Moreover, his country would like to see the Agency giving higher priority to its activities 
directed to helping make potable water available to those who lacked it. 
39. Nigeria was currently benefiting from technical assistance projects relating to 
agriculture, health care, radiotherapy and oncology, nuclear activation analysis, neonatal 
hypothyroidism screening, the monitoring of pesticide residues in foodstuffs, the crossbreeding 
of indigenous cattle to improve milk production, and the monitoring of occupational 
exposures to environmental pollutants. Also, it was participating in several AFRA projects. 
However, it would appreciate it if further steps were taken to enable developing countries to 
gain more experience of techniques for the improvement of food production. 
40. The Nigerian Government was committed to facilitating early completion of the 
ongoing miniature neutron source reactor project following the reactorÂs installation and 
approval of a legal instrument for the establishment of a National Regulatory Authority. With 
the completion of the project, Nigeria would be able to concentrate on pressing areas in 
radiation science and its applications in human health, agriculture and industry. 
41. As a demonstration of its commitment to the AgencyÂs activities, Nigeria was pledging 
US $28 470 as its contribution to the TCF for 2000. Given the increasing demands being 
made upon the Agency by Member States, it believed that the principle of zero real budgetary 
growth should be reviewed. 
42. Nigeria would like to see more of its nationals being accepted by the Agency for 
regional and interregional training courses and for scientific visits. It would also like to see 
an expansion of training opportunities, rather than the currently envisaged reduction. 
43. Turning to safeguards, he said that the appropriate Nigerian authorities were reviewing, 
in the light of his countryÂs nuclear energy development plans, the Model Additional Protocol 
with a view to the conclusion of a protocol additional to the safeguards agreement between 
Nigeria and the Agency. 
44. With regard to the staffing of the AgencyÂs Secretariat, he welcomed the efforts being 
made to improve the representation of developing Member States, but believed that much 
more could be done to recruit staff Âon as wide a geographical basis as possibleÂ and to 
ensure that a due share of Secretariat posts went to nationals of African countries. 
45. As to the question of amending Article VI of the Statute, he urged that Member States 
build upon the consensus already reached and not throw away the gains made. The African 
Group had a legitimate wish to see the Board more balanced and fully representative. 
Resolution of the Article VI issue would enable the AgencyÂs policy-making organs to devote 
their energies to other issues requiring their urgent attention. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 11 

46. Mr. dÂESCATHA (France) said that his country, which had signed the protocol 
additional to its safeguards agreement with the Agency on 22 September 1998, was eager to 
see it implemented as swiftly as possible. The major task of identifying which enterprises and 
organizations would be covered by strengthened Agency safeguards was almost complete, 
and it should soon be possible to produce a first draft of an expanded declaration to be agreed 
with the European Commission and the Agency. Apart from the technical issues involved, 
the obligations arising from the additional protocol would need to be incorporated into French 
law; the French authorities would have to be given the power to demand - where necessary - 
the information required under Article 2 of the protocol and to ensure that Agency inspectors 
were granted complementary access; and, finally, the protocol would have to be ratified by 
Parliament. Every effort was being made to ensure that the ratification process was as short 
as possible. 
47. His country, for which the NPT remained the cornerstone of the non-proliferation 
regime, would spare no effort to ensure that the NPT Review Conference scheduled for 
April 2000 demonstrated the international communityÂs renewed confidence in the NPT. The 
fact that the overwhelming majority of States had become parties to it showed that the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons was a major concern to all, and it made even less acceptable 
the attempts of the DPRK to obstruct the efforts of the Agency to achieve full implementation 
of the safeguards agreement between it and the DPRK. The stalemate in Iraq was equally 
worrying. In December 1998, UNSCOM and the Agency had been forced to withdraw from 
that country; their inspection activities had been halted for almost a year, and the international 
community could not be sure that Iraq no longer possessed or was not developing weapons of 
mass destruction. That situation was particularly regrettable since the last report of the 
AgencyÂs UNSC 687 Action Team had hinted at the possibility of moving over to ongoing 
monitoring and verification. Iraq must resume co-operation with UNSCOM and the Agency 
without delay and meet its obligations in full. 
48. It was important that the CTBT, which had been open for signature for three years, 
enter into force soon. Fourteen of the fifteen members of the European Union had already 
ratified the CTBT, including all those whose ratification was required for its entry into force. 
France and the United Kingdom were so far the only nuclear-weapon States to have ratified it. 
His country would particularly like to see those States whose accession to the CTBT was 
necessary for its entry into force making good their statements of intent in that regard without 
delay. 
49. Over a year previously, the Conference on Disarmament had decided by consensus to 
embark upon the negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty. Unfortunately, no concrete 
results had as yet been achieved, owing to a failure to agree on the ConferenceÂs work 
programme. France had, like other nuclear-weapon States, taken a unilateral decision to stop 
producing weapons-grade fissile material; however, it had then gone a stage further and 
started to dismantle its production facilities. The members of the Conference on 
Disarmament must overcome their differences and work towards the early opening of 
negotiations on a universal, non-discriminatory, truly verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 12 

50. The Kyoto Conference and subsequent meetings had highlighted the difficulty of 
reconciling growing energy requirements with the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions in a 
context of sustainable development. Nuclear power could fully demonstrate its advantages 
only if the general public were convinced that it was environmentally friendly and safe. 
There, too, international co-operation was indispensable. 
51. The frank discussions at the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, held in April 1999, had culminated in a useful summary 
report. The second review meeting, due to take place in three yearsÂ time, should provide an 
opportunity to verify whether the recommendations contained in that report had been acted 
upon. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management, which had been signed by France on the day of its being 
opened for signature, would shortly be ratified by the French Parliament. 
52. His country would continue to support the AgencyÂs activities relating to the safety and 
security of radiation sources, particularly following the International Conference on the 
Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials held in Dijon in 
September 1998. That conference had highlighted shortcomings in the management of 
radiation sources which had caused serious radiological accidents. In his countryÂs view, 
however, a code of practice would be a more appropriate way of dealing with such 
shortcomings than an international convention, which might take a long time to elaborate. 
53. With regard to the consideration being given within the Agency to the advisability of 
revising the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, he said that the 
mechanisms provided for by the Convention had made it possible to adapt the relevant 
international standards through the regular updating of recommendations. That had been 
possible only thanks to the flexibility and non-binding nature of the recommendations. In his 
countryÂs view, therefore, a revision of the Convention in order to incorporate the technical 
provisions contained in the recommendations did not seem desirable. Moreover, instituting 
an international peer review system like that provided for by the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety would run counter to the nature of physical protection, which implied confidentiality. 
54. In recent years, there had been great efforts to make the AgencyÂs technical assistance 
activities more effective and efficient, with fruitful results. His country would like to see a 
continuation of those efforts and a further increase in the commitment of the beneficiary 
countries. Of course, sustained support from donor countries was crucial, and France, which 
had consistently paid its full TCF target share, was determined to maintain that record. 
55. Activities in response to the increasing demands being made of the Agency could not be 
financed merely by cutting costs. It was for that reason that France, while in favour of 
streamlining efforts, had advocated a flexible attitude to zero-real-growth budgeting. That 
practice had forced the Agency to rely more and more on extrabudgetary resources, the use of 
which was an expedient that undermined the control of Member States and should be limited 
to exceptional cases. It was equally undesirable to create a multiplicity of special funds. In 
particular, the verification of fissile material no longer needed for defence purposes should be 
financed from the Regular Budget. Arms reduction measures were in the interest of all. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 13 

56. Turning to developments in France during the preceding year, he said that the installed 
capacity of FranceÂs 58 PWRs (the latest, Civaux 2, due to start operation soon) had been 
63 GW(e) at the end of 1998; those reactors were providing 76% of the countryÂs electricity. 
Availability remained at around 81%, and safety levels also continued to be high; for 
example, the average occupational exposure dose had dropped from 2.6 mSv in 1997 to 
2.3 mSv in 1998. 
57. One incident in 1998, at Civaux 1, had been classified at level 2 on the International 
Nuclear Event Scale; the problem had been resolved and the plant had resumed operations. 
58. France was engaged - together with Germany - in economic optimization studies 
relating to a European PWR design. Work was continuing on extrapolation of the SILVA 
uranium enrichment process from laboratory scale to industrial scale, together with an 
assessment of the costs. Since commencing operations in 1995, the MELOX fabrication plant 
for MOX fuel had produced around 300 tonnes of such fuel; it had just received authorization 
to diversify its output for export. As regards the back end of the fuel cycle, COGEMAÂs plant 
at La Hague had processed 1633 tonnes of irradiated fuel in 1998; since 1976, over 
14 300 tonnes of irradiated fuel from LWRs had been reprocessed at the plant. 
59. The management of long-lived high-level waste was one of the major problems facing 
nuclear power, and France had therefore intensified its research in three areas of relevance. 
60. The first was the transmutation of long-lived radionuclides, for which an evaluation of 
the relative advantages of different reactor types (thermal, fast, hybrid) was under way. The 
PhÃ©nix fast reactor would be starting up again in the second half of the year 2000 following 
renovation work, and the programme of transmutation experiments using it should be 
completed by the end of 2004. It was hoped that the results of the transmutation studies, 
which relied heavily on international co-operation, would be available by 2006. 
61. The second area of research related to disposal in deep geological formations. In 
December 1998, the French Government had taken a decision in favour of building two 
underground laboratories for retrievable disposal studies. The first laboratory was to be built 
in a clay formation in eastern France, and the Government had authorized the National 
Agency for Radioactive Waste Management (ANDRA) to begin work. The search for a 
granite formation for the second laboratory had started. 
62. The third area of research related to conditioning and long-term surface or sub-surface 
storage. A report on sub-surface storage had been submitted to the Government at the end 
of 1998, and work was continuing with a view to a decision being taken in 2006. 
63. The French Government had reaffirmed the broad outlines of its energy policy. Nuclear 
power was to remain the principal component of the electricity generation sector, but more 
emphasis was to be placed on energy conservation and renewable energy sources. The aim 
was to keep the nuclear option open until 2010, when the oldest nuclear power plants would 
be nearing the end of their lives.

page 14 

64. Particular attention would be paid to the controls applied in the nuclear industry and the 
industryÂs transparency and to ensuring that the expertise drawn on in the fields of radiation 
protection and safety was independent and diverse. To that end, the Government would 
shortly submit to Parliament a nuclear industry control bill providing for the establishment of 
an independent authority. The Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IPSN), 
which would provide the independent authority with technical support, would, in order to 
ensure its independence, be detached from the Commissariat Ã  lÂÃ©nergie atomique. 
65. The main thrust of FranceÂs energy policy had many points of contact with the goals of 
the Agency, whose essential role in promoting international co-operation was greatly 
appreciated by his country, which would continue to participate fully in its activities. 
66. Mr. NOOR UDDIN KHAN (Bangladesh) said that - as emphasized by Prime 
Minister Sheikh Hasina - Bangladesh remained firmly committed to nuclear non-proliferation 
and the peaceful uses of atomic energy and was very appreciative of the technical assistance it 
had received from the Agency. 
67. Bangladesh shared the Director GeneralÂs view that for many countries nuclear power 
was a viable option and welcomed the AgencyÂs endeavours to improve the socio-economic 
conditions in many parts of the world. 
68. BangladeshÂs nuclear applications programme encompassed areas such as agriculture, 
industry and the environment. There had been a particularly strong expansion of the 
applications of ionizing radiation in medicine, a field in which Agency technical assistance 
had been invaluable. 
69. Only about 14% of the population had access to electricity in his country, where per 
capita electricity generation was currently about 90 kW. However, the need for energy was 
growing rapidly as the country pursued its development goals. For Bangladesh, which had 
inadequate indigenous sources of energy, nuclear power was a feasible option. Its nuclear 
power programme was, however, running up against problems. An action plan to expedite 
implementation of the long-standing Rooppur nuclear power project was being finalized, and 
the Agency had recently helped organize a national training workshop on nuclear power 
project planning. Bangladesh looked forward to receiving further Agency assistance with the 
development of human resources. Also, it hoped for support for its nuclear power programme 
from countries belonging to the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
70. Bangladesh had received important assistance through both the technical co-operation 
programme and the research contract programme of the Agency, and the results were being 
applied in different sectors of the economy to good effect. In addition, it was involved in 
various RCA projects offering valuable opportunities for the sharing of experience. 
71. Bangladesh, which had passed a Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control Act in 1993, had 
signed most Agency-sponsored treaties and conventions and had incorporated the bulk of the 
Basic Safety Standards into its Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control Rules (1997). It was 
establishing a central radioactive waste processing and storage facility - an activity for which 
it would need Agency support. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 15 

72. Bangladesh intended to contribute to the attainment of the AgencyÂs goals and would do 
its utmost in the sphere of non-proliferation so as to ensure the survival and future prosperity 
of mankind. 
73. Mr. REGUIEG (Algeria) said that his country was endeavouring to establish the 
national regulatory framework required in order to respond to the new obligations associated 
with the strengthening of the safeguards system. The Algerian Atomic Energy Commission 
had initiated steps to establish an organization capable of ensuring the effective management 
of nuclear material at the national level. Algeria intended to set up a nuclear material 
accounting and control laboratory, and to that end it had submitted a technical assistance 
request to the Agency. Despite its importance, however, the project in question had been 
classified only as a footnote-a/ project. He wished to assure potential donor States that 
Algeria was ready to co-finance it. 
74. In the area of nuclear and radiation safety, AlgeriaÂs recently established national 
regulatory body was working in close co-operation with the National Nuclear Safety 
Commission to draw up guidelines for the implementation of a comprehensive safety strategy. 
There were plans to complement the existing regulations governing the possession and 
utilization of radiation sources by the establishment of an authorization procedure prior to the 
importation of radiation sources. Information on illicit trafficking disseminated by the 
Agency was passed on systematically to the relevant national institutions, for whose 
personnel specialized training programmes had been held. Periodic unannounced inspections 
of all users of radiation sources were carried out in order to monitor compliance with the 
current national regulations. With regard to the transport of radioactive substances, an 
amended regulatory text was to be promulgated by the Ministry of Transport in the near 
future. 
75. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities were crucial, and any steps to reduce or 
freeze the level of assistance provided would be detrimental to developing Member States. It 
was therefore essential that the Agency have sufficient, assured and predictable resources for 
those activities. 
76. The problem of potable water shortages was one of his GovernmentÂs major concerns, 
and Algeria was therefore very much involved in the AgencyÂs various activities connected 
with nuclear desalination. Algeria also attached great importance to the use of isotope 
hydrology in groundwater management, and its Isotope Hydrology Laboratory, which had the 
status of a regional laboratory, was being used to help meet the needs of several Member 
States. 
77. Noting that AFRA had now been in existence for ten years, he said that, despite the 
achievements to date, greater commitment on the part of the Agency and all States parties to 
AFRA was necessary in order to meet the legitimate demands of the African region. 
78. Turning to the application of safeguards in the Middle East, he pointed out that all 
States in the region, with one notable exception, had acceded to the NPT and concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities were a 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 16 

legitimate concern to Algeria, which believed that Israel should make a firm, genuine 
commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East by acceding to the NPT and 
placing all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. The international community 
should step up its efforts to ensure that all States in the region took tangible steps towards the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone there. 

79. Following the recent substantial expansion in the AgencyÂs membership, there was 
clearly a need for a corresponding expansion in the Board of Governors, and Algeria had been 
the first country to call for an amendment to Article VI in order to allow for such an 
expansion. It was extremely regrettable that the Board had failed during the previous week to 
reach a consensus on the issue; his country hoped that a consensus would be reached by the 
General Conference. 
Mr. Adam (Belgium) took the Chair 

80. Mr. DAFFE (Senegal) said that during the previous 20 years his country had 
carried out many projects in major sectors of its economy thanks to Agency technical 
assistance. The use of radioisotopes had produced results in several fields which would have 
been difficult to achieve using traditional research techniques. 
81. The organization in Senegal responsible for the promotion of nuclear techniques, 
training in the use of such techniques, radiation protection and nuclear equipment 
maintenance and repair was the Institute of Applied Nuclear Technology (ITNA), which had 
been established in 1980 through a UNDP project executed by the Agency. 
82. The ITNAÂs facilities, which had mostly been provided through the Agency, comprised 
radiation monitoring equipment, a radiochemistry laboratory, an electronics laboratory, X-ray 
fluorescence equipment and a nitrogen liquifier. Also, the Agency had helped to upgrade the 
facilities of the radiocarbon laboratory of IFAN (Institut fondamental dÂAfrique noire) 
through a project funded from extrabudgetary resources. 
83. The National Agricultural Research Centre (CNRA) at Bambey, part of the Senegalese 
Agricultural Research Institute (ISRA), was a major beneficiary of Agency technical 
assistance. The well-equipped radioisotope laboratory at Bambey, built with Agency 
co-operation, was carrying out research on soil-water-plant relations and fertiliser utilization. 
Using radioisotope techniques, ISRA had - inter alia - identified drought-resistant millet and 
groundnut varieties and selected niÃ©bÃ© and groundnut cultivars capable of fixing large 
quantities of nitrogen. 
84. The Agency had helped the National Laboratory for Livestock Rearing and Veterinary 
Research (LNERV) to establish a capability for the radioimmunoassay determination of 
reproductive hormones and had helped the Inter-State School of Veterinary Science and 
Medicine (EISM) to introduce radioimmunoassay and related techniques for bovine 
reproduction and animal nutrition studies. The AgencyÂs assistance to the LNERV had made 
it possible to virtually eradicate rinderpest in Senegal. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 17 

85. Agency-supported projects in nuclear medicine had improved the diagnostic facilities at 
the A. Le Dantec Hospital. Scintigraphy and in vitro assay equipment had been provided for 
the biophysics laboratories at that hospital and at the Cheikh Anta Diop University (UCAD). 
Liver, kidney, bone, brain and thyroid scans could now be carried out at those laboratories. 
86. Since 1982, UCADÂs Department of Geology had benefited from several Agency 
technical co-operation projects aimed at gaining more extensive knowledge of SenegalÂs 
groundwater and surface water resources. It had established a hydrochemistry laboratory 
where isotope techniques were being used, and the isotopic data now available had helped in 
the development of mathematical models for reassessing the groundwater resources in and 
around Dakar. Also, Senegal was participating in the Model Project on ÂIsotopes in 
groundwater resources developmentÂ, whose objective was to improve water resources 
management in arid and semi-arid zones of Africa. 
87. In radiation protection, a RAPAT mission had been followed by a technical 
co-operation project leading to the establishment, at the ITNA, of an occupational exposure 
dosimetry service and to the training of personnel for a national radiation protection service. 
In addition, Senegal had benefited from the services of experts in thermoluminescence 
dosimetry and in the preparation of legislation and regulatory documentation and been 
provided with a wide range of dosimetry and radiation protection equipment. Subsequently, 
the legislative and regulatory framework for ensuring the safe use of nuclear techniques and 
the safe management of radioactive waste had been established. 
88. As a party to the NPT and a member of the OAU, Senegal wanted Africa to remain a 
nuclear-weapon-free region and hoped that the international community would support the 
countries of Africa in ensuring that it did - in the interests of world security and prosperity. 
89. Mr. AHMAD (Pakistan) said that, with the approach of a new millennium, it was 
useful to look back at some of the momentous events of the present century. MankindÂs 
technical achievements - particularly the progress made in fields such as information 
technology, space exploration, genetic engineering, disease control and power production - 
had been unprecedented, but the most remarkable progress had been in nuclear physics and 
nuclear technology. President EisenhowerÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ programme in the nineteenfifties, 
aimed at a wider sharing of the benefits of nuclear research, the Geneva conferences 
on the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the establishment and activities of the Agency had 
all played a major role. The Agency had made commendable contributions to increasing the 
use of nuclear energy in power production, agriculture, medicine, industry, hydrology and 
other fields and hence to improving the socio-economic conditions of the developing world. 
The accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and the petroleum price crash in the 
nineteen-eighties might have drastically reduced the demand for new power reactors, but 
there could be no doubt that the period of reduced demand would not last much longer. 
90. Disappointingly, the contribution of nuclear power to total world electricity generation 
had remained static for many years, at 16-17%, although nuclear power was the most 
environment-friendly energy source. If greenhouse gas emissions were to be reduced in 
response to the call of the Kyoto Conference, nuclear power would have to be adopted as a 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 18 

preferred energy option and the developed world would have to subsidize the expansion of 
nuclear power in the developing world. 

91. Water would undoubtedly become a precious commodity in the twenty-first century, 
and the development of fresh groundwater resources should therefore be given very high 
priority. The role of nuclear techniques in the control of aquifer pollution and in optimizing 
the use of water in agriculture would assume greater importance. The ÂInternational 
Programme for Isotopes in the Hydrological CycleÂ, launched recently by the Agency in 
collaboration with UNESCO and WMO, was a very laudable initiative. Moreover, nuclear 
desalination might also become a necessity in several parts of the world. 
92. The lessons of Chernobyl should not be forgotten in the context of the safe development 
of nuclear power. The role of the Agency in providing information and advice to all of its 
Member States on safety-related issues and its active involvement in safety assessments 
through ASSET, OSART and similar missions were widely appreciated. The Convention on 
Nuclear Safety was helping States to improve their safety culture. A peer review of 
PakistanÂs National Safety Report at the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention had shown that the safety of its installations was second to none. In that 
connection, the AgencyÂs support in upgrading the safety of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant 
and its advice regarding the safety of the Chashma Nuclear Power Project had been 
invaluable. Also, its initiative in providing Y2K-related information and assistance to 
Member States was highly commendable. 
93. Another essential Agency activity was safeguards, and Pakistan remained fully 
committed to complying with its safeguards obligations. It realized that, in the present 
political climate, the AgencyÂs safety and safeguards activities were going to expand further, 
but it would not like to see the expansion taking place at the expense of the AgencyÂs 
promotional role. 
94. For developing countries, technical co-operation and technology transfer were the most 
important Agency activities. Pakistan therefore welcomed the fact that the financial 
implementation rate for technical co-operation had reached 76.7% in 1998. As the Chairman 
of SAGTAC, he hoped that the advice given by SAGTAC - particularly regarding synergism 
between the Department of Technical Co-operation and other Departments of the Secretariat 
and the promotion of TCDC - would prove valuable. 
95. Pakistan, as a recipient of Agency technical assistance, saw it as a duty of those 
developing countries which had reached a certain level of advancement to assist other 
developing countries. It had consequently provided the services of many experts and training 
opportunities for many Agency fellowship holders. Such interaction among developing 
countries would, it was to be hoped, facilitate the establishment of regional resource centres. 
96. The Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, in Trieste, was an 
outstanding international success. The Agency should continue to support the Centre and to 
derive benefit from it. 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 19 

97. As far as the past yearÂs activities of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) 
were concerned, its two research reactors had continued to operate safely. PAEC was grateful 
to the Agency for assisting with the overhaul of the turbine of the Karachi Nuclear Power 
Plant. Construction work was proceeding well at the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant, which 
was expected to start producing electricity on a regular commercial basis soon. The Pakistan 
Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH) had continued its academic and 
applied programmes in nuclear and related disciplines. 
98. The research conducted over the years by the three PAEC agricultural centres, using 
mutation methods, had resulted in 35 varieties of food and cash crops - such as wheat, rice 
and cotton - with improved yields and increased disease and pest resistance; six varieties had 
been introduced during the current year alone. ÂBiopowerÂ fertilizer, introduced by PAECÂs 
Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering and originally developed for rice and 
legumes, had now been developed for wheat. Also, the Institute had reached an advanced 
stage in the development of transgenic cotton resistant to the leaf curl virus. 
99. Eleven nuclear medical centres were operating in different parts of the country, and a 
twelfth would start operating later in the year. For some years PAEC had also been providing 
expert advice on the establishment of nuclear medical centres in the private sector. 
100. Pakistan remained committed to the goals of non-proliferation and disarmament. The 
events initiated in its neighbourhood in May 1998 had forced it to conduct its own nuclear 
tests in order to restore the strategic balance. It had acted with great restraint and a sense of 
responsibility, announced a unilateral moratorium on further testing and emphasized the need 
to prevent a nuclear arms race in the region. To that end it had proposed a strategic restraint 
regime for the region based on maintaining nuclear deterrence at the minimum level. 
Pakistan was still committed to not exporting nuclear and other sensitive technologies. As a 
responsible State that deeply respected the sentiments of the peace-loving international 
community, it had remained in the forefront of global efforts to halt the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, with total nuclear disarmament as the final goal. The ultimate 
objectives of non-proliferation and disarmament could be achieved only through 
non-discriminatory, equitable and verifiable global measures accompanied by credible 
confidence-building efforts and open co-operation in technology interchange between 
advanced and developing countries. The imposition of coercive restrictions and embargoes 
on scientific knowledge and technology could only be counter-productive. 
101. The tasks assigned to the Agency were scientifically challenging, technically complex, 
politically sensitive and financially demanding, and it was a sign of the confidence of 
Member States in it that they felt assured when placing new responsibilities on its shoulders. 
Despite that, the Agency had been forced to operate under the constraints of zero real 
budgetary growth for over a decade and a half. If positive real budgetary growth was not yet 
possible, at least the Agency should not be subjected to even more severe budgetary 
constraints. 
102. It was regrettable that, for the first time, the TCF target for 1999 provided for only zero 
real growth and the envisaged TCF target for the year 2000 was no higher. At all events, 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 20 

despite financial difficulties, Pakistan had already, in line with a long tradition, pledged its 
full share of the envisaged TCF target for the year 2000. 

103. Pakistan had made great efforts over the past two decades to bring about an increase in 
the representation of the AgencyÂs developing Member States on the Board. A consensus 
regarding an expansion of the Board was now very close, and it was to be hoped that the 
General Conference would succeed in resolving the long-standing Article VI issue. 
104. In conclusion, he commended the initiative of the Director General in promoting a Âone 
houseÂ culture within the Secretariat and also the Director GeneralÂs idea of holding a 
Scientific Forum in conjunction with the General ConferenceÂs current session. 
105. Mr. AL-GHAIS (Kuwait) said that his country was currently studying the Model 
Additional Protocol with a view to concluding a protocol additional to its comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
106. The application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East was an important issue for 
Kuwait, whose opinion regarding it was set out in Annex 3 to document GC(43)/17/Add.1. 
There was a clear link between the application of safeguards in the region and the declaration 
of the region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone; if such a zone were to be declared, Israel would 
have to accede to the NPT and place all of its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. His 
country hoped that the Middle East would soon be rid of all types of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
107. The AgencyÂs activities in Iraq were crucial to the security of the region, and it was 
therefore essential that those activities not be limited in any way by Iraq. 
108. Kuwait was also concerned at the non-compliance of the DPRK with its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. The DPRK must fully respect that agreement and facilitate the 
AgencyÂs verification activities. 
109. With regard to the Article VI issue, KuwaitÂs position had been set out in a letter dated 
7 June 1999 which he had sent to the Chairman of the Board in response to a proposal by the 
Chairman contained in a letter dated 17 May 1999. The acceptance of the ChairmanÂs 
proposal by the Council of Arab Ambassadors attested to the CouncilÂs wish to resolve the 
issue in a manner reflecting the principle of equitable geographical representation. 
110. Kuwait greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and was 
pleased with the way in which the technical co-operation strategy described in document 
GOV/INF/824 was being implemented. It would continue to welcome a strong Agency role 
in upgrading the capacities of developing countries relevant to radiation safety, to nuclear 
applications in industry, agriculture, medicine and environmental studies, and to a wide 
variety of other important technical areas. 
111. Mr. POOLOKASINGHAM (Sri Lanka) said that, like many other developing 
Member States, Sri Lanka had benefited significantly from Agency technical assistance, 
particularly in the areas of health care, agriculture and industry. It was accordingly taking 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 21 

steps to ensure the prompter payment, despite serious financial constraints, of assessed 
programme costs. 

112. Sri Lanka welcomed the efforts of the Department of Technical Co-operation to develop 
concepts and tools for project design; they had led to a significant improvement in the project 
proposals being submitted for the 2001-2002 biennium. At the same time, it was concerned 
about the steady decline in financial resources for technical co-operation. 
113. Referring to the section entitled ÂCollection of Data on Project Achievements/ 
Outcomes/ImpactÂ in the Technical Co-operation Report for 1998, he called for 
improvements in the collection, storage and presentation of such data. 
114. His Government, which had recognized the contribution which nuclear techniques 
could make in numerous fields, had earmarked 93 million rupees for the construction of a new 
building to accommodate the laboratories of the Atomic Energy Authority, and adequate 
resources were being made available for the development of the laboratories. 
115. Sri Lanka, which had benefited greatly from the AgencyÂs efforts to upgrade the 
radiation protection infrastructures in Member States, felt that the regional Model Project for 
East Asia and the Pacific on infrastructure upgrading should be allowed to run for an 
additional two years in order that all of its objectives might be achieved. 
116. The RCA had brought considerable benefits to Sri Lanka, which welcomed the 
improvements being made to the RCAÂs management structure. At the same time, his country 
felt that there should be closer co-ordination between the AgencyÂs Secretariat and Member 
States with regard to decisions concerning the implementation of RCA programmes. 
117. Many issues remained unsolved in the field of disarmament and arms control. The size 
of nuclear arsenals was not dramatically lower now than when the NPT had been opened for 
signature, over 30 years previously. Very little had been done to achieve nuclear 
disarmament in accordance with Article VI of the NPT. 
118. Sri Lanka was pleased that a large number of States had signed the CTBT, but was 
concerned that only 21 of the 44 States whose ratification was required for the CTBT to enter 
into force had ratified to date. It was also pleased that France and the United Kingdom had 
ratified it, and hoped that the other nuclear-weapon States would follow suit soon. For its 
part, Sri Lanka, which shared the view that the nuclear-weapon States should refrain from 
undertaking any tests that contravened the spirit of the CTBT, would take steps to ratify at an 
appropriate time. Currently, preparations were being made to bring into operation the CTBT 
monitoring station established in Colombo. 
119. Sri Lanka welcomed IndiaÂs and PakistanÂs commitment to the process of disarmament 
and hoped that those two countries would become parties to the CTBT and the NPT sooner 
rather that later. 
120. His country would like to see the establishment, within the framework of the 
Conference on Disarmament, of an ad hoc committee to negotiate a fissile material cut-off 

GC(43)/OR.3 
page 22 

treaty, which, if non-discriminatory and internationally verifiable, would usefully 
complement the CTBT and the NPT. 

121. While his country welcomed the bilateral negotiations between the Russian Federation 
and the United States and would welcome ratification of START II by the Russian 
Federation, it shared the view that the negotiations on nuclear disarmament should not be the 
preserve of the nuclear-weapon States only. 
122. Finally, successful completion of the negotiations on a convention for the suppression 
of acts of nuclear terrorism would strengthen the international mechanisms designed to 
prevent terrorism, which had become a global threat. 
The meeting rose at 1 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 
(GC(43)/4) 

1. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland), after welcoming Honduras and Angola to 
the Agency, associated himself with the statement which had been made by the representative 
of Finland on behalf of the European Union. Recalling the ever more useful role which the 
Agency was playing, and in particular the numerous international instruments which had been 
negotiated under its auspices, he noted that Poland was on the point of completing the 
ratification process for the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and for the Additional Protocol to its 
safeguards agreement. 
2. His country strongly supported the Agency in the fulfilment of its responsibilities in the 
field of nuclear safety and in the strengthening of the global non-proliferation regime 
instituted by the NPT. It also looked forward to the NPT Review Conference which was to be 
held in the year 2000. 
3. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to combat illicit trafficking of nuclear material and 
ionizing radiation sources by helping States establish accounting and control systems, and 
thanked it for organizing, within the framework of the International Physical Protection 
Advisory Service, a mission to Poland which had made a major contribution to improving 
technical physical protection systems in the country. He also thanked the Governments of the 
United States and the United Kingdom for the financial assistance they had provided in that 
connection. 
4. Turning to technical co-operation and the constant financial problems in that area, he 
expressed support for the SecretariatÂs initiatives aimed at strengthening the efficiency of 
those activities. Partnership in Development was a key element in technical co-operation 
strategy which facilitated the combining of various sources of funding. His country shared 
the opinion that the effectiveness of the technical co-operation programme could be improved 
by careful management of the entire project cycle and better monitoring of all activities, 
whether funded from the TCF, the Regular Budget or extrabudgetary resources. In that 
connection, he announced that Poland would be paying its full share of the TCF. 
5. After many difficulties, the Model Project which was being implemented by the Agency 
in Poland was reaching completion. Work on decommissioning of the research reactor was 
also progressing well. Moreover, a plasma physics centre was being set up in Warsaw with 
funding from UNESCO, the IAEA and the Government. 
6. Poland supported all kinds of technical co-operation among countries in the region. In 
addition to activities carried out with the Agency, it was co-operating with neighbour 
countries in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection through bilateral agreements. 
7. With regard to the programme and budget for the next biennium, he commended the 
SecretariatÂs efforts to maintain a high level of efficiency and expressed support for the new 
idea of a medium-term strategy based on three pillars - technology, safety and verification - 
specifying the AgencyÂs objectives for the period 2001-2005.

8. Mr. ARAMRATTANA (Thailand), after welcoming Angola and Honduras, 
informed the Conference that the Commission which had been instituted by the Treaty on the 
Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone had met for the first time in Singapore in July and 
had directed its executive committee to take all necessary actions to ensure compliance with 
the Treaty and, in particular, to hold consultations with nuclear-weapon States and the 
Agency. In that connection, he welcomed the fact that China was considering signing the 
Protocol to the Treaty, to which all nuclear-weapon States would need to adhere in order to 
enhance security in the region. 
9. Technical co-operation activities in Thailand had included the Model Project on 
extension of neonatal screening to rural areas, and the project on the establishment of a new 
nuclear research centre; Thailand had also contributed to technical co-operation among 
developing countries and to the Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, 
Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology for Asia and the 
Pacific. 
10. His country viewed the development of nuclear power as a possible option and was 
participating in a number of Agency activities in that area. In November 1998, a national 
public information seminar on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had been organized by the 
Thai Government and the Agency with the co-operation of Japan. Public information 
activities on the advantages and risks of nuclear power would be continuing with the holding, 
in February 2000, of a regional public information seminar which Thailand would be hosting 
with the Agency. 
11. Among ongoing activities, he urged the Agency to continue supporting the regional 
project on measuring the effectiveness of multinutrient supplementation (RAS/7/010), which 
showed great potential for identifying cases of malnutrition in mothers and children. He also 
applauded a new initiative on utilization of the vast database already in existence to reinforce 
knowledge in nuclear technology and engineering. The AgencyÂs continuing support for 
public information programmes and waste management programmes was equally welcome. 
Finally, the Agency should extend its activities to involve non-profit-making organizations in 
order to enhance opportunities for technical co-operation and public information. 
12. Despite the economic and financial difficulties it was facing, Thailand remained 
committed to paying its full assessed contribution to the Regular Budget and the TCF for the 
year 2000. Like several other members of the Group of 77, it felt that the issue of funding of 
Agency verification of nuclear weapon control and reduction measures required thorough 
examination. The balance between the AgencyÂs promotional and verification activities had 
to be maintained, both in financial and technical terms. Numerous points needed to be 
clarified before a decision could be taken, in particular funding by Member States and the 
Âpossessor paysÂ principle. 
13. With reference to Article VI of the Statute, Thailand, as a member of the SEAP Group, 
stood ready in the interests of consensus to acquiesce in the proposals for a six-seat increase 
in the size of the Board. It was also prepared to accept an eight-seat increase, on condition 
that the distribution of those seats was acceptable to all regional groups including SEAP and 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 7 

the Far East Group. All regional groups had the right to be consulted on an equal footing and 
it was not right that SEAPÂs interests had not been taken into account. He hoped that the 
consultations henceforth would be marked by greater transparency. 

14. Mr. CHIDAMBARAM (India), after welcoming Angola and Honduras to the 
Agency, read out the following message from the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee: 
ÂThe forty-third General Conference of the Agency marks the end of an era. But as we 
know every end is also a beginning. A new millennium beckons us. And we, as 
responsible Member States, must rise to the occasion and ensure that we leave behind a 
legacy, not a liability, for future generations. 

ÂWe can best ensure this by returning to the fundamentals, shorn of all rhetoric and 
verbiage, and by acknowledging that the primary function of the Agency is to 
encourage and assist research, development and practical applications of atomic energy 
for peaceful purposes throughout the world. In developing countries, atomic energy, 
with its multifarious applications in power generation, improving health standards, 
enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural yields, in controlling pests and in 
water resources management, is seen as the key to a better tomorrow. The International 
Atomic Energy AgencyÂs role in the nuclear power area is particularly significant as 
this source, with the progressive depletion of fossil fuels, is an important option for 
satisfying the future energy needs of developing countries in the long term. 

ÂI take this opportunity to wish the forty-third General Conference of the IAEA all 
success in its deliberations.Â 

15. The main conclusion of the Senior Expert Group which had been convened to review 
the AgencyÂs programme had been that the AgencyÂs ÂmissionÂ was still to Âaccelerate and 
enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the 
worldÂ, to use the language of Article II of the Statute. The most important of the peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy was power generation. While the decision to pursue the 
nuclear power option was of course a national one, the AgencyÂs mandate to promote that 
option in an objective manner should not be eroded in favour of its nuclear safety and 
safeguards responsibilities. Increasingly, the Secretariat had become diffident on matters 
relating to nuclear power which, while it was stagnating in Europe and North America, was 
growing fast in Asia and other parts of the world where it was looked upon as an inevitable 
option to satisfy future energy needs. 
16. From an environmental perspective, it was unfortunate that the Kyoto Conference had 
not explicitly mentioned nuclear power as one of the cleanest sources of energy, despite the 
AgencyÂs efforts in recent years in connection with the Clean Development Mechanism 
provided for by the Kyoto Protocol. Recognizing the importance of the role of nuclear 
energy, India - with the AgencyÂs assistance - had hosted an international seminar in Mumbai 
on the potential role of nuclear power in developing countries, and strategies for its 
deployment. It had also had the honour of receiving a visit from Mr. ElBaradei in February.

17. One of the yardsticks of the economic development of a country was the per capita 
electricity consumption. For the standard of living in India to reach a comparable level to that 
in the developed countries the per capita consumption would have to increase by a factor 
of eight to ten. Studies had indicated that nuclear power would account for an increasing 
share in the electricity mix and should reach the 20 000 MW level by 2020. IndiaÂs efforts to 
accelerate its nuclear power programme had borne fruit, and the performance of its ten 
nuclear power plants had improved considerably over the past three years. 
18. To ensure long-term energy security, India had chosen to follow a Âclosed fuel cycleÂ 
policy which called for the setting up of reprocessing plants and breeder reactors. The 
experience it had gained from the operation of its fast breeder test reactor at Kalpakkam had 
been put to good use in the development of a prototype reactor, construction of which was 
expected to begin in 2001. Moreover, it had always viewed spent fuel as a vital resource; 
reprocessing spent fuel had several advantages from the point of view of waste management. 
19. Turning to the safety of nuclear installations, he noted that the Nuclear Power 
Corporation of India Ltd. was a member of the World Association of Nuclear Operators 
(WANO) which had conducted a peer review at the Kakrapar nuclear power plant in 1998; 
another was planned for the Narora plant in the year 2000. The Indian regulatory authority 
was also closely monitoring the safety of nuclear facilities in the country. With respect to the 
Y2K problem, an in-depth assessment had been carried out and detailed contingency plans 
prepared. 
20. In addition, India was seriously considering adhering to the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material; it had, in effect, been applying the physical protection 
standards prescribed under that convention for some time. In that context, he commended the 
AgencyÂs efforts to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear material. India had an unimpeachable 
record in that regard and export control mechanisms effectively prevented misuse of material, 
equipment or technology exported from India. Its commitment to global nuclear disarmament 
was undiluted. 
21. In the context of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, India was pleased to 
announce that it would be paying its full share to the TCF on time. Once again, he called 
upon the Agency to identify centres of excellence for human resources development within 
the framework of technical co-operation among developing countries, and he reiterated 
IndiaÂs offer to place its training facilities at the disposal of scientists from such countries. 
22. India was strongly interested in fusion because of its potential for clean and safe power 
generation, and it had set up an experimental programme at the Institute for Plasma Research 
where a superconducting tokamak was currently being constructed which, it was hoped, 
would be the first in the world to generate 1000-second pulses. 
23. Recalling the words of Homi Bhabba who, in 1956, had cautioned against the creation 
of a safeguards system which was unrelated to the realities of the world, he reiterated that the 
AgencyÂs mission remained that of enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, 
health and prosperity. In some countries which had reached saturation point in electricity 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 9 

generation nuclear power development was slowing, while others were pressing ahead. 
Nevertheless, it was clear that the introduction of simpler, safer and less costly innovative 
technologies should continue. In that connection, it was to be feared that co-operation 
arrangements involving a limited number of countries - and in particular those which had 
reached saturation point - were unlikely to serve the best interests of countries choosing the 
nuclear power option to satisfy their electricity requirements. The Agency owed it to its 
Member States to promote the widest possible international co-operation. 

24. Mr. QUEIROZ DUARTE (Brazil), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the 
Agency, said that his country attached great importance to nuclear safety which was crucial to 
public acceptance of promotion of the uses of nuclear energy. He therefore commended the 
progress made by the Agency in establishing a worldwide safety regime. 
25. In the area of technical co-operation, Brazil had signed the Regional Co-operation 
Agreement for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and Technology in Latin America and the 
Caribbean (ARCAL) in August 1999. Brazil had been participating in the ARCAL 
programme since its inception in 1984 and had been particularly active in the field of medical, 
environmental, agricultural and industrial applications of nuclear energy, as well as safety. 
On the occasion of its fifteenth anniversary, he commended the significant benefits the 
ARCAL programme had brought to countries in the region, and the Secretariat on its 
extremely competent management of that programme. 
26. In the context of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, Brazil trusted that the 
Secretariat would continue to pay due attention to new challenges relating to nuclear power 
generation, management and disposal of radioactive waste, and radiation and isotope 
applications, particularly in the fields of the environment, water resource management and 
medicine. Continuous evaluation of the needs and interests of Member States was a welcome 
approach, since national development policies and priorities could change over time. It was 
important to continue to take due account of Member StatesÂ interests in the decision-making 
process for technical co-operation projects and activities. As both a receiver and donor under 
the technical co-operation programme, Brazil intended to keep abreast of the latest 
developments in nuclear technology and, at the same time, to continue offering its 
installations and expertise for training and other technical co-operation activities. 
27. Turning to verification, he noted with satisfaction the arrangement approved by the 
Board of Governors in relation to the proliferation risk of neptunium and americium. It was 
highly desirable for all States, both nuclear and non-nuclear, whether or not they were party 
to comprehensive safeguards agreements, to allow the proposed monitoring of such of their 
facilities as had actual or potential capability for neptunium and americium separation, and to 
provide the relevant information. Universal application of that arrangement would certainly 
constitute a positive signal for non-proliferation and global nuclear disarmament. 
28. Brazil was glad to note, with respect to strengthening of the safeguards system, that the 
Board of Governors had just approved the agreement by exchange of letters with the Agency 
confirming that the Quadripartite Agreement between the Republic of Argentina, the 
Federative Republic of Brazil, ABACC and the IAEA for the application of safeguards 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 10 

satisfied the requirements of Article III of the NPT. Also, at the most recent series of 
meetings of the Board of Governors, Brazil and Argentina had reaffirmed their commitment 
to strengthening the safeguards regime by announcing that they were ready to begin 
consultations with the Secretariat with a view to concluding an Additional Protocol to the 
Quadripartite Agreement. They were confident that the unique and successful bilateral 
experience they had gained through ABACC would make a significant contribution to the 
ongoing process of strengthening of the safeguards system. 

29. Non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and global disarmament were 
inseparable objectives. In June 1998, Brazil and seven other countries had signed a 
ministerial declaration entitled ÂTowards a nuclear-weapon-free world: the need for a new 
agendaÂ, which had subsequently been reflected in General Assembly resolution 
A/RES/53/77Y and reintroduced at the current session of the General Assembly. The Ânew 
agendaÂ had also been supported by 32 countries at the Preparatory Committee for 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference. By pointing the way towards a nuclear-weapon-free 
world, all the countries that supported that initiative were underscoring their concern over the 
need to strengthen the universality of the international regime anchored in the NPT and to 
continue to honour commitments undertaken under Article VI of that Treaty. Brazil hoped 
that the Ânew agendaÂ would attract the widest possible support in order to advance the 
common objectives of non-proliferation and disarmament. 
30. With regard to Article VI of the Statute, expansion of the Board of Governors would 
improve representation of the developing countries in that body. It was regrettable that, 
despite the ChairmanÂs efforts, the Board of Governors had not reached final agreement on 
that issue at its preceding series of meetings. Whatever the formula adopted, certain factors 
ought to be taken into consideration, including the impeccable credentials of the Latin 
American and Caribbean region with regard to non-proliferation. Brazil endorsed the urgency 
the Board of Governors had assigned in its report (document GC(43)/12) to further 
consultations on the matter with a view to finding a final solution during the current session 
of the General Conference. That was possible, with the full participation of all countries and 
regional groups in a true spirit of compromise. 
31. In 1999, Brazil had made further major progress in the field of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. Work on the Angra II nuclear power plant had advanced significantly and it 
was expected to go into operation in 2000. Implementation of the nuclear fuel cycle on an 
industrial scale had been completed. In the field of nuclear applications, there had been a 
significant increase in the production of radioisotopes for medical, industrial and scientific 
purposes. In addition, the Brazilian Government had taken steps to ensure that the national 
nuclear programme benefited society as a whole. Consistent investment in nuclear medicine 
in recent years had resulted in a remarkable increase and improvement in radiopharmaceutical 
production, bringing important benefits to the population. The high standard of quality had 
been acknowledged through the awarding of the ISO 9002 certificate. 
32. The Brazilian nuclear programme was therefore in line with the ambitious national 
objective - recently reaffirmed by President Cardoso - of accelerating economic growth while 
at the same time attaching priority to the well-being of the people.

33. Mr. WÃHLK (Denmark), having first of all welcomed Angola and Honduras to 
the Agency, associated himself fully with the statement which had been made by the Finnish 
Minister for Trade and Industry on behalf of the European Union. Denmark considered the 
NPT to be the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and essential to nuclear 
disarmament. The Treaty was close to global coverage, making non-proliferation an almost 
universally accepted principle. Denmark called on those countries which had not yet done so 
to accede unconditionally to the NPT as soon as possible. It fully supported the important 
decisions taken at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference on the indefinite 
extension of the Treaty, the principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament, and strengthening of the Treaty review process. Those decisions should be 
further consolidated at the 2000 Review Conference. 
34. Agency safeguards were an important element of the international non-proliferation 
regime and indispensable to ensuring implementation of the NPT. Once implemented, the 
measures foreseen in the Model Additional Protocol to existing safeguards agreements would 
lead to substantial strengthening of the safeguards system of the Agency, which would then 
be in a better position to detect any clandestine nuclear activities in non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
35. Denmark was party to the Additional Protocol concluded by the Agency, EURATOM 
and the non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union in September 1998, and was doing 
its best to meet its new obligations before the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
36. It was still cause for concern that more than 50 non-nuclear-weapon States party to 
the NPT had not yet signed a safeguards agreement pursuant to the Treaty. Although the 
pending agreements related to States with no significant nuclear activities, it was nevertheless 
important for the universality and the credibility of the NPT and of the safeguards system that 
all States complied with their obligations under the Treaty. 
37. Ever since international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had begun, 
supplier countries had accepted responsibility for ensuring that such co-operation did not 
contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That principle, which was enshrined in the 
NPT, was reflected in the system of multilateral consultations on nuclear export controls 
established after the TreatyÂs entry into force in 1970. Fulfilment of the NPT commitment 
concerning co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy depended on effective export 
control. 
38. The Nuclear Suppliers Group played a particularly important role and had made a 
considerable contribution to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation. Denmark appreciated the 
commitment undertaken at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference to promote 
transparency in nuclear-related export controls within the framework of dialogue and 
co-operation among all interested States party to the NPT. The two seminars on export 
control organized in October 1997 and April 1999 under the auspices of the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group had led to a deeper understanding of the issue by all involved. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 12 

39. Turning to the area of nuclear safety, to which Denmark attached the utmost 
importance, he recalled that in 1985, one year before the Chernobyl accident, his country had 
decided not to include nuclear power in its energy planning. It had taken that decision 
because it felt that, although nuclear power had been known and utilized for a long time, the 
problems of safety and waste storage remained unresolved. That situation had not changed. 
The safety levels at many operating nuclear power plants were unacceptable and management 
of nuclear waste was still unsatisfactory. 
40. His country supported the endeavours aimed at further strengthening safety activities 
and ensuring consistency between the AgencyÂs nuclear, radiation and radioactive waste 
safety activities. The assistance provided by the Agency in that area to the States of Central 
and Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent States was extremely important. 
Nevertheless, Denmark remained of the opinion that the only defensible solution was to shut 
down certain reactors in those States as soon as possible. 
41. Denmark supported the creation of a comprehensive and legally binding nuclear safety 
regime based primarily on the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and 
the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The first meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April had allowed for a useful 
exchange of views on safety issues. It was to be hoped that more States would accede to the 
Convention before the next review meeting took place in 2002. 
42. The need to strengthen the nuclear liability regime was a matter of concern for the 
entire nuclear community. The adoption of the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage was a step in the right direction. 
43. In view of the fact that no permanent solution to the problems of nuclear safety and 
waste storage had as yet been found, Denmark found it disturbing that so much effort was 
being made worldwide to develop nuclear power and felt that the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programme should not be used for that purpose. The programme should be 
demand-driven and should contribute to ensuring that the highest possible safety standards 
were in place in those countries which had chosen the nuclear option. That was particularly 
applicable to the least developed Member States. It was on that understanding that Denmark 
had accepted the TCF target of US $73 million for the year 2000 and had pledged its full 
share of that target. 
44. In spite of the budgetary constraints the Agency was facing, high-priority activities such 
as safeguards should continue to be funded from the core budget. Since no real growth in the 
Regular Budget was anticipated in the coming years, it was imperative that the Agency start 
setting priorities among and within the three pillars of its activities (safety, verification and 
technology). In other words, it should not only make savings but should also choose between 
activities, however painful that might be. Previous balances between programmes did not 
necessarily need be maintained. The report by the Senior Expert Group had been the first 
cautious step. To assist that process, no new activity or project should be approved unless its 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 13 

funding was assured, and no project should be implemented without prior planning as to when 
and how it would be concluded. 

45. Finally, he paid tribute to the competent and devoted work of the Director General and 
the highly qualified staff of the Agency. 
46. Mr. KURDI (Saudi Arabia), having welcomed Angola and Honduras to the 
Agency, recalled the message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to the 
General Conference regretting the lack of progress in implementing commitments pursuant to 
the NPT and in achieving its universality, and urged the States concerned to redouble their 
efforts with a view to making the next NPT Review Conference a success. 
47. At the current session, the General Conference was being called upon to take decisions 
that would help the Agency meet the challenges of the transition to the third millennium, 
including the Y2K problem which the Agency would certainly solve with respect to its own 
activities. The Agency had made commendable efforts to adapt to developments in the 
international arena, in particular in the field of global strengthening of nuclear safety, and to 
the increase in the demand for environmentally friendly methods of generating electricity and 
the intensification of international efforts to consolidate the non-proliferation regime. 
48. Saudi Arabia had always supported the Agency and, as usual, would be paying its 
contributions in full; however, it was concerned that some States were not doing the same, 
which had detrimental effects on Agency activities that addressed essential needs, such as the 
supply of potable water or the fight against disease. It had always been greatly appreciative 
of the AgencyÂs role in the area of control and verification and approved of the strengthening 
of the safeguards system and the AgencyÂs efforts to control illicit trafficking in nuclear 
material and other radioactive sources. While it understood the position of those countries 
which felt that the recent strengthening of controls could only increase the AgencyÂs 
effectiveness in those fields, and thus its role in maintaining peace and security at the regional 
and international level, Saudi Arabia, like other countries, feared that the AgencyÂs constantly 
expanding verification activities, coupled with the tasks which might be entrusted to it in 
connection with the control of special fissile material and monitoring international transfers of 
certain types of material such as neptunium and americium, could constitute a heavy burden 
and slow down or hinder the AgencyÂs activities in the development field. 
49. With regard to Israeli nuclear capabilities and the nuclear threat in the Middle East 
caused by IsraelÂs obstinate refusal to accede to the NPT, Saudi Arabia hoped that the 
Agency, as part of its verification responsibilities, would be able to alleviate its concerns and 
those of neighbouring countries regarding the threat of undeclared nuclear capabilities in the 
region, in accordance with the spirit of the NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty. 
50. Over the years, the technical co-operation programme had proved its effectiveness and, 
through it, the Agency had been able to respond in large measure to the legitimate 
expectations of developing Member States and meet their needs, in line with the objective for 
which it had been set up. The effectiveness of technical co-operation strategy was founded on 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 14 

regional programmes supported by thematic planning and Model Projects aimed at 
meeting the long-term socio-economic needs of the developing countries. However, technical 
co-operation activities could not be implemented without sufficient funding and, for that 
reason, his delegation had always requested that those activities be funded from the Regular 
Budget of the Agency. The idea of sharing the costs of technical assistance activities between 
the Agency and recipient States was excellent, and it would be equally useful to share the 
costs of verification missions as that would allow the Agency to develop its activities without 
putting a strain on its budget. 

51. Saudi Arabia had studied carefully the Director GeneralÂs report on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East (document GC(43)/17, Add.1, Add.1/Corr.1, 
Add.1/Mod.1 and Add.2). Its position on the issue took due account of the concerns of the 
Arab countries over the risks associated with the presence of nuclear weapons in the region, 
its assessment of the current situation and probable developments, and the mediation efforts. 
It was based on the following considerations: 
1. 
Saudi Arabia approved the establishment in the Middle East, as in other regions, 
of a zone free from nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction; 
2. 
It attached great importance to the accession of States in the region to the NPT 
and to their commitment to apply comprehensive safeguards, though most had 
never undertaken nuclear activities requiring the application of safeguards and 
could only gain access to the material required for their nuclear programme after 
concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency. Israel was 
the only State in the region which had not acceded to the NPT; 
3. 
It objected to IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and submit its nuclear 
installations to the Agency control, since that country was carrying out nuclear 
activities for peaceful and non-peaceful purposes; 
4. 
It appealed to all States in a position to do so to persuade Israel at least to accept 
comprehensive safeguards, even if it did not accede to the NPT or similar treaties 
or instruments, and urged the Agency to develop a mechanism for that purpose; 
5. 
It proposed that a denuclearized zone be declared in the Middle East - through the 
medium of the Agency - enabling States in the region to confirm their good 
intentions. In that connection, Saudi Arabia felt that the fact that the region had 
not been clearly defined in United Nations documents and General Assembly 
resolutions should not prevent it from being declared a nuclear-weapon-free zone; 
6. 
It was convinced that any progress depended on the wishes of the parties 
concerned. Saudi Arabia hoped that the pressure exerted by some States on Israel 
would persuade that country to comply with the General Conference resolutions 
on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, and to end its 
procrastination and arrive at a peaceful and lasting settlement with neighbouring 
countries which would facilitate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 15 

in the Middle East. The efforts of the Director General to that end were 
particularly useful. 

52. With regard to efforts to intensify international co-operation with a view to 
strengthening nuclear, radiation and waste safety, he commended the activities of the working 
groups and specialized technical committees which had assisted with the preparation of 
standards documents in that area. He also congratulated the Agency on its work on defining 
safety requirements, regulations and standards, and safe practices for quality assurance at 
various stages of operation, storage and final disposal of waste, decommissioning of facilities, 
protection of human health and the environment, and determination of the responsibilities of 
operators and control services. 
53. Although a consensus had been reached on the sincere desire to arrive at a final solution 
to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, differences still existed on the three aspects of 
the issue, namely expansion of the Board, the criteria for designation, and the composition of 
regional groups. Given the complexity of the issue, whatever time was needed to find an 
appropriate solution should be taken. Saudi ArabiaÂs position on the issue, which had not 
changed, was based on the following three principles: 
1. 
Any expansion of the Board should ensure representation which reflected the 
realities of the international situation and the situation in the regional groups; 
2. 
The number of seats held on the Board should be proportional to the size and the 
role of the different regional groups; 
3. 
Any Member State had the right to join a regional group; to do so, it should hold 
consultations with the members of the group in question. However, no State 
could be imposed on a group; that principle was important to ensuring the 
cohesion of the group in question and a favourable working atmosphere within the 
group, and to enabling it to contribute more effectively to the work of the Board. 
54. Mr. GARCIA III (Philippines), after welcoming Honduras and Angola, thanked 
the Director General for the Annual Report for 1998 and his opening statement on the 
previous day and said that the AgencyÂs efforts to revise the existing safety standards and 
prepare new ones were praiseworthy. Four documents in the ÂSafety RequirementsÂ category 
had been finalized and approved over the preceding year, and several others were in 
preparation. 
55. The Philippine Government recognized the importance of safety of nuclear applications 
and was making efforts to improve the countryÂs legal, administrative and technical 
infrastructure in that area. The Philippines would be participating in a regional project on 
legislation for safe and peaceful nuclear applications with a view to improving its domestic 
laws. The country was in the process of acquiring the necessary resources to respond to 
radiological emergencies, in line with the national radiological emergency preparedness and 
response plan approved by the National Disaster Co-ordinating Council. That comprehensive 
plan covered possible emergency situations both within the country and abroad, insofar as 
they could affect the Philippines.

56. With regard to the Y2K problem, preventive and corrective measures had been taken in 
various facilities, spearheaded by the National Y2K Commission. In that connection, the 
Philippines was grateful to the Agency for its timely and useful advice on safety measures to 
address the Y2K issue. 
57. He welcomed the SecretariatÂs endeavours to strengthen its activities in the area of 
technical co-operation, as detailed in document GC(43)/INF/3. The AgencyÂs TC strategy 
remained very relevant, and the progress with regard to the quality and implementation of 
projects should therefore be sustained. 1999 had been a dynamic year in the Philippines with 
the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute forging new collaborative ties with foreign national 
agencies and domestic private sector firms. The ultimate objective of efforts to promote 
applications of nuclear technology was to bring benefits to end-users. Projects were being 
implemented actively within the framework of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programme, as were RCA projects of regional import. A Philippine initiative in 1996 had 
given rise to the RCA project on Âred tideÂ, a phenomenon affecting the fisheries of many 
coastal countries. In the broader context of the management of marine coastal pollution, a 
wealth of information on radionuclides in water, sediment and biota had now been gathered. 
58. In the oil industry, the use of gamma scanning to resolve problems affecting distillation 
columns had been demonstrated at refineries and that technique was being promoted. In other 
sectors, the Philippines would shortly be hosting two regional activities as part of TCDC, 
namely a course on techniques for reservoir management and a seminar on mutation 
techniques and molecular genetics for tropical and sub-tropical plant improvement in the Asia 
and Pacific region. The Philippines was proud to be recognized increasingly as a centre of 
excellence in areas such as geothermal hydrology, nutrition and agriculture. In that 
connection, it appreciated the technical assistance the Agency had given it, and the latterÂs 
valuable contribution to development objectives. The next biennial technical co-operation 
programme was being eagerly awaited, with proposals beginning to pour in from the health, 
food, environment and industry sectors. 
59. Since the preceding session of the General Conference, two comprehensive safeguards 
agreements and 13 Additional Protocols had been approved by the Board of Governors, and 
the Philippines was pleased to note that they would be concluded shortly. Drawing attention 
to document GC(43)/22, he called upon States Party to the NPT which had not yet done so to 
conclude the safeguards agreement required by the Treaty. In addition, he once again urged 
those States that had concluded safeguards agreements to take the next step, since universal 
adherence to the Model Additional Protocol was essential for the establishment of an 
integrated and cost-effective safeguards system. The Philippines remained firmly committed 
to the NPT and to the broader objective of nuclear disarmament and looked forward to the 
next NPT Review Conference. 
60. Considerable progress had been made in the negotiations to amend Article VI of the 
Statute, and several proposals had been put forward at the BoardÂs last series of meetings with 
a view to reconciling divergent opinions. A final solution to the problem seemed closer than 
ever, and he thanked the Chairman of the Board and all those who had contributed positively 
to the discussions. His delegation shared the widely held view that any expansion of the 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 17 

Board should rectify the under-representation of the developing countries and prevent any 
decrease or cut-back in the number of such countries eligible for election to the Board in the 
future. It supported the current efforts to obtain an increase of eight seats distributed in an 
acceptable manner. 

61. Mr. TAVZES (Slovenia), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency, 
associated himself fully with the statement made by Finland on behalf of the European Union. 
The AgencyÂs role in building a global nuclear safety culture had expanded in recent years. It 
had also been playing a major role in the consolidation of the non-proliferation regime and in 
increasing the contribution of nuclear science and technology to achieving Member StatesÂ 
development goals. Since the inception of its nuclear programme, Slovenia had taken 
advantage of all the expert missions offered to it by the Agency; in 1999, it had received a 
Transport Safety Appraisal Service mission, and an International Regulatory Review Team 
mission would be conducted by the end of the year. 
62. A precondition for the peaceful use of nuclear energy was a well established 
international safety framework which included the legally binding instruments developed 
recently. The openness and transparency shown by the Contracting Parties in their reports, 
and at the first review meeting for the Convention on Nuclear Safety held in Vienna in 
April 1999, had strengthened the safety culture in the international nuclear community. That 
was the only meeting where all the Contracting Parties had been able to address the safety 
issues posed by nuclear power plants both at home and abroad. 
63. Now that the foundations of a legally binding international radioactive waste safety 
regime had been laid, it was time to put it into force. Slovenia had ratified the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management at the beginning of 1999. 
64. Since joining the Agency in 1992 as an independent State, Slovenia had opted for 
unshielded safeguards status, showing its strong commitment to zero proliferation. In that 
same context, it welcomed the measures adopted recently by the Board with respect to 
neptunium and americium. In 1999, Slovenia had adopted new import and export regulations, 
including a new trigger list, and had applied for membership of the Zangger Committee. 
Moreover, the Slovenian Parliament was examining a draft law on dual use and, once it had 
been adopted, his country would apply for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
65. The development of integrated safeguards was a high priority issue, the objective being 
to achieve maximum effectiveness and efficiency by optimizing the use of all measures 
available to the Agency under safeguards agreements and Additional Protocols, which were 
essential for the global peaceful use of nuclear energy. Slovenia had already signed an 
Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement and anticipated ratifying it by the end of the 
year. It urged all States which had not yet done so to sign safeguards agreements and 
Additional Protocols before the next NPT Review Conference. Slovenia welcomed the 
Trilateral Initiative entered into by the IAEA, the United States of America and the Russian 
Federation; it was also among those Member States which had expressed support for the 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 18 

principle of mandatory funding with regard to Agency verification of nuclear arms control 
and reduction measures. 

66. His delegation supported all the AgencyÂs efforts to implement safeguards in the 
Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea and the activities the Agency was carrying out in Iraq 
at the request of the Security Council. 
67. He underlined the importance of the International Physical Protection Advisory Service 
mission to Slovenia, and took note of the initiative taken by some States party to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in holding a meeting in 1999 to 
discuss whether there was a need to revise that Convention. If sufficient States wished to 
address the issues relating to the scope of the Convention, Slovenia was prepared to play an 
active part in the revision process. 
68. Slovenia had been working on the Y2K problem since the middle of 1998 and, inter 
alia, had taken steps to ensure the safety of its nuclear facilities. An Agency mission was due 
to visit the country in October 1999 to review the measures taken, including the contingency 
planning. 
69. With regard to the technical co-operation programme, he recalled that his country had 
benefited greatly from Agency co-operation in the past. In recent years it had been able to 
play a more active role in the organization of training courses and workshops, had hosted an 
average of six meetings a year, provided job training, and made its experts available. That 
reflected in practical terms a change of status: it would soon be a donor rather than a 
recipient. Slovenia had always pledged and paid its share of the target for the TCF in full and 
paid its assessed programme costs. Also worthy of mention were the Country Programme 
Framework approach, which would be applied to all Member States during preparation of the 
1999-2000 technical co-operation programme, and the Model Project concept, which focused 
on the end-user and took account of cost-effectiveness and impact. Technical co-operation 
was most effective when it was fully integrated into national development plans. 
70. Finally, when Slovenia had held the Chair of the Board it had put forward two proposals 
for amendments to the AgencyÂs Statute. Its proposal for the amendment of Article XIV of 
the Statute took account of the wish expressed by many members of the Board of Governors, 
during the examination of the AgencyÂs budget for 2000, for the introduction of Âbiennial 
programmingÂ. The modification Slovenia had suggested to paragraph K of Article VI took 
into account the proposal put forward by Japan. Slovenia strongly believed that the proposed 
formula could satisfy all the views expressed by the Member States over past years. 
71. With regard to the financial situation, it was clear that the Agency could not be asked to 
take on greater responsibilities while its resources were frozen. Furthermore, the AgencyÂs 
Secretariat had exercised financial discipline and embarked on a modernization process with a 
view to better identifying Member StatesÂ needs and priorities. Other ways of making savings 
could surely be found, but equally, in the long run, further reductions in resources could only 
be achieved by reducing the programme, especially with continued reliance on extrabudgetary 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 19 

funding and no improvement in discipline among Agency Member States as regards prompt 
payment of their contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF. 

72. Ms. HERNES (Norway), after welcoming Honduras and Angola, associated 
herself with the statement made by Finland on behalf of the European Union. 
73. Norway attached great importance to the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance nuclear 
non-proliferation by strengthening the effectiveness of the comprehensive safeguards system. 
It commended the Agency on having concluded Additional Protocols with a number of 
countries. Norway would be signing an Additional Protocol during the current session of the 
General Conference which would probably enter into force early the following year. She 
expressed the hope that States which had not yet done so would sign such Protocols as soon 
as possible in order to make the strengthened safeguards system as universal as possible. 
74. Norway was pleased to note that the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety had been held earlier that year and that the Agency had 
already started preparing for the review process foreseen under the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
75. In the following week, the first conference was to be held pursuant to Article XIV of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty in order to facilitate the TreatyÂs entry into force. 
Norway had deposited its instrument of ratification of the Treaty on 15 July 1999, and it 
called on all countries which had not yet done so, and in particular those whose instrument of 
ratification was required for the Treaty to enter into force, to sign and ratify it without delay. 
76. The Agency had a key role to play in relation to early warning and response in the event 
of a nuclear accident, and Norway strongly supported the work the Agency was doing to 
develop and implement practical procedures within the framework of the Early Notification 
Convention and the Assistance Convention. Also, recognizing that the AgencyÂs increased 
efforts to co-ordinate international response would strengthen Member StatesÂ capabilities in 
that area and make the system more cost-effective, she emphasized the importance of 
allocating sufficient financial and human resources to carry out those tasks. 
77. Norway, which attached great importance to the development of coherent and 
up-to-date legislative and regulatory frameworks for nuclear activities, supported the 
assistance programmes for the Newly Independent States which were endeavouring to 
develop their nuclear legislation and urged other countries and the Agency to continue 
supporting those efforts. 
78. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material was a cause for international concern. Norway was 
actively involved in various projects to strengthen prevention and detection systems and had 
hosted a seminar on the topic in 1999. It appreciated the initiatives undertaken by the Agency 
in that sphere and recommended that efforts be intensified, in particular to help various 
countries establish legal frameworks and transparent systems which would enhance detection 
and law enforcement. As the use of nuclear or radioactive material by terrorist groups in the 
future could not be ruled out, it was essential that safeguards, physical protection, illicit 
trafficking and legal frameworks be given a high priority. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 20 

79. Norway welcomed the activities which were being carried out in anticipation of the 
submission of weapons-origin fissile material from the United States and Russia to Agency 
safeguards; those activities were fundamental to non-proliferation. It therefore approved the 
SecretariatÂs plans to establish, in collaboration with those two States, technical measures, 
legal instruments and cost estimates for Agency verification of that material. 
80. Her country also welcomed the activities which were being undertaken by the Agency 
to resolve Y2K computer problems both at the Agency and in Member States and had itself 
taken account of the AgencyÂs recommendations. 
81. Turning to the Medium Term Strategy, she said that the Agency, while maintaining an 
appropriate balance between the separate pillars of its mandate, should always give top 
priority to nuclear safety. Nuclear energy had no future without nuclear safety and, on the 
threshold of the twenty-first century, safety and security issues should take precedence over 
the expansion of nuclear power and nuclear technologies. 
82. In the nuclear safety field, Norway was participating in various projects in northwestern 
Russia relating, inter alia, to the development of government structures, purchase of 
equipment, preparation of regulatory documents, and the application of accountancy systems 
and physical protection measures. A number of projects had already been implemented, or 
were being implemented, under the framework agreement signed by both countries the 
previous year on the assistance Norway proposed giving Russia with the handling of spent 
nuclear fuel and radioactive waste stored under hazardous conditions in the region, and with 
the safety of the nuclear installations on the Kola Peninsula. 
83. A nuclear clean-up strategy, with a list of priority projects, had been established in 
co-operation with the Russian authorities within the CEG under the auspices of the Agency. 
On the basis of the priorities and principles defined in the framework agreement, Norway, the 
United States, the European Commission and various European Union countries were 
working on establishing a multilateral legal framework for provision of assistance to nuclear 
safety projects through the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian 
Federation. 
84. Since 1992, Norway had been participating in a programme to enhance the safety of the 
Kola nuclear power plant and reduce the risk of accidental releases until the reactors could be 
shut down. Reactors where a satisfactory safety level could not be achieved should be shut 
down as soon as possible to protect human health and the environment. Alternative energy 
sources posing fewer risks to the environment should be considered, and it should not be 
forgotten that improving efficiency was one way of not having to increase energy production. 
85. Norway was also participating in the second phase of the Arctic Monitoring and 
Assessment Programme and, together with Russia, was heading the work on radioactive 
contamination. Future activities would focus on environmental monitoring and acquisition of 
new information on the impact of radioactive contamination on human health and the 
environment. The first report under that programme confirmed that radioactive discharges 
from European reprocessing facilities had been detected in the Arctic marine environment. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 21 

Norway welcomed the agreement, under the Oslo-Paris Convention for the Protection of the 
Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, on a reduction in discharges of radionuclides 
into the ocean, the aim of which was to reduce the level of artificial nuclides from releases to 
almost zero by 2020. As a consequence thereof, significant reductions in technetium-99 
discharges from the Sellafield reprocessing plant in the United Kingdom were expected. 
Norway also welcomed the new initiatives undertaken by the Agency in collaboration with 
the International Union of Radioecology to develop a system for protecting species other than 
man from ionizing radiation. 

86. A large number of Member States still did not make pledges to the TCF and the rate of 
increase in the TCF target had slowed down. She urged all Member States to pay their 
contributions in full and on time. 
87. In conclusion, she endorsed the measures taken to increase the number of women in the 
Secretariat, encouraged the Agency to continue its efforts in that direction and pledged her 
countryÂs support. 
88. Mr. BÃHM (Czech Republic), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the 
Agency, associated himself with the statement which had been made by Finland on behalf of 
the European Union and associated countries. 
89. With regard to the safeguards system, the Czech Republic felt that the implementation 
of Additional Protocols would conspicuously increase the transparency of national nuclear 
programmes and would strengthen the AgencyÂs capacity to detect in a timely fashion 
undeclared use of nuclear material, and of nuclear energy in general, for other than peaceful 
purposes. His country had just signed an Additional Protocol to the safeguards agreement it 
had concluded with the Agency pursuant to the NPT. Moreover, the Czech authorities had 
recently resolved the issue of the application of safeguards at the Temelin nuclear power 
plant. Since the beginning of 1998, they had been preparing - in regular consultation with the 
Agency - a new system for registration of nuclear material in the Czech Republic which 
would be Y2K compatible and would ensure continuity of safeguards information provided 
regularly to the Agency. 
90. In line with its international commitments under the NPT, the Czech Republic had been 
applying a strict licensing regime for exports and imports of all items subject to control in the 
nuclear field. In addition, an International Physical Protection Advisory Service mission had 
been sent to the Czech Republic in the second half of 1998 which had concluded that nuclear 
facilities and material in the country were subject to a high level of physical protection. 
91. Nuclear power engineering was an important part of the peaceful nuclear programme of 
the Czech Republic, which was of the opinion that using that form of energy to generate 
electricity was more environmentally friendly and helped preserve limited reserves of fossil 
fuels for future generations, provided of course that standards of nuclear safety and radiation 
protection were maintained at the highest possible level. In the preceding year, the Czech 
Republic had completed a fundamental reform of its legislative and regulatory framework 
which reflected its long experience in the operation of the Dukovany nuclear power plant, 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 22 

current international practice, and the latest findings of science and research. Thus it now had 
modern legislation in that area, and its State supervisory body was independent and had 
sufficient resources to facilitate evaluation of the level of nuclear safety and radiation 
protection in all activities relating to the use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation. 

92. The Czech Government was also sensitive to the international dimension of nuclear 
safety and radiation protection. Thus, it had recently used the mechanism provided by the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety to supply detailed information on the safety requirements in 
force in nuclear power plants operating in the country. It had greatly appreciated the 
frankness and high level of discussion during the first peer review of the Contracting Parties 
to the Convention, which had been organized in April in Vienna. The positive assessment of 
the Czech Republic by the other Contracting Parties was confirmation that it had achieved a 
high level of nuclear safety and radiation protection. 
93. All studies carried out to date at both national and international level had confirmed that 
the Czech organization responsible for the construction and operation of nuclear power plants 
had been achieving good results in all areas, while maintaining a high level of safety and 
making improvements where necessary, with the result that the frequency of operational 
incidents at the Dukovany nuclear power plant had gradually decreased. Construction of the 
Temelin plant was continuing and startup of the first unit was scheduled for the year 2000. 
Lately, the Czech Government had reviewed the economic aspects of that investment, 
including the possible financial risks, and had decided to complete the work, placing its trust 
as regards safety issues in the studies which had been carried out in accordance with current 
national legislation by the national body responsible for safety. 
94. The Czech Republic, as both a beneficiary and a donor country, highly appreciated the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme which was one of the international mechanisms 
that helped promote the development of applications of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation 
in the country. It attached the utmost importance to its Model Project on the use of a 
cyclotron to manufacture short-lived radiopharmaceuticals for use in diagnosis in cardiology 
and oncology, including the creation of a distribution network; that project would soon be 
complete. 
95. Within the limits of its capacities, the Czech Republic was trying to increase its 
participation in the AgencyÂs programme of technical assistance to other countries. Thus, 
in 1998 and 1999 it had contributed $150 000 to a project on the installation of a new system 
for non-destructive monitoring of WWER reactor pressure vessels in Ukraine. Moreover, the 
national nuclear safety body had engaged to support the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the 
radiation protection level within the context of Model Projects over the period 1999-2000. In 
addition, it had undertaken to train 50 experts - over and above its normal quota of fellowship 
holders, in particular from the countries of the former Soviet Union. It should also be 
mentioned that, in 1999 alone, the Czech Republic had organized ten seminars and training 
courses. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 23 

96. In conclusion, he noted that the Director General had made a successful visit to the 
Czech Republic in November 1998 which constituted an important milestone in co-operation 
between his country and the Agency. 
97. Mr. GOMIS (Spain) welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency and 
associated himself fully with the statement which had been made by Finland on behalf of the 
European Union. He said that he would limit his comments to some points of particular 
interest to his country. 
98. In 1998, Spanish nuclear power plants had generated some 59 GWÂ·h, which 
constituted 30.1% of the total amount of electricity produced and an increase of 6.7% 
over 1997; the availability had been 91.5% in 1998 and the average load factor 88.4%. 
Driven by the need to adapt to the more competitive environment created by the liberalization 
of the economy, efforts were being made to optimize costs by increasing plant power level, 
and to integrate plant management. However, safety remained a constant concern and could 
not be allowed to suffer as a result of the measures to improve competitiveness. The best way 
of maintaining and even strengthening safety within the context of a cost optimization 
programme was to improve knowledge of the technology; that was why emphasis was being 
placed on R&D activities. 
99. Under the new general radioactive waste plan approved by the Spanish Government in 
July 1999, the procedures to be followed and technical solutions to be applied to such waste 
had been reviewed. Most of the procedures adopted were similar to those in the preceding 
plan, but the strategy for final disposal of spent fuel and high-level waste had been modified. 
In view of the temporary storage solutions currently available, it had been deemed wise to 
defer any decision on final disposal until 2010; in the interim, Spain would continue to 
participate in research into storage in deep geological formations and into separation and 
transmutation. 
100. Decommissioning of Unit 1 of the VandellÃ³s plant had begun: some components were 
currently being disassembled and the waste management plan put into action. Those 
operations would clear 80% of the site and should be complete by the end of 2002. There 
would then be a delay of 30 years before the decommissioning was concluded. 
101. Additional Protocols to safeguards agreements were being signed at a very pleasing 
pace. SpainÂs Protocol was in the process of being ratified; that process should be complete 
within the next few months. In that context, he welcomed in particular the signing of an 
Additional Protocol by Cuba, the first country with an INFCIRC/66-type safeguards 
agreement to do so. However, it should not be forgotten that several countries with nuclear 
facilities had not yet signed Additional Protocols, and he expressed the hope that efforts 
would be redoubled to ensure the universal application of the Protocol. 
102. The elaboration and implementation of new safeguards measures, and their integration 
into the existing system, should result in arrangements which were better adapted to current 
realities. The credibility of the safeguards system and, in the last analysis, of the Agency 
itself were at stake. The Department of Safeguards should attach the highest priority to the 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 24 

matter and should be very selective in the launching of new activities. That reservation did 
not apply to the Trilateral Initiative which aimed at establishing a verification system for 
fissile material that had become excess to requirements thanks to nuclear disarmament 
activities. He hoped that the efforts which were being made in that direction would soon be 
crowned with success, and that the Director General would be in a position to submit to the 
Board of Governors a new model safeguards agreement which would differ from existing 
agreements in technical, legal and financial terms; in particular, matters such as the need to 
ensure irreversibility of use of the fissile material, the estimated costs, and the system of 
funding would need to be clarified. 

103. Spain had made its position on the financial aspects of that initiative clear: in taking on 
new verification tasks, the Agency should not depart from the principle of zero growth in the 
budget. Article XIV.C of the Statute could perhaps be applied; however, a special fund could 
be considered as long as contributions to it were strictly voluntary. Though it was essentially 
the responsibility of the nuclear-weapon States where the verification activities would be 
taking place to supply the funds in question, other countries or international organizations 
could of course contribute. Until new specific safeguards agreements of the kind mentioned 
were concluded, the Agency should of course continue to apply safeguards in nuclear-weapon 
States pursuant to their voluntary-offer agreements to the extent that its budgetary constraints 
allowed, or using voluntary contributions made for that purpose by the States in question. 
104. The results of the first peer review organized under the Convention on Nuclear Safety 
were highly satisfactory. Most participants had given a frank analysis of the situation in their 
country. Spain had been anxious to play an active part in that meeting and had presented a 
detailed report on the steps it had taken to meet its obligations under the Convention. The 
meeting had demonstrated that States attached the utmost importance to nuclear safety, and 
the frank discussion which had taken place on such complex subjects as the independence of 
the regulatory body or the safety of older nuclear power plants had given rise to a detailed and 
objective final report which augured well for the future. It was to be hoped that that would 
encourage countries which had not yet done so to ratify the Convention soon. 
105. By contrast, it was disturbing how few countries had ratified the Joint Convention on 
the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
Spain had ratified that Convention in May 1999 and hoped that many other countries would 
follow its lead soon. It was also ready to take part in the elaboration of rules and procedures 
for the implementation of the Convention. In that connection, he recalled that the 
International Conference on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management would be held in 
Cordoba in March 2000 under the auspices of the Agency, the Nuclear Energy Agency of 
the OECD, and the European Union. There could be no doubt that the international 
community would take a close interest in that conference which should help resolve various 
issues of concern to both the public and politicians. 
106. His delegation had examined with interest document GC(43)/INF/8 on measures to 
strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety. It attached great 
importance to the AgencyÂs IRS, OSART, ASSET and IRRT services. Several OSART and 
ASSET missions had been sent to Spanish nuclear power plants, and they had prompted 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 25 

major reviews and had confirmed the high priority accorded to safety in Spanish nuclear 
facilities. The Agency had also done an excellent job of acting as a central point for exchange 
of information on the Y2K problem. Spain had allocated considerable resources to that issue 
in order to ensure it was in a position to cope with any problems, and it would continue to 
pass on the results it had achieved in that area to other States through the intermediary of the 
Agency. 

107. He called once more upon all countries to reinforce their national arrangements for the 
control of radiation sources; it was important to be aware that losing control of such sources 
could give rise to serious risks to public health and the economy not only in the country 
concerned, but also in other countries. The action plan which the Board of Governors had 
just adopted in that regard constituted an important step and Spain, for its part, had taken a 
series of measures with a view to dealing with the problem. However, such arrangements 
could only be truly effective if there was rigorous control of radiation sources in all countries 
of origin of such sources. Spain was prepared to support any initiative by the Agency aimed 
at promoting co-operation with other competent international organizations, in particular the 
Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD. Such co-operation should ensure that the AgencyÂs 
resources were utilized in a more rational manner. 
108. Radiation protection of patients exposed to radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic 
purposes was attracting increasing attention owing to the numerous radiotherapy accidents 
which had been occurring. International co-operation through the Agency with a view to 
promoting better exchange of information and experience on radiation protection of patients 
would be most useful. An international conference on radiation protection in medicine could 
make recommendations which would enable the Director General to submit proposals for the 
strengthening of activities in that field. Spain was ready to assist in any way with the holding 
of such a conference, which it would gladly host. 
109. His country supported the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities through various 
voluntary contributions in cash and in kind in addition to its contribution to the Technical 
Co-operation Fund, and it was involved in many co-operation programmes and projects. It 
had played an active part in the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of nuclear power 
plants with WWER and RBMK reactors which had been completed in 1998. The success of 
that programme had encouraged it to participate in the extrabudgetary programme on nuclear 
installation safety in Asia as well, to which it had paid a contribution of $66 000. 
110. Mr. KIENER (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, welcomed 
Honduras and Angola to the Agency. 
111. The main international instrument in the field of non-proliferation was the regime 
instituted by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) together with the 
decisions taken at the NPT Review and Extension Conference of 1995. It was regrettable that 
the Preparatory Committee for the 2000 NPT Review Conference had not succeeded in 
adopting substantive recommendations on the full application and universality of the 
Treaty; that delicate task would therefore be left to the Conference itself. The nuclear 
non-proliferation regime had not gone unchallenged, and the situation in the PeopleÂs 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 26 

Democratic Republic of Korea and in Iraq, and the obstacles those countries had placed in the 
way of the Agency in its efforts to monitor implementation of their safeguards agreements, 
continued to be a source of serious concern. The Conference on Disarmament had still not 
reached agreement on a working programme which would authorize the opening of 
negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for military uses, and he 
called upon all members of the Conference to start negotiations as soon as possible with a 
view to concluding a treaty which would be non-discriminatory and verifiable by the 
international community. 

112. Switzerland wished to contribute to the strengthening of the safeguards system by 
ratifying an Additional Protocol. However, progress in the implementation of the 
non-proliferation regime had to be balanced: new constraints on non-nuclear-weapon States 
were only acceptable if they were matched by progress in nuclear disarmament. That 
principle should be taken into account when considering the funding of any possible new 
verification activities to be undertaken by the Agency. 
113. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was in the process of being implemented. 
Switzerland was on the point of ratifying it and would be participating in the conference of 
State Parties in October 1999. It was important that the Treaty enter into force without delay, 
and that there be full adherence by all nuclear powers. The ratification procedure for the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management was also under way. 
114. Though Switzerland was conducting research on the storage of high-level waste, it 
remained open to the option of participating in an international storage project. A solution of 
that kind would offer many advantages, particularly from the point of view of 
non-proliferation and reduction of Agency verification costs. For any international solution 
to be acceptable, adequate security arrangements would have to be in place in the receiving 
country, a state-of-the-art repository would have to be in existence, and transfer of waste from 
one country to another would have to be carried out within the framework of an agreement 
based on international law. An international framework needed to be established for the 
transfer and storage of high-level waste. The Agency was best placed to study the legal and 
institutional aspects of the problem, and its potential role as a participant in or guarantor of 
multilateral agreements also deserved consideration. It should undertake that task as soon as 
possible. 
115. On a national level, the process of dialogue which the Ministry of Energy had launched 
several years ago with the aim of defining future energy policy was partially complete, inter 
alia with regard to the economical use of energy and the promotion of renewable energy 
sources. By contrast, it had not been possible to reach consensus on the nuclear energy issue, 
and repeated attempts by the interested parties to reach agreement on the operational life of 
existing plants and on waste storage had failed: in Switzerland, nuclear power remained a 
political stumbling block. 
116. With regard to storage of nuclear waste, environmental organizations had requested that 
the possibility be studied of replacing the current approach, i.e. permanent storage, with 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 27 

controlled long-term storage; experts were studying the matter. In the meantime, the granting 
of authorization to store low- and intermediate-level waste at the Wellenberg site had been 
blocked for political reasons. By contrast, work on the construction of the WÃ¼renlingen 
intermediate storage centre was going ahead; the centre should enter into service at the 
beginning of the year 2000 and would be capable of accepting spent fuel and high-level 
waste. In addition, low- and intermediate-level waste could be treated in a processing facility 
or incinerated in a plasma furnace. Lastly, geological research was still in progress with a 
view to selecting rock formations suitable for burying high-level waste, and some of the 
results obtained so far were promising. 

117. The Swiss Government was of the opinion that the law on atomic energy of 1959 was in 
need of revision. A new draft law which was still in preparation would redefine procedures 
and competencies; it would also contain a clause on an optional referendum which would 
allow citizens to express their views before the construction of any new nuclear plant in 
Switzerland. The opponents of nuclear energy had announced that they had collected 
sufficient signatures to introduce two amendments to the Constitution: the first aimed at 
prolonging the current nuclear moratorium by ten years and prohibiting any increase in the 
capacity of existing nuclear power plants; and the second demanded the decommissioning of 
existing plants after 30 years of operation and the permanent abandonment of spent fuel 
recycling. Finally, in 1999 it had been reported that rail shipments of spent fuel elements had 
shown levels of contamination in excess of the current norms; the source of the contamination 
had been identified and the necessary measures taken. 
118. As at the preceding session, Switzerland - concerned as it was about the balancing of 
the AgencyÂs budget - supported a zero growth budget applied flexibly. It continued to 
appreciate and support the AgencyÂs activities, and the central role the latter played in 
promoting international co-operation and security. 
119. Mr. HEATHCOTE (United Kingdom), having fully endorsed the statement made 
by the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry on behalf of the European Union, said that, 
although the past 12 months had been characterized by progress on such important issues as 
the AgencyÂs future priorities and its funding regime, he was concerned by the slow progress 
or lack of progress in other areas. 
120. He welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative in producing a draft Medium Term 
Strategy, which he regarded as an essential tool to ensure that the AgencyÂs activities 
remained relevant and useful. However, the existing draft required further work, particularly 
in terms of defining priorities and performance indicators, and identifying areas of work 
which could be phased out. 
121. The proposal to amend Article XIV of the Statute in order to allow for biennial 
budgeting was also a welcome move, since it should enable the Agency to plan its activities 
better while still maintaining an effective overview. The Agency should, of course, use the 
possibilities offered by biennial budgeting wisely, without stretching its limited resources too 
far. The United Kingdom would continue to participate fully in the budget process with a 
view to ensuring that the Agency identified its priorities efficiently and effectively. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 28 

122. Significant progress had been made towards the implementation of the strengthened 
safeguards system. He congratulated the Director General on having submitted Additional 
Protocols with 45 States to the Board for approval; those States included a number with 
significant nuclear activities, and he urged all States which had not yet done so to conclude 
and sign an Additional Protocol as soon as possible. 
123. The next stage would be to implement those agreements. The United Kingdom was 
continuing its efforts to put the necessary legislation in place and, over the next few weeks, it 
would be transmitting to the Agency a voluntary declaration containing the information that it 
was required to provide under its Additional Protocol, thereby demonstrating its commitment 
to the strengthening of safeguards. He urged all States to do their utmost to support the 
SecretariatÂs efforts to secure the rapid implementation of the strengthened safeguards system 
which would help optimize Agency safeguards through the integration of the old and new 
measures. 
124. The United Kingdom was disappointed at the lack of progress in the area of 
non-proliferation during the past 12 months. The third session of the Preparatory Committee 
for the 2000 NPT Review Conference had only been able to reach agreement on procedural 
arrangements for the Conference. The latter would be very important for the nonproliferation 
regime, since it would provide an opportunity to look back over the previous five 
years and set an agenda for making real progress over the following five years. The United 
Kingdom would do its utmost to contribute to its success. 
125. It was very regrettable that the negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty in the 
Conference on Disarmament had not started, although an ad hoc committee had been 
established for that purpose. His country remained committed to playing an active role in 
those negotiations because it believed that such a treaty would constitute a major step forward 
in the area of non-proliferation, and he urged all States to facilitate the start of negotiations at 
the next session of the Conference on Disarmament. 
126. The situation in Iraq and the DPRK continued to cause concern. Like its partners in the 
European Union, the United Kingdom commended the AgencyÂs work in investigating IraqÂs 
clandestine nuclear programme but was deeply concerned at the fact that, since 
December 1998, it had been unable to fulfil its mandate in that country. He called on Iraq to 
resume full co-operation with the Agency immediately. 
127. The United Kingdom was also concerned by the DPRKÂs continuing refusal to 
co-operate with the Agency and he urged the DPRK to comply with its commitments under 
its safeguards agreement and to co-operate fully with the Director General. He hoped that the 
fruitful discussions that had taken place earlier in the month between the United States and 
the DPRK marked the beginning of a commitment by the latter not to destabilize the region 
by its missile proliferation activities, and to behave responsibly in international affairs. 
128. His country continued to support the AgencyÂs active role in the field of nuclear safety, 
and in particular the priority given to the revision of existing safety standards and the 
preparation of new standards. The International Conference on the Strengthening of Nuclear 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 29 

Safety in Eastern Europe, organized in June 1999, had highlighted the technical and 
operational improvements that had been made in many States during the past decade to 
strengthen safety, and the major changes that had been made to their legislative and 
regulatory infrastructures. The United Kingdom endorsed the ConferenceÂs conclusions that 
further improvements in nuclear safety in Eastern Europe remained desirable, notably in 
terms of strengthening the technical capabilities and enforcement powers of independent 
nuclear regulators. 

129. The United Kingdom had been pleased to provide additional funding to the Agency for 
its technical co-operation projects in the area of safety and for its work on the Y2K problem. 
He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to increase international awareness of the risks 
associated with potential Y2K computer failures and the way it had helped countries share 
their experience in that area. 
130. The open and frank discussion that had taken place at the first review meeting held 
under the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April 1999 had been very encouraging. The 
success of that meeting fully justified the confidence of the Contracting Parties, which had set 
up that peer review mechanism in order to promote continuous improvement in nuclear safety 
levels worldwide, and it augured well for future review meetings in which the United 
Kingdom intended to continue to play an active role. 
131. His country continued to support the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. It had 
once again paid its full share of the target for the TCF in 1999 and had paid additional 
voluntary contributions in a number of areas. 
132. The External Auditor had made a number of comments and useful recommendations on 
the subject of the technical co-operation programme. The United Kingdom fully endorsed 
those comments and recommendations and believed that the Agency should act upon them 
with a view to improving the programme still further. All parties should play a role in that 
endeavour, and he urged those States that had not yet done so to pay their share of the TCF 
target and their assessed programme costs in full and on time. 
133. Mr. EL-FEKI (Egypt), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency, 
said that his country attached great importance to the goals of worldwide non-proliferation 
and nuclear disarmament. There was a particularly pressing need to make progress in those 
areas in the Middle East, since the outdated deterrent strategy posed a threat to peace and 
stability in the whole region. Egypt had been working since 1974 to establish a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and, as a logical extension of that aim, on 
8 April 1990 President Mubarak had called for the establishment of a zone free of all weapons 
of mass destruction in the region. Within the Agency, Egypt had recommended the 
application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East as an 
essential step towards ensuring nuclear non-proliferation at regional and international level; it 
had also proposed that the Agency prepare a model agreement for the application of 
safeguards and for the verification of compliance with legal obligations stemming from the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 30 

134. Following the Madrid Middle East Peace Conference, multilateral negotiations had 
been initiated at EgyptÂs request on the vital issue of disarmament and security in the Middle 
East, on which a regional agreement would have to be reached in order to achieve genuine 
peace and stability in the region. It was clear that agreement could not be reached in a 
region characterized by military imbalance. The resolution on the Middle East 
(NPT/CONF.1995/32/RES/1) adopted by the participants of the 1995 NPT Review and 
Extension Conference, including the three depositary States, had reaffirmed the importance 
the international community attached to nuclear disarmament in the region. All those States 
which had supported the resolution, and especially the depositary States, had a responsibility 
to ensure that its provisions were implemented, in particular within the framework of the NPT 
Review Conference that would be held the following year. 
135. All Arab States without exception had acceded to the NPT and had placed their nuclear 
facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards, thereby demonstrating their confidence in 
the non-proliferation regime and their desire to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. Israel was the only country in the region that had not acceded to the Treaty; it had also 
not given any indication that it intended to do so, and it refused to place its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. 
136. For its part, Egypt would continue to favour dialogue between the parties in the region 
and encourage the Agency to take steps to establish an appropriate framework for regional 
arrangements that might prove acceptable. It therefore expected the other party to show the 
same determination to achieve the common objective of eliminating the risks of nuclear 
weapons in the region, and to demonstrate the necessary commitment and credibility by 
initiating a dialogue on ways of achieving that objective, particularly since Egypt had already 
taken constructive steps within the Agency and the United Nations General Assembly to 
create a suitable climate for the initiation of genuine dialogue on the denuclearization of the 
Middle East and the other aspects of security and stability in the region. 
137. Egypt believed that technical co-operation, like non-proliferation, was an essential 
aspect of the AgencyÂs programme and an integral part of its work to promote the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy. While certain States were really not able to pay their contributions to 
the TCF owing to their economic and political situation, others, invoking the AgencyÂs 
Statute, looked upon the ÂvoluntaryÂ nature of contributions to the TCF as lending a 
certain legitimacy to their failure to pay. Those contributions should be regarded - at least 
politically - as compulsory. Member States, whether donors or recipients, should honour all 
their commitments and pay their contributions to the Fund regularly and in full in order to 
ensure the smooth implementation of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. 
138. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, some States had said that the 
issue of Board expansion should be linked to that of the composition of regional groups. It 
was true that a complex political issue was involved, but the logic of that linkage was not 
clear to Egypt, which had nevertheless shown flexibility and understanding in accepting the 
principle of linkage with a view to solving the problem of the composition of regional groups 
and the problem of criteria in a manner acceptable to all. He reaffirmed EgyptÂs support for 
the African position that the Board should be increased by at least seven seats. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 31 

139. Egypt was strengthening its programmes related to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
and making sure that they were transparent and implemented in accordance with the 
safeguards system and the standards established for nuclear safety and the protection of 
workers, the public and the environment. The commissioning in February 1998 of its second 
research reactor - with a capacity of 22 MW -and of its reactor fuel fabrication plant had 
enabled it to enter a new phase on the industrial and technological plane. 
140. The Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority was participating actively in regional and 
international programmes, and in training courses and scientific conferences on the 
development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, particularly within the framework of the 
activities carried out by the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, the Middle Eastern Regional 
Radioisotope Centre for the Arab Countries, and the AFRA programme, in co-operation with 
the African States. In that connection, Egypt had welcomed the meetings held in April 1999 
in connection with the tenth anniversary of the African Regional Co-operative Agreement for 
Research, Development and Training Related to Nuclear Science and Technology, and the 
third African symposium on nuclear science and technology, thereby demonstrating the 
importance it attached to regional co-operation within the framework of AFRA. 
141. Convinced of the importance of developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to 
ensure the well-being of its people, Egypt was evaluating, in co-operation with the Agency, 
alternative strategies and technologies in the area of electricity production and, in particular, 
nuclear power, which it would need during the coming decades. Since its water resources for 
irrigation were limited, it was conducting a technical and economic feasibility study on the 
construction of a nuclear power plant to be used for electricity generation and seawater 
desalination, in order to decide on the best option in preparation for the next stage when it 
would be implementing a project on electricity generation and desalinated water. 
142. Mr. RAMAKER (Netherlands), endorsing the statement made by the Finnish 
Minister for Trade and Industry on behalf of the European Union, said that his country was 
planning to ratify before the 2000 NPT Review Conference the Additional Protocol with the 
Agency which it had signed one year previously together with the 12 other 
non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union and EURATOM. He noted with pleasure 
how many other countries were in the process of negotiating, signing and ratifying Additional 
Protocols and urged all States that had not yet done so, including those that had not concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements, to follow that example. His country welcomed the 
Director GeneralÂs statement to the effect that the integration of ÂclassicalÂ and additional 
safeguards measures was a matter of priority, since it was convinced that an integrated 
safeguards system was a prerequisite for meeting the challenges which lay ahead. 
143. The Agency would have an important role to play in the future in the arms control and 
verification field. The verification of surplus weapons-grade material from dismantled 
nuclear weapons in the Russian Federation and the United States deserved priority, as all 
States would benefit from the enhanced global security it would bring. A number of 
important questions still needed to be settled, such as the scope of verification and funding, 
and he called upon all States to engage in a serious discussion of those issues. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 32 

144. Although the review meeting organized under the Convention on Nuclear Safety had 
been a success, the effectiveness of the Convention would of course depend on the measures 
taken by the Parties pursuant to the recommendations and suggestions made during the review 
process. The safety authorities in the Netherlands were paying close attention to the 
comments of their colleagues. In particular, they fully supported the recommendation that the 
Netherlands should maintain enough technically qualified staff to ensure that its level of 
nuclear safety remained high. 
145. Several conclusions in the report of the review meeting focused on older power plants 
in Central and Eastern Europe that did not meet internationally accepted safety standards. As 
some of those plants could not be upgraded to meet those standards, the countries concerned 
and the international community should put more effort into planning and preparing for their 
speedy decommissioning. Some of the countries concerned were heavily dependent on the 
electricity generated by those plants and international assistance would need to be provided to 
them in that regard. 
146. He commended the intensive efforts the Agency had made as co-ordinator of the 
international efforts to deal with the Y2K problem in nuclear power plants. His country had 
supported those endeavours from the outset through financial contributions and the provision 
of cost-free experts for technical missions. It was prepared to continue providing such 
assistance, on the understanding that the focus might shift from problems in nuclear power 
plants themselves to related problems in electricity networks. 
147. The Netherlands had only one nuclear power plant which would stay in operation 
until 2003; another had been shut down for economic reasons related to the liberalization of 
the electricity and gas market, currently one of the main objectives of national energy policy. 
Furthermore, two studies on the advantages and disadvantages of spent fuel reprocessing and 
direct storage had been carried out at the GovernmentÂs request; on the basis of those studies 
and subsequent discussions in Parliament, the Government had concluded that there were no 
pressing reasons to modify the current strategy based on reprocessing. That view had been 
largely accepted by Parliament. 
148. Mr. BOTA (Romania), after welcoming Honduras and Angola to the Agency, said 
that his GovernmentÂs nuclear policy encompassed not only the development and use of 
nuclear energy, but also the establishment and enforcement of legislation and regulations to 
ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety and prevent proliferation. Romania, which had 
long supported the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, was now benefiting from its investment 
with nuclear energy accounting for approximately 10% of its electricity output. The 
Government had always attached high priority to safety and protection of the environment 
and the public, and the nuclear industry was one of the most closely controlled industries in 
Romania. 
149. Over the preceding year, a National Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation 
had been established with a mandate to promote nuclear energy applications and R&D 
programmes through the National Atomic Energy Agency. There were two governmental 
organizations responsible for nuclear safety: the National Commission for Nuclear Activities 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 33 

Control (which enforced the regulations), and the "NuclearelectricaÂ company (which 
constructed and operated CANDU reactors). Following the privatization of commercial 
energy production and distribution, the ÂNuclearelectricaÂ company, the Autonomous 
Company for Nuclear Activities and the National Uranium Company had assumed control, 
with the Ministry of Trade and Industry co-ordinating activities. 

150. Unit 1 of Cernavoda, the first Romanian nuclear power plant, was equipped with a 
CANDU-6 reactor and was managed by Romanian specialists; it had been in operation since 
December 1996, and by August 1999 it had generated over 15 million MWCh and had 
attained a gross capacity factor of 98%. The Government viewed the completion of 
Cernavoda Unit 2 as a strategic objective and had entrusted an interministerial committee 
with the task of concluding a financing agreement for that purpose. The Agency and the 
technical assistance it provided to Romania had made a major contribution to the safe 
operation of Unit 1. 
151. The National Agency for Science, Technology and Innovation had recently adopted a 
national research, development and innovation plan for 1999-2002 consisting of four 
programmes, including one to promote applied research in the nuclear field and another on 
international co-operation and partnership arrangements in the nuclear research field. The 
objective of the plan was to meet the countryÂs medium- and long-term needs, taking into 
account the objectives of the European UnionÂs Fifth Framework Programme for the countries 
of Central and Eastern Europe and the AgencyÂs technical assistance requirements. 
RomaniaÂs participation in the Fifth Framework Programme opened up new co-operation 
opportunities for it, and it attached particular importance to the involvement of Romanian 
institutes in EURATOM research projects on fission and fusion. 
152. The financial support provided by the Agency had taken the form of research contracts, 
expert missions, fellowships and national and regional projects. The Secretariat had 
displayed a high degree of competence and effectiveness, and the technical co-operation 
programme gave Romania valuable assistance with the transfer of equipment and know-how 
and the training of experts. In addition, the Agency and the United States had given Romania 
unfailing support in nuclear power development; that support had taken many forms, 
including footnote-a/ projects, even if those projects required a great deal of funding. The 
project on the conversion of the 14 MW TRIGA reactor core at the Pitesti Institute for 
Nuclear Power Research was worthy of mention. The two Model Projects on strengthening 
of the Romanian nuclear safety regulatory authority and the technical review of spent fuel dry 
storage at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant should also be noted. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 34 

153. Moreover, fellowship holders and specialists from several developing countries had 
received training in Romania in 1998 and 1999. He hoped that those activities would 
continue, and that his country would be in a position to go on sharing its expertise with other 
developing countries. Furthermore, Romania was willing to host courses and provide 
on-the-job training in its nuclear facilities and specialized institutes as part of the regional 
technical co-operation programme for Europe. Finally, two seminars on public awareness 
had been organized in 1998 and 1999 at the initiative of the National Atomic Energy Agency, 
with the support of the Agency; as a follow-up to those, a national centre for public 
information in the nuclear field was soon to be established. 
154. The first review meeting organized under the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 
April 1999 had demonstrated that the Convention was a valuable instrument for evaluating 
and improving nuclear safety. Romania was currently assessing the lessons learnt from the 
review and would continue to meet fully its obligations under that Convention. 
155. The Y2K action plan would make the Agency a centre for exchange of information on 
diagnostic and remedial actions to be taken. All nuclear facilities in operation in Romania 
had prepared themselves for the changeover to the year 2000 by implementing a special 
programme based on the requirements of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
156. Romania supported all steps taken by the Agency to ensure that safeguards were applied 
in the most effective and efficient manner possible. The Additional Protocol to the safeguards 
agreement between Romania and the Agency had been approved by the Board of Governors 
and signed in June 1999. The Government of Romania looked forward to the assumption by 
the Agency of new verification tasks relating to nuclear arms control and reduction, and felt 
that the Agency should continue its long-standing tradition of accepting all requests for the 
application of safeguards. 
157. Ms. PELLICER (Mexico), having welcomed Honduras to the Agency, said that 
the ongoing session of the General Conference was a good opportunity to re-evaluate the 
AgencyÂs activities and consider structural modifications, so as to adapt the organization to 
current circumstances and strengthen its role in the future. Her country attached great 
importance to the strengthening of technical co-operation and felt that the efficient integration 
and co-ordination of the AgencyÂs activities, particularly in the areas of technical cooperation 
and nuclear applications, would be very beneficial to the Agency and Member 
States. The Secretariat should therefore make moves to develop a co-ordination programme 
with a view to ensuring consistent and integrated planning of the activities of the Department 
of Technical Co-operation and the Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications. 
158. Turning to the programme on comparative assessment of energy sources, she 
commended the Secretariat on its work to develop methodological tools to facilitate 
decision-making. It was to be hoped that the comparative assessments of all energy supply 
options would provide a useful evaluation framework for all Member States, many of which 
were searching actively for other energy sources to replace those which generated greenhouse 
gases. Her country was of the opinion that it would not be possible to forgo nuclear power in 
the medium and long term, and the decision to extend the analysis time horizon to the 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 35 

year 2100 for tasks related to the role of nuclear power in sustainable energy development and 
in the mitigation of potential climate changes was therefore wise. 

159. The activities undertaken as part of the programme on co-ordination of safety-related 
activities (development of guidelines, follow-up and application of relevant conventions, 
exchange of information and assistance to Member States) fully met the concerns of Member 
States and the international community and laid the foundations for convincing the public that 
nuclear energy was a prerequisite for development. 
160. Mexico was of the view that the Agency should begin to consider the possibility of 
extending its activities in the safeguards field to promote a universal non-proliferation regime 
covering vertical proliferation. It therefore welcomed the agreement recently reached in the 
Board of Governors on measures to address the proliferation potential of neptunium and 
americium. However, that agreement would only have positive results if the nuclear-weapon 
States fulfilled their responsibilities. She therefore requested the Director General to keep 
Member States informed of progress with the implementation of the measures adopted by the 
Board of Governors. 
161. Her country was also looking forward to the Director GeneralÂs report on Agency 
verification of fissile material declared surplus to requirements by the Russian Federation and 
United States of America. The financial implications of the tripartite agreement between 
those two countries and the Agency should be examined as soon as possible, as well as the 
legal provisions which would need to be adopted to ensure that the AgencyÂs work was viable 
and credible, since the voluntary-offer agreements did not contain any irrevocable 
commitments. 
162. The results of applying safeguards in nuclear-weapon States showed that that work was 
useful, should continue, and should even be intensified, not only for political and moral 
reasons, but also because it raised the technical abilities of the inspectors involved. 
163. Mexico therefore called upon Member States to support the Agency in that area, which 
was vital for the non-proliferation regime, and even to encourage it to contribute to the efforts 
of the international community in the disarmament field. 
164. Over the preceding year, Mexico had made significant progress in the nuclear field. A 
project had been successfully implemented that had raised the power levels of both units in 
operation at the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant by approximately 30 MW(e). Constant 
efforts were being made at the plant to promote a safety culture. It was a member of the 
World Association of Nuclear Operators and would be subjected to a review by other 
members in November 1999. Furthermore, collective exposure levels had been reduced 
considerably and significant environmental improvements had been recorded in the vicinity of 
the plant, thanks to the implementation of an aggressive programme. 
165. The National Institute for Nuclear Research (ININ) had continued its work on nuclear 
energy and related issues, and on applications of radiation in agriculture, food, industry and 
human health. In addition, it had expanded its activities to provide specialized advanced 
technology services to the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, the petroleum sector and 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 36 

industry in general. It had also studied the possibility of providing services to the 
governments of the federal capital and other federal states. 

166. In the area of health, ININ was carrying out research into the development of 
radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. It had also been granted a licence by the 
Secretariat of Health to operate a radiosterilized tissue bank. 
167. The first doctorates in nuclear science and non-linear physics had been obtained by 
students on the masters and doctoral programmes set up by the ININ in collaboration with the 
Mexico State Autonomous University. The excellence of those programmes had been 
recognized by the National Council for Science and Technology. 
168. Finally, she thanked the Director General for the efforts he had made to increase the 
number of women in the Secretariat. An intensive public information programme was 
required to encourage women, and in particular those from developing countries, to move into 
scientific activities related to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; without such a programme, 
it would not be possible to increase the number of female applicants, despite the Director 
GeneralÂs good intentions. In addition, a special programme of fellowships for women with a 
scientific education could perhaps be established at the Agency in order to acquaint them with 
its activities. 
169. Mr. HABIB (Lebanon), after welcoming Angola and Honduras to the Agency, 
said that water was vital to stability and progress, particularly in the Middle East region, and 
the Agency should therefore make efforts to expand the use of techniques involving nuclear 
energy - and more specifically isotope hydrology - in the development and management of 
water resources. He urged the Agency to intensify co-operation in that area at national and 
international level. 
170. The 3% increase in the world demand for nuclear material for the production of 
electricity, and the increased use of such material in various peaceful applications had led to 
an increase in the volume of nuclear waste; the processing and management of such waste had 
become a matter of urgency and necessity in order to protect the environment and limit the 
risks of contamination. 
171. Technical co-operation was the link between Member States and the Agency and 
enabled the Agency to carry out its primary tasks, namely to enlarge the contribution of 
nuclear energy to the peace, health and prosperity of Member States. Lebanon therefore 
welcomed the AgencyÂs new technical co-operation strategy and hoped that it would further 
increase the effectiveness of collaboration between international organizations and the 
competent authorities of Member States. Technical co-operation also played an important 
role in providing the training required to address specific problems related to the objectives 
and priorities of Member States. 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 37 

172. Lebanon was convinced that co-operation was the means to accelerate progress and 
development and had participated in several regional Model Projects, including the one on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure. The national projects it was currently 
implementing in co-operation with the Agency related to use of the Van de Graaff accelerator 
of the Lebanese Atomic Energy Commission, the fight against the Mediterranean fruit fly, 
and determination of toxic pollutants in the environment. 
173. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, it was essential that regional 
groups be represented in a more equitable manner on the Board of Governors. The draft 
amendment submitted, and in particular the new paragraph K, appeared to meet with the 
approval of a large number of Member States. Nevertheless, while Lebanon recognized the 
right of each State to belong to a regional group, it had to be recognized that any group had 
the right to accept or refuse a countryÂs application for membership. 
174. The application of safeguards was one of the AgencyÂs main tasks and constituted the 
cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Progress had been made in recent years 
thanks to the development of new inspection techniques and the signing of Additional 
Protocols. Lebanon, which had ratified the NPT and joined the safeguards system, would be 
honoured to see highly skilled Lebanese nationals acting as members of the AgencyÂs 
inspection teams responsible for the application of safeguards and the NPT. 
175. The safeguards system had to be accepted by all States if it was to be applied 
comprehensively and effectively. It was well known that Israel was the only country in the 
Middle East which had not acceded to the NPT and concluded a safeguards agreement. It 
refused to submit its nuclear facilities to inspections, creating a very serious situation in the 
region; the General Conference should therefore demand that Israel submit its nuclear 
facilities to Agency safeguards and agree to receive Agency inspectors. 
176. Lebanon attached great importance to the AgencyÂs efforts to make the Middle East a 
denuclearized zone and to apply comprehensive safeguards there. It therefore appreciated the 
visit the Director General had made to the region in 1999 to pave the way for denuclearization 
of the Middle East, with a view to strengthening peace efforts and consolidating the 
non-proliferation system. The Director General was undoubtedly aware of the existing 
military imbalance in the nuclear field in IsraelÂs favour, and of the latterÂs stubborn defiance 
of the international community and the resolutions it had adopted. Given the fact that Israel 
continued to occupy a part of Lebanese territory, oppress the civilian population, and bomb 
and destroy its installations and infrastructure, Lebanon called upon the international 
community, through the forum of the Agency, to put pressure on Israel and persuade it to 
discharge its obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency, like all States in the region, and to comply with 
international resolutions and provisions in order to strengthen peace and security in the 
Middle East and in the rest of the world. 
177. The current session of the General Conference provided an opportunity, on the 
threshold of the third millennium, to recall that the Agency was the most appropriate 
framework through which the threat posed to humanity by the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons could be averted. Lebanon therefore called upon all members of the international 

GC(43)/OR.4 
page 38 

community to join forces to reject violence, injustice and intolerance, and ensure that reason, 
justice, peaceful coexistence and moderation prevailed, so that the future of subsequent 
generations was not compromised, thus making the current session the crowning success of 
the present millennium. 

178. Mr. NOBILO (Croatia), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency, 
said that the AgencyÂs goals were also of vital interest to his country. Since becoming a 
member of the Agency in 1992, Croatia had implemented a number of projects in 
co-operation with it which had enhanced safety and security in the management of nuclear 
energy. Its legislation had been harmonized with the AgencyÂs standards, it had acquired 
expertise in the fields of radiation protection and waste management, and it had improved the 
skills of its experts. 
179. As an indication of its desire to co-operate fully with the Agency, Croatia had signed an 
Additional Protocol to its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency during the 
forty-second session of the General Conference in September 1998. It was anxious to 
strengthen the efficiency of the safeguards system in order to diminish the threat of 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, Croatia 
had concluded two bilateral agreements on early exchange of information in the event of a 
radiological emergency - one with Slovenia and one with Hungary. Those two agreements 
went beyond the Additional Protocol and also foresaw exchanges of information between the 
information systems of the various countries concerned. 
180. Croatia welcomed the achievements in the field of nuclear safety. A legally binding 
regime was being established under the auspices of the Agency and world awareness of the 
issue was constantly increasing. Nevertheless, much remained to be done and his country 
pledged its continuing co-operation in the future. The first review meeting of the States party 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had shown that exchange based on experience was a 
good way of promoting the ConventionÂs objectives. 
181. While the AgencyÂs field of activities was increasing, its available funds were not; 
something would have to be done about that in the not too distant future. His country 
supported the recent initiatives whereby the Agency would play an active role in the training 
of young experts, primarily in physics and other scientific disciplines related to the use of 
nuclear energy. It was firmly convinced that investing in education was an investment in the 
future. In addition, the Croatian Nuclear Society was currently preparing for the third 
international conference on the topic ÂNuclear Option in Countries with Small and Medium 
Electricity GridsÂ, due to take place in Dubrovnik in June 2000; Croatia had proposed that the 
Agency sponsor that event. 
182. The Croatian electricity company was the co-funder and co-owner of the KrÂko nuclear 
power plant built on Slovenian territory. Both sides were pleased with the results achieved as 
regards safety and reliability indicators, and they looked forward to the planned visit to the 
site of the AgencyÂs team. Some differences of opinion concerning management of the 
facility were currently being resolved; they had, however, at no time represented a threat to 
safety or security.

183. Co-operation between Croatian universities and research institutes on the one hand, and 
the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme on the other, was increasing, and the 
appreciable number of applicants being awarded fellowships at Croatian establishments was 
proof of the respect and esteem they enjoyed. That fruitful co-operation would continue in 
the future. 
The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 
(GC(43)/4) 

1. Mr. MTELEKA (United Republic of Tanzania) appealed to all delegates to act 
upon the guidance provided by the United Nations Secretary-General in his message, in 
which he had outlined strategies for increasing the peaceful applications of nuclear 
techniques, and for controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
2. The speed and scale of the changes in the political and economic complexion of the 
world would have a profound long-term impact on all countries. Countries were increasingly 
being affected by events which could only be managed globally by making increased use of 
science and technology and by engaging in close international co-operation. Further 
development of basic sciences was necessary to address the fundamental needs of humanity, 
particularly those that were necessary for sustainable development. However, the most 
effective science and technologies would never be able to solve societyÂs major problems and 
could create new ones, if they did not take human values into account. 
3. As one of the least developed countries, Tanzania greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs 
technical assistance, which enabled it to acquire, adopt and adapt nuclear techniques that 
would fuel social and economic development by reducing poverty, disease and famine. The 
Agency had provided support in various areas such as agriculture, health, water resources and 
industry. 
4. The success of the Zanzibar tsetse fly eradication project had led to a rapid growth in 
economic activity and improvements in agriculture and livestock production and Tanzania 
was greatly indebted to Member States such as Belgium, Canada, Sweden, the United 
Kingdom, China, the United States of America and the agencies which had contributed 
extrabudgetary funds so generously to that project. It welcomed the introduction of similar 
projects on the Tanzanian mainland. The tsetse fly, which infested approximately one half of 
the non-desert area of the continent, represented the main obstacle to increasing agricultural 
and animal production in Africa. Following the successes achieved with the SIT, every effort 
should be made to eradicate the tsetse fly from Africa and to make the technique more costeffective 
and better able to deal with the various species of tsetse fly. He was pleased that 
large-scale projects for the eradication of tsetse flies were being implemented in other 
countries such as Ethiopia. All Member States and agencies with a mandate to increase food 
production should unite in combatting the tsetse fly as they had done in the case of the screw 
worm and fruit fly. 
5. He commended the AgencyÂs increased efforts to promote regional co-operation and 
collaborative ventures and welcomed the increased funding for regional programmes such as 
AFRA, ARCAL and RCA. However, increased allocation of resources to regional 
programmes left individual Member States with decreasing funds to build the infrastructure 
needed to make the most of nuclear technology. Since the appropriate infrastructure was a 
prerequisite for participation in regional projects, the least developed Member States, which 
generally had inadequate or no infrastructure, would receive increasingly fewer resources to 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 4 

enable them to build the necessary infrastructure. The Agency should make every effort to 
resolve that problem. 

6. Technical assistance had to be funded from predictable and assured sources and the fact 
that the Informal Working Group on the Financing of Technical Assistance had urged all 
Member States in its report to the Board to pay their assessed programme costs did not in 
itself make the TCF any more predictable and assured. Despite the strong political 
commitment associated with the TCF, pledges were low. The matter needed to be 
reconsidered, since it seemed likely that the recommendations of the Informal Working Group 
would be ineffective. 
7. Radiation protection and safety, and the related problems of the dumping of radioactive 
waste and illicit trafficking, were causes for concern. Tanzania was closely following the 
measures being taken, including the conclusion of various conventions to strengthen 
international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety and welcomed the assistance 
given to Member States in taking remedial action. Member States should continue their 
co-operation through the Agency to ensure maximum nuclear, radiation and waste safety. 
8. Despite the fact that the NPT had been in existence for thirty years, nuclear-weapon 
States continued to believe that they had a right to a monopoly in the possession, development 
and, by implication, use of nuclear weapons. The reluctance of those States to commit 
themselves to disarmament and the delay in the entry into force of the CTBT were very 
regrettable and could, if fuelled by regional conflict, lead to the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
9. Mr. SHKOLHIK (Kazakhstan) said that his country, which was fully committed 
to further strengthening the nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime, was taking an active 
part in the implementation of the CTBT and actively supported the AgencyÂs efforts to 
strengthen the safeguards system. It welcomed the international communityÂs efforts to 
prevent the spread of military nuclear technology and the continuing co-operation between 
the nuclear Powers, particularly between the Russian Federation and the United States, to 
broaden the scope of the application of safeguards to their nuclear activities and the nuclear 
material under their jurisdiction. For its part, Kazakhstan was currently completing the 
preparations for the signature of an Additional Protocol to its comprehensive safeguards 
agreement. 
10. Kazakhstan attached great importance to the measures to stop illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials and radiation sources; it had adopted the AgencyÂs requirements in that field 
as standards for its own nuclear export and import policy and was taking steps to improve 
co-ordination between the State export control and law enforcement authorities. 
11. In the area of nuclear safety, Kazakhstan was preparing to ratify the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety. It appreciated the AgencyÂs role as co-ordinator of the international support 
programme for the decommissioning of the BN-350 reactor at the Mangyshlak atomic energy 
complex. Kazakhstan had begun to develop up-to-date legislation in the field of radiation 
safety and waste management, and was planning to establish the appropriate infrastructure. It 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 5 

therefore supported the AgencyÂs regional project aimed at solving such problems by the 
beginning of the twenty-first century. 

12. Turning to technical co-operation, he expressed his countryÂs appreciation for the 
AgencyÂs projects involving the use of nuclear and isotopic techniques in various fields such 
as industry, agriculture, medicine and hydrology, and hoped that such co-operation would be 
expanded, despite the fact that its current financial difficulties prevented it from fulfilling its 
financial obligations. It was very grateful to the Agency for its understanding in that regard, 
and would make every effort to settle its debts in the near future. 
13. Mr. OMER (Sudan), expressing appreciation for the technical co-operation 
provided by the Agency, said that Sudan was participating in various national and regional 
projects in different areas, including the control of human and animal diseases, improvements 
in agricultural production, and water resources management. He welcomed the fact that the 
implementation rate for the AgencyÂs technical co-operation projects with Sudan had reached 
95% in 1998. 
14. Under the Model Project entitled ÂUpgrading Radiation Protection InfrastructureÂ, 
Sudan had been able to complete the major part of the action plan for 1997-1999. The legal 
framework had been established, as well as regulations for licensing and waste management. 
In addition, an extensive inventory of radiation sources had been made. National training and 
seminars had been provided for groups of radiation workers and the relevant institutions. 
15. Electricity shortages remained the fundamental obstacle to development and SudanÂs 
energy authorities were focusing attention on improving the stability of electricity supply. In 
that context, the project with the Agency entitled ÂEnergy Economics and Power PlanningÂ 
had been very useful. 
16. In the field of medicine, a second centre for the treatment of cancer had been opened in 
April on the occasion of the visit of the Deputy Director General for Technical Co-operation. 
That visit had had a major impact on the promotion and implementation of technical 
co-operation projects in Sudan and the visit had also resulted in the development of the 
Country Programme Framework for technical co-operation with the Agency for the 
years 2000-2005. The new programme focused on food security through the improvement of 
crop production; improvements in animal productivity to meet the national demand; the 
greater use of nuclear techniques for water resources management; and improved training in 
various areas. 
17. While Sudan appreciated the support provided for AFRA projects, it looked forward to 
greater contributions from donor countries for such projects. In the light of the success 
achieved at national and regional level and the growing needs of developing countries, Sudan 
was concerned at the decrease in the resources being made available for technical 
co-operation. For its part, Sudan had fulfilled its responsibilities towards both the AgencyÂs 
Regular Budget and the TCF by paying its arrears for previous years. It called upon all 
Member States to pay their contributions to the Agency in order to provide the necessary 
financial resources for the technical co-operation programme. 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 6 

18. Turning to the amendment of Article VI, he welcomed the proposed expansion of the 
Board in response to the legitimate demands of developing Member States to have fair 
representation within the Board and to be able to participate actively in the BoardÂs decisionmaking 
process. He appealed to all delegations to show wisdom and flexibility in finding a 
solution to that long-standing issue. 
19. Since its inception, the Agency had made every effort to establish an effective universal 
regime prohibiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. For its part, Sudan had acceded to 
the NPT and was making the necessary arrangements to ratify an Additional Protocol to its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. As a signatory of the Pelindaba Treaty establishing a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, Sudan was eager for a similar zone to be established in 
the Middle East. In that regard, it was dismayed at IsraelÂs continuing refusal to accede to the 
NPT and submit its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards. Israel thus represented a 
serious nuclear threat to all States of the region and beyond. It was regrettable that the 
recommendations made by the AgencyÂs General Conference and the various General 
Assembly and Security Council resolutions had not achieved any positive results. The 
establishment of peace in the region required the application of comprehensive safeguards to 
all States without exception. Sudan was naturally ready to collaborate fully with the Agency 
in that effort and in other areas of concern such as illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and 
radiation sources, as well as problems in the area of nuclear safety. 
20. Mr. RÃZEAU (Holy See) said that security and safeguards in the nuclear field 
were preconditions for the peaceful world to which all aspired. Even though for the time 
being a nuclear conflict seemed remote, illicit trafficking in nuclear material could pave the 
way for clandestine activities. The full and proper implementation of the AgencyÂs 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and Additional Protocols by all countries would reduce 
fear and anxiety about a nuclear threat, promote trust and confidence and eventually lead to 
worldwide nuclear disarmament. For its part, the Holy See had signed and ratified the 
Additional Protocol to its safeguards agreement. 
21. Another area of major concern was the shortage of potable water. It had been estimated 
that by the middle of the next century less than 50% of the world population would have full 
access to potable water. The Holy See welcomed all efforts and initiatives by the Agency and 
its Member States to solve the problem of fresh water shortages and fully supported the draft 
resolution submitted to the General Conference by India on behalf of the Group of 77 and 
China. The matter was particularly urgent in the developing countries of Africa, Asia and 
Latin America. The use of isotope hydrology in the search for untapped water resources and 
the use of nuclear technology for the production of potable water through the desalination of 
sea water appeared to be feasible ways of alleviating the problem. A solution to the 
worldwide demand for potable water was a precondition for sustainable development and the 
urgency of finding such a solution should not be underestimated. 
22. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, aimed at environmentally friendly 
results and at keeping the natural ecological balance intact, made a very effective contribution 
to the process of sustainable development. The noted progress achieved through the 
introduction of Model Projects might eventually lead to what Pope John Paul II had meant by 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 7 

Âhuman ecologyÂ - another precondition for sustainable development - meaning the balance 
within various social groups, including the family, the community and civil society. The 
AgencyÂs contribution to peace, health and prosperity might also be seen from the same 
standpoint. 

23. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba) said that it was imperative that nuclear energy 
play its part in the twenty-first century to guarantee a secure future for following generations. 
Nuclear energy was a safe, technically feasible and economically viable alternative for 
meeting the energy needs of developing countries. Cuba, whose nuclear programme was 
completely peaceful and transparent, had the necessary technical potential, regulatory 
infrastructure and conditions for the safe use of nuclear technology for development. 
24. However, for almost four decades there had been a relentless economic, political and 
financial blockade against Cuba which had prevented technology transfer to the country. The 
United States Helms-Burton Act of 1996 stated that Â... the completion and operation of any 
nuclear power facility [in Cuba] Â will be considered an act of aggression [against the United 
States] which will be met with an appropriate response in order to maintain the security of the 
national borders of the United States ...Â. It was clear that the free transfer of nuclear 
technology and CubaÂs own national security depended not on the signing of any multilateral 
agreement or treaty, but on the ending of the United States systematic policy of embargo, 
aggression, and hostility. 
25. The current non-proliferation regime was discriminatory and there was a need for total 
nuclear disarmament. His Government was ready to move towards an efficient, effective and 
strengthened safeguards system based on a fair, equitable and universal non-proliferation 
regime which would bring about the immediate, total and unconditional elimination of 
nuclear weapons. In spite of the difficulties to which it had been subjected, the Cuban 
Government had taken specific steps in that direction. 
26. Cuba was the first country with an INFCIRC/66-type safeguards agreement that had 
voluntarily offered to sign an Additional Protocol and it would be signed during the Director 
GeneralÂs visit to Cuba in October. 
27. He appreciated the SecretariatÂs measures to strengthen technical co-operation in line 
with the General ConferenceÂs many resolutions on that subject. However, the design and 
implementation of an effective and integral programme to strengthen technical co-operation 
should deal not only with improvements in organization, but also with the availability of 
financial resources to enable the genuine transfer of technology required by developing 
countries. Those countries which, for historical reasons, had reached a high level of 
development had the greatest responsibility to help provide genuine technology transfer that 
was unconditionally and universally accessible. 
28. Cuba was very grateful for the support received under its technical co-operation 
programme with the Agency, which had achieved excellent results in human health, 
agriculture, industry and other areas. Cuba also continued to participate actively in various 
technical co-operation projects among developing countries in Latin America and the 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 8 

Caribbean. Noting that the very successful ARCAL Programme had established priorities for 
regional co-operation and provided the basis for projects to solve problems of common 
interest using national capacities and infrastructures, he said that he would like the Agency to 
step up its contribution to the Programme. 

29. Finally, he recalled that Cuba had always stressed the need to work together to 
democratize the United Nations system and had supported the efforts to reach a decision on 
the expansion of the Board of Governors. It therefore welcomed the fact that Member States 
had been brought close to a solution to the amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute. 
Mr. Dubois (Canada) took the Chair. 

30. Ms. DORAN (Ireland) welcomed the contribution that the Agency made to 
enhancing nuclear safety culture worldwide. Ireland had participated in the first review 
meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and looked forward 
to the next meeting and to the review process that would take place under the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. 
31. Ireland was one of an increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, that had 
rejected the nuclear power option as it believed that the risks of a major nuclear accident 
outweighed the alleged benefits of nuclear power. Furthermore, the genuine public concern 
about the environmental impact of radioactive waste management and the disposal of spent 
fuel had led her Government to the firm conclusion that the case for nuclear power was 
unsound. One of the main concerns of successive Irish Governments had been the potential 
risk to the Irish population from the nuclear industry in the United Kingdom and, in 
particular, from the Sellafield plant, where spent fuel was being reprocessed and high-level 
radioactive waste was being stored on site. Ireland was totally opposed to the proposed 
expansion of operations at Sellafield and continued to urge that reprocessing and all forms of 
nuclear energy production at the Sellafield site should cease. 
32. The continuation of radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea was 
unacceptable, and Ireland welcomed the strategy adopted by the Parties to the Convention for 
the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, committing all the 
Contracting Parties to that Convention to reducing radioactive discharges into the marine 
environment to almost zero by the year 2020. In the light of its concerns, Ireland would be 
making every effort to ensure that the strategy was implemented fully within the time frame 
provided for. 
33. Ireland shared the view that the nuclear non-proliferation regime enshrined in the NPT 
was the foundation for international efforts to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and 
the essential basis for nuclear disarmament. The universal application of strengthened 
safeguards and the effective verification of compliance with agreements to eliminate existing 
nuclear arsenals would increase confidence that a world free from nuclear weapons could be 
achieved. The Agency should continue to explore the elements of a system of verification 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 9 

arrangements necessary to maintain a world free from nuclear weapons, as it had been 
requested to do in United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/53/77Y. 

34. Lastly, noting that the Y2K computer problem was a matter of concern given its 
possible implications for nuclear safety, she welcomed the numerous initiatives undertaken by 
the Agency to promote Y2K preparedness and to establish an action plan to address the 
problem. 
35. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) drew attention to the increasing dangers 
faced by the Middle East as a result of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities, which posed a threat not 
only to regional, but also to international peace and security. Although Syria had reiterated 
its willingness to resume the peace negotiations with Israel at the point at which they had 
stopped, Israel had refused to do so and had taken no steps to encourage a resumption of the 
peace process. It continued to build settlements, to expel people and to enhance its arsenal of 
weapons. The imbalance of power in the region and the special treatment accorded to one 
State was one of the main causes of instability in the region. While all Arab States had 
acceded to the NPT and placed their nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards, the necessary 
international political will was lacking to exert pressure on Israel to make it follow suit. 
Since international disarmament was one of the main goals enshrined in the AgencyÂs Statute, 
the Agency should take resolute steps to deal with the issue. He called on Israel to honour the 
provisions of the various General Conference resolutions that had been passed and, in 
particular, Security Council resolution 487 which called on it to place its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. 
36. Turning to the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, he recalled that for 
the past five years the General Conference resolution on that issue had been adopted by 
consensus. Syria had not opposed that consensus although the resolution did not respond to 
its demands because Israel had not been explicitly asked to accede to the NPT and place its 
nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. The General Conference should call on Israel to 
do so because such a move would be a confidence-building measure leading to peace in the 
Middle East and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 
37. Repeated General Conference resolutions and Board decisions had called for an 
amendment of Article VI to expand the Board to ensure equitable representation of the area 
groups and an increase in the number of seats for Africa and MESA. However, the proposed 
link between the expansion of the Board and the composition of area groups was 
unacceptable because all members of a group had to be able to work together and the current 
tensions in the Middle East precluded any possibility of Arab States working together in the 
same group as Israel. 
38. Syria welcomed the improved technical co-operation implementation rate, but regretted 
that West Asia had been the area with the lowest percentage of actual delivery in 1998. The 
increase in the number of Model Projects was a positive development and the Model Project 
on upgrading the radiation protection infrastructure had been particularly useful. Syria was 
also grateful to the Agency for organizing, together with the Syrian Atomic Energy Agency, a 
basic professional training course on radiation protection to be held in Arabic in October and

November in Damascus. Lastly, he noted that the reduction in the resources allocated to the 
TCF was a source of concern to many Member States and called on all countries, particularly 
the major donors, to fulfil their obligations so that the Agency could carry out its statutory 
responsibilities. 

39. Mr. KRECKLER (Argentina) said that the Agency should attach the highest 
priority to genuine integration rather than summation of safeguards measures. Argentina 
continued to participate fully in the AgencyÂs activities aimed at strengthening and integrating 
the international safeguards system, and regarded the development of technology for remote 
monitoring and environmental sampling as particularly important. He recalled that Argentina 
and Brazil had recently announced their readiness to begin negotiations with the Secretariat 
with a view to concluding an Additional Protocol to the Quadripartite Agreement. 
40. In keeping with the importance it attached to achieving and maintaining the highest 
nuclear safety levels worldwide, Argentina had taken an active role in the first review meeting 
of the Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. If the review process continued to prove 
as positive as that initial exercise, it would be a further boost to the strengthening of nuclear 
safety worldwide. The other aspects of safety to which due attention should be paid were the 
transport of radioactive materials and the safety of radiation sources. 
41. Turning to the achievements in his country over the previous year, he said that the 
principal event had been the completion of the basic engineering for the CAREM 25 MW(e) 
reactor, specifically designed to supply electricity in isolated regions or for small distribution 
networks, and possibly to be coupled to a seawater desalination system, as indicated in 
document GC(43)/20. The second notable achievement was the development of a new 
generation of membranes for ArgentinaÂs gas diffusion uranium enrichment plant, bringing 
both technical and economic improvements. Thirdly, a new reactor fuel had been developed 
which could be used at the Atucha and Embalse nuclear power plants, both of which were 
operating smoothly and had recorded high availability factors. 
42. In addition, the National Atomic Energy Commission had launched an ambitious 
programme intended to increase national production of cobalt-60 sources, which would also 
be exported, and hoped to increase production of fissionable molybdenum-99 for medical 
applications. 
43. The independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority had continued to discharge its 
responsibilities satisfactorily in the areas of radiation protection, nuclear safety, 
non-proliferation and physical protection, and had established a regional office in the south of 
the country in order to ensure a permanent presence in areas of concentrated nuclear activity. 
44. Argentina continued to play a full part in furthering the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
in the context of multilateral and bilateral co-operation. In conjunction with the Agency, 
Argentina had continued to host courses, workshops and scientific meetings, to train Agency 
fellows, to receive scientists from other countries, and to make experts and lecturers available 
to the Agency. Argentina had recently signed a new co-operation agreement with Romania. 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 11 

At the regional level, it welcomed the new ARCAL Agreement, which it had ratified during 
the previous year, as a very useful multilateral mechanism. 

45. Turning to the matter of the BoardÂs expansion, he noted the significant progress which 
had been made and expressed the hope that an arrangement would be reached which ensured 
equitable representation for all regions, without impairing the level of representation of any 
region in particular. In conclusion, he stressed that the Board should continue to conduct its 
considerations efficiently, with particular emphasis on the AgencyÂs statutory functions. 
46. Mr. RANA (Kenya) welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts to develop a technical 
co-operation programme that responded more effectively to the priorities of Member States 
and urged it to redouble its efforts in that area. His Government was committed to further 
enhancing the understanding of the benefits of nuclear energy and its applications among the 
general population in Kenya with a view to promoting public co-operation and support for 
technical assistance programmes. 
47. Under the current technical co-operation programme, there had been notable progress in 
the project on the early diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, which would greatly 
enhance the level of national health care. Further technical assistance in developing nuclear 
medicine and oncology, particularly at the infrastructure level, would be greatly appreciated. 
48. Kenya was grateful for the assistance provided in the area of water resources 
management and looked forward to the AgencyÂs continued efforts to increase the use of 
isotope techniques to control groundwater and surface water pollution. 
49. With a view to increasing food security, Kenya was using nuclear technology to 
develop drought-resistant wheat varieties, to improve livestock production and to develop 
biofertilizers, particularly for small-scale farmers, under the AFRA programme. 
Consultations had also been held with the Agency over the past six months on tsetse fly 
eradication in the Lambwe Valley and other tsetse-infested areas. 
50. The existence of nuclear weapons continued to pose grave threats to international 
security and the AgencyÂs active role in eliminating those threats, through its safeguards 
system, was crucial. His Government supported the strengthened safeguards measures, which 
it believed should be implemented with due regard for the requirements of national 
sovereignty. 
51. Turning to safety issues, he said that public confidence in nuclear technology depended 
on its safety. The Agency had played an important role in facilitating the negotiation of 
several important international safety conventions that prescribed the basic legal norms for 
the safe use of nuclear energy, internationally accepted safety standards and measures to 
assist Member States in the implementation of those standards. 
52. With regard to illicit trafficking, Kenya greatly appreciated the effective measures taken 
by the Agency to improve the security of nuclear material. Major challenges nevertheless 
remained and the Agency should strengthen the effectiveness of international and national 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 12 

efforts for the prevention and detection of illicit trafficking with a view to its global 
eradication. 

53. On the question of staffing, the Secretariat should continue its efforts to increase the 
proportion of women in the Professional category in the Agency until a proper gender balance 
was achieved. Women should therefore be encouraged to take advantage of the current mood 
of Member States to make the Agency an international example of an equal opportunity 
employer. In addition, the recruitment of qualified candidates from developing Member 
States should be given special consideration. 
Mr. Ryzhov (Russian Federation) took the Chair. 

54. Mr. RÃNAKY (Hungary) welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to conclude Additional 
Protocols with Member States. Hungary was one of 45 States that had signed an Additional 
Protocol, and work was already in progress to elaborate national regulations for its 
implementation. It hoped that a comprehensive, integrated safeguards system could be put in 
place at an early date and would co-operate with the Agency in tackling any problems that 
might arise in connection with such a system. As to the AgencyÂs efforts to fulfil its mandate 
in Iraq and to implement safeguards in the DPRK, he urged those countries to co-operate fully 
with the Agency. 
55. Turning to illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, he said that Hungary appreciated the 
technical and financial assistance provided by the Agency to improve its central registry of 
radioactive materials. Nuclear and radioactive materials in Hungary were subject to 
regulatory control and the national radiation protection regulations met international 
standards. 
56. With regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in Hungary, he said that the periodic 
safety report for the first and second units of the Paks nuclear power plant had been 
completed in 1997 and the report on the third and fourth units would be completed by the end 
of the year. The implementation of the most important corrective actions was a prerequisite 
for the operating licence granted for the first and second units until 2008, and various safety 
improvements were being carried out. Hungary looked forward to the IRRT mission to 
review the performance of the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority, and had already decided 
to invite the Agency to organize an OSART mission to give further assistance in the 
upgrading of the operational safety of the Paks nuclear power plant. His country had also 
paid special attention to the Y2K issue and was convinced that the safe operation of the units 
would not be jeopardized. 
57. As a result of collective efforts and the assistance made available to improve the safety 
of reactors of Soviet design, nuclear safety in Eastern Europe had improved significantly. 
However, ultimate responsibility remained at the national level, and major upgrading 
programmes could not be financed from foreign assistance. Although external assistance was 
not a prerequisite for the completion of the safety upgrading programmes already in progress 
in Hungary, his country would require further assistance in the fields of human health, 
agriculture, education and training. The countries of Eastern Europe were committed to 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 13 

working together to solve common problems of a regional nature and the Agency had created 
an excellent framework for fostering such co-operation. 

58. The review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and 
the International Conference on the Strengthening of Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe had 
confirmed the importance of collective knowledge, openness and international co-operation in 
the area of nuclear safety, and had provided an excellent opportunity for countries to provide 
a detailed picture of their nuclear-related activities. 
59. Hungary had recently been the venue for several important international events in the 
nuclear field, including the international nuclear emergency preparedness exercise, the World 
Conference on Science, and the International Symposium on the Reform of Civil Nuclear 
Liability, which he hoped had promoted greater public understanding of the benefits of 
nuclear energy and increased public confidence. 
60. Mr. HASHIM (Malaysia) said that the AgencyÂs professionalism in nuclear 
material safeguards and arms control verification should serve as a model for other 
multilateral arms control and disarmament bodies, particularly those under the auspices of the 
United Nations, and might also serve as a basis for the development of an appropriate 
verification system for a fissile material cut-off treaty at the Conference on Disarmament in 
Geneva. 
61. The nuclear-weapon States and other States which had played a role in the development 
and deployment of nuclear weapons, by, for example, providing test sites or allowing such 
weapons to be stationed on their territory, had a special responsibility for financing the 
AgencyÂs nuclear arms control verification activities in view of the power and privileges they 
had long enjoyed through their possession of nuclear weapons. States which had never 
contributed to the development or deployment of such weapons and had unequivocally 
renounced them should not be burdened with the financial responsibility for their dismantling 
or verification. The NPT, the CTBT, and the fissile material cut-off treaty that was being 
negotiated were critical elements in the evolving global nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament regime. 
62. While safeguards implementation was an important aspect of the AgencyÂs work, equal 
consideration and weight should be given to its other statutory roles, in particular technical 
co-operation. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme was a valuable and 
significant confidence-building measure for promoting greater transparency in national 
nuclear programmes and, in turn, for helping to deter the misuse of nuclear technology and 
the diversion of nuclear materials for non-peaceful purposes. Although it was encouraging to 
see that the pledges made by Member States to the TCF in 1998 had been at a record level, 
the decline in the potential resources of the TCF, the gap between the target and the actual 
level of contributions, the declining share of footnote-a/ projects, and the lack of agreement 
on the IPFs for 2001-2002, as well as on the recommended target figures for 2003-2004, were 
causes for serious concern. For its part, Malaysia would continue to honour its financial 
commitments to the Agency, including its obligations with respect to the TCF and its assessed 
programme costs. It would also continue to co-operate with the Agency to assist other 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 14 

Member States in the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. National nuclear 
technology programmes could not be developed in isolation and the development of stronger 
links between developing Member States through the AgencyÂs TCDC mechanism should be 
encouraged. 

63. With regard to Article VI of the Statute, Malaysia strongly supported an expansion of 
the Board of Governors, provided that the representation of the developing Member States 
was thereby improved and the distribution of the additional seats was acceptable to all area 
groups, including SEAP. Although he appreciated the argument that those Member States 
with active nuclear power programmes and capabilities had more legitimate claims to seats on 
the Board, he pointed out that the Chernobyl accident had demonstrated that nuclear accidents 
were transboundary in nature. The issues of nuclear safety and non-proliferation were 
unquestionably of global concern and interest. Transit and littoral States should have as much 
say with regard to the transport of nuclear materials as those which owned, used, processed or 
shipped such materials. The fact of being a signatory to a nuclear-weapon-free-zone treaty, as 
well as to the NPT, should also be a valid consideration for the purposes of representation on 
the Board. 
64. Finally, he welcomed the management reform and modernization methods initiated by 
the Director General to ensure better planning, implementation and evaluation of the 
AgencyÂs programme activities, including the one-house concept. 
65. Mr. DUBOIS (Canada) highlighted the importance of the AgencyÂs three main 
strategic objectives: safeguards, safety and assistance to Member States in connection with 
the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. Canada was a strong supporter of effective measures 
to promote the harmonization and co-ordination of the AgencyÂs programmes and resources 
in line with the established priorities which themselves reflected the needs of Member States, 
and noted that it was necessary to promote a balanced understanding of the benefits and 
potential of nuclear energy, particularly at a time when urgent demands were being made 
concerning climate change and sustainable development. 
66. The budget was a fundamental issue for his country. Canada advocated nominal zero 
growth for the budgets of all international organizations although budgetary restrictions were 
not an end in themselves. Even with strict rationalization of resources, it was still possible to 
implement activities more effectively and efficiently without adversely affecting them. 
67. During what had been a difficult year, the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities 
had achieved a number of good results: an increase in the implementation rate, a record 
payment of assessed programme costs and an increase in contributions to the TCF. Canada 
fully supported all initiatives to improve that programme, such as strengthening interaction 
and co-operation among recipient countries, and the efforts to make sure that projects 
contributed to the objectives of sustainable development. The success of that programme 
required commitment and discipline both from the Agency and recipient countries. Canada 
looked forward to further progress in establishing a management strategy geared towards 
results, particularly in the development of performance indicators. 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 15 

68. An excellent way of marking the 2000 NPT Review Conference would be to achieve 
significant advances in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Canada continued to be 
concerned about the nuclear tests conducted the previous year in India and Pakistan, and it 
called on those two countries and all other States that had not yet done so, particularly those 
which operated unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, to accede to the NPT at the earliest date. 
Crucial to halting nuclear weapons proliferation would be reductions by the nuclear-weapon 
States of their strategic and tactical nuclear weapons inventories and the devaluation of the 
political significance ascribed to such weapons. As for non-nuclear-weapon States, they 
should place all their nuclear activities under Agency safeguards. 
69. After the significant developments in activities to strengthen and increase the efficiency 
and effectiveness of safeguards, the Agency now needed to fulfil the promise of the Model 
Additional Protocol. A high priority for Canada was the preparation, development and 
implementation of integrated safeguards. An integrated safeguards approach at State level 
would enable the Agency to reduce safeguards implementation costs while increasing 
effectiveness. The Agency needed to move away from the current rigidly structured criteria 
towards criteria specific to integrated safeguards, thus adopting more qualitative and less 
quantitative approaches. He called on all States to conclude Additional Protocols by the 2000 
NPT Review Conference. Physical protection of nuclear material and facilities was also an 
integral part of effective nuclear non-proliferation, and he supported the decision to convene 
an informal open-ended meeting of experts to discuss whether there was a need to revise the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
70. The AgencyÂs programmes needed to be refocused and rationalized to address the new 
priorities in the area of nuclear safety and in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
technologies. There was a need for more effective communication about the benefits and 
challenges of nuclear power and the Agency could play an important role in assisting Member 
States and in providing a credible and balanced perspective on nuclear power to the 
international community. The Agency should work closely with other international 
organizations to ensure that nuclear powerÂs vital role in addressing the challenges of climate 
change and sustainable development was fully recognized. 
71. Mr. CHAUNY de PORTURAS-HOYLE (Peru) reaffirmed his countryÂs faith in 
the AgencyÂs scientific credibility and technical competence. The Agency had an important 
role to play as an international centre of co-operation for sustainable development and was a 
valuable instrument for the strengthening of international security. 
72. During the past year, Peru had continued to take steps to promote the peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy. It had participated actively in national and regional technical 
co-operation projects and had improved its control of radiation sources and their users. 
Among the various projects that were being implemented, the bilateral project with Chile on 
the eradication of the medfly and the project with Bolivia on the study of Lake Titicaca were 
particularly noteworthy. Other projects involved the strengthening of the research reactor 
infrastructure, laboratory automation, irradiation of food and medical products, enhancing 
nuclear safety, selection of improved native crops and improvements in the area of animal 
health and reproduction. Since the previous General Conference, 39 expert missions had been 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 16 

conducted and 88 professionals and technicians had received different types of training. Peru 
had co-operated with the Agency in the organization of 8 international meetings, 5 of which 
had been under the ARCAL Programme. Participation in the ARCAL Programme had, inter 
alia, helped to improve nuclear instrumentation maintenance, quality assurance in analytical 
laboratories, radiotherapy practices, and aquifer characterization for sustainable management. 
Peru was particularly grateful to the Agency and the United States Government for the supply 
of X-ray fluorescent equipment under the project to improve brachytherapy services. It also 
appreciated the French GovernmentÂs announcement of its intention to finance the 
implementation of the project on nuclear techniques in mining and industry. 

73. In the area of nuclear, radiation and waste safety, Peru, as one of the Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, had participated in the first review meeting and had 
presented its national report on measures taken to comply with its obligations under the 
Convention. Peru had almost completed the procedures for legislative approval of the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. In 
the field of environmental monitoring, work had continued on the development of techniques 
to evaluate and mitigate the adverse effects of ionizing radiation. An emergency response 
programme had been established and advice was being provided to national users of ionizing 
radiation. 
74. Despite those efforts, an accident involving a radiation source used for industrial 
applications had occurred, resulting in the exposure of a worker at a hydroelectric power plant 
construction company. The Agency and the French Government had provided invaluable 
assistance in evaluating the patient in Lima and then providing highly specialized treatment in 
France. 
75. Turning to safeguards, he said that the preparatory steps at national level for the 
conclusion of an Additional Protocol to the safeguards agreement between Peru and the 
Agency had been completed. 
76. Lastly, he noted that the Director GeneralÂs visit to Peru in October would constitute a 
milestone in the relations between Peru and the Agency and was an example of his efforts to 
seek not only closer contacts with civil society and non-governmental organizations, but also 
direct contacts with Governments, with a view to promoting awareness of the AgencyÂs work. 
77. Mr. HUANG Yu (Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) said 
that the Chemical Weapons Convention, adopted in 1992, aimed to eliminate an entire 
category of weapons of mass destruction in a time-bound framework under international 
supervision. States Parties to the Convention had made a commitment not to develop, 
produce, stockpile or use chemical weapons. Under a comprehensive verification regime, 
they had agreed to make declarations related both to military activities and to the production, 
processing and consumption of certain Âdual useÂ chemicals which also had peaceful uses in 
the civilian chemical industry. The declarations were backed by routine inspections, shortnotice 
challenge inspections and investigations of any alleged use of chemical weapons. The 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 17 

Convention applied equally to all its States Parties whether or not they possessed chemical 
weapons or had an advanced chemical industry. States Parties were obliged to declare the 
possession of riot control agents, to reaffirm the undertaking in other international 
instruments not to use herbicides as a method of warfare, and to destroy all chemical weapons 
which they might have abandoned on the territory of any other State Party. The obligations 
were offset by provisions on peaceful economic and technological development in the field of 
chemistry. 

78. There were 126 States Parties to the Convention, which had entered into force in 
April 1997, and a further 44 States had signed the Convention but had yet to deposit their 
instruments of ratification. The worldÂs largest known chemical weapons or stockpiles had 
already come within the purview of the Convention. 
79. The OPCW had already received declarations from the majority of States Parties and 
had embarked on its enormous verification task: 540 inspections had already been carried out 
in 30 Member States, involving approximately 60% of the OrganisationÂs staff; inspection 
teams had witnessed the destruction of some 3000 tonnes of chemical weapons agents and 
over 700 000 munitions and containers related to such weapons. A very successful mission 
had been undertaken in Baghdad, under the aegis of the United Nations, to close down the 
UNSCOM chemical laboratory. 
80. Despite its achievements, the OPCW knew that there was little room for complacency. 
A number of Member States still had to submit their initial declarations and some declarations 
which had been submitted were incomplete. The Russian Federation, which had the worldÂs 
largest declared quantity of chemical weapons, amounting to some 40 000 tonnes, faced 
economic difficulties in fulfilling its obligations in respect of the timely destruction of its 
chemical weapons and related facilities. 
81. In addition to immense potential benefits to Member States, such as enhancement of 
security and access to chemicals and equipment for the development of chemistry for peaceful 
purposes, the Convention contained provisions for trade sanctions which could have a severe 
impact on the imports of certain essential chemicals by States outside the purview of the 
Convention. 
82. The level of representation of States from Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia, the 
Caribbean and South Pacific was a cause for concern. The Director General of the OPCW 
had therefore written to the Foreign Ministers of all signatory and non-signatory States 
informing them of the benefits of being Parties to the Convention. 
83. The Agency and the OPCW largely shared a common constituency. The Agency had 
been a pioneer organization in the area of sophisticated international verification and 
accounting regimes and the OPCW had continued that tradition. For its part, the Agency had 
drawn upon the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention with respect to short-notice 
challenge inspections as a method of last resort, together with intermediate measures designed 
to clarify uncertainties and facilitate compliance in a constructive and co-operative manner. 
There was a significant body of expertise within the Secretariats of the two organizations, 

GC(43)/OR.5 
page 18 

which had a wide range of common interest such as provisions for technical co-operation, 
verification and confidentiality procedures, financial and operational aspects of inspections, 
dispute resolution procedures and experience with other international organizations in the 
area of disarmament. Participation in meetings organized by the two organizations, and the 
exchange of personnel and speakers would go a long way to establishing that co-operation on 
a firm footing. 

84. The OPCW fully subscribed to the strategic vision of the AgencyÂs Director General, 
particularly his emphasis on the importance of confidence-building measures in the area of 
disarmament and non-proliferation, on strengthened international co-operation and the 
fostering of a culture of communication and transparency. In those and other respects, the 
OPCW would closely follow the developments in the Agency. 
85. Mr. ROMAN-MOREY (Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean) noted that, while the twentieth century had been rich in scientific 
and technological developments, it had also been plagued by internal confrontations, 
international conflicts and two world wars. For its part, the Agency had, by promoting the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, made a major contribution to the preservation of peace and 
security during the past forty years. 
86. The idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America and the 
Caribbean had been mooted in 1962, with the Tlatelolco Treaty being opened for signature in 
1967. At that time, only 18 States had signed, but now all 33 States of the region had signed 
and all but Cuba had ratified it. It was hoped that Cuba would soon ratify it thereby making 
the region the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone. He welcomed CubaÂs announcement 
of its intention to sign an Additional Protocol and the AgencyÂs approval of the application by 
Honduras for membership of the Agency. 
87. While the NPT was undoubtedly the cornerstone of the international nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, the CTBT, 
verifiable bilateral agreements, and the AgencyÂs verification and control measures all 
provided vital support for that regime. Nevertheless, there was no room for complacency and 
it should be borne in mind that the end of the Cold War did not signify the end of the nuclear 
threat - a threat posed not only by the immense arsenals of nuclear weapons possessed by the 
officially recognized nuclear-weapon States, but also by the desire of a small group of 
countries to establish themselves as nuclear Powers. While reductions in nuclear arsenals 
were welcome, it would be far better to eliminate such arsenals completely. If countries that 
had adopted nuclear weapons programmes took the courageous decision to discontinue such 
programmes, he was confident that others would follow suit and the hope of achieving a 
world free of nuclear weapons could be realized. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 
(GC (43)/4) 

1. Mr. FRANK (Israel), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency, said 
that although the General ConferenceÂs agenda was well balanced and covered most of the 
important issues relevant to the AgencyÂs technical mission, two draft resolutions stood out as 
extraneous to the AgencyÂs Statute and mission, both of them concerning the Middle East. In 
contrast, one central issue was being dealt with only in the Scientific Forum, and not by the 
General Conference, namely the future role of nuclear power and the AgencyÂs role in its 
objective assessment. That point was worth dwelling on. 
2. In view of the need for a sustainable energy future with less dependence on fossil 
sources and the operating experience accumulated with nuclear power reactors, the role of 
nuclear power might be expected to increase in the future. Current projections, however, 
indicated the contrary. In his address on nuclear power presented in Paris in May 1999, the 
Director General had aptly summarized the current trends and the factors to be taken into 
account for future analysis. Given its reputation and competence, the Agency should 
contribute to the entire spectrum of nuclear power issues, as it did so successfully with some 
aspects of the problem. The possibility of undoing the close link between nuclear power and 
proliferation was one example: Israel felt that proliferation risks could be limited appreciably 
by employing nuclear power alone without any nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure or fuel 
production and reprocessing activities. Also, a well designed research and development 
programme for more efficient and safer nuclear power should aim at increased proliferation 
resistance. There were at least two promising approaches: the use of thorium-fuelled lightwater 
reactors and of high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. The development of models 
combining enhanced safety, proliferation resistance and efficiency could be essential for the 
future of nuclear power. The Agency could promote such research and development 
activities and complement the tools for assessing safety and efficiency with tools for 
analysing the efficiency of a given design from the safeguards point of view. 
3. He commended the excellent work done by the Department of Technical Co-operation. 
The medfly eradication project in the Middle East was an excellent example of regional 
co-operation which built confidence. Israel looked forward to its expansion to other parties in 
the region. Future projects could be envisaged in the fields of nuclear medicine, the efficient 
utilization of freshwater resources and food preservation. Israel felt that even sub-regional 
initiatives could be very beneficial. It looked forward to technical co-operation being 
developed in its immediate neighbourhood with Jordan, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority, 
and was ready to provide concrete support for such initiatives. 
4. Reverting to the two draft resolutions on the Middle East, he said they needed to be 
viewed in the proper context, namely the recent developments in the peace process, which 
might herald a more benign era in the Middle East. His Government had made clear its 
commitment to the peace process in the region and vigorous moves were under way to 
revitalize it in all aspects. Israel believed that there was no going back. Nevertheless, the 
road ahead was long and arduous. All parties would have to show determination, goodwill, 
patience and restraint, in order to create and maintain a climate of confidence conducive to 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 6 

progress. Unfortunately, the desire for peace and security was not shared by all. There were 
still States in the region which were eschewing the peace process, which continued to deny 
IsraelÂs right to exist, which refused to forswear war as a means of settling disputes and which 
attempted to impede the peace process by means of terror and violence, either directly or 
through proxies. That regrettable trend by some countries to try to bypass a dialogue among 
the concerned parties in the Middle East had been repeatedly demonstrated in the AgencyÂs 
policy-making organs and, at its present session, the General Conference was being called 
upon to revisit under agenda item 25 the so-called ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ, 
first introduced by Iraq, whose own capabilities in the matter of weapons of mass destruction 
had been amply demonstrated. 

5. There had been many developments with respect to proliferation in recent years: the 
sombre experience of UNSCOM and the Action Team in Iraq, and other dangerous 
proliferation initiatives in the Middle East and other regions. Israel was not involved in any 
of them. On the contrary, it had never threatened any of its neighbours, not had it acted in 
violation of any of its international commitments. That was where the irony lay; instead of 
taking note of the peace process and of IsraelÂs behaviour, there was an attempt to ostracize it. 
Israel remained committed to making the Middle East - in due course and in the proper 
context - a zone free both of weapons of mass destruction and of missiles. 
6. The creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region should emanate from a 
regional initiative and be supported by all the States of the region. Such a zone could not be 
imposed. All the Parties to the NPT had reaffirmed their support for those principles in the 
ÂPrinciples and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and DisarmamentÂ in stating that 
Âthe establishment of internationally recognized nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of 
arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, enhances global and 
regional peace and securityÂ. Item 25 of the General ConferenceÂs agenda clearly deviated 
from those agreed principles and objectives, and all the Member States which had approved 
the 1995 document should therefore be opposed to it. The provocations and attempts at 
political harassment contradicted the spirit of co-operation needed for a resolution on possible 
future developments in the Middle East to be adopted by consensus. A decision on a draft 
resolution under that agenda item was bound to create a situation where it would be 
impossible for Israel to join a consensus on a resolution concerning the application of 
safeguards in the Middle East. Once the tradition of consensus on the Middle East resolution 
was broken, it would be very difficult to restore it in future. 
7. With a view to maintaining the long-established practice of adopting the Middle East 
resolution by consensus, he invited the General Conference to consider agenda item 24, 
ÂApplication of IAEA Safeguards in the Middle EastÂ. Israel made no secret of its 
fundamental difficulties and reservations about the wording and the relevance of the 
resolution and had formally distanced itself from its modalities. It was, however, firmly 
committed to the establishment, in the proper context and at the proper time, of a nuclearweapon-
free zone, and was thus willing to join a consensus once again if the text was not 
modified. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 7 

8. In no region could nuclear issues be considered outside a comprehensive and stable 
framework of peace and security. The vast experience accumulated with similar processes 
elsewhere showed that such a framework, along with careful and patient confidence-building, 
were essential conditions for disarmament and non-proliferation. Taken out of that context, 
formal commitments under the NPT or nuclear export controls, even when coupled with 
Agency safeguards, were not in themselves adequate guarantees of compliance with the 
Treaty. Nowhere was that more apparent than in the present day Middle East. 
9. In that context, he drew attention to the experience of the Working Group for Arms 
Control and Regional Security that had been established in Madrid in 1991 as part of the 
multilateral track of the Middle East peace process. In its four years of operation from 1992 
to 1995, that Working Group, in which no less than 15 Middle East parties had taken part, had 
accomplished a great deal in negotiating specific confidence-building measures and setting 
the stage for serious arms control negotiations. That Group would undoubtedly have 
progressed much further with a co-operative security architecture for the Middle East, had not 
one of its regional parties blocked the required consensus for moving ahead. The areas of cooperative 
security which had been negotiated included the gradual progression from 
confidence-building to arms control for all categories of armaments - from light arms to 
weapons of mass destruction, with the imposition of various qualitative limitations on 
categories of arms and the control of expenditure for the procurement and use of those arms. 
Many initiatives concerning arms control and nuclear confidence-building measures had been 
on the agenda at that time. 
10. Anyone who knew the history of the Tlatelolco Treaty or ABACC, or who had studied 
the ÂAsian wayÂ of dealing with security would surely realize that a careful step-by-step and, 
just as importantly, informal confidence-building process was the proven recipe for 
transforming conflict-ridden regional relationships into more stable, enduring and mutually 
beneficial ones. The way to build security was to aim high, but start modestly and move 
ahead carefully, because confidence-building was a lengthy process. Time was needed to 
encourage others to co-operate, to win over hesitant bystanders, it being important not to 
intimidate, harass or ostracize those who needed time to assure themselves that their basic 
security interests would not be compromised. The two items on the agenda concerning the 
Middle East were hardly likely to foster progress towards a peaceful, safer and more stable 
Middle East, in which it would be feasible and desirable to establish a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, or indeed a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. 
11. Turning to amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, an issue that had been 
under consideration by the General Conference and the Board of Governors for more than two 
decades, he commended the efforts of the last three Chairmen of the Board of Governors, who 
had devoted a large part of their time and energy to try and produce a text acceptable to all. 
Although the present text contained elements which left much to be desired, Israel could go 
along with it if it opened the way to consensus. 
12. In conclusion, he said that, in order to preserve the traditions and spirit of the Agency, it 
was vital to resist all attempts to impair its professional competence and impartiality, and to 
shield it from the debilitating effects of politicization. Political initiatives and energies should 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 8 

be directed at promoting regional co-operation in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
The Agency already had the requisite technical competence as well as an impressive track 
record in that area. Accordingly, he believed that that was the way to move ahead, using all 
the AgencyÂs strengths to foster co-operation, stability and prosperity in the regions of the 
world which were lacking in them. Israel looked forward to working with the Director 
General and the Secretariat in all those areas and hoped that, as in previous years, reason and 
moderation would prevail, and that the resolutions adopted by the General Conference at its 
present session would strengthen the Agency in pursuit of its goal. 

Mr. Adam (Belgium) took the Chair. 

13. Mr. BEBRIS (Latvia), having welcomed the admission of Honduras and Angola 
to the Agency, associated himself with the statement made by the delegate of Finland on 
behalf of the European Union. 
14. With all the new challenges facing the Agency, he noted in particular the introduction 
of the peer review process under the Convention on Nuclear Safety which served to evaluate 
the efforts undertaken in different countries to meet high safety standards. His own country 
recognized the need to improve its emergency preparedness system, and was also making 
arrangements for safe transition to the year 2000. 
15. Reporting on changes that had been made to its institutional framework, which was still 
rather complex and comprised a number of ministries, he said Latvia was planning to 
establish a single central body in 2000 to regulate nuclear activities. 
16. With regard to safeguards, Latvia was sure that the Agency would be playing an even 
more important role in the application of the NPT as a result of Additional Protocols. His 
country intended to complete the procedures for the signature and ratification of the 
Additional Protocol in 1999, but it would be needing extra time to prepare its initial report 
under the Protocol. Latvia was also intending to ratify the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
17. Latvia was working closely with its neighbours, Sweden and Norway, to develop a 
strategy for the prevention of illicit trafficking. The action plan being prepared would be 
submitted to other Baltic and Scandinavian countries at the end of the year. His delegation 
also wished to propose that the international nuclear community investigate more thoroughly 
the issue of contaminated scrap metal. 
18. With regard to the new edition of the Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive 
Material, he said that Latvia had already incorporated some of its provisions in its legislation 
but would be grateful if the competent expert group could complete the drafting of the related 
explanatory documents. 
19. Latvia attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities 
aimed at promoting sustainable development in the area of radiation and nuclear safety. It 
greatly welcomed the adoption of the Model Project concept and noted that the regional 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 9 

approach for technical co-operation had also proved to be very useful. Latvia had already 
received valuable assistance from the Agency, and further aid would be welcome in the 
decade ahead in preparing for the decommissioning and dismantling of a research reactor. 

20. In conclusion, Latvia urged the Agency to accelerate the development of comprehensive 
safety standards and guidelines for radioactive waste management. In particular, a system for 
the disposal of small amounts of long-lived radioactive waste was needed in small countries. 
21. Mr. SOERIAATMADJA (Indonesia), having welcomed Angola and Honduras to 
the Agency, commended the Director General on his work in connection with the three main 
areas of the AgencyÂs mandate, namely nuclear technology, safety and verification. 
22. The Nuclear Energy Control Board (BAPETEN), an independent body established 
in 1998, had been fully operational since January 1999, and he was grateful to the Agency for 
the two missions it had conducted in Indonesia to assist BAPETEN with reviewing national 
legislation. He was also pleased to announce that Indonesia was signing the Protocol 
additional to its safeguards agreement, thus demonstrating its support for non-proliferation 
and total nuclear disarmament. 
23. With regard to Article VI of the Statute, he commended the tireless efforts made to 
resolve that complex problem, and hoped that it would be finally settled at the present session. 
As for the technical co-operation programme, his delegation agreed that it should be 
demand-driven, results-based, and closely integrated into national development strategies. 
24. Indonesia considered nuclear power as a possible alternative to oil and gas for the 
production of electricity in the medium and long term. Systematic planning was therefore 
required in all the areas concerned. A democratic decision-making process would also be 
introduced and public information programmes continued. In that connection, his delegation 
supported the AgencyÂs initiative to focus on small- and medium-sized reactors that provided 
a technically reliable, cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for the production 
of electricity and also fresh water and salt. That initiative was consistent with new legislation 
in Indonesia granting greater autonomy to regional authorities. 
25. He noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs intention to redouble its efforts to apply nuclear 
technology to increase food production, fight disease, manage water resources and protect the 
environment, which were all problems faced by his country. With regard to staple foodstuffs, 
his Government had been able, through the National Nuclear Energy Agency (BATAN), to 
distribute high-yield mutant varieties of rice, soya and mung beans to farmers in ten 
provinces. As a result of technical assistance from the Agency, Indonesia had also introduced 
feed supplementation techniques to farmers, enabling meat and milk production to be 
increased. Furthermore, Indonesia was making increasing use of nuclear techniques to 
improve animal reproduction and health with a view to achieving self-sufficiency in milk and 
meat production. All those activities were carried out in close collaboration with regional 
authorities and local universities. 
26. Turning to human health, he said that because of the economic and financial crisis that 
Indonesia was facing, several hospitals were having difficulties in providing satisfactory 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 10 

diagnostic services, and the State was increasing its efforts to provide radiodiagnostic 
equipment, radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals. With regard to water resources 
management, the Indonesian Government was very interested in the AgencyÂs isotope 
hydrology programme and the various applications of that technology. 

27. He thanked the Agency for the special mission to Jogyakarta in August 1999, when 
Indonesia had launched a programme to incorporate nuclear technology in the regional 
development strategy, and also expressed IndonesiaÂs satisfaction with the RCA, under which 
it had benefited from a wide spectrum of programmes. The latter, coupled with the bilateral 
technical co-operation activities organized by the Agency, had contributed significantly to the 
development of human resources and nuclear science and technology and its various 
applications. Indonesia would therefore continue to contribute actively to the RCA with a 
view to promoting technical co-operation among developing countries. 
28. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia), having welcomed Angola and Honduras to the Agency, 
noted that the 1999 session of the General Conference was taking place in a less tense 
atmosphere than the previous year, when nuclear testing had been on the agenda. Australia 
hoped that the two States concerned would now honour the undertakings they had made 
earlier regarding the CTBT. That Treaty was to be reviewed the following week at the 
Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT. 
29. The next treaty on arms reduction and, ultimately, nuclear disarmament was the cut-off 
treaty. Unfortunately, the Conference on Disarmament had made hardly any progress in that 
area. None the less, the conclusion of such a treaty remained a vital means of further 
reducing the risk of proliferation and an essential step towards nuclear disarmament. 
Australia hoped that the intersessional consultations that it was conducting in its capacity as 
President of the Conference on Disarmament would lead to the early start of negotiations in 
2000. In the meantime, it appreciated the Agency SecretariatÂs work in preparing information 
and advice on what was needed to verify compliance with a cut-off treaty. In AustraliaÂs 
view, the Agency was best placed to carry out such verification. 
30. Like others, Australia was concerned that for nearly a year the Agency had been unable 
to carry out the inspections called for under Security Council resolution 687. It was 
concerned that Iraq might take advantage of that interruption to reactivate its nuclear-weapons 
programme. It therefore welcomed the AgencyÂs commitment to resume verification in Iraq 
as soon as circumstances permitted. 
31. In the DPRK, the AgencyÂs responsibility was two-fold, stemming, on the one hand, 
from the safeguards agreement that was still in force and, on the other hand, from the role 
assigned to it by the Security Council pursuant to the Agreed Framework concluded between 
the DPRK and the United States. The Agency had done what it could under difficult 
circumstances to monitor the freeze of the DPRKÂs nuclear activities required by the Agreed 
Framework. However, for the Agency to be able to discharge its full safeguards 
responsibilities under the Agreed Framework, more co-operation was needed from the DPRK 
authorities. The Agency had still been denied the access that would allow it to measure the 
plutonium content of the spent fuel rods from the Nyongbyon reactor. For that and other 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 11 

reasons the Secretariat was still not in a position to verify the DPRKÂs initial declaration and 
that country was still failing to comply with its safeguards agreement. The DPRK had to be 
induced to preserve all information needed by the Agency to be able to verify the accuracy 
and completeness of that declaration. Australia welcomed the apparent improvement in 
relations between the DPRK and the United States and hoped that it would lead to an 
improvement in co-operation with the Agency. In the meantime, the General Conference 
should require the Agency to continue its monitoring role, which remained vital. 

32. In the case of both the DPRK and Iraq, the Agency should endeavour to establish a 
normal relationship on the basis of the existing safeguards agreements with those countries, 
but also through the conclusion of Additional Protocols. Unfortunately, the strengthened 
safeguards system, embodied in the Model Additional Protocol, was running behind schedule 
and, while Indonesia was to be congratulated on signing an Additional Protocol that very day, 
there appeared to be little prospect of reaching the objective of having Additional Protocols in 
force by mid-2000 with all States that had concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
Australia urged the Agency to step up its activities to correct those deficiencies and believed 
that the international community should declare the Model Additional Protocol as constituting 
the AgencyÂs safeguards system prescribed by the NPT, so that all States Party to the Treaty 
would be obliged to conclude and implement Additional Protocols without delay. 
33. The Board of Governors and the Secretariat had already spent an enormous amount of 
time trying to reconcile the conflicting demands of a zero-growth budget and the AgencyÂs 
increased responsibilities. Australia had no magic solution to offer and could merely note 
with relief that it had been possible to reach a compromise on Agency funding for another 
year. At the following session of the General Conference, the safeguards component of 
Regular Budget contributions would have to be reviewed or renegotiated pursuant to 
resolution GC(39)/RES/11 adopted in 1995. Australia intended to participate actively in that 
review, since it believed that the whole international community benefited from the 
verification of nuclear non-proliferation, and the current arrangement - which was inelegant, 
too selective, and inequitable - was far too complicated. 
34. The technical co-operation programme, valuable as it was, also placed increasing 
demands on Member States. Australia, recognizing the programmeÂs importance, intended to 
increase its voluntary contribution to 1.5 million Australian dollars in 1999. It would 
continue to provide in-kind technical support to the Agency and to neighbouring countries in 
various areas of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, and it was particularly interested in 
the RCA. 
35. Among other budgetary issues facing the Agency, none had greater immediacy than the 
funding of the AgencyÂs participation in the nuclear arms control verification arrangements. 
The Director General was to be commended for having raised the matter at the 1998 session 
of the General Conference, and then for having developed options for consideration by the 
Board of Governors. The political reality showed, or confirmed, that, despite the setbacks in 
South Asia in 1998 and the continuing concern about Iraq and the situation in the Korean 
Peninsula, the world had made extraordinary progress in bringing the nuclear genie under 
control. However, the function of verifying achievements continued to be an integral part of 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 12 

the achievements themselves. That verification entailed real costs. The question was how to 
provide the Agency with the necessary resources to enable it to discharge its responsibilities 
and exploit new opportunities. The principal challenge that lay ahead would be coping with 
all those demands in the face of the zero-real-growth policy to which Member States were 
committed. 

36. The new agreement reached by the Board of Governors on the monitoring of 
accumulations and transfers of neptunium and americium, which were now regarded as being 
of proliferation concern, was an important development. Australia, which had played a major 
role in those negotiations, welcomed the final result. It was content with the nature of the 
arrangements which had been agreed, but stressed the need for vigilance in case the quantities 
involved began to reach levels calling for more stringent measures such as applied to 
plutonium and highly enriched uranium. 
37. Nuclear safety was another major Agency responsibility. It had done an excellent job in 
that area and Australia paid particular tribute to the Deputy Director General for Nuclear 
Safety, Mr. Domaratzki. Australia was particularly impressed with the way in which he had 
focused the AgencyÂs Y2K activities on nuclear installation safety. Australia was happy to be 
one of the countries that had provided extrabudgetary resources to finance those activities. 
38. The Convention on Nuclear Safety only covered power reactors, whereas research 
reactors, which were more numerous, were not subject to any comparable international 
regulation or peer review. It was true that research reactors were smaller than power plants, 
but transparency of operation and vigilance on safety were still essential. It was therefore 
time to consider whether some elements of the review mechanism under the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety should not be extended to research reactors. 
39. There had been talk the previous year about the possibility of establishing a long-term 
repository for nuclear waste, spent fuel and surplus radioactive material in Australia under a 
proposal from a private company, Pangea Resources. The General Conference would seem to 
be the appropriate forum to reiterate the Australian GovernmentÂs clear and unequivocal 
position, namely that its policy of prohibiting the import and disposal of radioactive waste 
from other countries was absolute and irrevocable. 
40. Mr. KENIK (Belarus), after welcoming Honduras and Angola to membership of 
the Agency, recalled that since its independence Belarus had espoused the principles of 
nuclear non-proliferation. It had ratified the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of 
Strategic Offensive Arms, acceded to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State, and concluded 
a safeguards agreement with the Agency. It had been one of the first States to sign the CTBT 
and all strategic nuclear weapons had been withdrawn from its territory. 
41. Belarus was very appreciative of the AgencyÂs efforts to facilitate the establishment of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones and urged all States with military programmes to curtail them and 
to submit all their nuclear installations and materials to Agency safeguards. 
42. As a resolute supporter of non-proliferation, Belarus welcomed the AgencyÂs activities 
in regard to the safety of radiation sources and the security of radioactive materials as well as 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 13 

the measures taken to combat illicit trafficking in them. In accordance with its safeguards 
agreement, it was making every effort to exercise effective control over all the nuclear 
materials on its territory and was preparing to sign an Additional Protocol. Convinced of the 
need to further strengthen the safeguards system, Belarus was actively implementing the 
measures provided for in Part 1 of Programme 93+2 and was ensuring efficient operation of 
its national system of accounting for and control of nuclear material, which had been 
established with Agency help. 

43. With the active support of the Agency and with the help of certain donor countries, 
including Japan, to which his country was particularly grateful and with which it looked 
forward to further fruitful collaboration, Belarus was planning to set up a regional training 
centre for accountancy, control and physical protection of nuclear material. It had already 
organized two international courses enabling specialists from ex-Soviet Union countries and 
Bulgaria, Poland and Romania to learn about the international safeguards system and the 
methods and practices applied to control nuclear materials. Recognizing that the illicit use 
and trafficking in nuclear materials was a global problem, Belarus advocated increasing the 
resources allocated in the Regular Budget to the programme on systems of accounting, 
control and physical protection of nuclear materials. 
44. With a view to increasing the fruitful international co-operation in the field of nuclear 
and radiation safety, Belarus had acceded in January 1999 to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety and had taken part in the work of the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to 
that Convention, which had shown that close co-operation was essential for maximum safety. 
At the same time, Belarus specialists were looking into the question of BelarusÂ possible 
accession to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 
45. Belarus appreciated the AgencyÂs consistent efforts to strengthen the safety of all 
reactors, including RBMK reactors. Believing that States were responsible for the safe 
operation of their nuclear power plants, Belarus, which had suffered terribly from the effects 
of the Chernobyl accident, acknowledged by the UN as the greatest technological disaster of 
the twentieth century, had postponed taking a decision on the construction of a nuclear power 
plant. Bitter experience had taught Belarus to attach particular importance to radiation and 
nuclear safety and it accordingly advocated that the AgencyÂs activities to enhance safety by 
means of legal and verification mechanisms should continue to have high priority in the 
twenty-first century. 
46. Collaboration between Belarus and the Agency under the technical assistance 
programme - the AgencyÂs most dynamic programme - was producing satisfactory results and 
he welcomed the flexible approach taken by the Secretariat in heeding the interests of States 
when preparing that programme. The projects implemented in Belarus in 1999 concerned 
with rehabilitating land contaminated as a result of the Chernobyl accident were helping to 
promote scientific, technical and industrial development in those regions, particularly in the 
fields of radiation metrology, medicine, food and agriculture. One example was the project 
on rapeseed cultivation for the production of lubricants. Belarus planned to initiate another 
project with Agency assistance on the production of edible rapeseed oil. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 14 

47. Belarus was actively participating in regional co-operation by organizing training 
courses and fellowships and offering the services of its experts. He urged the Agency to 
continue to take advantage of BelarusÂ accumulated experience in the field of nuclear 
technology. Thus, several projects on the production of pharmaceuticals and new materials, 
developed in collaboration with the Agency, should be included in the technical co-operation 
programme for 2001-2002. 
48. Belarus had made a commitment to pay back its arrears under a payment plan agreed 
with the Agency which it would do its utmost to observe. In spite of the difficult economic 
situation, aggravated by the need to mitigate the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and 
natural disasters, it had made a contribution of US $1 073 000 to the Regular Budget for 1999 
and had also paid its assessed programme costs for 1998 and its voluntary contribution 
for 1999. 
49. Finally, stressing that Belarus was doing everything possible to extend collaboration 
with the Agency and fully supported its activities in the fields of the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy, safety and non-proliferation, he appealed to Member States to support his countryÂs 
candidature for a seat on the Board of Governors. In conclusion, he said his Government 
recommended approving the Annual Report for 1998 and the AgencyÂs budget for 2000. 
Mr. Ki-Moon Ban (Republic of Korea) took the Chair. 

50. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that over the previous eight years, Iraq had fulfilled 
its obligations under paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of Security Council resolution 687, and had 
co-operated with the AgencyÂs Action Team. In the reports to the Security Council in 
October 1997, April 1998 and May 1999, the Director General had emphasized the coherent 
picture obtained of IraqÂs former programme. Those reports indicated that the Agency was 
devoting the majority of its resources to the on-going monitoring and verification plan and 
that there were no significant inconsistencies between that picture and the information 
contained in the full, final and complete declaration issued by Iraq on 7 September 1996. 
51. In his report of April 1999, the Director General stated that the evaluation of the results 
of the analyses of environmental samples taken during the inspection of presidential sites 
between 26 March and 3 April 1998 had shown no indication of the presence of proscribed 
materials, or the conduct of proscribed activities at any of the sites visited. That statement 
confirmed the fact that the allegations put forward by certain countries were unfounded, 
reinforced IraqÂs credibility and corroborated the explanation it had given of the motives 
behind the allegations in question. It was important to recall all the publicity surrounding the 
presidential sites in view of the similar campaign currently being orchestrated by the same 
parties to spread false allegations that Iraq had carried out prohibited activities. The 
AgencyÂs latest reports indicated that only a few outstanding questions remained and that they 
did not affect at all the coherent picture that the Agency had formed of IraqÂs former nuclear 
programme. 
52. It was clear from the foregoing that Iraq had discharged its obligations under 
resolution 687. It was therefore regrettable that the Security Council had not done the same 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 15 

and lifted the sanctions imposed on Iraq because two permanent members of the Security 
Council had abused their influence to prevent the Council from concluding that Iraq had 
implemented all its obligations under resolution 687. Those two countries, the United States 
and the United Kingdom, had used UNSCOM to serve their own hostile policy towards Iraq 
and maintain the embargo. The aggression they had perpetrated from 16 to 20 December 
1998 had highlighted their vile objectives and the infamous role that UNSCOM had played in 
espionage against Iraq, the provocation of false crises and the preparation of that aggression. 
The United States and the United Kingdom were continuing their aggression against Iraq, 
bombing civilian targets daily in the two air exclusion zones illegally established in the north 
and south of Iraq, causing casualties among women and children as well as material damage, 
and blatantly violating international law which they claimed to uphold. Iraq, whose 
Mesopotamian civilization had given humanity its first codes and laws, continued to suffer 
brutal aggression from the power-crazed United States and United Kingdom. The 
international community should condemn such aggression. Those who were demanding that 
Iraq conform to the Security Council resolutions should demand that the United States and 
United Kingdom observe the same resolutions, cease the aggression against Iraq and lift the 
embargo on it. That embargo, which had been in force for more than nine years was a crime 
of genocide against the Iraqi people, with the number of women, children and elderly people 
who had died as a result far exceeding the death toll at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

53. Iraq expected the Agency to adhere strictly to its professional and scientific approach 
and, since the Agency had concluded that Iraq had discharged its obligations under 
paragraphs 11, 12, and 13 of resolution 687, that it should resume relations with Iraq, apply 
safeguards there and not bow to the pressures exerted by States known for their hostility 
towards Iraq. It also requested the General Conference to consider seriously the withdrawal 
from the agenda of the item relating to Iraq. 
54. The Agency had seven technical co-operation projects with Iraq in its programme for 
1999-2000, three of them being regional ones. Those humanitarian-type projects were aimed 
at resolving numerous vitally urgent problems in Iraq. Through a letter dated July 1999, the 
Agency had informed the Iraqi authorities that the Sanctions Committee established by 
Security Council resolution 661 linked the implementation of those projects to the resumption 
of activities by Agency officials in Iraq. He wished to stress that Iraq had not expelled the 
Agency officials, and that the officials responsible for the technical co-operation programme, 
some of whom were already in Iraq, were most welcome there. He also maintained that the 
linkage of such issues was tantamount to holding humanitarian considerations hostage to 
political issues, which not only contravened the relevant Security Council resolutions, but 
also gave a false idea of the Iraqi position. Iraq had not requested the departure of the 
inspectors. They had left the country at the behest of the Chairman of UNSCOM, in advance 
of the perfidious aggression of 16 December 1998. The technical co-operation projects with 
Iraq had been approved by the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee, the Board 
of Governors and the AgencyÂs Action Team, since they were consistent with the relevant 
Security Council resolutions. The projects related to the early detection of cancer, the 
diagnosis of thyroid disorders among new-borns, and the suppression of rinderpest, a disease 
that had killed large numbers of cattle in Iraq and neighbouring countries.

55. The massive destruction of Iraqi nuclear facilities during the attack on Iraq by 30 States 
in 1991 had had grave consequences and had caused widespread contamination of the 
environment. The Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission had first drawn attention to the situation 
in 1991, and had held repeated consultations on the subject with the AgencyÂs Action Team, 
requesting an assessment of the radioactive contamination, the harmful human effects of 
which were now becoming apparent. Iraq had already taken strong measures to combat the 
dangers of such contamination, and had requested technical assistance from the Agency to 
restore to service the radioactive waste processing facility at the Tuwaitha site destroyed in 
the 1991 attack. However, no tangible moves had been made by the Agency to help Iraq 
eliminate the effects of the radioactive contamination. Iraq was therefore continuing to 
rectify the situation by its own means but was being hampered in that task by the total 
embargo. 
56. At the forty-second session of the General Conference, Iraq had drawn attention to the 
damage resulting from the use by the United States and United Kingdom in 1991 of 
300 tonnes of depleted uranium against Iraqi forces, and to the radiological effects caused by 
the destruction of nuclear facilities, and had asked the international community for urgent 
assistance. On 23 February 1999, the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission had again urged the 
Agency to take appropriate measures and appealed to Member States to make a contribution 
equal to that made in response to other radiological accidents in the world. The effects on 
man and the environment were ongoing and cumulative, whilst the risks they presented did 
not stop at borders and affected the neighbouring countries of Iraq. 
57. Iraq had constantly urged the establishment in the Middle East of a denuclearized zone 
free from weapons of mass destruction and it stressed that IsraelÂs nuclear programme was a 
cause of deep concern among States of the region, because it was not subject to international 
control, a concern made all the greater by IsraelÂs refusal to accede to relevant international 
treaties and accept the associated safeguards. Iraq wondered why the States of the region 
were not treated on an equal footing, why demilitarization only applied to certain countries, 
and why IsraelÂs maintenance of an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, in particular 
nuclear weapons, was accepted. The international community should shoulder its 
responsibilities and endeavour to make the Middle East a region free from nuclear weapons 
and weapons of mass destruction. It should also induce Israel to sign the NPT, abandon 
definitively the nuclear option, and accept full-scope Agency safeguards. 
58. The negotiations in the Board of Governors and the General Conference on the 
amendment of Article VI of the Statute had been going on for more than two decades, without 
any solution acceptable to all parties being found. The United States had supported IsraelÂs 
quest for membership of the Board of Governors as a representative of the MESA region, 
even though Israel possessed a formidable nuclear arsenal and refused to accede to the NPT 
and submit to international verification. Iraq rejected the link between the issue of Board 
expansion and the composition of regional groups. The composition of regional groups 
should be approved unanimously by the States concerned. A State could only join a group if 
all the members of the group approved. Finally, it would be necessary to ensure equitable 
distribution of seats between the different regions, once the issues of amendment of Article VI 
and expansion of the Board had been settled.

59. Mr. ALLOTEY (Ghana) said it was imperative for all members of the 
international community to support the AgencyÂs efforts to promote - openly and impartially - 
the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes, and in that regard he welcomed 
the admission of Angola and Honduras to the Agency. 
60. On the threshold of the new millennium, now that the Agency had reached full maturity, 
the cold war had ceased and international co-operation was burgeoning, it was disturbing to 
find that world peace and security appeared as elusive as ever. The Agency, as the leading 
specialized institution in the nuclear energy field, needed to liaise more closely with other 
competent institutions to ensure that technological know-how was not used to destroy 
mankind, and for that it would require the unswerving support of all States. It was necessary 
to employ collective diplomacy and to recognize that, as all States were deemed equal and 
had equally valid interests and concerns, they all had to strive together to achieve the 
objectives of the NPT and complete nuclear disarmament. The Agency should work towards 
both the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and the destruction of stockpiles of 
nuclear weapons. 
61. Considering the potential contribution that the peaceful application of nuclear energy 
could make to increasing the resources necessary for the survival of a rapidly expanding 
world population, he urged the Agency to accelerate the implementation of the resolutions 
concerning the technical and economic evaluation of the production of potable water by 
seawater desalination. 
62. In co-operation with the Agency, the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission was 
promoting research on the application of nuclear techniques and biotechnology to augment 
agricultural productivity and food security, enhance human health, develop industry, protect 
the environment and assure a high level of nuclear safety, particularly in hospitals and 
relevant industries. The Commission had moreover established the National Centre for 
Mathematical Sciences which provided opportunities for research and theoretical and 
practical training for scientists in Ghana and the whole of Africa with the support of the 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, which he commended on the 
remarkable role it played in that field. Par ailleurs, the National Radioactive Waste 
Management Centre had participated during the year in activities organized through AFRA. 
63. He informed the General Conference that, for the first time in Africa, spent radium 
sources had been conditioned by a team of South African experts who had come to Ghana 
under an AFRA project. Furthermore, the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission had organized 
a regional workshop on greenhouse gas effects in 1998. 
64. Ghana deeply appreciated the excellent relations existing between the Agency and the 
Ghana Atomic Energy Commission and especially the valuable support lent by the Agency to 
development projects. With continued assistance of that kind, the Commission would be able 
to contribute even more substantially to enhancing the health of the people. 
65. Mr. PUCCIO HUIDOBRO (Chile), having welcomed Angola and Honduras as 
new members of the Agency, said that with the debate going on in some developed countries 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 18 

concerning nuclear technology which was arousing more and more fears and prejudices in the 
public mind, it was up to the Agency to confront the challenge vigorously, concentrating on 
the two key concepts of safety and development. In fact, the future of nuclear technology 
depended absolutely on nuclear, radiation and waste safety. Chile would continue to 
co-operate in those fields inter alia by making the services of its experts available, and he 
exhorted countries to collaborate transparently on the systematic development of the 
necessary infrastructures and safety standards, particularly with respect to the transport of 
radioactive materials, which was a matter of great importance to Chile. 

66. As regarded development, which was now synonymous with peace, it was up to the rich 
countries to discharge their responsibilities by working for a fairer and more stable world. 
The Agency was an appropriate institution to pursue that objective and Chile was gratified at 
the recent measures it had taken to strengthen its technical co-operation activities. TC, being 
the instrument for development and hence a cornerstone of peace, should become more and 
more the driving force of the Agency. The partners in TC, i.e. the donors, the recipients and 
the Agency, had to ensure that TC projects were adapted to national programmes so as to 
have a real impact on the socio-economic development of countries, as exemplified by the 
ARCAL programme in Latin America. The peaceful use of nuclear energy presupposed the 
maintenance of a proper balance between effective and efficient safeguards - security - and 
creative and expanding TC activities - development. 
67. In conclusion, he deplored the fact that the proposed amendment of Article VI, aimed at 
expansion and democratization of the Board of Governors, had been for so long the subject of 
controversy and conflict within the Agency between regions having similar interests. Chile 
was trying to foster an agreement through consensus within GRULAC, but that would only be 
possible if the result benefited all parties, who would accordingly need to be fully consulted 
in the matter. 
68. Mr. KASTCHIEV (Bulgaria) associated himself with the statement made by the 
delegate of Finland on behalf of the European Union. On the subject of non-proliferation, he 
declared his conviction that universal accession to the NPT and the implementation of all its 
provisions would contribute greatly to international security and to peaceful co-operation 
between Member States, and he was looking to the forthcoming NPT Review Conference to 
confirm the viability of the Treaty. 
69. On 10 September 1999 Bulgaria had ratified the CTBT, whose entry into force would 
strengthen non-proliferation and promote nuclear disarmament, and he called on all countries 
to follow suit as soon as possible. He hoped moreover that the Conference on Disarmament 
would commence without delay negotiations towards a treaty prohibiting the production of 
fissile material for military purposes. Bulgaria strongly supported the principle of 
strengthening safeguards and continued to support Programme 93+2. 
70. Turning to illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources, he said 
Bulgaria recognized the primary importance of national countermeasures but welcomed the 
growing international co-operation between Member States and the increased efforts being 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 19 

made by the Agency in that area. He also noted in that connection the improvement in the 
AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database. 

71. Stressing the importance of national export control measures, he said that, as a member 
of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Bulgaria shared the view that the 
right enshrined in Article IV of the NPT to develop research, production and use of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes should be exercised in conformity with the non-proliferation 
obligations set forth in Articles I and II of the Treaty. 
72. Whilst welcoming the conclusion that the Agency had not detected any indication of 
diversion of nuclear material in 1998, he deplored the fact that the DPRK was still not 
complying with its safeguards agreement and that the Agency had still not been able to verify 
the correctness of that countryÂs initial declaration. 
73. On the subject of nuclear safety, the Bulgarian delegation commended the work 
performed under the AgencyÂs extrabudgetary programme on WWER and RBMK reactors. 
Bulgaria had submitted its national report on the implementation of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and had taken an active part in the first review meeting of the Contracting 
Parties to the Convention. It also attached great importance to the recommendations of the 
International Conference on the Strengthening of Nuclear Safety in Eastern Europe. 
74. Bulgaria wished to thank the Agency for the assistance lent it on various TC projects 
and also to acknowledge the assistance provided to Member States to help deal with the Y2K 
problem. 
75. With regard to the budget for 2000, he considered the programmes to be well balanced. 
Despite its financial difficulties, Bulgaria had paid the whole of its dues to the Regular 
Budget and the TCF in 1998 along with all its assessed programme costs. Its voluntary 
contribution to the TCF for 2000 would be equal to the recommended amount. 
76. Nuclear power played an important role in meeting BulgariaÂs electricity needs, its 
share of total generation being 41.5%. The safety of unit 1 of Kozloduy nuclear power plant 
had been continuously increased over its 25 yearsÂ service. A programme involving 86 
activities had been undertaken in 1998 to strengthen the safety of units 1-4. The 
implementation of the upgrading programme on units 5 and 6, equipped with WWER-1000 
reactors, had also commenced in 1998 with the participation of the European Consortium and 
Westinghouse. 
77. He outlined legislative reforms planned in Bulgaria, the principal objective of which 
was to set up a strong, independent and competent regulatory body and to bring nuclear 
legislation into line with international conventions in preparation for BulgariaÂs admission to 
the European Union. Bulgaria had also initiated the ratification procedure for the Protocol 
additional to its safeguards agreement and for the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
78. Recalling the fruitful co-operation between Bulgaria and the Agency in 1998, he 
stressed in particular the assistance provided by the Agency to improve the safety of nuclear 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 20 

facilities, to enhance the capability of the authority responsible for nuclear safety and to train 
Bulgarian specialists abroad. Agency financial support had also enabled Bulgarian scientists 
to participate in various international meetings. For its part, Bulgaria had hosted Agency 
meetings and workshops and put its training facilities at the disposal of specialists from 
developing countries. Bulgarian research institutes and laboratories had also participated in 
the AgencyÂs research programme and contributed to the implementation of co-ordinated 
research projects. Bulgaria was also participating actively in the International Nuclear 
Information System, the Incident Reporting System and the Power Reactor Information 
System. 

79. Ms. MOSELY (New Zealand) regretted having to record, as at the previous 
General Conference, that the year gone by had not been particularly auspicious for countries 
which, like New Zealand, attached the utmost importance to nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament. 
80. The disturbing conclusion reached at the Tokyo Forum for Nuclear Non-proliferation 
and Disarmament that non-proliferation and disarmament treaties could become hollow 
instruments, unless concerted action was taken promptly, was not unrealistic: universality 
was far from being achieved for many treaties and the nuclear non-proliferation norm had 
been infringed. Negotiations on a fissile material treaty had yet to begin in earnest, the 
Conference on Disarmament had yet to establish a subsidiary body to address nuclear 
disarmament and the CTBT had not entered into force. The balance sheet was not good 
therefore but New Zealand did not share the pessimistic view that all was lost. 
81. Because of its concern that efforts towards nuclear disarmament and arms control were 
faltering, New Zealand along with Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, Slovenia, South Africa and 
Sweden had launched the new agenda initiative based on the conviction that the continuing 
threat represented by the prospect of the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons had to be 
confronted forthwith. The new agenda proposed a practical and realistic way forward, and 
her delegation was pleased to see that that initiative had been favourably received. 
82. Two major international events would provide an opportunity to demonstrate that 
governments were serious about nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, namely the 
Conference on Facilitating the Entry Into Force of the CTBT, which would take place in 
Vienna the following week, and the NPT Review Conference due to be held in New York 
in 2000. As regarded the CTBT Conference, she recalled that it was taking place because the 
Treaty had to be ratified by 44 States to enter into force, and that essential step along the road 
to the total elimination of nuclear weapons had not yet been taken. The universal ratification 
of the CTBT and its prompt entry into force were absolute imperatives. 
83. New Zealand regarded the NPT as the cornerstone of international peace and security 
and believed that the first Review Conference to take place since the Treaty had been 
extended indefinitely would be facing formidable challenges. The NPT review process was 
still evolving. At the 2000 Review Conference, States would have to shoulder their 
responsibilities and adopt the measures required to implement the Treaty fully in all its 
aspects, including nuclear disarmament, at an early date. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 21 

84. The Agency was one of the pillars of the international security architecture, and New 
Zealand attached the highest importance to its vital contribution to nuclear non-proliferation 
and disarmament through its safeguards role of verifying that commitments made under the 
NPT were kept. Reiterating her disappointment that not all States had concluded a safeguards 
agreement with the Agency and that only five Additional Protocols were in force, one of 
which being New ZealandÂs, she expressed the hope that strengthened safeguards would very 
soon become the norm. 
85. New Zealand was most concerned that the Agency and the DPRK had fundamentally 
differing views regarding the application of the latterÂs safeguards agreement. That 
agreement was still in force and binding, so the DPRK was in breach of its legal obligations. 
New Zealand supported the Framework Agreement between the United States and the DPRK 
and was making a financial contribution to KEDO. The latter depended on the 
implementation of commitments towards the Agency, and the DPRK had to live up to those 
commitments, if that ambitious project were to come to fruition. 
86. New Zealand was just as keen as any other State to have international security 
strengthened by arms control and reduction measures, backed up by a credible verification 
system. It particularly welcomed the progress made by the Agency, the United States and the 
Russian Federation in concluding arrangements for the verification of fissile material no 
longer required for military purposes. 
87. It was clear, however, that that important initiative would have significant implications 
for the AgencyÂs financial situation. For more than a decade the Agency had been operating 
under the constraint of a zero-real-growth budget, whilst at the same time being required to 
expand its activities, particularly in the safeguards field. Reliable and predictable funding 
was required for that purpose. New Zealand could not supply any magic solution to that 
problem, which was one that had to be faced up to squarely. 
88. In subscribing fully to the need for a global nuclear safety culture, New Zealand, which 
itself possessed very little radioactive material, was concerned above all about the transport of 
such material by other parties, a concern which was shared by its Pacific island neighbours. 
New Zealand was thus deeply dismayed at the shipment of MOX fuel through its region en 
route from Europe to Japan. On the matter of transboundary movements of radioactive 
material, she made it clear that New ZealandÂs objective was prior notification and, ideally, 
prior informed consent procedures. However, at the present Conference her delegation was 
supporting a balanced and moderate draft resolution designed to build on an initiative taken 
the previous year to promote more transparency in the application of laws and regulations 
concerning the shipment of radioactive material. That draft resolution fell well short of New 
ZealandÂs ultimate objectives but it was a very practical and useful measure. 
89. Turning to the matter of Article VI, she felt that a solution could now be in sight. From 
the outset, New Zealand had understood the sentiments of those who considered themselves 
to be underrepresented on the Board of Governors, and she hoped that the General 
Conference would demonstrate enough flexibility and mutual understanding to settle that 
question once and for all. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 22 

90. In conclusion, she commended the hard work, common sense and vision of the Director 
General and his staff and in particular the efforts made to increase the number of women in 
the Secretariat, especially in high-level posts. 
Mr. Soeriaatmadja (Indonesia) took the Chair. 

91. Mr. VALENTUKEVI.IUS (Lithuania), having welcomed the admission of 
Honduras and Angola to the Agency and thanked the Director General and the Deputy 
Director General for Nuclear Safety for their visit to Lithuania in June, endorsed the statement 
made by the delegate of Finland on behalf of the European Union. 
92. Because of the crucial role played by nuclear power in its national economy, Lithuania 
accorded high priority to improving safety. The national regulatory authority had followed 
the western model in issuing Ignalina NPP with a five-year licence to operate unit 1. During 
1999 nuclear legislation had been expanded by two acts elaborated with the aid of Agency 
experts, one covering radiation protection and the other radioactive waste management. 
93. The new national energy strategy, which Parliament was currently debating, provided 
for unit 1 at Ignalina NPP to be shut down in 2005, with the unit 2 being due to start up 
in 2004. The cost of closure would be immense and Lithuania would require financial and 
technical assistance from the European Union and other organizations. A donor conference 
would take place shortly in Vilnius, and Lithuania hoped that the Agency would contribute to 
its success. 
94. More than 80 per cent of the measures contained in the second safety improvement 
programme for Ignalina NPP had already been implemented and it was proposed to set up a 
third programme of that type and produce a new safety analysis report. In that connection, he 
noted with satisfaction that the nuclear community had acknowledged that second-generation 
RBMK reactors of the type installed at Ignalina could tolerate design-basis accidents without 
substantial damage to the environment. 
95. Lithuania considered the exchange of views during discussions of national reports under 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety to have been most useful. The Convention could evidently 
serve as a means of assessing the level of nuclear safety in a particular country. In that 
connection, he noted that remarks made regarding the safety of Ignalina NPP had not taken 
into account either the substantial technical safety measures being implemented or the 
improvements in safety culture which had taken place. Thanks to support from the Agency 
and the United States Department of Energy, the Y2K problem should not directly affect 
safety-related systems at Ignalina NPP or other important systems in the energy sector. 
96. International co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety was especially 
important for small countries with modest resources. The problems of low- and medium-level 
radioactive waste, and the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel could best be solved by joint 
efforts, and the Agency could play a very important role in co-ordinating such efforts. That 
also applied to the development of safety standards for the transport of radioactive material, 
and Lithuania appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to create a uniform global regime for the 
transport of such material. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 23 

97. Recalling that Lithuania had acceded to the NPT in September 1991, he noted that the 
State Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate (VATESI) had set up a State system of accounting 
and control of all nuclear material subject to safeguards. As a staunch supporter of the NPT, 
Lithuania highly appreciated the AgencyÂs contribution to the application of comprehensive 
safeguards and deplored the fact that some States were still opting to stay outside the NPT 
regime whilst others were violating safeguards agreements concluded with the Agency. 
98. Turning to the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities, he 
commended the AgencyÂs contribution in that field and expressed his countryÂs gratitude for 
the IPPAS mission to Lithuania in June 1999 to verify that its system conformed with 
international standards. 
99. On the subject of technical co-operation, he expressed appreciation for the assistance 
provided to Lithuania under the national project on the training of nuclear power plant 
personnel and regional projects concerned with the upgrading of radiotherapy facilities, the 
development of a legal framework for nuclear activities, and radioactive waste management. 
A marked increase in bilateral co-operation between Lithuania and other Member States was 
also taking place. 
100. Mr. NSIMBI (Zimbabwe), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the 
Agency, said that Zimbabwe had also benefited from nuclear technology and was in the 
process of implementing four technical co-operation projects, including one on the use of 
isotopes for assessing and developing water resources, the aim of which was to formulate an 
effective groundwater management plan. 
101. The Model Project on the production of biofertilizers to help increase agricultural 
production, involving six of the eight provinces in the country, was having a positive impact 
on smallholders. Following the success of the project, the Agency was supporting a regional 
project aimed at increasing the production of smallholders through the use of biofertilizers in 
sub-Saharan Africa as part of the technical co-operation programme for 1999-2000, and 
Zimbabwe was playing a key role in that project. The counterparts concerned were 
organizing a national demonstration programme on soya bean processing technology to 
increase the impact of the project and win increased Agency assistance. 
102. Two other projects concerning Zimbabwe had also been approved as part of the 
1999-2000 cycle, one relating to radioimmunoassay techniques for cancer diagnosis, and the 
other to control of the human papilloma virus associated with cervical cancer. Furthermore, 
his country was participating in a project to establish a radiation protection infrastructure and 
was planning to set up an independent national body responsible for that area. In March 
1999, Zimbabwe had hosted the first co-ordination meeting for the regional project on the use 
of isotopes to control communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis and malaria, and the 
success of that project would greatly improve the welfare of the population. 
103. With regard to Article VI of the Statute, Zimbabwe supported the proposal of the Group 
of 77 and China for expansion of the Board by eight seats, and urged the General Conference 
to reach consensus on the issue before the end of the present session. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 24 

104. Zimbabwe, which had become a member of AFRA in April 1998, had benefited from 
that agreement in terms of capacity building. Unfortunately, owing to financial constraints 
obtaining in other sectors, the four projects involving Zimbabwe had not yet started, but the 
Government had undertaken to make available the funds required for their implementation 
in 2000. 
105. With regard to the Y2K problem, he noted that the competent authorities in Zimbabwe 
were taking corrective measures and establishing contingency plans in order to meet the 
deadline of 31 December 1999. 
106. Finally, his Government, which recognized the need to meet its financial obligations in 
full and on time, was studying a proposal to guarantee payment of all its financial 
contributions to the Agency. 
107. Mr. MALESKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), having 
welcomed Angola and Honduras as new members, lauded the AgencyÂs tireless efforts to 
encourage the use of nuclear technology to foster the sustainable economic and social 
development of its Member States. Moreover, the Agency was playing a crucial role in 
developing legal instruments essential for international security and stability. His delegation 
also commended the efforts made to improve all aspects of nuclear safety and to prevent illicit 
trafficking. 
108. With regard to the measures taken to strengthen regional co-operation with a view to 
achieving a more integrated approach to safety and environmental issues, he expressed his 
countryÂs appreciation to the Agency for the attention it was paying to the regional project on 
the Prespa lake, which his country was implementing with Albania and Greece. 
109. Having enumerated projects being implemented in the fields of nuclear medicine, 
animal production, irrigation, and non-destructive testing, he said that the projects for the next 
cycle would be defined with Agency assistance. In that connection, he expressed appreciation 
for the valuable assistance rendered by the Department of Technical Co-operation in 
formulating national projects and establishing priorities. The Agency had also aided the 
Macedonian Government to elaborate safety standards in conformity with its 
recommendations, and to develop the associated infrastructure as well as legislation and 
monitoring systems. 
110. Having thanked the Agency for its support, enabling Macedonian specialists to 
participate in various courses and seminars that it had organized, he highlighted joint efforts 
with the Agency to strengthen the national capacity for organizing training courses on 
radiation protection in industrial and medical radiography. His country was prepared, with 
assistance from the Department of Technical Co-operation, to host specialists from 
neighbouring countries. Finally, he announced that his country had pledged its share of the 
TCF target. 
111. Mr. CHARRY SAMPER (Colombia) said that the AgencyÂs mission was to 
increase the ability of Member States to make full use of nuclear technology to foster 
socio-economic development, taking account of the different levels of nuclear development, 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 25 

the environmental hazards of that form of energy and the desire of peoples in all regions of 
the world for nuclear weapons to be subjected to control and progressively eliminated. 

112. The Agency had an irreplaceable role to play in the application of verification measures 
aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and encouraging the dismantling of 
nuclear arsenals. Efficient co-ordination between the Agency and the United Nations system, 
and swift reaction to violations of safeguards agreements would serve to establish conditions 
ensuring that that prodigious source of energy was used for constructive and not destructive 
purposes. 
113. Colombia noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs contribution to the strengthening of 
national capacities in the nuclear field thanks to national technical co-operation projects, 
ARCAL projects, study visits, expert missions, equipment and training. The new technical 
co-operation strategy had made it possible to pay closer attention to the needs of each country 
and focus on the end-user, which increased the efficiency of technical co-operation activities. 
It was important to intensify such co-operation with those that had the greatest need, i.e. the 
developing countries. 
114. The ARCAL programme had been established 15 years earlier and, since that time, the 
participants had defined and implemented projects to meet their immediate needs. They had 
used the infrastructure established or improved as a result of those projects for specific 
applications, and were endeavouring to consolidate their achievements. If that co-operation 
were to remain fruitful, it would be necessary, as part of the ongoing evaluation process, to 
take constant account of the interests and priorities of Member States, as well as the benefits 
to be derived from Agency expertise. 
115. One of ColombiaÂs priorities in the nuclear area was to improve its radiation protection 
infrastructure, as it did not yet have an effective and independent regulatory or normative 
framework, or a complete radiation protection and nuclear safety system. An Agency mission 
had gone to Colombia to examine a plan of action to strengthen radiation protection. That 
plan, the implementation of which was a test of the ability of the Agency and the Colombian 
Government to undertake joint action, covered the following areas: legal framework, 
regulation, codes of practice, regulatory body, regulatory control, monitoring of occupational 
exposure, management of radioactive waste, and emergency response. That expert mission 
had also helped to develop a draft law on radiation protection and nuclear safety which the 
Agency was currently examining, and which he hoped could be adopted shortly. 
116. In June, the regulatory and monitoring functions of the Research Institute for 
Geological Sciences, Mining and Chemistry (INGEOMINAS) had been transferred to the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines. Thus, a first step had been taken towards the establishment of 
a supervisory body for the peaceful use of nuclear energy that was independent of the 
promotional body, as recommended by the Agency. 
117. INGEOMINAS, whose research and information role in the nuclear area had been 
strengthened, now had two main areas of activity: the characterization and processing of 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 26 

radioactive minerals and materials, and the development of a national strategy for preventing 
and dealing with radioactive risks. 

118. Colombia, whose constitution already forbade the dumping of toxic and radioactive 
waste, hoped that the Code of Practice on the International Transboundary Movement of 
Radioactive Waste, which the General Conference had adopted in 1990, would make it 
possible to give effect to that constitutional provision. Furthermore, the draft law on radiation 
protection and nuclear safety provided for the adoption of the AgencyÂs Regulations for the 
Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials. 
119. Noting the efforts undertaken to strengthen the safeguards system, and in particular, the 
adoption of the Model Additional Protocol by the Board of Governors, he said that Colombia, 
which had concluded a safeguards agreement with the Agency in connection with the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, was currently considering completing the formalities required for the 
signing of a safeguards agreement in connection with the NPT and a Protocol additional to 
that agreement. 
120. Finally, he hoped that the present session of the General Conference would succeed in 
adopting a balanced amendment of Article VI of the Statute, which would provide for better 
representation of the developing countries, particularly those from Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and thereby duly acknowledge the positive role played by that region in deciding 
in 1967 to become a nuclear-weapon-free zone and in so doing encouraging the use of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
121. Mr. SANON (Burkina Faso), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to 
membership of the Agency, said that the forty-third session of the General Conference was 
taking place in a special context with the dawn of a new millennium bringing many 
challenges. 
122. Several initiatives had been taken in 1998 to improve the internal management of the 
Agency. A group of experts had reviewed the AgencyÂs activities and had reaffirmed the 
relevance of its primary mission which was to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of 
atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. The activities carried out 
on the African continent proved that nuclear technology and energy could contribute greatly 
to national development and he urged the Agency to intensify its efforts to initiate joint 
programmes with regional bodies and other United Nations organizations. 
123. In 1998, the AFRA programme had concentrated in particular on regional 
harmonization and rationalization of legislation and regulations relating to radiation 
protection and radioactive waste. He appealed to donors and multilateral and bilateral bodies 
to support AFRAÂs activities through various projects in the areas of agriculture, human and 
animal health, water resources management, training, etc. He was gratified by the level of 
contributions to the technical co-operation programme in 1998. 
124. Burkina Faso had demonstrated its commitment to the ideals of international peace and 
solidarity through its constant active involvement in the AgencyÂs activities since becoming a 
member in September 1997. It had also joined AFRA and set up a liaison centre to 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 27 

co-ordinate Agency activities in Burkina Faso. Discussions were under way with the 
Secretariat to start a co-operation programme which took the countryÂs needs and specific 
conditions into consideration. 

125. He thanked the Agency for the promptness with which it had organized a mission to 
Burkina Faso in June 1999, where it had been able to see the importance attached to Agency 
activities by the national authorities. Burkina Faso intended to honour all its commitments as 
a member of the Agency, including the payment of contributions and the conclusion of 
safeguards agreements. 
126. The Agency should play a leading role in international co-operation on nuclear, 
radiation and waste safety. He hoped that a decision on Article VI would be taken at the 
present session of the General Conference in a spirit of consensus, equity and justice and said 
that his delegation would do its utmost to help achieve such a consensus. 
127. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), having extended a welcome to 
Honduras and Angola, said that his country attached great importance to technical 
co-operation in the scientific and nuclear fields in view of the big contribution it made to most 
spheres of economic and social development, with nuclear energy becoming indispensable to 
meet the growing needs of the developing countries. Small and medium power reactors 
would be vital in that regard because they were well adapted to consumption in the 
developing countries. Special attention should therefore be given to those types of reactor 
which could be used for seawater desalination. Nuclear techniques had a key role to play in 
groundwater exploration, and hydrology projects should be promoted, particularly in 
countries with severe water shortages. Support was needed for regional bodies, like the Arab 
Atomic Energy Agency, concerned with promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
128. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya endorsed the steps taken by the Agency to strengthen 
international co-operation in the fields of nuclear and radiation safety, the safe transport and 
management of radioactive waste, and the combating of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. 
It also attached high importance to nuclear disarmament, as it was convinced that weapons of 
mass destruction posed a threat to international peace and security. That was why at 
international forums it had consistently advocated denuclearization of the Middle East, where 
the fact that one country - Israel - possessed nuclear weapons caused a serious security 
imbalance. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which was party to the Pelindaba Treaty, called for 
the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and for Israel to submit its nuclear 
installations to international inspection in accordance with the NPT. There would be no 
peace in the Middle East as long as certain powers continued to support Israel. 
129. Despite laudable efforts by the Agency to improve the representation of the developing 
countries, no tangible progress had been made and he urged that more nationals from the 
developing countries be appointed to senior Agency posts, especially as they now had the 
required competence in many areas. Noting that Africa remained the least well represented 
continent on the Board, he called for the Board of Governors to be enlarged in the light of the 
changes which had taken place in the world in recent years, in order to maintain confidence, 
strengthen the role of the Agency and secure equitable representation for the developing 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 28 

countries so that their interests would be catered for both in the management of the Agency 
and in decision-taking on its future directions, programmes and activities. 

130. Finally, stressing the importance of universality of the safeguards system, he called on 
the nuclear-weapon States to finalize a programme to eliminate their nuclear arsenals and 
terminate all nuclear weapon development programmes. 
131. Mr. HLAING (Myanmar), after congratulating Honduras and Angola as new 
members, noted with satisfaction that the Agency was reviewing and redirecting its activities 
to better respond to the needs and interests of its Member States. 
132. With nuclear safety assuming international dimension, the AgencyÂs role was becoming 
more important than ever, and he commended its activities in that sphere, as well as in the 
spheres of radiation safety, non-proliferation and safeguards, and the promotion of nuclear 
energy and its applications, which was making an important contribution to sustainable 
development and prosperity in Member States. 
133. Technical co-operation served to promote the use of environmentally friendly 
techniques, and the Agency had given Myanmar valuable assistance in terms of equipment, 
experts and training in the fields of nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. Myanmar was also 
making increasing use of radioisotopes in industry. As a member of the RCA, it appreciated 
the efforts by the Agency to promote co-operation through its regional agreements. 
134. As it embarked on a programme of nuclear applications, Myanmar was aware that it 
needed an adequate radiation protection infrastructure. The Agency was providing assistance 
in that area too. Myanmar was participating in interregional Model Projects on radiation and 
waste safety. It was also preparing regulations on the use of radiation sources and nuclear 
materials and intended to establish a regulatory authority. 
135. Long-term development needed to be examined on the threshold of a new millennium. 
Myanmar would certainly need to develop nuclear applications in industry and would also 
need nuclear power. It needed to start planning as a matter of urgency, learning from the 
experience of other countries and drawing on Agency assistance. His delegation hoped that 
the Agency would accord priority to the least developed countries in its technical assistance 
programme. 
136. On the subject of nuclear weapons, he noted that his country was party to the Treaty on 
the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which would help strengthen peace, security 
and stability in the region. Myanmar was convinced that the establishment of such zones was 
an effective way of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and it would continue to 
participate actively in international efforts to secure the total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
137. Mr. PULE (Zambia), having welcomed Angola and Honduras as new members, 
commended the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen its technical co-operation activities and 
broaden its vision; he particularly welcomed the training that it was providing on project 
design and implementation, which would help improve access to technical co-operation. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 29 

138. Zambia was deriving great benefit from the skills acquired under technical co-operation 
projects, including the use of gamma radiation to sterilize biological dressings. The 
development of certain cultivars had also been very successful and, thanks to Agency 
fellowships, Zambian researchers had received training in the use of radiation to improve crop 
yields. The various agricultural programmes concerned with both food and cash crops had 
significantly increased farmersÂ incomes. A project on industrial aerosol measurement would 
improve the working environment in the mining sector, which employed very large numbers 
of workers. The project would serve to create a database that would be useful for 
environmental protection and occupational health studies. Other projects on biofertilizers and 
animal feed supplements were helping smallholders to improve crop and livestock 
productivity. Furthermore, the Tropical Disease Research Centre had made considerable 
progress in the use of nuclear techniques against malaria. 
139. Fruitful work had been carried out over the past ten years within the framework of 
AFRA, including the establishment of special teams for the auditing of radiotherapy and 
nuclear medicine procedures, the conditioning of radium sources and the detection of dam 
leakage. The AFRA project on the maintenance and repair of scientific equipment had 
enabled 20 Zambian technicians to receive training in the repair and maintenance of nuclear 
instrumentation on two courses organized in 1998. In the area of nuclear waste management, 
Zambia had hosted a pre-project mission on the conditioning of radium sources used in the 
mining industry. 
140. Although Zambia was not currently handling nuclear materials, it was taking steps to 
prevent and combat illicit trafficking in radiation sources and ensure the security of 
radioactive materials. A seminar on those issues had been held in August 1999 in Lusaka, 
attended by 30 specialists in different fields (airline staff, fire-fighters, medical personnel, 
non-governmental organizations, etc.). In order to solve the problem of illicit trafficking in 
the long term, it would be essential for the Agency to assist Member States acquire the 
technical skills for detection activities. 
141. His delegation wished to stress that the enlargement of the Board being sought through 
amendment of Article VI of the Statute should be effected in such a way as to ensure 
equitable geographical representation of the membership of the Agency. In conclusion, he 
commended the AgencyÂs work to improve the social and economic conditions of the 
developing countries, curb the spread and threat of nuclear weapons, and halt the degradation 
of the environment. Zambia would be pledging its full share of the TCF target for the year 
2000. 
142. Mr. FEU ALVIM (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials) said that ABACC, which had been established by the Guadalajara 
Agreement between Brazil and Argentina in 1991 with the aim of eliminating any nuclear 
proliferation risks in the region, had been extremely successful. The increased solidarity 
between the countries of the region had spread in the economic, technical and cultural spheres 
to Uruguay and Paraguay with the establishment of MERCOSUR. 

GC(43)/OR.6 
page 30 

143. Brazil and Argentina, which had in the meantime taken a series of formal measures 
towards disarmament and non-proliferation, had announced at the previous session of the 
Board of Governors their intention to begin consultations with the Agency for the conclusion 
of a Protocol Additional to the Quadripartite Agreement, and ABACC was pleased to 
announce that it was ready to do likewise. 
144. Since 1992, ABACC had been applying safeguards to Brazilian and Argentine facilities, 
and since 1994, within the framework of the Quadripartite Agreement, it had been 
co-ordinating its activities with the AgencyÂs safeguards operations with a view to avoiding 
duplication, while preserving the independence of each organization. Those efforts had borne 
fruit: during the past year ABACC had progressed in the common use and standardization of 
equipment, the co-ordination of announced and unannounced inspections, as well as the 
integration of training programmes for inspectors within the framework of technical 
co-operation between the two agencies. An agreement had also been reached with the IAEA 
on the use of common safeguards procedures for small enrichment plants which ABACC was 
already applying. 
145. ABACCÂs fruitful co-operation and interaction with several organizations and 
countries, including the IAEA, the United States Department of Energy, EURATOM, the 
Commissariat Ã  lÂÃ©nergie atomique, the Technology Centre for Nuclear Control of the Korean 
Atomic Energy Research Institute, Japan, the United Kingdom and Chile, were enabling it to 
keep fully up to date and integrated in the international safeguards system 
146. Finally, he pointed out that the integration of a regional and a State system for 
accounting and control of nuclear material with the AgencyÂs international system would only 
be possible if the State system were credible. If the Agency were to introduce a quality 
assurance system, it could make more use of the regional system under the new safeguards 
regime incorporating the Additional Protocol. 
The meeting rose at 6.40 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (continued) 
(GC(43)/4) 

1. Mr. NIITENBERG (Estonia) said that Estonia, which neither had nor planned to 
have nuclear power facilities, was nevertheless responsible for the decommissioning and safe 
management of nuclear sites which were the legacy of Soviet nuclear activities. Owing to a 
lack of national funding and expertise, almost all decommissioning activities at those sites 
were being supported through multilateral and bilateral projects. His country was extremely 
grateful to the Agency, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the United States and the 
European Commission for their invaluable assistance in that and in other areas. 
2. Estonia was rapidly developing national legislation on radiation protection and 
radioactive waste management with the aim of ensuring the implementation of internationally 
accepted principles and standards. Its Radiation Protection Act of 1997, which had been 
amended in 1998, was based on concepts and limits set forth in the Basic Safety Standards 
and relevant EURATOM directives. Several regulations for implementation of the Act had 
been approved by the Government and relevant ministries, but there was a need for better 
regulations concerning a number of aspects of decommissioning and waste management. 
Draft regulations based on international and European Commission recommendations were 
being prepared and, it was hoped, would be adopted before the end of the year. 
3. As required by existing legislation, a national policy for decommissioning and 
radioactive waste disposal was being formulated. 
4. A law on the import, export and transit of strategic goods had been adopted by the 
Estonian Parliament in June 1999 and supplemented by relevant regulations. That law, 
together with the use of advanced techniques by the Border Guard Administration and 
EstoniaÂs participation in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database programme, would, it was 
hoped, contribute to international efforts to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. 
5. Estonia had ratified the CTBT and had joined other countries in requesting the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene a conference for the purpose of 
expediting the CTBTÂs entry into force. 
6. The 2000 NPT Review Conference would be an opportunity to work together towards a 
stronger nuclear non-proliferation system and further nuclear disarmament. Meanwhile, it 
was time that the Conference on Disarmament took a decision to start substantive negotiations 
on a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons and other nuclear 
explosive devices. It would be most unfortunate if a further year was lost. 
7. Mr. NIÃO DE GUZMAN (Bolivia) reiterated his countryÂs firm commitment to 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, to the peaceful uses of atomic energy and its 
application for the benefit of mankind, and to a policy of sustainable economic and socially 
equitable development. Bolivia had demonstrated its dedication to peace by acceding to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty in 1969, by subsequently signing and ratifying a safeguards agreement in 
connection with the Tlatelolco Treaty and the NPT, and - more recently, in 1999 - by ratifying 
the CTBT. 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 4 

8. Bolivia had taken important initiatives to introduce nuclear technology for development 
and, in order to increase public acceptance thereof, it had held, with Agency support, a public 
information seminar on the subject in 1998. 
9. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme was having an enormous impact in 
Bolivia in such areas as human and animal health, agriculture, radiation protection, control of 
ionizing radiation and water resources. Much work had been done in the past year to raise the 
quality of BoliviaÂs technical co-operation programmes, to enhance its project presentation 
and to improve the results attained. A national workshop on the preparation of nuclear 
technology projects had been organized with Agency support. Eight technical co-operation 
projects were currently being implemented in Bolivia and it was participating in a further ten 
projects under the ARCAL programme. The latter was a valuable instrument for facilitating 
regional co-operation, strengthening national capabilities and finding the best solutions to 
common needs. He paid tribute to the achievements of ARCAL over its 15 year existence, 
now consolidated by the intergovernmental Co-operation Agreement signed a year ago. 
10. Progress continued to be made in the field of nuclear safety. The 1997 radiation 
protection law was now being implemented, with responsibility for control of radiation 
sources being assigned to the Bolivian Institute for Nuclear Science and Technology 
(IBTEN). The Radiation Protection Centre was participating in the AgencyÂs regional Model 
Project on upgrading radiation protection infrastructure, and a recent Agency mission had 
concluded that BoliviaÂs achievements in that sphere set an example for the international 
community. Further important legislative work remained to be done, consisting mainly of 
drawing from relevant Agency conventions. Bolivia was also participating in a project on 
radiation protection supported by PAHO. 
11. Bolivia was grateful for the documentation prepared by the Agency on the Y2K 
problem and was looking forward to receiving Agency experts in the near future to evaluate 
its medical facilities. Still in the health field, it was planning to set up oncological centres and 
brachytherapy facilities. 
12. In the field of radioactive waste management, Bolivia was in the process of collecting 
and controlling radium sources on its territory. 
13. Agricultural research activities in Bolivia had concentrated on plant improvement and 
the study of crop genetics, as well as physical and chemical analysis of soils, water and 
organic, geological and mineral samples. In the field of hydrology, tracer techniques were 
being applied to study the flow of rivers and basin tributaries. 
14. Turning to verification matters, he stressed the importance of strengthening of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system in order to provide a real guarantee of peace and security for the 
world. 
15. His country was pleased to note that the AgencyÂs financial situation was sound enough 
to enable it to carry out its main activities. Bolivia, for its part, had paid its contribution to the 
Regular Budget. It had also made a partial payment of its assessed programme costs for TC 
and had submitted a proposal to the Agency for paying off the remainder. It was essential for 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 5 

a healthy TCF to be maintained, as the technical co-operation programme provided all 
Member States with the possibility of benefiting from the AgencyÂs principal statutory 
function of accelerating and enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and 
prosperity throughout the world. Each Member State should contribute in accordance with its 
ability to do so. 

16. In conclusion, he said that Bolivia was extremely proud to have been elected as a 
representative of the area of Latin America on the Board of Governors for the period 
1999-2001. It would tackle that new challenge with great dedication. 
17. Mr. URRUELA PRADO (Guatemala), having announced that his country had 
recently signed the CTBT, said that it greatly appreciated the contributions being made by 
nuclear techniques to the implementation of its development agenda. For example, nuclear 
techniques were being used - in addition to conventional ones - in studies relating to the 
contamination and eutrophication of various water bodies in Guatemala. 
18. Technical assistance from the Agency, which was co-ordinated by the General 
Directorate for Energy and Mines, was especially important in improving the populationÂs 
quality of life, and Guatemala was eager that it should continue. In that connection, his 
country had recently committed itself to establishing a mechanism designed to help increase 
the impact of Agency technical assistance. 
19. In view of the important role played in Guatemala by Agency technical assistance, his 
Government was committed to paying its full TCF target share and to providing the support 
necessary for ensuring that Agency technical co-operation projects achieved their objectives. 
20. Guatemala was ready to host regional Agency training courses and to accept Agency 
fellows, since the resulting exchanges of experience would contribute to the much-needed 
development of the Latin American region. Already it had organized a number of regional 
meetings within the framework of ARCAL. 
21. Co-operation with the United States Department of Agriculture had led to successes in 
the field of pest control, particularly in the control of the medfly. 
22. There had been considerable progress in GuatemalaÂs geothermal power sector, with the 
construction of new power plants at AmatitlÃ¡n and Zunil. Three further areas of geothermal 
activity were being explored, the ultimate aim being a total geothermal power capacity 
of 430 MW(e). It was hoped that the use of isotope techniques would expedite the 
explorations. 
23. Mr. NGUYEN XUAN HONG (Viet Nam), having welcomed Angola and 
Honduras as members of the Agency, said that, with the Conference taking place at the turn of 
the millennium, it was a good time to take stock. 
24. On the non-proliferation front, the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone was an 
important contribution by ASEAN to common efforts to eliminate weapons of mass 
destruction from the world. In order to ensure full implementation of the Bangkok Treaty 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 6 

establishing the zone, it was essential that all nuclear-weapon States accede to the Protocol of 
the Treaty. 

25. Being a party to the NPT and a supporter of the non-proliferation regime, Viet Nam had 
done its best to comply with all commitments under its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. It also supported the strengthening of the safeguards system, so he was pleased to 
report that the necessary internal steps were being taken towards Viet NamÂs signing of the 
Additional Protocol. 
26. With regard to the financing of possible Agency verification of nuclear arms control 
and reduction measures, his country shared the view of many members of the Group of 77 
that that issue called for thorough examination to ensure that the promotional activities of the 
Agency were not affected. 
27. The year 1999 had seen further developments in the peaceful use of atomic energy in 
different sectors in Viet Nam. Notable successes had been obtained with the development of 
high-yielding varieties of rice and other agricultural crops through mutation, the application 
of radioisotopes in diagnosis and therapy, the application of nuclear techniques in industry 
and environmental studies, and the radiation sterilization of medical products and tissue grafts 
and membranes for clinical use. With Agency assistance a new 60Co irradiation facility had 
recently been completed in Ho Chi Minh City. 
28. In the years to come, nuclear technology would be applied to improve the existing 
national public health service, with a model radiology and radiotherapy centre planned to be 
set up in Hanoi. 
29. The provision of clean drinking water being a major worldwide concern, Viet Nam 
strongly supported the draft resolutions on the application of isotope hydrology for water 
resources management and on the production of potable water, and hoped that due attention 
would be accorded thereto under the AgencyÂs TC programme. 
30. With funding support from the Government and with Agency assistance, the radiation 
protection infrastructure had been considerably improved in all aspects. Viet Nam was 
making great efforts to foster a safety culture in the national institutions dealing with radiation 
sources. Within the framework of Model Project RAS/9/021, a series of documents had been 
drafted with the aid of Agency experts, and national training activities had been organized for 
persons working with radiation sources, particularly for those in charge of radiation 
protection in provinces of Viet Nam. 
31. Noting that sustainable development was closely linked to the sustainable development 
of energy sources, he said that nuclear power was one of the options among the energy mix in 
his country. The nuclear power option had been the subject of an Agency TC project 
evaluation which had shown that the first nuclear power plant with a capacity of 3000 MW 
should be introduced into the national electricity generating system in Viet Nam around the 
years 2017-2020. Before then it would be necessary to develop an adequate infrastructure, 
including a nuclear regulatory system and qualified manpower. He hoped that the Agency 
would continue to help promote public understanding of nuclear power development in the 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 7 

country, particularly through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). In that connection, 
he informed the Conference that, in co-operation with the Agency, Viet Nam would be 
organizing a national workshop on the CDM and nuclear power that October. 

32. Since the previous General Conference, the Agency had carried out a lot of effective 
TC activities for which the Secretariat was to be congratulated. Viet Nam remained 
committed to paying its full assessed contribution to the Regular Budget and TCF target share 
despite its financial constraints. 
33. In conclusion, referring to the proposed amendment of Article VI of the Statute, he 
stressed that the formula for the distribution of additional seats to the area groups should take 
into account the interests of non-designated developing member countries. 
34. Mr. YENNIMATAS (Greece) said he would address the three main Agency 
programme components and, first, nuclear safety. Although the responsibility for the safe 
design and operation of nuclear facilities rested with individual States, the Agency had a 
fundamental role in ensuring the application of proper safety standards through international 
co-operation. The first review meeting of the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April that year 
had shown how international co-operation could prompt States to implement high standards 
in the field of nuclear safety through greater transparency. It had also provided an 
opportunity to collaborate with neighbouring countries in nuclear safety issues of mutual 
interest. Greece was therefore happy to reconfirm its commitment to the objectives and the 
obligations of the Convention. 
35. Although the Agency already had in place a programme related to the decommissioning 
of nuclear facilities, Greece considered it of paramount importance for that programme to be 
expanded beyond the present limited stage of training and consultancy. It should start to deal 
with the practical problems associated with the decommissioning process and provide the 
necessary assistance for the strict implementation of safety measures. 
36. Turning to non-proliferation and safeguards, he said Greece staunchly supported the 
verification role of the Agency. It was the duty of the international community to highlight 
the need for disarmament and to strengthen the safeguards system. His country was dedicated 
to the principle of universality of the NPT, which remained the cornerstone of the global 
non-proliferation regime. 
37. The world with NPT was better than the world without NPT but the Treaty needed to be 
reaffirmed and revitalized. That could be achieved, on one hand, by expediting acceptance 
and implementation of the Additional Protocol and, on the other, by reducing the number and 
salience of nuclear weapons. It was vital for the international community to find new 
approaches to reduce the nuclear threat but that would require a vision and a road map of how 
to resolve complex issues which had emerged in recent years. The 2000 NPT Review 
Conference should pave the way for the resolution of unexpected challenges. 
38. He welcomed the initiative taken by the Agency, the United States and Russia aimed at 
ensuring that nuclear material removed from weapon programmes could not return to military 
use and exploring ways of subjecting surplus fissile material stocks to Agency verification. 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 8 

39. Greece participated in all fora concerned with non-proliferation and would continue to 
subscribe to any international or multinational treaty which would advance that goal. It had 
ratified the CTBT and hoped that more countries would follow suit. 
40. Greece was also gratified at the commitment undertaken by a number of States related 
to the management of plutonium. 
41. All the various potential new verification activities had prompted the Director General 
to propose a special fund to finance them. Detailed discussions on the necessary 
arrangements would be required if the Agency were to respond adequately to a worldwide 
demand for it to assume a key expanded role in the field of peace and security. 
42. Whilst applauding the AgencyÂs activities with regard to physical protection and illicit 
trafficking, Greece would like to see more practical involvement by the Agency, not only in 
the field of training or co-operation in developing safety guides but also in providing 
assistance to Member States with the procurement of monitoring equipment for use at border 
controls. 
43. In that context, he mentioned that a recent Greek ministerial order obliged all customs 
authorities in the country, as well as factories processing scrap metal, to be equipped with 
appropriate instruments for detecting radioactive material or radiation sources. 
44. As regarded the safety and security of radiation sources, the Agency should develop a 
comprehensive database for the central monitoring of radiation sources in co-operation with 
the suppliers and receivers of such sources. 
45. As the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material had been in force for 
several years and many things had changed, there was an urgent need to consider widening 
the scope of the Convention to cover, inter alia, materials in transit. 
46. The process of ratification by the Greek Parliament of the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management was 
now in its final stages and was expected to be completed in the near future. 
47. Finally, on technical assistance, he declared that Greece, as both a donor and recipient 
of technical assistance, would continue to contribute in full to both the AgencyÂs Regular 
Budget and to the TCF. 
Mr. Kadri (Algeria) took the Chair. 

48. Mr. ARMOUTI (Jordan) expressed appreciation for the efforts made by the 
Agency to meet its statutory objectives with respect to nuclear non-proliferation and 
promotion of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Jordan also welcomed the work it had done 
to consolidate international co-operation through such conventions as the Early Notification 
Convention, the Assistance Convention, and the recent Joint Convention concerned with 
spent fuel and waste management.

49. The Agency should take advantage of the positive trends in the Middle Eastern political 
climate, which could lead to the hoped-for lasting peace. Oman had signed the NPT and a 
safeguards agreement between it and the Agency had been drawn up. Now, all the Arab 
countries without exception were party to the NPT. Most of the countries in the Middle East 
were prepared to take whatever steps were necessary to transform the region into a nuclear- 
and also a chemical- and biological-weapon-free zone. However, Israel, which refused either 
to sign the NPT or to submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, continued to pose a 
nuclear threat and that could lead to a destructive arms race. Jordan was confident that the 
General Conference would take all measures to remedy that situation in accordance with its 
resolution on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. 
50. Amendment of Article VI of the Statute to provide more equitable representation in the 
Board of Governors for the areas of Africa and of the Middle East and South Asia was more 
necessary than ever, not least because the members of those area groups had made substantial 
progress in the nuclear field. 
51. Jordan supported the AgencyÂs efforts to find a solution to the Y2K problem, 
particularly with respect to nuclear power stations, fuel processing and waste treatment plants 
and medical facilities. 
52. The Agency had shown itself to be a real leader in development issues. Even greater 
emphasis should be placed on the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, to enable the 
developing countries to improve their technological capabilities. Sustainable development 
was to be achieved by providing assistance not only in setting up nuclear facilities but also in 
training the necessary manpower to operate them properly. 
53. In addition, Jordan hoped that the Agency would assist countries in moves to combat 
illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. Efficient controls were 
needed to ensure that such materials were accounted for at all times and to minimize the risk 
of accidents which were harmful to human health and the environment. 
54. Population growth in many countries meant an increasing demand for resources. Jordan 
welcomed the AgencyÂs programme to promote regional nuclear desalination facilities 
capable both of providing potable water and generating electricity. It also supported the 
AgencyÂs continuing efforts to promote the use of isotope hydrology for water resources 
management. 
55. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency in Tunis made its nuclear facilities available to many 
countries in the Arab world and to Agency Member States. However, it lacked financial 
support. More co-operation with the Agency would enable nuclear technologies to be 
disseminated much more widely. 
ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
(GC(43)/3 and 26) 

56. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a 
procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a 

GC(43)/OR.7 
page 10 

particular area, no secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas 
where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the 
rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time, particularly when elections could be concluded 
without a vote. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure of the 
General Conference, which provided that elections to the Board should be by secret ballot, be 
suspended in respect of those areas for which there was agreement. He was happy to report 
that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their candidates for the vacancies to be 
filled. 

57. Drawing attention to document GC(43)/3, containing a list of the Agency Member 
States which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the 
present session until the end of the forty-fourth (2000) regular session, he recalled that, under 
Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the elective 
places on the Board which had to be filled and accordingly invited delegates to refer to 
document GC(43)/26. That document indicated that the Conference now had to elect eleven 
members to the Board from the seven categories listed. 
58. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Bolivia and Cuba to the two 
vacant seats for Latin America. 
59. Bolivia and Cuba were duly elected. 
60. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Austria and 
Finland to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
61. Austria and Finland were duly elected. 
62. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Belarus and 
Poland to the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
63. Belarus and Poland were duly elected. 
64. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Algeria and 
Nigeria to the two vacant seats for Africa. 
65. Algeria and Nigeria were duly elected. 
66. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Syrian 
Arab Republic to the vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
67. The Syrian Arab Republic was duly elected. 
68. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the 
Republic of Korea to the vacant seat for the Far East. 
69. The Republic of Korea was duly elected.

70. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Indonesia to 
the floating seat for MESA/SEAP/Far East, which it was the turn of a member from SEAP to 
fill. 
71. Indonesia was duly elected. 
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.

APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
(GC(43)/14) 

1. The PRESIDENT recalled that in September 1995 the General Conference, upon 
the recommendation of the Board of Governors, had appointed the Comptroller and Auditor 
General of the United Kingdom as External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the 
financial years 1996 and 1997. In September 1997, that appointment had been extended for 
the financial years 1998 and 1999. The period of the External AuditorÂs appointment would 
end with the completion of the audit of the AgencyÂs accounts for 1999. He took it that the 
General Conference, in line with the recommendation made by the Board of Governors at its 
meeting in June 1999, wished to extend the period of appointment of the present External 
Auditor for a further period of two years so that he could audit the AgencyÂs accounts 
for 2000 and 2001. 
2. It was so decided. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1998 (resumed) 
(GC(43)/4) 

3. Mr SANTER (Luxembourg), having welcomed Honduras and Angola to the 
Agency, associated himself fully with the statement made by Finland on behalf of the 
European Union. 
4. The first review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety to discuss the national 
reports on the safety of nuclear installations - held in April 1999 - had shown that the 
Convention had had a positive effect on the safety of many nuclear installations, particularly 
those that did not meet the AgencyÂs safety standards. It was to be hoped that the remaining 
necessary measures would be taken before the second review meeting in 2002. 
5. He was convinced that the progress achieved through the implementation of that legal 
instrument would encourage all States, particularly those with nuclear weapons, to accede to 
it as soon as possible. He was also convinced that the experience acquired during the first 
review meeting would be useful for the implementation of the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which it 
was to be hoped would enter into force in the very near future and enjoy widespread support. 
6. In September, the Member States of the European Union, the European Commission 
and the Agency had signed Additional Protocols to their existing safeguards agreements. 
Luxembourg and its European partners would make every effort to ensure that the ratification 
procedure for the Additional Protocols was completed before the NPT Review Conference in 
April 2000. They hoped that as many States as possible would confirm their acceptance of 
the Additional Protocol by that date and welcomed the AgencyÂs decision to develop an 
integrated, effective and efficient verification regime. They were convinced that, as in the 
past, the fruitful co-operation between the IAEA and EURATOM would enable substantial 
savings to be made. 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 4 

7. The Secretariat had provided a swift, judicious response to the problem posed by 
ÂorphanÂ sources and he hoped that the discussion that would ensue on the action plan related 
to the safety of radiation sources and the security of radioactive material would enable the 
Agency to tackle that problem with the necessary speed and enable it to have adequate 
resources. He also hoped that due attention would also be given to the safety of operating 
research reactors and the decommissioning of those which were no longer in operation. 
8. With regard to the reduction and control of nuclear arsenals, he hoped that the parties 
concerned would agree on the adoption of a verification agreement that would enable the 
Agency to ensure that fissile material from nuclear weapons was not reused for military 
purposes. He also hoped that the Agency would be closely associated with the work of the 
Conference on Disarmament so that it could participate in the elaboration and subsequent 
application of the verification system for the future cut-off treaty. 
9. Luxembourg had decided to start paying, as of the 1998 financial year, its share of the 
target for the TCF, thereby demonstrating its awareness of the importance of the AgencyÂs 
technical assistance to developing countries, its recognition of the high quality of that 
assistance, and its approval of the areas in which that assistance was focused. Efforts should 
continue to increase still further the number of donors and to promote universal participation 
in the TCF. 
10. Mr. BULBULA (Ethiopia), after welcoming Angola and Honduras, said that 
Africa would play a major role, both as a partner and a recipient, in the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy during the first quarter of the next century. Ethiopia recognized the 
importance of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation and fully endorsed the priorities outlined 
by the Director General. 
11. As an LDC, EthiopiaÂs main priority was to meet the minimum requirements of its 
people. It was embarking on a number of significant activities based on the Country 
Programme Framework which had been recently concluded with the Agency and which had 
made it possible to identify areas of co-operation such as the use of isotope hydrology to 
improve water resources management and the use of the sterile insect technique to control the 
tsetse fly and thereby to improve animal production. Noting in that context the efforts 
undertaken in the area of regional integration, he said that several African countries had 
shown interest in that technique in order to tackle the problem of the tsetse fly and 
trypanosomiasis in Africa. 
12. Ethiopia was regrouping small, isolated projects in larger, more effective programmes 
in areas such as mutation breeding for certain indigenous crops, human nutrition and health. 
The national authority responsible for radiation protection, which had been strengthened, was 
the AgencyÂs counterpart at all stages of co-operation projects and EthiopiaÂs support for the 
Pelindaba Treaty and TCDC was channelled through that authority. Ethiopia was also 
participating increasingly actively in AFRA projects. 
13. In conclusion, he thanked the Agency for its technical co-operation and also the donors 
that provided assistance to Ethiopia under footnote-a/ projects. 

GC(43)/OR.8

14. Mr. ROSA LÃ (Portugal), having extended a welcome to Angola and Honduras, 
associated himself with the statement made by Finland on behalf of the European Union. 
15. Portugal welcomed the action taken by Mr. ElBaradei, particularly with respect to 
programme reform and administrative management, and supported the changes aimed at 
obtaining financial resources to implement key programmes despite budgetary restrictions. 
16. Guaranteeing safety was one of the greatest challenges posed by the use of nuclear 
energy, and it was important to note the major international conventions that had been 
adopted in that area. The recent review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear Safety was 
one example of the efforts being made to improve the level of nuclear safety. Agency 
assistance in the application of advanced technologies would certainly help enhance the safety 
of nuclear energy and radioactive waste management. 
17. The Agency should attach importance to research reactors, illicit trafficking in nuclear 
and radioactive materials, the transport of nuclear materials and radiation protection. In that 
regard, he recalled that at the beginning of September Portugal had hosted a very successful 
international symposium on research reactor utilization, safety and management. 
18. With regard to safeguards, he believed that the establishment of the integrated system 
should have top priority and called on all Member States to participate in that system. He was 
pleased that 41 Member States had signed an Additional Protocol and that the Agency was 
already carrying out activities in application of that instrument. 
19. He also took note of the verification and control activities with respect to material 
originating from military programmes. Although those activities were not progressing as fast 
as one might have hoped, they were a big step towards the complete banning of nuclear 
explosives. 
20. It was regrettable that certain countries like the DPRK were still not co-operating with 
the Agency. A case in point was Iraq, which was preventing the Agency from performing the 
necessary inspections and thereby from fulfilling its Security Council mandate. 
21. Portugal, which had benefited from the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme for 
a number of years, felt that the programmeÂs activities in such fields as health, food and 
agriculture were not sufficiently well known to the public and that efforts to publicize them 
were needed. The AgencyÂs contribution to seawater desalination projects should also be 
underlined, as the supply of potable water would be one of the main problems in the future. 
Manpower training in that area should be encouraged and Portugal was prepared to contribute 
to such activities, particularly to those organized for Portuguese-speaking countries. 
22. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) welcomed Honduras and Angola to the Agency and 
recalled the important role played by the work of the General Conference for all States, 
particularly the developing countries, which were endeavouring to obtain greater Agency 
support. Yemen supported all the AgencyÂs activities aimed at strengthening the safeguards 
system while ensuring that it was equitable and applied equally to all countries, and its 
activities to promote international co-operation in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 6 

nuclear safety, radiation safety, the safety of transport and of radioactive waste management. 
It also supported all the steps taken by the Agency to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear 
materials and other radioactive sources. 

23. Wherever it occurred, the nuclear arms race only exacerbated tension and instability; 
thus, Yemen strongly recommended that every effort be made to achieve global development 
through denuclearization under the NPT and application of the international safeguards 
system to the nuclear facilities of all countries without exception, with a view to achieving 
regional and global peace and security. 
24. Yemen welcomed the new regional and global trends and initiatives for peace and the 
solution of conflicts by peaceful means, and it endorsed the negotiations for a just peace 
based on international, regional and local legitimacy. In view of the progress made, Yemen 
stressed that the legitimate right of the Palestinian people to establish an independent State on 
their territory, with Jerusalem as the capital, should be taken into consideration, and voiced 
YemenÂs solidarity with the people of Iraq, who had suffered long enough. 
25. On the strength of its recent achievements in safeguards in many regions of the world, 
the Agency should take whatever steps were necessary to induce Israel to sign the NPT, 
thereby improving the chances of peace in the region and promoting confidence in a secure 
future for the Middle East and the rest of the world. 
26. Welcoming the recent presidential election in Yemen, a democratic experience that the 
people of Yemen were happy to have undertaken and which the Yemeni Government was 
using as a basis for carrying out economic, financial and administrative reforms, he 
announced that a National Atomic Energy Commission was being established in Yemen and 
would be the chief State body dealing with all issues related to nuclear and radiation safety 
and the peaceful applications of nuclear energy for economic and social development. That 
body would help strengthen YemenÂs international and regional relations, particularly its 
relations with the Agency. 
27. In the light of that improvement in its nuclear and radiation safety infrastructure, Yemen 
hoped that friendly States and the Agency would intensify their co-operation and support to 
help implement its various national development projects, especially in the fields of health, 
agriculture, the environment and hydrology. 
28. Mr. MORALES SAN MARTÃN (Ecuador), having welcomed Honduras and 
Angola to the Agency, said that of the many Agency success stories since its establishment, 
its main achievement - given that peace was mankindÂs most precious asset - had been to 
prevent to a great extent the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the application of its 
safeguards programme and to facilitate the signature by States of the relevant treaties. It had 
also brought universal support for the development and application of nuclear technology in 
many fields, including health, agriculture, environmental protection, industry and power 
generation. 
29. With the help of the Agency and its experts, technical co-operation project counterpart 
staff had been able to familiarize themselves with specific techniques and to update their 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 7 

knowledge through courses and workshops. Participation by national scientists in 
conferences, symposia and seminars had also made a contribution in that regard. Without that 
assistance, which had also included the provision of equipment and information, the least 
developed countries would not have been able to improve the health, nutrition and well-being 
of their peoples. 

30. In Latin America, the AgencyÂs main achievement had been to unite the efforts of the 
countries of the region under the ARCAL programme to implement projects which promoted 
harmonious regional and national development. The introduction of the Partnership in 
Development concept several years previously had boosted the spirit of co-operation between 
the countries of the region. Those countries should continue strengthening that spirit by 
providing joint solutions to their common problems. Ecuador thanked the Agency for the 
support it had given to the ARCAL programme. 
31. One problem facing many countries, especially the least developed countries, was the 
shortage of potable water resources. Ecuador was therefore pleased with the AgencyÂs efforts 
to find ways of producing potable water economically and to implement isotope hydrology 
projects in order to improve the management of existing water resources. On a more general 
note, it was clear to everyone that the Agency and its Member States had a decisive role to 
play in resolving food problems and in remedying damage caused to the environment. 
32. Finally, he noted that Ecuador had decided to sign an Additional Protocol to the 
safeguards agreement it had concluded within the framework of the Tlatelolco Treaty and the 
NPT in order to demonstrate its unconditional commitment to the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy in the world, an objective which was one of the main pillars of the Agency. 
33. Ms. ROMERO DE GONZÃLEZ (Paraguay), after welcoming the admission of 
Honduras and Angola to the Agency and reaffirming her GovernmentÂs firm commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation, said that her country was currently completing the necessary 
formalities to ratify the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and the Convention on Assistance in 
the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. 
34. Paraguay supported the AgencyÂs efforts to encourage certain countries to accede to the 
NPT, and urged those countries to place their nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency 
safeguards in order to establish the balance required for peace in that region, and to eliminate 
the nuclear threat existing there. 
35. The participation of the National Atomic Energy Commission in the regional project on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure (RLA/9/030) in co-operation with the Ministry 
of Public Health and Social Welfare had been one of its most important activities. She was 
grateful for the AgencyÂs sustained support of her countryÂs efforts to harmonize radiation 
protection regulations; those efforts had led to the signing of an agreement between the two 
regulatory bodies in the country. As part of its regulatory activities, the Commission had 
expanded the national register of occupationally exposed workers and implemented an 
inspection programme for users of radioactive sources, accelerators with power greater than 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 8 

200 keV, and industrial X-ray sources. In addition, the Commission and the Ministry of 
Public Health and Social Welfare were working actively to provide training of regulatory 
personnel through courses, scientific visits and expert missions within the framework of 
project RLA/9/030. 

36. Over the previous year, Paraguay had continued to participate actively in the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme and the ARCAL programme, and had hosted major courses 
and workshops providing training to many scientists and fellowship students. During the 
15 years of its existence, the ARCAL programme had enabled thousands of specialists in the 
region to receive training in a number of areas and had facilitated the transfer of technology. 
Paraguay had been one of the first countries to sign the intergovernmental agreement which 
would lead to the strengthening of the ARCAL programme. It was grateful to the Agency, 
which was the main contributor to the programme, as well as to the other donors, in 
particular, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden 
and the United States. 
37. A special brachytherapy unit had been provided within the framework of technical 
co-operation project PAR/6/008 entitled ÂImprovement of BrachytherapyÂ and extensive use 
would be made of the equipment for the treatment of cervical cancer, which was a very 
common disease in the country. 
38. Having outlined the specific results obtained under project PAR/5/008 on the 
improvement of reproductive efficiency in cattle, she said that, as it did every year, the 
National Atomic Energy Commission had organized an open day to inform people about the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, during which a group of women in the nuclear field called 
ÂWINÂ had been set up; since then, that group had carried out a number of information 
activities relating to nuclear issues. 
39. In conclusion, she thanked the Agency for its valuable co-operation in the 
implementation of national and regional projects that were of great social and economic 
benefit. 
40. Mr. SERVIÃN (Uruguay), having welcomed Honduras and Angola, commended 
the efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to increase the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the AgencyÂs work to achieve its basic objectives, namely the promotion and 
control of nuclear energy, despite a budget that remained practically unchanged. The 
improvement of the processes for the design, selection, implementation and follow-up of 
technical co-operation projects, as well as the increase in the volume of activities, and the 
participation of countries from Latin America and the Caribbean in the ARCAL programme 
would be beneficial to all Member States. 
41. The balance between promotional and verification activities, and between the power 
and non-power applications of nuclear technology was essential in order to ensure the 
AgencyÂs universality and its influence on the world stage so that it could rise to the 
challenges ahead and promote the further use and synthesis of technical progress in nuclear 
and non-nuclear fields. It also had to deal with the risks associated with the existence of large 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 9 

quantities of uranium and plutonium from dismantled weapons, the proliferation potential of 
neptunium and americium, the increase in illicit trafficking in nuclear material, and the 
verification activities provided for by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Although 
Uruguay recognized the importance of those problems, it considered that the AgencyÂs 
universality and efficiency would be reduced significantly if it became primarily an 
organization for verification and control. 

42. Finally, he noted that Uruguay was continuing its efforts to use nuclear technology in 
the production sector and was planning to restructure its radiation protection activities with 
the support of the Agency. 
43. Mr. TABIBIAN (Armenia), after welcoming the admission of Honduras and 
Angola to the Agency, noted that, according to some estimates, more than 20 countries 
possessed nuclear weapons or were about to acquire them. In a few years, the international 
community had taken decisive steps to avert a predictable disaster, and a large number of 
countries had acceded to the NPT and other treaties aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear 
weapons and nuclear testing. Armenia remained fully committed to the principles of 
non-proliferation, and supported the AgencyÂs activities to improve the effectiveness of the 
safeguards system. With the conclusion of new Additional Protocols, the prospects for the 
elimination of the threat of nuclear weapons and their proliferation were good. 
44. His Government attached great importance to the legal aspect of the nuclear issue, and 
on 1 March 1999, the Armenian President had signed the main national nuclear law on the 
safe utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Armenia was party to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, the first legal instrument to address directly the issue of the 
safety of nuclear power plants worldwide. Armenia had also acceded to the AgencyÂs 
Conventions on the Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and on Assistance in the Case 
of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. That legal framework had contributed to 
the relative success of Aragats 99, an exercise on emergency preparedness and response, 
which had been held in Armenia under the auspices of the Agency with the participation of 
foreign observers. Despite certain shortcomings, the main purpose of the exercise, which was 
to validate the revised Armenia procedures for preparedness and management of nuclear and 
radiological emergencies, had been achieved. 
45. The Armenian Government attached great importance to technical co-operation and 
highly commended the Secretariat, in particular the Europe Section, for its continuous 
support. As part of the biennial cycle of technical co-operation with the Agency, the 
Armenian regulatory body had carried out co-ordination activities for 8 national and 
18 regional projects in which Armenia was participating. Armenia was grateful to the main 
donors - the United States and the United Kingdom - for their support, which had made the 
successful implementation of the Armenian projects possible. 
46. At the bilateral level, Armenia was continuing to co-operate closely with Argentina, 
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, the Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine, the 
United Kingdom, the United States of America and other countries. Very recently, on 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 10 

23 September, the Armenian Government had concluded an agreement with the European 
Union on assistance for the development of the energy sector, including nuclear energy. 

47. His Government was very committed to nuclear safety and was determined to apply the 
highest safety standards at Unit II of the Medzamor nuclear power plant. It was grateful to 
the Agency for the considerable assistance provided both before and after the plantÂs 
reopening in the areas of seismic safety evaluation, emergency planning and seismic and 
radiation monitoring systems, and for organizing training courses and scientific visits. 
48. Turning to financial matters, he said that Armenia had fulfilled its commitments. In 
spite of serious financial constraints, his Government had approved the transfer of the sum of 
US $86 719 to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget - the amount required for the restoration of the 
countryÂs voting rights. 
49. Many countries in the world were using nuclear techniques for a variety of peaceful 
purposes - more than 40 countries had nuclear reactors, and numerous major facilities 
containing nuclear material safeguarded by the Agency were operating in some 68 developed 
and developing countries. Efforts should be redoubled to strengthen international 
co-operation in the areas of radiation protection and waste management, as well as to combat 
illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radioactive sources, and to guarantee the safe 
storage and disposal of such materials. The Agency could not work alone in those areas, and 
the international community as a whole should join in its efforts. 
50. Mr. SUAREZ (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty Organization) said that the previous week, on 24 September 1999, the Preparatory 
Commission had celebrated the third anniversary of the opening of the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty for signature at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. 
During those three years, 154 States had signed the Treaty and 47, including 23 of the 
44 States whose ratification was required for the TreatyÂs entry into force, had deposited their 
instruments of ratification with the United Nations Secretary-General. On the same day, the 
majority of States that had ratified the Treaty had sent a letter to the Secretary-General, as 
depositary of the Treaty, requesting, pursuant to Article XIV.2 of the Treaty, the convening of 
a Conference of the States that had already deposited their instruments of ratification to 
examine the extent to which the requirement for entry into force had been met and to decide 
by consensus what measures consistent with international law could be undertaken to 
accelerate the ratification process to facilitate the early entry into force of the Treaty. That 
Conference, which was expected to take place at ministerial level, would be held in the 
Hofburg from 6 to 8 October 1999. 
51. The Treaty provided for the establishment of a global regime to verify compliance with 
the comprehensive ban on nuclear explosions. When fully operational, that regime would be 
able to detect and locate any nuclear explosion, even of very small yield, whether 
underground, underwater or in the air. Although it was not yet complete, and therefore only 
partially operational, it had repeatedly demonstrated that it was capable of detecting and 
locating various events around the world. 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 11 

52. The regime comprised of three main elements: the International Monitoring 
System (IMS), consisting of 321 seismological, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide 
stations, supported by 16 radionuclide analysis laboratories; the International Data 
Centre (IDC), at the Vienna International Centre, where data from the IMS stations were 
collected, processed, analysed and made available to Member States; and the on-site 
inspections, which were a final verification measure that would only be carried out in 
accordance with the stringent requirements set out in the Treaty. Much progress had been 
achieved in that area during the past year. 
53. With regard to the IMS, approximately 55% of the site surveys needed for the SystemÂs 
321 stations had been completed, about 45% of the station installation work was under way or 
had been completed and data signature devices for authentication of information were being 
installed. A fourth introductory training programme had been held at Dubna (Russian 
Federation) in June 1998 for monitoring station personnel in Eastern Europe, North America 
and Western Europe and a second technical training programme was under way. 
54. The IDC had installed the second of four test releases of the application software and 
the Preparatory Commission was in a position to provide initial services and to distribute IMS 
data and IDC products to Member States. Reviewed event bulletins and atmospheric 
radioactivity reports were being produced regularly and the third and fourth training courses 
to improve understanding of how the IDC functioned and to identify a pool of possible 
candidates for analyst posts in the IDC had taken place. The backbone of the global 
telecommunication infrastructure, which made the swift and secure transmission of IMS data 
to the IDC and Member States possible, had been tested and accepted and was now in use. 
Furthermore, the IDC was connected to nine destinations by terrestrial lines and to 12 remote 
sites by geostationary satellites. Site surveys for the installation of further communication 
nodes were progressing. 
55. Preparatory activities for the on-site inspection aspect of the regime - in readiness for 
the TreatyÂs entry into force - had continued to focus on the drafting of an operational 
manual; establishing the specifications for the equipment for testing and training purposes and 
obtaining that equipment; and organizing training programmes and practical exercises to 
develop a corps of inspectors. During the past year, two introductory on-site inspection 
courses - attended by 72 trainees from 37 signatory States - had taken place. In December, 
the first simulation of various phases of the on-site inspection process would take place. In 
2000, two on-site inspection courses would be organized for potential inspectors. 
56. The Preparatory Commission had set up a legal framework to protect its interests while 
at the same time allowing for the verification activities to proceed swiftly. Four facility 
agreements, setting the basis for the CommissionÂs activities in the States hosting or taking 
responsibility for monitoring stations, had been concluded and interim exchanges of letters 
governing verification activities pending the conclusion of facility agreements had been 
conducted with more than 50 States. 
57. The Commission had made every effort to emphasize the advantages of participating in 
the Treaty by identifying possible spin-offs from the TreatyÂs verification regime and the 

GC(43)/OR.8 
page 12 

resulting data. Workshops on international co-operation had stressed the TreatyÂs 
fundamental importance in strengthening global peace and security and possible applications 
of the technologies used within the framework of verification, as well as other peaceful 
applications of the IMS data. A database of meetings of possible relevance for R&D had 
been developed. 

58. Those achievements had been made possible through the strong support of Member 
States for the Preparatory CommissionÂs activities. States had worked hard to lay the 
foundations for an effective and efficient verification system, supported by a small and 
flexible Secretariat. The Preparatory Commission was grateful for that support and was 
committed to carrying out the programme of activities entrusted to it. 
59. The Secretariat had continued the development of the experts communication system, 
which enabled national experts to contribute to the CommissionÂs work. The Commission 
intended to develop that system still further to help Member States participate better in its 
work. 
60. The support of Member States was demonstrated by the high level of payment of 
assessed contributions. As of 23 September 1999, 71.8% of the contributions for 1999 had 
been paid - an increase of 55.4% over 1998. The administrative costs were low, since they 
represented only 20% of the verification-related budget. Staff continued to grow as the 
SecretariatÂs responsibilities increased and on 30 September 1999 there was a total of 
206 staff members from 65 signatory States. 
61. Finally, he noted that the Commission was grateful for the advice and co-operation 
provided by the other organizations at the Vienna International Centre and elsewhere, as well 
as for the continuing support and understanding of the host country, all of which had helped 
to make such rapid progress possible. 
REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

62. The PRESIDENT said that during the meeting that it had held in the morning to 
examine delegatesÂ credentials, the General Committee had considered, in the light of the 
criteria and guidelines for the consideration of requests for the restoration of voting rights 
approved by the General Conference at its previous session, two requests submitted by 
Afghanistan and Senegal. In the case of Afghanistan, the Committee recommended that its 
voting rights should not be restored since the request, which had been received only during 
the current session, did not comply fully with the criteria and guidelines. In the case of 
Senegal, the Committee also recommended that its voting rights should not be restored. He 
took it that the General Conference wished to accept those recommendations. 
63. It was so decided. 
The meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.

RADIATION ACCIDENT AT THE FUEL CONVERSION PLANT IN TOKAIMURA, 
JAPAN 

1. The DIRECTOR GENERAL drew attention to an IAEA press release on the 
radiation accident at the fuel conversion plant in Tokaimura and said that the chain reaction 
had now been stopped. Naturally, the Agency was ready to provide assistance to the Japanese 
Government in its efforts to respond to the accident. He had offered the Japanese 
Government the services of an expert team to be dispatched immediately, but the Government 
had indicated that that was not required at present. 
2. The AgencyÂs Emergency Response Centre had been working throughout the night 
assessing the available information. Reports had been sent to the AgencyÂs contact points in 
Member States and to Permanent Missions in Vienna, and such reporting would continue as 
appropriate. The Centre had also kept the World Health Organization fully informed. If 
requested, and as with similar cases in the past, the Agency would carry out a full assessment 
of the accident as soon as practicable. 
3. Mr. SUGANUMA (Japan) said that his Government was grateful for the concern 
shown by the Director General and all Member States concerning the radiation accident at 
Tokaimura. The Government was taking every possible measure to ensure the populationÂs 
security. Fortunately, the situation had now stabilized and the population within a 
10-kilometre radius were no longer required to stay indoors. However, as a precaution, those 
within a 300-metre radius had not yet been allowed to return to their homes. The radiation 
levels had now dropped to normal. 
4. His Government was extremely grateful for the assistance provided by the Agency and 
for the assistance offered by Member States. Japan would work closely with the Agency and 
provide all the necessary information to ensure safety, prevent the recurrence of any such 
accident and restore confidence in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
5. The PRESIDENT, speaking on behalf of the Conference, expressed sympathy to 
the Government and people of Japan. The Conference noted the contacts already established 
by the Agency with the authorities in Japan and welcomed the AgencyÂs readiness to offer 
expert assistance and support as appropriate. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLEÂS REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF 
SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE 
NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
(GC(43)/23, GC(43)/L.2 and Add. 1-3) 

6. The PRESIDENT noted that the item had been included in the agenda pursuant to 
resolution GC(42)/RES/2. Since the adoption of that resolution, the Director General had 
reported periodically to the Board on the implementation of safeguards in the DPRK. He had 
also submitted document GC(43)/23 to the Conference, summarizing the developments of the 
past year. In addition, a draft resolution submitted by a number of States was contained in 
document GC(43)/L.2, to which three addenda with additional sponsors had been issued. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 6 

7. Mr. MORGAN (Canada), introducing the draft resolution, said the fact that it had 
more than sixty sponsors was an indication of the breadth and depth of concern among 
Member States over the DPRKÂs refusal to co-operate with the Agency under its safeguards 
agreement. The draft resolution reflected the General ConferenceÂs determination that the 
Agency, acting through its Director General, should pursue the implementation of the 
safeguards agreement with the DPRK. The sponsors looked forward to evidence that recent 
developments in the general political environment might offer hope that the DPRK would 
adopt a more constructive attitude towards its safeguards obligations, but in the meantime 
they considered the draft resolution to be an appropriate response to the current situation. 
8. Mr. SUGANUMA (Japan) commended the Agency on its continued impartial 
efforts to implement measures and to monitor the freeze in the DPRK as requested by the 
Security Council. Little progress had been made since the last General Conference, except in 
areas related to implementation of the KEDO project. However, further progress with the 
KEDO project required the DPRKÂs co-operation with the Agency, including the 
implementation of its safeguards agreement. He appealed to all delegations to support the 
draft resolution. 
9. Mr. Ki-Moon BAN (Republic of Korea) said that despite the strenuous efforts 
made by the Agency over the past seven years, no new developments had been achieved on 
most of the fundamental issues, owing to the DPRKÂs lack of co-operation. Its persistent 
failure to comply with its safeguards agreement constituted a serious challenge not only to the 
AgencyÂs overall safeguards system, but also to the basic framework of the NPT. The 
Secretariat should take advantage of the favourable atmosphere created by the DPRKÂs recent 
announcement that it would suspend the test-firing of new, long-range missiles to make a 
breakthrough with respect to implementation of the DPRKÂs safeguards agreement, and the 
international community, for its part, should demonstrate its firm opposition to any attempts 
by the DPRK to undermine the basic international nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
10. The draft resolution before the Conference conveyed a simple and clear message: that 
the DPRK must comply with its safeguards agreement and he called on the Conference to 
adopt the draft resolution without a vote. 
11. Mr. RITCH (United States of America) noted that, for five years, the Agreed 
Framework, which required the DPRK to maintain a freeze on its 5-megawatt reactor and 
related facilities and refrain from construction work on other graphite-moderated nuclear 
reactors and related facilities, had been a crucial mechanism for containing the DPRKÂs 
nuclear programme and the threat it posed to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. 
Agency inspectors had maintained a continuing presence in the DPRK to monitor the freeze 
and a joint United States/DPRK team had nearly completed the canning and safe storage, 
under Agency seals, of the DPRKÂs 8000 spent nuclear fuel rods. Conclusion of that 
operation would be a significant accomplishment for both sides. Preparatory work continued 
on the two light-water reactors to be built by KEDO in the DPRK. Under KEDOÂs 
cost-sharing agreement, the Republic of Korea and Japan had reaffirmed their commitment to 
play central and significant roles in funding the project. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 7 

12. During the past year, an extensive review of United States policy towards the DPRK 
had been conducted and there were hopes of an improvement in the relations between the two 
countries. The United States would remain committed to the Agreed Framework and 
expected no less of the DPRK. If the Agreed Framework was to be fully realized, it was 
essential that the DPRK address Agency concerns on all issues, particularly those regarding 
the preservation of information related to its past nuclear activities. The United States 
accordingly urged the DPRK to take all steps deemed necessary by the Agency to monitor the 
freeze and ultimately to verify its initial declarations to the Agency. The DPRKÂs 
co-operation with the Agency was central to the successful implementation of the Agreed 
Framework and a prerequisite for completion of the light-water-reactor project. The DPRK 
should show renewed flexibility and resolve access and monitoring issues in the forthcoming 
technical discussions with the Agency, and the Director General should continue to report to 
the Board of Governors on freeze-monitoring activities and the implementation of full-scope 
safeguards in the DPRK. 
13. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia) said that the AgencyÂs responsibilities in relation to the 
DPRK were twofold: those which derived from the safeguards agreement concluded with it, 
which was still in force, and those which derived from the role assigned to the Agency under 
the Agreed Framework between the DPRK and the United States. Australia had welcomed 
the Agreed Framework and had given practical and financial support to KEDO. 
14. However, Australia deplored the DPRKÂs repeated threats to break out of the Agreed 
Framework and its continued failure to meet its safeguards responsibilities. The Agency was 
still being denied the access that would allow important measurements of plutonium in spent 
fuel rods in its installations to be taken. The apparently positive outcome of the DPRKÂs 
recent meeting with the United States might signal a wish for better relations with the outside 
world, and Australia would welcome such a development. As he saw it, the DPRK could 
either respond positively to the generous offers now being made by the international 
community, or reject them and run the risk of catastrophic consequences. 
15. Ms. MOSLEY (New Zealand) regretted the DPRKÂs continued failure to comply 
with its safeguards agreement, which remained binding and in force. New Zealand supported 
the Agreed Framework and made substantial contributions to KEDO. Since the success of the 
KEDO project depended on the full application of Agency safeguards, the DPRK should fulfil 
its obligations under its safeguards agreement. 
16. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(43)/L.2 without a vote. 
17. It was so decided. 
18. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that while he had not wished to block 
a consensus, he would like to remind the Conference of the positive steps already taken by the 
DPRK. The repeated adoption of resolutions condemning the DPRK would only further 
complicate the issue, and he hoped that a positive dialogue could soon be established between 
the DPRK and the Director General, since that was the only way a solution could be found. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 8 

19. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China) said that the fact that China had not blocked the 
adoption of the resolution did not mean that it fully endorsed it. China continued to believe 
that consultation and dialogue on the basis of equality was the only way that the problem 
could be solved. 
ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

20. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, 
presenting the CommitteeÂs report on agenda items 9-11, 13-21, 26 and 27, said that the 
CommitteeÂs discussions had been very fruitful and constructive and that all the draft 
resolutions that the Committee was submitting to the Plenary had been adopted in the 
Committee by consensus. 
21. He thanked the Conference for the confidence it had placed in him and expressed his 
gratitude to the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee, Mr. Stratford of the United States and 
Mr. Tomaszewski of Poland, for so ably presiding over the CommitteeÂs proceedings in his 
absence. He thanked all participants for the spirit of co-operation they had shown. 
22. Concluding on a personal note, he said that although MoroccoÂs two-year mandate as a 
member of the Board of Governors was coming to an end, he looked forward to participating 
in the BoardÂs work as an Observer. He had greatly enjoyed his term of office and his work 
as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, which had culminated in the resolution of the 
long-standing problem of the amendment of Article VI. 
23. The PRESIDENT, having thanked the Chairman and the Vice-Chairmen of the 
Committee for their able guidance of the CommitteeÂs discussions, invited the Conference to 
take up one by one the items which the Committee of the Whole had considered. 
The AgencyÂs accounts for 1998 (agenda item 9) 

24. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page I of 
document GC(43)/5 was adopted. 
The AgencyÂs budget for 2000 (agenda item 10) 

25. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A, B and C in 
Annex I to document GC(43)/6 were adopted. 
Amendment to Article XIV of the Statute (agenda item 11) 

26. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
Annex 4 to document GC(43)/24 was adopted. 
Scale of assessment of MembersÂ contributions towards the Regular Budget (agenda 
item 13) 


GC(43)/OR.9 
page 9 

27. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page 3 of 
document GC(43)/15 was adopted. 
Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety 

(agenda item 14) 

28. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the four resolutions contained in 
documents GC(43)/L.3, L.4, L.5 and L.7 were adopted. 
Measures to address the year 2000 (Y2K) issue (agenda item 15) 

29. The PRESIDENT said he took it that, as recommended by the Committee of the 
Whole, the Conference wished to take note of the information contained in documents 
GC(43)/7 and GC(43)/INF/4. 
30. It was so decided. 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities (agenda item 16) 

31. The PRESIDENT asked whether, as recommended by the Committee of the 
Whole, the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(43)/L.15. 
32. Ms. FREUDENSCHUSS-REICHL (Austria), explaining her countryÂs position on 
the draft resolution contained in document GC(43)/L.15, said that Austria did not associate 
itself with the group of countries referred to in preambular paragraph (f) that considered 
nuclear power as a climatically benign source of energy and an eligible option under the 
Clean Development Mechanism. In AustriaÂs view the risks associated with nuclear energy 
were unacceptably high and any assessment of climatic impact had to take into account the 
whole nuclear fuel cycle, including decommissioning and waste disposal - problems for 
which so far there was no solution. As for operative paragraph 6, Austria did not consider 
nuclear power as a viable option for achieving sustainable development in developing 
countries and in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions through the Clean Development 
Mechanism, although it had no objection to the Director General assisting interested Member 
States in obtaining access to information on such matters. With regard to preambular 
paragraph (f) and operative paragraph 6, she stressed that the question of eligibility of 
projects under the Clean Development Mechanism could only be addressed through the 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol process. 
33. Mr. WÃHLK (Denmark), endorsing the views expressed by the representative of 
Austria, added that the reference to the Kyoto Protocol in connection with the Agency was 
inappropriate. 
34. Mr. TWIST (Ireland) and Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) associated themselves 
with the remarks by the representatives of Austria and Denmark. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 10 

35. Mr. HÃGBERG (Sweden), supported by Ms. HERNES (Norway), said he 
recognized the wish of some Member States to use nuclear power as part of their national 
energy supply provided that they fully complied with their obligations under the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention. However, while he would not jeopardize the 
consensus on the draft resolution, he shared the view that the reference to the Kyoto Protocol 
was irrelevant. 
36. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(43)/L.15 was adopted. 
Plan for producing potable water economically (agenda item 17) 

37. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(43)/L.9/Rev.1 was adopted. 
Extensive use of isotope hydrology for water resources management (agenda item 18) 

38. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(43)/L.8 was adopted. 
Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system 
and application of the Model Protocol (agenda item 19) 

39. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(43)/L.13 was adopted. 
Measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources 

(agenda item 20) 

40. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(43)/L.14 was adopted. 
Amendment to Article VI of the Statute (agenda item 21) 

41. The PRESIDENT asked whether, as recommended by the Committee of the 
Whole, the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(43)/L.12, noting that following its adoption, he intended to make a Presidential Statement 
on the implementation of Article VI.A.2(c). 
42. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) expressed his appreciation of the efforts 
made and spirit of compromise shown by all those who had helped to forge agreement on the 
expansion of the Board by eight members, notably the European Union, which had 
reconsidered its original position of an increase of only six. For its part, his delegation had 
been instrumental in promoting acceptance of the proposal through its efforts in the MESA 
Group and the Group of 77. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 11 

43. However, his country maintained its strong objection to the proposed new paragraph K 
and did not wish to join or associate itself with the consensus on that paragraph. Moreover, 
he would have liked two issues to be clarified before the draft resolution was adopted. 
44. Firstly, while Article V.C of the Statute stipulated that a majority of members 
constituted a quorum, the proposed paragraph K made no mention of a quorum, but merely 
referred to Â90% of those present and votingÂ. In order to prevent any difficulties of 
interpretation in the future, a clear reference to a quorum should have been included in the 
paragraph. 
45. Secondly, his understanding of paragraph K was that, if the allocation of Member States 
to an area group was not approved in accordance with the provisions of paragraph K, the 
whole process of the BoardÂs expansion would be blocked. Paragraph K made it necessary 
for the requirements of Article XVIII.C to be met at the same time as the General Conference 
confirmed the allocation of Member States to areas. That problem could have been overcome 
by the insertion of the word ÂthenÂ so that the provisions of Article VI.A would enter into 
force Âwhen the requirements of Article XVIII.C are met and then the General Conference 
confirms a list ...Â. 
46. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) regretted that the Conference had been 
asked to agree to an amendment intended to further the democratic process in the Board of 
Governors without a democratic discussion having taken place, since negotiations had been 
conducted outside the Plenary without the participation of all countries. The resulting text 
had been submitted to the Committee of the Whole the previous day, but again there had been 
no opportunity to discuss it properly. 
47. Syria had always maintained that the expansion of the Board had no connection with the 
question of area groups. It was clear that the provisions of Article VI.A could not enter into 
force until the requirements of Article XVIII.C of the Statute had been met, but their entry 
into force should not be dependent upon the composition of area groups. He therefore 
proposed a slight amendment to paragraph K whereby the first sentence would be divided up 
and end after the words Ârequirements of Article XVIII.C are metÂ, and the second sentence 
would begin with the words ÂThe General Conference confirms a list ÂÂ. Syria did not wish 
to join a consensus on the existing text of paragraph K. 
48. Mr. AL-HADITHI (Iraq) said that while Iraq was in favour of expanding the 
Board, it rejected the idea of any linkage between expansion and the composition of area 
groups. Moreover, the composition of area groups should be subject to the agreement of all 
members of the group. If Israel were included in the MESA Group, there would be 
difficulties because of the strong objections to IsraelÂs arsenal of nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction, its continuous refusal to submit its facilities to safeguards and 
its refusal to accede to the NPT, all of which constituted a serious threat to the members of the 
MESA Group and to other Arab countries. Iraq also noted that there was a legal contradiction 
between paragraph K, which indicated that the list of area groups could be adopted by 90% of 
those present and voting, and the provisions of Article V.C of the Statute. Iraq therefore 
wished to be added to the list of those countries which objected to the amendment. 

GC(43)/OR.9 
page 12 

49. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), speaking on behalf of the African 
Group, welcomed the draft resolution, which it believed would have a very positive effect on 
the future work of the Board enabling area groups, particularly Africa, to play a more active 
part. 
50. The PRESIDENT said that he took it that the Conference wished to adopt the 
draft resolution to amend Article VI of the Statute as recommended by the Committee of the 
Whole and contained in document GC(43)/L.12. 
51. It was so decided. 
52. The PRESIDENT said that in the course of exhaustive consultations, it had been 
agreed that he would read out the following Presidential Statement: 
ÂThis seat, as mentioned in paragraph VI.A.2(c) (in the draft resolution proposed by the 
President of the General Conference concerning the amendment to Article VI of the 
Statute), shall be filled in conformity with the requirements of the Statute on a rotational 
and alternate basis and equally shared by these two areas. This rotation shall begin first 
with Latin America.Â 

53. The Conference endorsed the Presidential Statement. 
54. Mr. PALACIOS CEVALLOS (Ecuador), speaking on behalf of GRULAC, noted 
that considerable efforts had been made within the Group to accommodate the different points 
of view into a single regional approach and to ensure compatibility with other regional groups 
with a view to finding a solution that reflected the legitimate interests of the region. The 
Conference had nevertheless arrived at a consensus that did not meet all of GRULACÂs 
expectations, particularly in respect of the regional distribution of the additional seats. The 
Group therefore hoped that the political decision just taken would be duly appreciated by all. 
55. Mr. PUCCIO HUIDOBRO (Chile) said that, although Chile had joined the 
consensus to amend Article VI, it regretted and deplored the lack of transparency in the form 
and procedures followed in the submission of a proposal which, having been rejected by 
GRULAC in the Board, had nevertheless been taken up by the President of the Conference. 
Friction and conflict between friendly areas with a common interest had been caused as a 
result and, despite the flexibility demonstrated by GRULAC at all stages of the negotiations 
to reach a consensus reflecting a just solution and equitable regional representation, the Group 
had been forced to accept a solution to the detriment of a region that took pride in making an 
important contribution to nuclear disarmament and security. Unfortunately, the necessary 
willingness to reach a just solution had been lacking. Therefore, while Chile welcomed the 
fact that the Agency had succeeded in overcoming a long-standing impasse, it remained 
profoundly concerned at the way the matter had been dealt with and the role played by the 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole. Had he been less eager to be in the limelight, it 
might have been difficult to find a solution, but there would have been a true consensus. 
56. His conduct had been repeated the previous day when the resolution had been submitted 
to the Committee of the Whole. The traditional standards of debate which were characteristic

page 13 

of the United Nations and of diplomacy had been flouted and a dangerous precedent had been 
set for democratic discussion and co-existence. 

57. The fact that the Latin American region was the only one in the world to have 
unilaterally declared itself a nuclear-weapon-free zone introduced valuable equilibrium into 
the AgencyÂs difficult work and conferred on the region sufficient moral authority to demand 
representation commensurate with that contribution. For its part, Chile had always 
participated in the day-to-day work of the Agency and in the various committees of experts 
and was ready to extend its participation to other areas. 
58. Mr. TIWARI (India) expressed his appreciation for the spirit of accommodation 
and consensus that had been displayed throughout the previous three years in order to reach a 
solution to Article VI. A striking feature of the debate had been the BoardÂs determination to 
deliberate on the matter and agree on a consensual basis. It was to be hoped that the Board 
and the General Conference would avoid fractious, politically divisive debate on issues that 
were inappropriate to the Agency. The Board was undoubtedly most effective when its 
deliberations and decisions were informed by consensus. It was also to be hoped that the 
Board and General Conference would return to the AgencyÂs main objective of accelerating 
and enlarging the peaceful uses of atomic energy, in particular the use of nuclear power. 
India had noted the reluctance of some of the developed countries to include references to the 
Clean Development Mechanism in the resolution on the strengthening of the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation activities. Unless Member States were proactive in respect of 
promotional activities, safety and safeguards would lose their relevance, which was dependent 
upon the existence of nuclear facilities. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.
