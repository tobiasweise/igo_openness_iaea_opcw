APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST (resumed) 
(GC(41)/16, 34 and 47) 


1. The PRESIDENT asked the General Conference to turn to item 26 of its 
agenda, "Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East", which had been deferred at 
the previous meeting in order to allow time for consultations to be held. 
2. The item had been included in the agenda pursuant to resolution GC(40)/RES/22 
adopted by the General Conference in 1996, and pursuant to operative paragraph 9 of that 
resolution the Director General had submitted the report contained in document GC (41)/16 
on the implementation of the resolution. In addition, the Conference had before it 
document GC(41)/34, containing a draft resolution on the subject, and document 
GC(41)/47, which set out a revised draft resolution on which he understood agreement had 
been reached during the extensive consultations that had been held among the parties 
directly involved since the previous meeting. The revised resolution was identical with 
resolution GC(40)/RES/22 adopted by the Conference at its previous session, except that 
some technical adjustments had been made, such as updating references to documents. 
Accordingly, he took it that the sponsors of the draft resolution in document GC(41)/34 
would not press it and that the Conference would be ready to adopt the revised draft 
resolution without a vote. 
3. Mr. EL FADHEL KHALIL (Tunisia), speaking on behalf of the Arab 
Group, said that although the Group was convinced of the sound foundations of its draft 
resolution as set out in document GC(41)/34, it was also convinced of the need for 
cooperation 
and consensus, especially in the year that marked the fortieth anniversary of 
the Agency and a change in its leadership. The Arab Group had therefore proposed that 
the General Conference retain the text of the resolution it had adopted at its fortieth session 
(GC(40)/RES/22). 
4. Mr. KATRA (Lebanon) said his country had joined the consensus achieved 
by the Arab Group but with a reservation regarding his Government's position on operative 
paragraph 4 of the draft resolution. Lebanon had always shown every readiness to go 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 4 


forward with the Middle East peace process, but as long as there was no progress on the 
bilateral level his Government was not in a position to undertake any step within 
multilateral activities or negotiations. 


5. Mr. BENMOUSSA (Morocco) said the General Conference was about to 
adopt a draft resolution whose text had been repeated verbatim for the fourth year running 
and contained nothing new. It had been submitted for adoption by consensus, but was not 
the result of an honourable consensus, which presupposed a constructive spirit and mutual 
respect between delegations; it was instead the result of a questionable process of which no 
one could be proud. It did not do honour to international diplomacy or to the ethics which 
must characterize multilateral activity. Operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution 
contained statements which lacked all reality in the present context because of the 
intransigence of a single, arrogant, bellicose entity which sowed terror and destruction in 
the Middle East. As a result, the General Conference was incapable of making progress 
towards guaranteeing nonproliferation 
in the region in accordance with the objectives and 
principles laid down in the Agency's Statute. His delegation would not prevent the 
Conference from adopting whatever it wished, but it refused to associate the name of 
Morocco with a disgrace to international legality and multilateral ethics. 
6. Mr. AYATOLLAHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that the original draft 
resolution put forward by the Arab Group had been more progressive and more up to date 
than the present proposal in that it reflected changes in conditions in the Middle East over 
the past 12 months. His country had been the first Member of the Agency to propose the 
establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East. However, it considered 
that the socalled 
peace process referred to in operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution 
under discussion had never taken full account of the rights of the Palestinian people and 
was therefore doomed to failure, as the past year had demonstrated. Moreover, it was his 
country's firm belief that Israel was the cause of that failure and of the resulting insecurity 
in the Middle East region, and that Israel's policy had always kept peace and 
internationallyagreed 
conventions hostage to its goals and ambitions. 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 5 


7. Having made those observations, the Islamic Republic of Iran would not object to 
the Conference adopting the draft resolution in document GC(41)/47 by consensus, 
although it would have preferred to see the Arab Group's original proposal adopted instead. 
8. Mr. HALIM MOHAMED (Sudan) said the original draft resolution had 
differed from the one under discussion in two respects: it had sought to refer to the facts 
which were clear on the ground, and it had sought to indicate the degree of deterioration 
which had taken place since the last session of the General Conference. The Middle East 
peace process had ground to a halt on all fronts, and even the agreements to which Israel 
had become party had not been honoured. In addition, Israel had been trying to create a 
situation that would lead to tension and insecurity, by building settlements in Arab East 
Jerusalem. The intention of the Arab Group during the consultations had been that 
operative paragraph 4 of the draft resolution should refer to reviving the peace negotiations. 
That was a genuine and modest request which was being denied by Israeli intransigence and 
the determination of certain countries not to reflect the situation as it really was. The fact 
that the Agency was celebrating its fortieth anniversary and at the same time bidding 
farewell to one Director General and welcoming his successor had led the cosponsors 
of 
the original draft resolution not to block a consensus, even though it could be viewed as an 
injustice. Sudan, like Morocco, was not proud to have its name associated with the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(41)/47, but would not prevent the Conference from 
taking the decision it considered appropriate. Nevertheless, it was Sudan's hope that 
efforts would be made to revive the Middle East peace negotiations on all its tracks. 
Intransigence, injustice and the building of settlements could not be compatible with 
comprehensive peace and security in the Middle East. 
9. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) agreed that the draft resolution 
unfortunately did not reflect the existing situation in the Middle East. Despite annual 
resolutions calling for a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the region, Israel continued to refuse 
to subject its nuclear facilities to comprehensive IAEA safeguards. Moreover, Israel was 
placing obstacles on the road to peace with its occupation of the Golan Heights and its 
settlements policy. Not mentioning Israel by name in the draft resolution and not exerting 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 6 


sufficient pressure on Israel to abide by the rules and precepts of international legitimacy 
threatened the Middle East region and removed the foundations for peace. His country had 
been calling for the resumption of the Middle East peace process but had encountered only 
Israeli intransigence, and that was why the efforts of the multilateral working group on 
Arms Control and Regional Security to promote mutual confidence and security in the 
Middle East were so important. There would be no security without peace, and 
multilateral negotiations would be fruitless if Israel did not withdraw from all occupied 
Arab land and place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. The Middle East peace 
negotiations clearly needed to be resumed, but they would have to be conducted more 
successfully if peace and security were to be achieved. For the moment, however, the 
Syrian Arab Republic would not object to the draft resolution being adopted by consensus. 


10. Mr. TWAL (Jordan) said his country had always called on all parties and 
States, in the Middle East especially, to join it in signing the NPT and concluding 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency, as well as other such treaties and 
conventions. Jordan had not been included in the list of cosponsors 
of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(41)/34 for purely practical and technical reasons; it nevertheless 
supported that draft resolution politically just 
as it supported any genuine call for peace 
and for freeing the Middle East from weapons of mass destruction, and especially nuclear 
weapons, which would lead to greater confidence among the parties in the region and 
guarantee a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. It was Jordan's hope that the 
General Conference at its fortysecond 
session would be successful in adopting a resolution 
calling on all parties and States in the Middle East to implement Agency safeguards and rid 
the region of all nuclear weapons. Meanwhile Jordan would not object to the adoption of 
the draft resolution by consensus. 
11. Ms. EDDIB (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that the fact that her country was 
prepared to join the consensus on the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/47 did 
not in any way mean that it recognized Israel or that it accepted operative paragraph 4 as an 
accurate description of the existing situation. Israel had a huge nuclear arsenal which it 
was constantly developing, and so the noble objective of establishing a nuclearweaponfree 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 7 


zone in the Middle East on a comprehensive and just basis could be achieved only if the 
international community at large exerted the necessary pressure on Israel to subject its 
nuclear activities to verification by the Agency. On the other hand, if Israel continued to 
renege on its international obligations and to refuse to join the NPT it would remain a 
threat to the region and to peace and security in the world at large. 


12. Mr. EL FADHEL KHALIL (Tunisia), speaking on behalf of the Arab 
Group, said it was with sorrow in their hearts that the Arab countries had once again 
decided to accept a consensus solution in order that the current session of the General 
Conference could end in a spirit of cohesion and understanding. The Arab countries were 
constantly being blamed for delaying the General Conference's deliberations, but their 
proposals were always concrete ones and any delays that arose were due not to any 
stubbornness on their part but to an obstinacy and spirit of noncooperation 
elsewhere. 
The fact that they had not wished to break the consensus was due entirely to the wisdom of 
their respective national Governments, and it was their hope that at the fortysecond 
session 
of the General Conference the other side would act in like manner. 
13. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) noted that his delegation, too, felt that the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(41)/47 did not take account of developments during 
the past 12 months and did not adequately reflect the reality on the ground in the Middle 
East region. 
14. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference was ready to adopt the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/47 without a vote. 
15. It was so decided. 
16. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said his country had joined the consensus on the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(41)/47 despite its inherent deficiencies because it 
recognized that a nuclearweaponfree 
zone would eventually serve as an important 
complement to overall peace, security and arms control in the Middle East region. The 
resolution contained elements which contradicted Israel's policy, and its decision not to 
block consensus should not be interpreted as an indication of agreement with all its 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 8 


provisions. Israel's policy had always been that the nuclear issue, as well as all regional 
security problems both conventional and nonconventional, 
should be dealt with in the full 
context of the peace process. Indeed, such negotiations could only realistically be expected 
to take place freely and directly within the framework of that process. The political 
realities of the Middle East region had demanded a practical stepbystep 
approach, with 
priority being given to dealing with weapons and systems which experience had shown 
were destructive and destabilizing. 


17. Having listened to statements by some of Israel's neighbours, he would like to 
emphasize his country's concern, shared by other Member States, that the General 
Conference should not become an arena for political protests or a venue for political 
discrimination. That was discordant with the responsibilities and activities of the Agency 
as provided for in its Statute. With those regrettable statements in the background, he 
wished to conclude by expressing a hope for a better future of reconciliation, security and 
peace in the Middle East. 
18. The PRESIDENT said he understood that after extensive consultations there 
was agreement that he should read out the following statement for acceptance by the 
Conference: 
"In the context of the agenda item on the application of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle East, the General Conference requests the Director General to invite experts 
from the Middle East and other areas to a technical workshop on safeguards, 
verification technologies, and other related experience, including experience in 
various regional contexts. It calls on the Director General to commence with the 
preparation, in consultation and coordination 
with the parties concerned, with a 
view to developing an agenda and modalities that will help ensure a successful 
workshop. Future proposals on workshops in the framework of the abovementioned 
agenda item shall be submitted by mutual consent." 


19. Mr. ALNOWAISER 
(Saudi Arabia) asked when the Director General 
would be taking the initiative just referred to. 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 9 


20. The PRESIDENT replied that it would be undertaken before the next session 
of the General Conference. He assumed that the Conference was ready to accept the 
statement, with that clarification. 
21. The statement was accepted. 
22. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg), speaking on behalf of the European Union, 
said that the European Union was very happy that the resolution contained in 
document GC(41)/47 had been adopted by consensus, but continued to hope that progress 
could be made towards universality of the NPT. 
CLOSING OF THE SESSION 


23. The PRESIDENT announced that since the Conference's discussion of 
agenda item 29, Georgia had pledged US $10 000 to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund 
for 1998. 
24. Ms. BATACLAN (Philippines), speaking on behalf of the Mr. Padolina, the 
President of the Conference at its previous session, thanked Mr. Niewodriiczanski on behalf 
of all present for bringing the fortyfirst 
regular session of the General Conference to a 
successful conclusion in the year marking the Agency's fortieth anniversary. That success 
was attributable in no small measure to his excellent fusion of scientific knowledge and 
diplomatic skills. She also commended the efforts of the women and men of the Agency's 
Secretariat, under the leadership of Mr. Blix. 
25. The PRESIDENT, expressing gratitude for those kind words, said that it had 
been a great honour and privilege for him and Poland to serve as President at the fortyfirst 
regular session of the General Conference, especially in the historic year in which the 
fortieth anniversary of the Agency was being celebrated. It had been particularly important 
for Poland that he, as head of the Polish delegation, had been able during the Conference to 
sign the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management and the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. In addition, he had, on behalf of his delegation, 
signed the Protocol Additional to Poland's Safeguards Agreement. He thanked all 

GC(41)/OR.10 
page 10 


concerned for the cooperation 
and assistance extended to him in the conduct of business 
and the overcoming of difficulties. 


26. In view of the General Conference's importance for the world nuclear community, 
he expressed the hope that it might be possible to undertake a review of its Rules of 
Procedure, as well as the existing practice in conducting its sessions, in order to ensure that 
the time given to that important event was used in the most efficient manner. Streamlining 
the Conference's practices would undoubtedly benefit both the Secretariat and the Member 
States. 
27. Speaking on behalf of all, he expressed appreciation for the special arrangements 
that had been made on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the entry into force of the 
Agency's Statute on 29 July 1957. 
28. On behalf of the Conference, he thanked the Austrian authorities and the City of 
Vienna for their traditional hospitality. 
29. Thanks were also due to the Director General and all concerned in the Secretariat 
for the valuable support they had provided to ensure the success of the Conference. 
30. Finally, he thanked Mr. Blix once again for his services to the Agency over the past 
16 years and wished him well in his future endeavours. He also took the opportunity to 
wish the Director General Elect, Mr. ElBaradei, all the best. 
31. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the Conference to 
observe a minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and observed silence for one minute. 


32. The PRESIDENT declared the fortyfirst 
session of the General Conference 
closed. 
The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.

OPENING OF THE SESSION 


1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the fortyfirst 
regular session 
of the General Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he 
invited the delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 


3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT, having expressed his gratitude for the 
support and cooperation 
extended to him during the fortieth session of the General 
Conference, said that the current session of the General Conference marked two important 
milestones: the fortieth year of the entry into force of the Agency's Statute and the silver 
anniversary of the RCA, which had become a mature technical cooperation 
network 
providing great benefit to its 17 Member States. 
4. Since the fortieth session of the General Conference, there had been many 
developments where the Agency had been able to demonstrate its ability to further its role 
both in promoting global peace and prosperity through the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy and in implementing nuclear safeguards to ensure a world free from the threat of 
nuclear destruction. 
5. As the international agency entrusted with the implementation of the safeguards 
required under the NPT, the Agency was constantly faced with the challenges of 
strengthening its safeguards system and improving the efficiency of the verification system. 
It had discharged its responsibilities effectively in both areas and the Director General and the 
Secretariat were to be commended for their efforts. 
6. With the approval of the Model Additional Protocol, the Agency now faced the 
challenge of making it an operational reality. It was to be hoped that all Governments would 
conclude their respective protocols with the Agency forthwith to ensure a higher degree of 
confidence that nuclear materials and sensitive equipment would not be diverted to nonpeaceful 
applications. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 4 


7. The Secretariat was to be congratulated for undertaking measures which had enabled 
the Agency to meet the growing number of programme challenges with no real growth in its 
budget. The streamlined, automated process for Agency travel, the socalled 
ATLAS system, 
had, in particular, started to reap dividends. 
8. Considerable progress had been made in the area of technical cooperation. 
In view of 
the increasing scarcity of resources, projects involving the peaceful applications of nuclear 
science and technology would have to compete against other projects using other 
technologies. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of the technical cooperation 
programme 
continued to gain momentum and the technical cooperation 
strategy paper due to be 
presented to the TACC later in the year was expected to contribute substantially in that 
connection. 
9. The Agency had continued to promote global safety initiatives in a number of ways 
and had achieved progress in developing a global safety culture. The opening for signature of 
the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage was welcome, as was the 
opening for signature of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which was intended to cover all types of 
radioactive wastes. It was important that all those achievements, which would contribute 
slowly but surely towards the development of an international safety culture, should be 
communicated to the public in a manner which would ensure that the ensuing benefits were 
properly recognized. 
10. A number of unresolved issues from the fortieth session of the General Conference 
would require further consideration at the present session, including the proposed amendment 
of Article VI of the Statute. He trusted that, with the active participation and cooperation 
of 
all delegations, it would be possible to solve those issues. 
11. In conclusion, he paid tribute to the outgoing Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, for his 
sterling guidance and leadership of the Agency and wished him well in the future. He also 
thanked all members of the Agency, in particular the members of the Board of Governors, for 
the work which they had accomplished since the fortieth session of the General Conference,

including 
the

Furthermore, 
he 
thanked 
all 
participants 
for 
their 
support 
and 
co-operation 
over 
the 
past 
year, 
which 
would 
undoubtedly 
be 
extended 
to 
the

President, 
and 
wished 
everyone 
a 
successful 
conference.

16. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
he 
appreciated 
the 
honour 
bestowed 
upon 
himself 
and 
his 
country 
by 
his 
election 
as 
President 
of 
the 
forty-first 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
thanked 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Eastern 
European 
Group 
that 
had 
unanimously 
agreed 
to 
his 
nomination. 
He 
also 
conveyed 
the 
greetings 
and 
best 
wishes 
of 
Mr. 
Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Poland, 
for 
a 
successful 
conference. 
He 
thanked 
his 
predecessor 
Mr. 
Padolina 
for 
his 
able 
and 
skilful 
guidance 
of 
the 
fortieth 
regular 
session 
in 
1996. 
17. 
The 
forty-first 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
taking 
place 
at 
an 
auspicious 
time 
in 
the 
Agency's 
history. 
Firstly, 
the 
session 
was 
an 
anniversary 
one, 
following 
the 
fortieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
Agency's 
Statute 
on 
29 
July 
1957. 
As

had made important contributions to the development of the world and had never been used 
to resolve any conflict since the Agency's establishment. The hundredth anniversary of the 
discovery of polonium and radium by Marie and Pierre Curie had also taken place during the 
year and had been celebrated in Poland by a series of commemorative events. The 
discoveries by the Curies had opened the door to new techniques that had had a great impact 
on the world and, since its establishment, the Agency had been involved in the application of 
those techniques. 


18. The fortyfirst 
session would be called upon to approve the appointment of a new 
Director General for the Agency. The Government and people of Poland warmly commended 
Mr. Hans Blix for his very distinguished service over the past 16 years as Director General 
and wished him continued success in all his future endeavours. 
19. The Board of Governors and all Member States were also to be commended for their 
achievements in the past year in resolving a number of longstanding 
issues, in particular the 
successful conclusion of the Diplomatic Conferences on the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and on the 
Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 
20. The Board had also successfully concluded its deliberations on measures to strengthen 
the safeguards system, which had culminated in the adoption of the Model Additional 
Protocol in May 1997. Poland intended to be one of the first countries to sign an additional 
protocol. 
21. The Agency had a special and important role to play in the global quest for peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy and in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons. It was a role 
that it had played very well over the past forty years with the cooperation 
of all Member 
States. He therefore appealed to all States to continue to extend their cooperation 
to the 
Agency as it celebrated its fortieth anniversary with renewed hope for the future. He further 
appealed for the cooperation 
of all participants to enable him to perform his functions 
successfully as President of the fortyfirst 
regular session of the General Conference. 

GC(41)/OR.1 
page 7 


22. Before proceeding to the election of other officers and the appointment of the General 
Committee, he invited Mr. Viktor Klima, Federal Chancellor of Austria, to address the 
Conference. 
Further business under item 1 was suspended. 


ADDRESS BY THE FEDERAL CHANCELLOR OF AUSTRIA 


23. Mr. KLIMA (Federal Chancellor of Austria), having congratulated the 
President on his election as President of the fortyfirst 
regular session of the General 
Conference, said that it was a great honour for him to address the Agency's Member States as 
they celebrated its fortieth anniversary. Austria took considerable pride in having been host 
to the Agency from its very beginning and had done its best over the past 40 years to give it 
the necessary support by building permanent headquarters for the Agency and by providing 
the laboratories at Seibersdorf, where, from the early sixties, important scientific and 
educational work had been carried out, in particular for the benefit of the developing 
countries. 
24. The General Conference was meeting at a time of great hope: the ideological 
confrontations of the Cold War no longer posed an obstacle to global solutions and more 
States than ever were showing readiness to solve international and global problems within the 
framework of the United Nations system. On the other hand, the international community 
still faced a number of major challenges. The dramatic events of 1991 had called for reforms 
in the nuclear nonproliferation 
agenda for the United Nations and in particular for the 
Agency. With the recent adoption by the Board of Governors of the Model Additional 
Protocol for strengthened and more efficient international safeguards to detect clandestine 
nuclear activities, thus increasing confidence that those States were fulfilling their 
obligations, the Agency had proved its ability to master new challenges. 
25. In addition, the United Nations General Assembly, by endorsing the Comprehensive 
NuclearTestBan 
Treaty, had laid the legal basis for a ban on all nuclear tests. The history of 
the CTBT, which had been a priority on the nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda 
since the 1950s, was closely linked to the NPT, adding to the system of nuclear verification. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 8 


The acceptance by the new organization, the CTBTO, of Austria's invitation to establish its 
headquarters in Vienna, had been particularly welcome. 


26. The Agency, in close cooperation 
with the CTBTO, would be able to make an 
important contribution both to the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and to the 
process of nuclear disarmament. The Austrian Government hoped that Vienna would become 
the centre for global nuclear arms control and disarmament. 
27. The devastating Chernobyl accident in 1986 had affected millions of people and 
caused widespread environmental damage. The effects of that accident on Austria and many 
other European countries had demonstrated that the consequences of nuclear accidents were 
not confined to the region or country of origin. With the adoption of the Convention on 
Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency and the Convention 
on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident in September 1986, the international community, 
under the auspices of the Agency, had reacted quickly but only partially. It had taken more 
than a decade before the Convention on Nuclear Safety had entered into force, again under 
the auspices of the Agency, and it was only recently that a convention had been adopted in the 
area of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management, and further instruments adopted 
in the field of nuclear liability. 
28. All those achievements marked milestones on the thorny road to achieving a situation 
where adequate international legal instruments would cover all aspects of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. Those encouraging steps would not have been possible without the dedicated 
work of the Agency with its highly professional staff and the determination of its Member 
States. They confirmed, yet again, the Agency's ability to cope with new challenges and to 
adapt to a changing environment. Nevertheless, much remained to be done. 
29. The future role of nuclear power generation would continue to be questioned in 
principle. While respecting national sovereignty and current international law, he did not 
consider nuclear power to be compatible with the concept of sustainable development. 
Consequently, reliance on nuclear power could not be a viable option for combating the 
greenhouse effect. That position was shared by all the political parties represented in the 
Austrian Parliament. Sustainable development, if fully applied to the energy sector, would 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 9 


require substantial increases in energy efficiency and energy saving as well as a switch to 
renewable sources of energy with the ultimate goal of meeting the demand for energy services 
in the industrial world and in developing countries alike. 


30. Forty years of the Agency was a fortyyear 
success story. In that connection, he 
thanked Mr. Blix for his efforts and the dedication with which he had served the Agency and 
its Member States during the past 16 years. He also expressed his best wishes to the 
incoming Director General for his future work and assured him of Austria's full support in his 
efforts to guide the organization to meet the growing challenges of the future. The Agency 
would continue to play a central role in the nuclear field and Austria, for its part, stood ready 
to support the Agency in the decades to come as it had done over the past 40 years. 
31. Finally, he wished the participants of the fortyfirst 
session of the General Conference 
a successful conclusion of the work which lay ahead. 
32. The PRESIDENT, having thanked Mr. Klima for doing the Agency the honour 
of participating in the General Conference and for his thoughtprovoking 
address, proposed 
that the meeting be suspended briefly to enable the Chancellor to leave the Conference Hall. 
The meeting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 10.55 a.m. 


ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND APPOINTMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE 
(resumed) 


33. The PRESIDENT recalled said that under Rules 34 and 40 of its Rules of 
Procedure the Conference had to elect eight VicePresidents, 
the Chairman of the Committee 
of the Whole and five additional members of the General Committee, resulting in a 
Committee of 15 with himself as Chairman. As a consensus had emerged from the 
consultations which had taken place, he proposed that under Rule 34 the delegates of Canada, 
Germany, Guatemala, the Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, the Russian Federation and 
Zimbabwe be elected as VicePresidents, 
and that Mr. Richard Stratford of the United States 
of America be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and that, under Rule 40, 
the delegates of Bangladesh, Finland, Greece, South Africa and Venezuela be elected as 
additional members of the General Committee. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 10 


34. The President's proposals were accepted. 
35. The PRESIDENT further proposed that, prior to the General Committee's 
meeting and submitting its recommendations on the agenda, the General Conference waive 
Rule 42 and proceed with its consideration of items 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 in order not to lose 
time. 
36. The President's proposal was accepted. 
APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AGENCY 
(GC(41)/2and3) 


37. The CHAIRMAN informed delegates that the General Conference had before 
it applications for membership by Malta and Burkina Faso contained in documents GC(41)/2 
and 3 respectively. Those applications had been endorsed by the Board of Governors, which 
had also submitted draft resolutions on those applications for adoption by the General 
Conference. 
38. He assumed that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolutions by acclamation. 
39. It was so decided. 
40. Mr. BORG (Malta)1 expressed his Government's gratitude to the Board of 
Governors for endorsing, and to the General Conference for approving, Malta's application 
for membership of the Agency. That application was yet another demonstration of his 
Government's commitment to policies that opposed and prohibited the production, 
proliferation, use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass 
destruction, including chemical and biological weapons. Malta had been a party to the NPT 
since 1970 and in November of that year had signed an agreement with the Agency for the 
application of safeguards. It believed that membership of the Agency would enhance Malta's 
role in, and contribution to, the strengthening of security and cooperation 
in the 
Mediterranean region, particularly in the field of nuclear disarmament. 
41. Recalling that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and the 
Environment, in submitting Malta's application for membership, had pledged the 
Speaking under Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure. 



GC(41)/OR.l 
page 11 


Government's commitment to the concomitant obligations of membership and its intention to 


abide by the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, he reiterated that commitment 


and assured the General Conference that his delegation was prepared to work tirelessly to 


ensure that the objectives for which the Agency had been established were realized in the 


most comprehensive manner possible. 


MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARYGENERAL 
OF THE UNITED NATIONS 


42. Mr. ARLACCHI (Representative of the SecretaryGeneral 
of the United 
Nations) read out the following message from the SecretaryGeneral 
of the United Nations: 


"I am pleased to send greetings to the fortyfirst 
regular session of the General 
Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This session is important for 
a number of reasons. 


"First, we are marking the IAEA's fortieth anniversary. Over the years, its role has 
become valuable in international efforts aimed at preventing the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons and ensuring the safe and peaceful use of nuclear technology for 
sustainable development. I salute the IAEA for its many achievements. 


"This session will also mark a change of guard at the helm of the IAEA. I wish to pay 
tribute to Dr. Hans Blix for his 16 years of outstanding leadership and service in the 
cause of peace and development. He leaves behind a great legacy. I wish him much 
happiness, health and success in his new undertakings, and I pledge my full 
cooperation 
and support to the new Director General. 


"This session will address a long and complex agenda. You will continue coping with 
the Chernobyl disaster and promoting nuclear safety efforts 
which received a boost 
last year with the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. You will be 
trying to devise effective measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials by 
criminal elements who prey on the openness of borders and the transnational 
movements of goods, finance, information and people that characterize our age. 


"I am pleased that so many countries have signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
and initiated steps towards its ratification. This is a landmark agreement. The 
Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO has 
now been established at the Vienna International Centre, and is making steady 
progress towards becoming fully operational. 


"IAEA safeguards under the Treaty on the NonProliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons are 
an integral part of the international regime for nonproliferation 
and play an 
indispensable role in ensuring implementation of the Treaty. I welcome therefore the 
adoption in May this year of the Model Protocol additional to existing safeguards 



GC(41)/OR.l 
page 12 


agreements between States and the IAEA, which is designed to strengthen the 


effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the IAEA's safeguards system. 


"I am also pleased to note the successful conclusion of two important diplomatic 
conferences this month in Vienna. The first led to the adoption of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management. The second adopted two instruments in the field of nuclear 
liability. All three are being opened for signature at this General Conference. They 
greatly enhance our efforts to establish an international legal regime in the nuclear 
field. 


"I would also like to express appreciation for the IAEA's efforts in implementing 
resolutions of the Security Council relating to Iraq and the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea. This work is just one manifestation of the long tradition of close 
ties between our two organizations. 


"That peace and development are two sides of the same coin is broadly recognized 
today. The technical cooperation 
activities of the IAEA to promote the peaceful uses 
of atomic energy are a direct contribution to development, helping countries in the 
critical areas of water, health, nutrition, medicine and food production. Such activities 
also help with implementation of Agenda 21. 


"As we continue down the 'road from Rio', I look forward to the contributions the 
IAEA is sure to make to discussions on the role of energy in fulfilling the hopes 
generated by the 'Earth Summit' and by the followup 
special session of the General 
Assembly held this past June to assess progress made since the Rio Conference. 


"The fiftysecond 
session of the General Assembly has now begun. With reform and 
renewal at the top of the agenda, this promises to be one of the most momentous 
periods of debate and action in United Nations history. We are seeking nothing less 
than to reshape and retool the Organization for the new global era. 


"The tasks ahead are numerous, complicated and urgent. I look forward to working 
with the IAEA in our joint efforts towards international peace, security and 
development. Please accept my best wishes for a productive and successful session." 


43. Speaking as Director General of the United Nations Office at Vienna, and on his own 
behalf, he wished the participants of the General Conference every success in their 


deliberations. In addressing vital aspects of peace and security, it was important to bear in 


mind the broad concept of human security, which encompassed aspects ranging from nuclear 


safety to the protection of the individual from threats in his immediate environment. Hand in 


hand with the positive effects of globalization that often rendered national borders 



GC(41)/OR.l 
page 13 


meaningless, the world community increasingly faced the threats of transnational organized 
crime, drug abuse and terrorism. Those threats represented some of the priority issues that 
the United Nations addressed in Vienna. 


44. With the important work of the IAEA, UNIDO, the Preparatory Commission of the 
CTBTO and the United Nations, the Vienna International Centre had indeed become a centre 
dealing with various aspects of human security in the broad sense. He looked forward to 
furthering that broad concept of human security and to working closely with the Agency and 
other organizations to realize that goal. 
45. Finally, he wished to congratulate the Director General designate, Mr. Mohamed 
ElBaradei, with whom he looked forward to working closely, and to wish Mr. Hans Blix a 
productive time in the next phase of his work. 
STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 


46. The DIRECTOR GENERAL, having drawn attention to two books that were 
being published to mark the Agency's fortieth anniversary, said that the anniversary year had 
been an extremely productive one. A number of spectacular results had been registered in the 
field of technical cooperation: 
for instance, the cattle disease rinderpest had been eradicated 
from most countries in Africa and the tsetse fly had been eliminated from the island of 
Zanzibar. The Convention on Nuclear Safety, concluded in 1995, had entered into force, and 
preparation for the first meeting of the parties for safety peer reviews was scheduled for 1998. 
New legal instruments on liability for nuclear damage, including the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, had recently been adopted in Vienna after 
many years of work. In the fields of safety of spent fuel management and safety of 
radioactive waste management, two years of negotiations had culminated in the very recent 
adoption of the Joint Convention. In the field of verification, the Model Additional Protocol 
had been adopted by the Board of Governors in June 1997, completing a series of measures to 
strengthen the safeguards system which had begun after the Gulf War. 
47. Turning to the Agency's different areas of work, he said its activities involving 
cooperation 
in research and the transfer of nuclear technology had steadily expanded, but the 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 14 


emphasis had changed with changing needs in Member States. The Agency had long placed 
emphasis on research in nuclear science and had helped to develop institutions and staff that 
could carry out scientific research and advance the use of nuclear techniques in agriculture, 
medicine and industry. In most, but not all, countries, that initial formative stage had been 
completed. Support for basic science continued, but the Agency's technical cooperation 
was 
increasingly aimed at achieving direct practical benefits such as higher yield crops, assurance 
of food quality, healthier animals and better use of water. That change in the emphasis and 
direction of the Agency's technical cooperation 
had been accompanied by efforts to improve 
planning methods and implementation. 


48. Successful results had been achieved with assistance from the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
programme in a variety of areas: isotope techniques were often very useful in 
the exploration and rational exploitation of water resources and the Agency had assisted many 
countries over the years in that field, for example, in the area of Caracas, groundwater 
reserves had been mapped using isotope techniques and some 50 wells had been drilled to 
supplement the city's water supply, reducing the deficit by about 30%; in the field of nuclear 
medicine, a 30 MW(e) cyclotron had been installed and commissioned at the Karadj Nuclear 
Research Centre for Agriculture and Medicine in Iran with expert assistance and training 
provided under an Agency project and was now producing radionuclides for 65 nuclear 
medicine centres in Iran; salttolerant 
plants and nuclear techniques were being used to map 
the interactions between the groundwater, soil and plants in cases where saline soils and 
brackish groundwater impeded agricultural production causing major problems in many 
countries and an interregional Model Project launched in 1997 was designed to demonstrate 
the feasibility of that approach by drawing on Pakistan's successful experience; another 
Agency Model Project had been launched to help strengthen radiation safety in no less than 
53 countries and the ambition was that by the year 2000 those countries would all comply 
with the Agency's Basic Safety Standards. 
49. Turning to regional cooperation 
arrangements, he noted that the RCA, which was 
celebrating 25 years of successful activities in 1997, and similar arrangements in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and in Africa (ARCAL and AFRA) continued to address the 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 15 


specific needs of their respective regions and demonstrated that regional technical 
cooperation 
between developing countries had a special capacity to mobilize expertise and 
facilitate technology transfer. Support for those schemes remained an important way for the 
Agency to reach out to and cooperate 
with the countries in the regions. 


50. Looking to the future, Agency support would no longer be required for some nuclear 
activities and services that had become selfsupporting 
or that had become commercial. 
However, many other areas remained. There was, for example, no commercial interest in 
developing appropriate norms and establishing institutions to ensure radiation protection, to 
monitor safety or to apply safeguards. 
51. Assisting developing countries to share in the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy had been a fundamental part of the vision of the Atoms for Peace initiative on which 
the Agency had been established. The Agency's ability to provide that assistance depended 
on adequate funding. At a time when Member States turned increasingly to the Agency for 
help in transferring nuclear techniques in 
areas such as more effective food production or 
environmental monitoring not 
all donors and recipients were contributing as envisaged. As 
a result, there was the prospect of a US $5 million shortfall in resources for the technical 
cooperation 
programme in 1997. The Board had urged the Secretariat to take "due account" 
of the record of contributions whether 
from recipient or donor States in 
the allocation of 
resources and in procurement, and the Secretariat was doing so. Donor countries which 
pledged and fully paid their proposed share of the target understandably felt that their 
contributions should be used for the procurement of services and equipment primarily in 
States that did likewise or in developing countries. 
52. Turning to the nuclear power and fuel cycle, he noted that vigorous expansion of 
nuclear power was currently visible only in some countries in East Asia. In most other parts 
of the world, there was stagnation or a slowdown, with most of the additional electricitygeneration 
capacity based on fossil fuels coal 
and gas. Nevertheless, many Governments 
remained very interested in international cooperation 
that could help to make full use of 
existing nuclear capacity and to develop further and make more diversified use of nuclear 
power. For instance, many countries suffering, or expecting to suffer, from a shortage of fresh 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 16 


water were interested in the potential use of nuclear power for desalination of water. As 
obstacles arose to the building of new reactors, questions relating to the ageing of existing 
reactors attracted more interest; as concerns were encountered about the longevity of highlevel 
nuclear waste, Governments took an interest in the prospects for the transmutation of 
actinides. Those interests affected the Agency's programme, as did the continuous interest of 
Governments in the safety of nuclear power and waste disposal. 


53. Yet another factor of great relevance for nuclear power had emerged in the 1990s the 
risk of climate change, or global warming, due to the accelerated emissions of socalled 
greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels, the most important being carbon dioxide. 
54. It used to be said that the best energy was the cheapest energy and the Agency had a 
long tradition of assessing the cost of nucleargenerated 
energy and comparing it with the cost 
of energy from other sources. Cost certainly remained very relevant and it was clear that, for 
a variety of reasons, the nuclear option had lost the competitive cost advantage it had 
previously enjoyed in many places. However, several other factors were becoming of great 
relevance in States' choice of energy sources and assessed in their calculation of the cost of 
the energy used. The cost of waste disposal, for example, had long been included in the cost 
calculated for nucleargenerated 
electricity. More recently, the environmental cost to society 
of the dispersion, or the expense of neutralization by technical means, of waste from burnt 
fossil fuels had attracted general attention. Requiring utilities which burned coal or oil to 
prevent damaging emissions of SO2 and NOX into the atmosphere had a direct, substantial 
impact on the price of the electricity generated by those sources. Any charge on CO2 
emissions would have a similar impact. The Agency must evidently follow that discussion, 
which could lead to cost increases and/or to restrictions in the use of fossil fuels and cause a 
greater demand for nuclear power, which gave rise to no CO2 emissions. There had already 
been repeated calls for limitations on CO2 emissions, with little effect, however. 
55. Against that background, the stage would seem to be set for a discussion of energy 
policies, including nuclear power policies. The United States had recently announced an 
initiative for an internal discussion to increase understanding of the problem of climate 
change; Russia had invited the G7 
energy ministers to a meeting preceding the 1998 G7+
1 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 17 


summit; and the aim of the Kyoto Conference on the Climate Change Convention later 
in 1997 was to reach agreement on targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It was still 
far from clear, however, what approach different Governments would take in the face of the 
current dilemma between the demands for more energy and for limitation of CO2 emissions. 


56. If current trends continued, it was inevitable that there would be a further increase in 
global CO2 emissions, but if nuclear power were adopted more widely, it could have a 
significant restraining impact on CO2 emissions at costs not very different from those of 
fossilfuelled 
power. Only hydroelectric power could compete with nuclear power as a nonCO2 
producing source of baseload power. Most Agency Member States favoured the 
expanded or at least continued use of nuclear power, while some were opposed. However, 
even in the absence of a consensus about the use of nuclear power, several courses were 
generally supported. 
57. One course of action that had been accepted by all members was the preparation of 
data and analyses and assessments of the various energy options, not only in terms of direct 
cost, but also in terms of their impact on health, environment, safety and security. In 
collaboration with a number of other international organizations and national institutions, the 
Agency had developed methodologies and databases for such comparative assessment. While 
Governments also had to consider political and psychological aspects before discussing 
strategies and taking decisions, the studies contributed some hard facts as a technical basis for 
policy decisions. 
58. A second area where there seemed to be continuing general support for the Agency to 
act was the exchange of information and experience in the development of modern reactor 
designs, including breeders, fuel cycle options and waste management technologies. 
Furthermore, with the welcome prospect of nuclear material, including plutonium, being 
turned over from military programmes to the civilian sector, adding to the quantities arising 
from the reprocessing of spent civilian nuclear fuel, there was also a need for an intensified 
international discussion about the use of plutonium stocks and options for the fuel cycle. The 
Agency was serving as a central forum for that important discussion. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 18 


59. A third course of action, supported by consensus and followed by the Agency from the 
time of its inception, was to promote nuclear safety. One important area of such action had 
been the adoption of legally binding rules. Some 40 States were now parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, which had entered into force in 1996. In 1997, the Protocol to 
Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management had been adopted. They were further results of the readiness which States felt 
after the Chernobyl accident to seek internationally binding rules and procedures to 
demonstrate a commitment to, and to promote, universal safety standards. States should be 
encouraged to adhere to those Conventions and to participate fully in the peer reviews and 
other procedures for their implementation. 
60. The development of nonbinding 
joint norms and the provision of services had 
likewise been dramatic. Without impinging on national sovereignty and responsibility for 
nuclear safety, the Agency had offered extensive services in the safety field, thereby 
supplementing national efforts. While the Agency welcomed the provision of safety services, 
to the extent they were able, by the World Association of Nuclear Operators and other 
organizations, it was important to ensure that there was no duplication of effort. 
61. A special category of safety questions which had been given much attention by the 
Agency in the past decade related to the need for safety improvements in the power reactors 
in Eastern Europe. Much had been achieved, but a great deal remained to be done to 
implement the required improvements. At the same time, there were emerging demands for 
safety support and advice in areas such as safety infrastructures and training in new or 
expanding nuclear power programmes, especially in Asia. Fortunately, it appeared that the 
Agency would be able to meet those demands, as Japan, in particular, had generously offered 
extrabudgetary support for work in that area. 
62. A question which had received much attention in recent years in connection with 
radiation protection was to what extent radiological hazards remained from past nuclearweapons 
tests. In several cases the Agency had been asked to answer that question, and 
studies had been carried out at former nuclearweapon 
test sites in Kazakhstan, the Marshall 

GC(41)/OR.1 
page 19 


Islands and French Polynesia, the results of which had proved to be far less worrisome than 
some had feared. 


63. Turning to the subject of Iraq, he recalled that, in its resolution 687 adopted in 1991, 
the Security Council had decided that Iraq should make a declaration describing its nuclearweaponsrelated 
assets, and that the Agency should urgently inspect and destroy, remove or 
render harmless what was of relevance for a weapons capacity and thereafter implement 
monitoring and verification measures to detect any revival of Iraq's clandestine nuclear 
programme. Owing to Iraq's policy of concealment and obstruction, mixed with spells of 
cooperation, 
it had not been possible to keep to the schedule envisaged by the Security 
Council. The Agency had been obliged to rely on the results of its own inspections, 
information from suppliers and Governments, information obtained from Iraq and its own 
expertise and knowledge to form a technically coherent picture of Iraq's vast programme. The 
completeness of that picture had been and remained decisive for the fulfilment of the mandate 
to identify, destroy, remove or render harmless relevant material, installations and equipment. 
Through more than six years of investigations, the blank spots in the picture had become 
fewer, although there was still more to learn and it was not impossible that some equipment 
might still be undetected. As fewer questions arose, however, the emphasis was shifting to 
ongoing monitoring and verification, which should allow the Agency to sound the alarm if a 
renewal of the nuclear programme were to be undertaken. 
64. The discovery in 1991 that Iraq had been able to mount a secret programme of 
uranium enrichment and weaponization undetected had confirmed that the Agency's 
safeguards system had to be strengthened. Many measures that had fallen within the 
Agency's existing authority had been adopted without much delay, and the Model Additional 
Protocol, when accepted by States, would add new teeth to the system and introduce new 
costeffective 
techniques. He welcomed that instrument and expressed appreciation to the six 
countries Armenia, 
Australia, Georgia, the Philippines, Poland and Uruguay that 
were 
taking the lead in signing individual additional protocols. He trusted that other States would 
follow soon. For the Secretariat, it would be a great challenge to ensure early, smooth and 
efficient implementation. The case of Iraq had convinced everyone of the need to strengthen 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 20 


safeguards and the Agency's experiences in Iraq, although based on inspection rights that 
went vastly beyond what would be accepted by States under normal circumstances, had 
suggested important new approaches and techniques, some of which were envisaged in the 
Model Additional Protocol. The Agency's experience in Iraq had thus broadened its 
perspective in the field of verification. It was now better able to tailor verification schemes to 
fit needs that might arise in nuclearweaponfree 
zones, in a "cutoff 
agreement and other 
contexts. 


65. In the DPRK, the Agency was asserting its right and duty to perform inspections under 
an NPTtype 
safeguards agreement which remained in force. But at the same time, it was 
verifying a freeze of the DPRK nuclear programme at the request of the Security Council and 
with periodic reporting to the Council. Regrettably, cooperation 
received from the DPRK 
had not improved in the past year and the correctness and completeness of the initial 
inventory of plutonium declared by the DPRK could therefore not be verified. 
66. During the General Conference in 1996, an arrangement had been made between the 
then Secretary of Energy of the United States, the Minister of the Russian Federation for 
Atomic Energy and himself to examine the modalities of Agency verification in the United 
States and Russia that nuclear material transferred from the defence sector to the peaceful 
sector, notably fissile material from dismantled nuclear weapons, remained peacefully stored 
or was rendered unusable for weapons purposes. Exploratory discussions had been pursued 
on that subject in the past year: he himself had recently visited the Mayak facility under 
construction in the Urals where large quantities of fissile material from dismantled Russian 
nuclear weapons were to be stored. The current session of the General Conference was 
providing an opportunity for a further round of discussions on that issue. 
67. Regrettably, no progress had been made during the past year on the proposal for a 
"cutoff 
agreement to stop all production of fissile material for weapons purposes It was to 
be hoped that talks would soon be reactivated. While verification of the peaceful storage or 
use of fissile material from dismantled weapons would give confidence that no such material 
went back into new weapons, verification of a "cutoff 
would give the world confidence that 
no fresh fissile material was produced for new bombs. The two measures would complement 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 21 


each other and point toward the longterm 
goal of a nuclearweaponfree 
world. Many 
questions needed to be answered, however not 
least about the modalities of verification and 
how it would be financed. It might be tempting to suggest that the States responsible for the 
production of fissile material used for weapons should pay for the verification themselves. 
However, such a regime would make the verification financially dependent upon the party 
where verification was to take place. Perhaps some thought should be devoted to having a 
special nuclear disarmament verification fund based on longterm 
voluntary contributions. 


68. As was apparent from seizures made in recent years of small quantities of nuclear 
materials and of radioactive sources, criminal attempts were being made to exploit a black 
market in those items. Such illicit trafficking raised both health and proliferation risks. In 
response to the interest of Member States, the Agency had developed a programme which 
sought to supplement the action taken by Governments and to coordinate 
a variety of 
measures directed at the problem. In some States, the Agency was offering advice on 
appropriate legislation and standards of physical protection. In others, training was provided. 
In addition, the Agency had developed a database containing official information about 
reported cases. It also intended to explore whether some of the relevant international 
instruments notably 
the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material should 
be updated. 
69. The Agency's accomplishments did not mean that all the challenges facing it had 
disappeared. They continued to exist not only in the area of its specific mission, the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy, but also, importantly, in the area of management. If the Agency had 
faced less criticism than most other international organizations, it was probably because its 
house had been kept in reasonably good order and it had become aware relatively early of the 
need for modernization and streamlining. However, it remained financially vulnerable: any 
failure to pay or late payment by large contributors raised serious problems for the smooth 
functioning of the Agency. All contributions were appreciated. Some had been made only 
the previous week and the Agency hoped that larger contributions would be made the 
following month so that it would remain solvent until the end of the year. Needless to say, 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 22 


such uncertainty was not a healthy situation. He therefore made his perennial appeal to all 
Member States, large and small, to pay their dues and to pay on time. 


70. Information technology had radically changed the ways in which the Secretariat 
worked and would increasingly change the way it interacted with Member States and 
counterpart organizations. For example, most of the documentation for the current session 
was available electronically, via the Internet, to Member States and to the world. Board 
documents were also becoming available electronically. The benefits for both Member States 
and the Agency were speed and ease of access as well as reduced printing and distribution 
costs. 
71. In personnel matters the Secretariat had sought, in line with the directives of the 
General Conference, to increase the number of staff from developing countries and to 
improve the representation of women on the Professional staff. The measures taken were 
described in documents GC(41)/18 and 19. Since the twentyfifth 
anniversary of the Agency 
in 1982, the developing country share of Professional staff subject to geographical 
distribution had almost doubled and was now close to 33%. For senior officers Directors 
and Deputy Directors General it 
was currently even higher at 36.4%. The number of women 
on the Professional staff had not increased as much as it should have done, although some 
progress had been recorded. From 1982 to 1997, the share had increased from 11.7% to 
18.6%. As to the figures for women holding higherlevel 
Professional posts, i.e. P5 
and 
above, whereas in 1982, the highestgraded 
women in the Secretariat had been two staff 
members at P5, 
there were currently 11 women at the P5 
level and 6 at the Dl 
grade. 
72. Turning from the subject of staff recruitment to the staff on board, he reaffirmed his 
conviction that the Agency's good reputation was due not only to the readiness of Member 
States and their representatives to work constructively to achieve results, but also to the 
competence, professional skill and dedication of the Secretariat staff. In addition, it should be 
recognized that Vienna provided a very positive environment for the work and lives of staff. 
He expressed appreciation and gratitude on their behalf to the Austrian Government and the 
City of Vienna for the prevailing good conditions. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 23 


73. The Agency had a very specific profile within the United Nations family in its 
dedication to science and technical excellence characteristics 
which should be preserved. Its 
statutory mandate was also very specific to 
promote the peaceful applications and to help 
prevent the military uses of nuclear energy. Its mission was therefore clear. The Agency was 
not, however, the only international organization engaged in the field of energy, nor the only 
one engaged in nuclear arms control. Its position within the United Nations family of 
organizations called for cooperation 
to achieve joint goals and distribution of labour to avoid 
duplication. 
74. The Agency sought faithfully to observe and implement United Nations systemwide 
policies concerning, for example, the status of women, least developed countries and 
protection of the environment. It had also successfully cooperated 
with other United Nations 
organizations in areas where their mandates were contiguous or overlapped. 
75. International cooperation 
in the general field of energy was a more complex matter. 
The Agency's statutory mandate was limited to nuclear energy, which was deemed to call for 
global intergovernmental cooperation. 
The members of the United Nations community had 
not at 
least so far wished 
to establish any organization for energy generally, not even after 
the oil crises in the 1970s. Moreover, the members of the Agency had never had any 
ambition to extend the scope of the Agency's work to promoting, for instance, renewable 
energy sources. However, at a time when the accelerated use of energy, more particularly 
fossil sources of energy, could have the most dramatic consequences for the world, there was 
no specialized global intergovernmental forum for the discussion of accelerated energy use 
and the current mix of sources. He was not advocating that one should be created at the 
present stage. Perhaps more modestly, as was the case with other questions which were of 
great relevance under Agenda 21, an organization in the United Nations system could be 
made the focal point and task manager within the system for the compilation and analysis of 
relevant data. The International Energy Agency was clearly a highly competent institution of 
that kind, but the OECD, to which it belonged, was not or 
at least not yet a 
global 
organization. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 24 


76. He believed that the Agency's existing activity in the general field of energy was 
adequate. It consisted essentially in collecting data concerning nuclear power and other 
sources of energy and comparing them from a variety of viewpoints, including cost, risk, 
health and environment, and providing those data to Member States and other United Nations 
organizations as a factual basis for policy consideration. He was personally convinced that in 
due course such data would persuade Governments that a revival of the nuclear power option 
was both needed and justified. The problems facing that option today were not so much 
technical and economic as psychological. If he were to recommend any expanded Agency 
activity, it would be in the area of promoting better understanding everywhere of nuclear 
energy, radiation and risk. Most people had not yet come to grips with the force of the atom as 
they had come to grips with the force of gravity and 
with its benefits and risks. Perhaps 
more information and education in that area on a longterm 
basis would help to solve the 
psychological problems. The Agency might be a forum where the need for information was 
discussed and an instrument through which basic material could be provided for use by 
Governments. 
77. In the area of arms control, the Agency was no longer the only global 
intergovernmental organization. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
was in operation at The Hague and the Provisional Technical Secretariat for the CTBT was in 
place in Vienna. Like the Agency, those organizations had important verification functions. 
The Agency looked forward to cooperation 
and enriching discussions about common 
objectives and varying methods of work. While the United Nations Security Council was 
responsible for any enforcement actions regarding weapons of mass destruction, 
organizations like the Agency would be the watchdogs of the system. He was optimistic 
about the longterm 
prospects for nuclear arms control, including the currently delayed 
"cutoff 
agreement. 
78. In conclusion, he quoted from a recent speech in which the President of Brazil had 
announced his Government's intention to supplement Brazil's adherence to the Tlatelolco 
Treaty by adherence to the NPT. The President had argued that the atomic bomb was losing 
its juridical legitimacy and political importance. Whereas previously nuclear weapons had 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 25 


been central to the military planning of the Superpowers, the atomic bomb was currently 
viewed as a source of risk, costs and uncertainty. Even in the nuclear Powers, public opinion 
was recognizing that the bomb only increased insecurity. At the same time, other countries 
that were stronger in economic production and trade and political stability had gained great 
influence in international relations. The essential power factors in today's world were 
competitiveness and social cohesion. The Director General subscribed to those thoughts. He 
merely wished to add that the slow setting of the sun on the nuclear weapons era would need 
to be closely watched and that there would be no shortage of work in that connection for the 
Agency. 


79. The PRESIDENT, commending the Director General on his statement, said that 
his interesting ideas on the challenges that lay ahead for the Agency would certainly be carefully 
considered by Member States. 
APPROVAL OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 
(GC(41)/5and25) 


80. The PRESIDENT declared that, pursuant to Article VILA of the Statute, the 
Board had decided to appoint Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei to serve as Director General of the 
Agency for a term of four years from 1 December 1997 to 30 November 2001 and had 
requested the General Conference to approve that appointment by adopting the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(41)/5. He took it that the General Conference wished 
to adopt the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/5. 
81. It was so decided and the Conference confirmed the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei to 
the post of Director General by acclamation. 
At the invitation of the President, Mr. ElBaradei entered the meeting. 


82. The PRESIDENT informed Mr. ElBaradei that the Conference had approved 
his appointment to the post of Director General. He was pleased to be the first to congratulate 
him on behalf of the General Conference and to wish him a long and fruitful tenure. He 
invited him to take the oath of office. 
83. Mr. ELBARADEI took the following oath: 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 26 


"I solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions 
entrusted to me as Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to 
discharge these functions and to regulate my conduct with the interest of the Agency 
only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my 
duties from any Government or other authority external to the Agency." 


84. Mr. ELBARADEI said he was grateful for, and humbled by, the confidence 
placed in him by the General Conference and would do his best to fulfil the duties of his 
office objectively, impartially and efficiently in accordance with the Statute and the directives 
of the policymaking 
organs. 
85. Intergovernmental organizations were instruments for cooperation 
among States for 
the common good. They were at their best when consensus prevailed and they could be 
paralysed by dissension. To enjoy the confidence and support of their members, they had to 
be responsive to their needs, achieve concrete results, operate in a costeffective 
manner and 
ensure equitable representation, transparency and open dialogue. 
86. The Agency had been established to promote peace and sustainable development 
through international cooperation 
for the safe use of nuclear energy, to curb the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and, it was to be hoped, one day to verify their elimination. It could be 
justly proud of its record, to which the outgoing Director General had made an outstanding 
contribution during his tenure, steering the Agency through turbulent times with deftness and 
vision. He wished him health and happiness in the coming years. 
87. Many challenging and complex tasks still lay ahead. The potential of nuclear 
technology for meeting such basic human needs as energy, food, health and water had not yet 
been fully exploited. Nuclear power would clearly continue to play a key role in the energy 
mix of many countries for strategic, economic and environmental reasons. Radioisotope 
applications were also essential in many fields. The Agency should therefore continue, in 
accordance with its Statute, to encourage the development and refinement of such technology, 
to assist in framing acceptable responses to related concerns and to make its expertise 
available as required. The Agency's role as an objective mechanism for information 
exchange and comparative assessment was unique, as was its role as a vehicle for the transfer 
of nuclear technology and development assistance. Technical cooperation, 
a critical 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 27 


component of the international consensus underpinning the peaceful use of nuclear energy, 
should therefore be sustained, expanded and adequately financed. However, the technical 
cooperation 
programme should also be linked as closely as possible to priorities for 
economic and social development in recipient countries, with emphasis on quality projects, 
efficient delivery and TCDC. 


88. The use of nuclear energy depended not only on technological advances, but also on 
public trust that safety was given high priority and that it was used exclusively for peaceful 
purposes. The safety regime had made important strides over the previous decade, but had to 
be consolidated as a comprehensive and coherent set of widely accepted standards. The 
transformation of many safety norms into conventions and "hard law" was a welcome 
development that should continue, with emphasis on widespread adherence. The regime 
should also focus on helping States with practical implementation, particularly in areas where 
problems persisted such as radiation protection, reactor safety, waste disposal and transport, 
physical protection and illicit trafficking. 
89. Recent setbacks had shown that the verification of nonproliferation 
undertakings, 
which was vital to international security, could not be confined to declared activities. A move 
towards greater rigour was successfully being made through efforts to strengthen the 
safeguards system and expand the scope of its application. The new measures would also 
cover possible undeclared activities, provide the Agency with additional information and 
access rights, make use of stateoftheart 
technology and increase efficiency. Such 
transparency measures should enable the Agency to provide additional assurances regarding 
an inspected State's nuclear activities, a critically important requirement as the world moved 
towards nuclear disarmament. It was therefore vital to secure universal support for the 
protocol which incorporated those measures. 
90. Although the tasks were challenging, they were within the Agency's grasp. The 
Secretariat could and would do whatever the Member States asked, but certain fundamental 
requirements had to be fulfilled. Firstly, there had to be a broad consensus on, and sustained 
commitment to, the three pillars of nuclear verification, nuclear safety and sustainable 
development, regardless of geographical and ideological differences. The Agency had to 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 28 


approach the various aspects of its mandate in an objective and balanced manner, reflecting 
the range of needs and the priorities of its Member States. A process of mutual 
accommodation was therefore essential. 


91. Secondly, there had to be a focused programme and clearly defined priorities: the 
Agency could not have a monopoly of all things nuclear. The programme had to be reviewed 
to ensure that it was organized around the Agency's core competencies and what it was best 
suited to do. Relations between the Agency as flagship with its counterparts, regional 
organizations, Governments and society at large, should be based on a prudent division of 
labour, vigorous interaction, cooperation 
and coordination. 
92. Thirdly, there had to be adequate resources, both human and financial. The Agency's 
staff was one of its greatest assets and should continue to be motivated and adequately 
compensated. Maximum efficiency and prudent management were, of course, essential and 
he intended to pursue that tradition with vigour and review the Secretariat's organizational 
structure and management practices. The fact remained, however, that new and additional 
tasks such as combating illicit trafficking required additional funds. He suggested that when 
Governments were deciding whether to commit additional resources to the Agency, they 
should apply the criterion of whether, as shareholders, they were likely to get a good return on 
their investment, in both the short and the long term. If the Agency was a successful 
instrument for promoting international peace, enhancing nuclear safety and contributing to 
economic and social development, then it was surely wise to invest in its future. 
93. He shared with those present the exciting task of leading the Agency into the twentyfirst 
century, an Agency that had to continue to be responsive to changing global needs and 
priorities, that spearheaded the effort to maximize the use of evolving nuclear technology, and 
that was lean, focused and innovative. He was confident that, with the continuing guidance, 
active involvement and support of its Member States, the Agency would meet and, he hoped, 
exceed existing expectations. 
94. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution in document GC(41)/25 conferring the title of Director General Emeritus on the 
retiring Director General. 

GC(41)/OR.1 
page 29 


95. The draft resolution in document GC(41)/25 was adopted by acclamation. 
96. The PRESIDENT paid tribute to Mr. Blix on behalf of the General Conference 
for his outstanding leadership of the Agency for the past 16 years and wished him happiness, 
good health and continued success in the years ahead. 
97. Mr. EL FADHEL KHALIL (Tunisia), speaking on behalf of the African 
Group, said that that Group took particular pride in the approval by the General Conference of 
the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei of Egypt as Director General of the Agency. In addition to 
the unanimous support of the African Group, he had enjoyed the full support of the Group of 
77 and his appointment had been unanimously endorsed by the Board of Governors. He 
therefore enjoyed the fullest confidence and could expect unstinting support from the 
Agency's entire membership. 
98. He was taking over at a time when the Agency was in good shape thanks to the 
successful leadership of Mr. Blix, who had tacked many difficult issues during his mandate 
with patience, perseverance and wisdom. Historic decisions had been taken regarding the 
strengthening of safeguards and nuclear safety. The Agency had consequently acquired a 
special prestige within the United Nations system and he was confident that Mr. ElBaradei, 
who had served the Agency with competence and dedication for many years, would continue 
to promote the interests of all Member States and help to add to its achievements in the period 
leading into the twentyfirst 
century. 
99. Mr. ElBaradei came from an African Member State and would be the first Director 
General from a developing country. He would bring to the task not only superb intellectual, 
organizational and management skills, but also an intimate understanding of the needs and 
aspirations of developing as well as developed countries. The African Group would give him 
its full support, particularly in the field of technical cooperation, 
which, according to the 
opening statement by the Director General to the recent meeting of the Board, was facing 
certain difficulties. 
100. Mr. TULLER (Czech Republic), speaking on behalf of the Eastern European 
Group, commended the Director General on his 16 years of service to the Agency, during 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 30 


which he had displayed deep personal involvement, high professionalism, keen political 
intuition, admirable diplomatic skills and a sensitive approach to and deep understanding of 
the specific conditions and needs of all Member States of the Eastern European Group. Each 
member of that Group could list specific and unique results of their cooperation 
with the 
Agency for which they owed a debt of gratitude to Mr. Blix. 


101. His achievements included: international conventions which laid the basis for an 
international nuclear safety regime in response to the Chernobyl accident; an extrabudgetary 
programme on objective judgement of the safety of WWER and RBMK reactors and 
identification of safety issues; technical assistance to Eastern European Member States in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear power and ionizing radiation; and measures to maintain global 
security through improved effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency safeguards system. 
Under Mr. Blix's guidance, the Agency had become a highly respected organization 
promoting the safe and exclusively peaceful use of nuclear power for the benefit of the world 
as a whole. He wished him every success in his future endeavours. 
102. On behalf of the Eastern European Group, he congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his 
appointment as the new Director General. The Group had known him as a responsible and 
capable head of the Division of External Relations, who had played an important role in 
respect of a number of decisive legal issues and whose abilities and skills qualified him for 
the responsible post he was about to assume. The Eastern European Group assured him of its 
full support and wished him every success. It believed that, under his leadership, the Agency 
would retain the respect it had achieved and continue to gain strength. 
103. Mr. SeungKon 
LEE (Republic of Korea) speaking on behalf of the 
Far Eastern Group, extended his sincere congratulations to Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment 
as Director General of the Agency. Over the previous four decades, the Agency had played a 
major role in promoting the peaceful application of nuclear technology and nuclear nonproliferation. 
However, many challenges lay ahead and, under Mr. ElBaradei's leadership, 
the Agency should adopt a wellbalanced 
approach to promoting public acceptance of nuclear 
energy, enhancing the nuclear safety culture and strengthening technical cooperation 
and the 
safeguards system. The Far Eastern Group was confident that, with his diplomatic skill, 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 31 


professional expertise and vision, Mr. ElBaradei would steer the Agency successfully into the 
next millennium and the Group would provide him with every assistance in the years to 
come. 


104. He also expressed the Group's gratitude to Mr. Blix for his dedicated service to the 
Agency over the previous 16 years. His outstanding managerial skills had made the Agency 
an international body of exemplary effectiveness and efficiency. His commitment to the 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had brought the Agency one step closer to 
fulfilling the objectives and principles enshrined in its Statute, and his efforts in the nuclear 
nonproliferation 
field were particularly laudable. 
105. Mr. de OUROPRETO 
(Brazil), speaking on behalf of GRULAC, said that 
during his 16 years as Director General of the Agency, Mr. Blix had helped to promote 
international cooperation 
to ensure that nuclear energy would serve as an instrument of peace 
and cooperation. 
Under his leadership, the Agency had been fulfilling the mandate with 
which it had been entrusted 40 years previously. Mr. Blix had always demonstrated a talent 
for reconciling positions and interests and was a skilful orator. However, it was his ability to 
listen which, to a large extent, accounted for his success. 
106. Mr. ElBaradei was well known in the Latin American and Caribbean region. He too 
was politically sensitive, a man of dialogue and understood the need to focus both on 
safeguards and technical cooperation. 
The Group was certain that, as Director General, Mr. 
ElBaradei would explore new channels for dialogue and cooperation, 
and he could be 
assured of the Group's support. 
107. Mr. TIWARI (India), speaking on behalf of the Middle East and South Asia 
Group, congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment as Director General of the Agency. 
The Group was certain that, with his long experience, he would give new orientation and 
impetus to the Agency. The developing Member States had always sought to achieve a better 
balance between the Agency's promotional and regulatory functions and believed that the 
Agency should act as a catalyst for the promotion of nuclear power as an inevitable, although 
benign, option for meeting future energy requirements. In that connection, the MESA Group 
welcomed the appointment of the first ever Director General from the developing world and 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 32 


assured Mr. ElBaradei of the Group's full cooperation 
in his endeavours to fulfil the 
Agency's objectives. 


108. The MESA Group also wished to pay tribute to Mr. Blix, who had supervised the 
preparations for the conclusion of several international instruments on safety and safeguards 
during his tenure. The Agency owed much to his persistence and efficiency and skills in 
communication and diplomacy. The Group was certain that, with his rich and varied 
experience in disarmamentrelated 
issues and international relations, Mr. Blix's counsel 
would be sought in the future and was pleased to note that the Conference had decided to 
confer on him the title of Director General Emeritus. 
109. Mr. RITCH (United States of America), speaking on behalf of the North 
American Group, said that the Group was keenly aware of the Agency's responsibilities in 
promoting both world peace and sustainable global development and believed that Mr. Blix 
had left as his legacy an organization equipped to fulfil those responsibilities. 
110. Leadership would be of fundamental importance in the years to come and it was the 
world's good fortune that Mr. ElBaradei possessed the energetic intellect, personal dedication 
and diplomatic skills to provide the leadership required in the future. He could be assured of 
the Group's unwavering support in the accomplishment of his momentous task. 
111. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia), speaking on behalf of the South East Asia and 
Pacific Group, congratulated Mr. ElBaradei, who had an unsurpassed knowledge of the 
intricacies of the Agency's constantly evolving agenda, on his appointment as Director 
General and said that the Group particularly welcomed the appointment of a Director General 
from a ThirdWorld 
country. 
112. Recalling the way in which Mr. Blix had responded to the challenge to the safeguards 
regime following the discovery of the undeclared nuclearweapons 
programme in Iraq, and 
his firm, yet sensitive handling of the situation with regard to the DPRK, he said that the 
imprint left by Mr. Blix extended across the entire range of Agency activity. The General 
Conference's decision to confer on Mr. Blix the title of Director General Emeritus was 
therefore entirely appropriate. 

GC(41)/OR.1 
page 33 


113. Mr. ORTIZ (Spain), speaking on behalf of the Western European Group, 
welcomed the adoption of the draft resolution on the approval of the appointment of the 
Director General contained in document GC(41)/5. The support Mr. ElBaradei's candidacy 
had received bore witness to the esteem in which he was held. His extraordinary personal and 
professional skills, together with his thorough knowledge of the Agency boded well for his 
successful tenure. He would receive the Western European Group's full support in achieving 
the objectives enshrined in the Agency's Statute. 
114. Mr. Blix's retirement would mark the end of an era. He had steered the Agency 
through difficult times and had left, as his legacy, an organization that was an example to 
others within the United Nations system. The Group was proud that Mr. Blix came from a 
Western European country and was pleased to note that the draft resolution conferring the 
title of Director General Emeritus on Mr. Blix had been adopted. 
115. Mr. ABAZA (Egypt) said that the fact that Mr. ElBaradei's appointment as 
Director General had been approved by all the regional groups attested to his recognized 
capabilities. His delegation was grateful to all those countries that had supported 
Mr. ElBaradei's nomination and thanked the African Group, in particular, which had 
submitted his candidature. He also thanked the Group of 77 and other geographical regions 
for supporting the nomination and finally, he expressed his appreciation to the Chairman of 
the Board of Governors, Ambassador Walker, for his impartiality in guiding the Board's 
deliberations on the selection of a new Director General. 
116. He also wished to pay tribute to Mr. Blix, who had steered the Agency through a 
period of profound international transformation. As a result of Mr. Blix's diplomatic skill 
and political acumen, the Agency had become one of the strongest and most cohesive 
international organizations and was admired by all. 
117. Mr. FRANK (Israel), having pointed out that he was taking the floor because 
none of the eight regional groups had spoken on Israel's behalf, expressed his Government's 
appreciation of Mr. Blix's achievements. Under his leadership, the Agency had been able to 
fulfil its crucial tasks and even improve its performance, despite the formidable challenges it 
had faced in recent years. He also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei, whose outstanding record 

GC(41)/OR.l

and experience had prepared him well for the high office of Director General. He was 
confident that Mr. ElBaradei would lead the Agency with wisdom and vision. 


118. Mr. BLIX (Director General), having congratulated his successor, 
Mr. ElBaradei, on his appointment as Director General, thanked the General Conference for 
the distinction it had conferred on him by making him Director General Emeritus upon his 
retirement. When he had been elected in 1981, he had been unknown in Agency circles. 
However, in 1985, 1989 and 1993 Governments must have known what they were doing 
when they had reelected 
him and he was grateful for and proud of the confidence that they 
had shown in him. 
119. From his days as a student, he had felt that it would be a meaningful mission to help 
in the efforts to put relations between States on the basis of law and had been fortunate 
enough to pursue that mission at university, in government and at the United Nations. At the 
Agency, he had had the privilege of continuing to work on the development of international 
law and had also had the privilege of broadening his own outlook to deal with other elements 
needed for peace, such as development, disarmament, arms control, education and research, 
energy and technology transfer. 
120. While there was no single hub around which the world turned, the Agency was an 
important arena where Governments slowly built some of the structures needed for a more 
peaceful and more developed world community. It had been an enormous privilege to be in 
the midst of that arena for 16 years. He thanked the Governments of Member States for 
giving him that privilege and their Missions and experts for the rich and professional relations 
he had enjoyed with them. He also thanked his colleagues, with whom he had shared the 
management of the Agency's Secretariat, and the staff of the Agency for their hard work, 
initiative and loyalty. Finally, he thanked the Government of Austria, which had been such 
an excellent host to the Agency and to himself personally. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL COOPERATION 
FUND FOR 1998 


(GC(41)/27) 


121. The PRESIDENT said that since 1982 the Agency's policymaking 
organs had 
observed a practice of recommending Indicative Planning Figures to serve in fixing annual 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 35 


targets for contributions to the Fund. In September 1995 the Board had agreed that the target 
for contributions to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund for 1996 would be $65.4 million and 
had also agreed on target increases of at least $3.5 million in 1997 and 1998. The approved 
target for 1997 was $68 million, and in draft resolution B relating to the TCF in Annex I to 
document GC(41)/10, the Board had recommended a figure of $71.5 million as the target for 
contributions to the Fund for 1998. 


122. The early pledging of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in 
planning the Agency's technical assistance programmes. Delegations in a position to do so 
were therefore urged to notify the Secretariat during the Conference of the contributions 
which their Governments would be making to the TCF in 1998. He hoped that the expected 
10% shortfall in new resources announced by the Director General the previous week would 
not lead to a reduction in the technical cooperation 
programme for 1998 and he appealed in 
particular to the major contributors to pledge their share of the target in full. 
123. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the 
contributions which had been pledged up to that time. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY 
(GC(41)/8) 


124. The PRESIDENT appealed for understanding and cooperation 
in the 
arrangement of the daily speakers' list. Adjustments had been necessary to allow the 
participation of several Ministers and other senior officials from Member States and 
international organizations who were unable to spend the whole week in Vienna. Additional 
adjustments might be required, but he was confident that the Secretariat would do its best to 
cope with the conflicting demands. He took it that the Conference was in agreement with 
those arrangements. 
125. It was so agreed. 
126. The PRESIDENT, pointing out that over 85 delegates had already inscribed 
their names on the speakers' list, said that he took it that the Conference authorized him, 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 36 


under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of speeches to 15 minutes, in 
accordance with past practice. 


127. It was so decided. 
128. Mr. TAURAN (Holy See) conveyed greetings from Pope JohnPaul 
II, who 
wished to encourage participants to the fortyfirst 
session of the General Conference in their 
efforts to establish and monitor standards for the transfer and responsible use of nuclear 
technology for peaceful purposes. The Agency's work in the 40 years of its existence had 
contributed to the emergence of a safety culture that was absolutely essential if the world 
wanted to continue to use nuclear energy. 
129. Moving from military to peaceful uses of atomic energy clearly presupposed the 
existence of international verification bodies that were capable of securing, in an objective 
manner, the loyalty of all. The Treaty on the NonProliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons and the 
safeguards system had certainly been an effective barrier to the general proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. The Agency's instincts and commitments had been an inspiration to new 
organizations, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the 
Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty Organization, which had also been set up to prevent 
the proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. The Holy See, which was in favour of 
the total elimination of nuclear weapons, expected the nuclear Powers to submit to specific 
safeguards agreements the entire process of transferring military nuclear material to civilian 
use, in accordance with the conclusions of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. 
130. The history of the Agency, and in particular the conviction, competence and hard 
work of its staff, had shown that it was possible through dialogue and respect for the law to 
move mankind forward in the direction of fraternity and reason while rejecting the culture of 
violence and hatred. In that connection, he wished to associate himself with all those who 
had paid tribute to Mr. Blix, who had guided the Agency prudently and effectively for the past 
16 years, and to congratulate his successor, Mr. ElBaradei. 

GC(41)/OR.l 
page 37 


131. All the participants in the General Conference should persevere in their task; at the 
end of one of the bloodiest centuries in history, all had the duty, as Pope JohnPaul 
II had 
said, resolutely to proceed to the total outlawing of war and to cultivate peace as the supreme 
good to which all programmes and strategies should be subordinate.

GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE FORTIETH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE AGENCY (continued) 
(GC(41)/8) 


1. Mr, KATO (Japan), after welcoming the fact that Malta and Burkina Faso had 
been approved for membership of the Agency, expressed particular appreciation to Dr. Blix 
for his dedicated efforts over the past sixteen years to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. The numerous achievements of Dr. Blix's 
period of office had been the products of energetic work combined with wisdom and effective 
leadership. He also congratulated Dr. ElBaradei, who would be assuming the post of Director 
General on 1 December 1997. The Japanese Government was convinced that his excellent 
qualifications and wide experience of the Agency made Dr. ElBaradei the best person to lead 
the Agency and continue the work of Dr. Blix. 
2. He then read out the following message from the Prime Minister of Japan, 
Mr. Ryutaro Hashimoto: "On behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I would like to 
offer my sincere congratulations on the fortieth anniversary of the Agency's establishment. 
Since its inception, the Agency has succeeded admirably in its efforts to tackle two major 
undertakings the 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the prevention of 
nuclear proliferation. Japan, maintaining its national policy of limiting the use of nuclear 
energy to exclusively peaceful purposes, is at the forefront in this field, but its progress in 
nuclear development and utilization would be unthinkable if it were not for close cooperation 
with the Agency. 
3. "Reviewing the Agency's outstanding achievements, we cannot applaud Dr. Blix 
sufficiently for his dedication and leadership over the past sixteen years. As Japan promotes 
nuclear policy, including the nuclear fuel cycle, it has been extremely encouraging that Dr. Blix 
has led the Agency with a firm belief in the importance of promoting the utilization of nuclear 
energy. Japan is thus particularly grateful to him. 
4. "As mankind faces new challenges such as global environmental and sustainable 
development issues, the importance of nuclear power as an energy resource will not diminish, 
but increase, as it offers the advantages of inter 
alia stable 
supply and low environmental 
impact. Recognizing the importance of nuclear power, however, does not automatically 
guarantee a rosy future. Enhancing safety, an essential prerequisite for the promotion of 
nuclear energy, together with maintaining and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime, constitutes a major agenda for us. The Agency's role in this context is paramount, 
and we look forward to the initiatives to be taken by Dr. ElBaradei in his role as new Director 
General. 
5. "In conclusion, on the occasion of the Agency's fortieth anniversary, I affirm Japan's 
determination to continue its close cooperation 
with the Agency under its new Director 
General." 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 4 


6. Population growth, improvements in living standards and other factors meant that a 
continuing increase in world energy demand could be expected. Under those circumstances, 
his country felt that the members of the international community had a duty to ensure 
sustainable development while economizing on fossil fuels, given the limited supply and their 
impact on the global environment. The Third Conference of the Parties to the Framework 
Convention on Climate Change, due to be held in Kyoto in December 1997, would be 
concerned with establishing a new international framework consisting of a set of measures for 
tackling the problem of global warming beyond the year 2000. Nuclear power would play an 
important role in that regard. Provided its safety could be ensured, nuclear power was a 
realistic option offering supply stability and low, greenhousegasfree 
environmental impact. 
7. In Japan, the sodium leakage from the Monju prototype fast breeder in December 1995 
and the incident at a radioactive waste disposal facility of the Tokai Reprocessing Plant in 
March 1997 and 
the subsequent mishandling of both issues had 
increased the public's 
doubts about the Government's nuclear policy. The Japanese authorities intended to address 
the situation by strengthening the country's safety culture and through greater transparency. 
They were working hard to restore public confidence, mainly through a thorough restructuring 
of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation, whose safety role would be 
strengthened and openness visavis 
the public increased. 
8. As a country with scarce energy resources, Japan attached very great importance to 
establishing a nuclear fuel cycle which maximized the usefulness of uranium. In accordance 
with that policy, Japan would continue to develop fast breeders and to use plutonium in 
lightwater 
reactors. Public understanding and cooperation 
were indispensable to further 
progress along that path. It was from that perspective, and bearing in mind the fact that the 
Agency was the only international organization concerned with all aspects of nuclear energy, 
that Japan supported the initiatives taken by the Agency in addressing nuclear fuel cycle and 
public acceptance issues. 
9. As the twentyfirst 
century drew nearer, a historic opportunity existed to create a more 
secure world by promoting global disarmament and upholding nuclear nonproliferation. 
The 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) had been adopted and opened for signature 
at the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996. Banning all nuclear explosions, 
the CTBT was regarded as a realistic, significant step towards a world free of nuclear 
weapons. Japan intended to participate very actively in the work of the Preparatory 
Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) as it 
prepared for the CTBT's implementation. Ratifying the CTBT in July 1997, Japan had been 
the fourth signatory State to ratify it and was the first of the 42 countries whose ratification 
was necessary for the CTBT's entry into force to have become a State Party. It hoped that 
signatory States would ratify the CTBT soon. Meanwhile, it earnestly hoped that those 
countries which had expressed opposition to the CTBT would reconsider their position in the 
light of the paramount objective the 
promotion of nuclear disarmament. 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 5 


10. Following the CTBT, the elaboration of a "cutoff 
treaty" prohibiting the production of 
weaponspurpose 
fissile material should be the next multilateral measure directed towards 
nuclear disarmament. The Conference on Disarmament had not yet started negotiations to 
that end, and Japan therefore intended to join with other interested countries in expediting the 
process. 
11. In the interests of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, 
it was extremely 
important to manage the plutonium recovered from dismantled nuclear weapons safely and to 
dispose of it safely and as speedily as possible, ensuring that it was not reused for military 
purposes. In that connection, Japan looked forward to progress in the consultations between 
the United States, the Russian Federation and the Agency aimed at the placing of such 
plutonium under Agency safeguards. It intended to take part in the international cooperative 
effort in question, exploiting technology which it had developed for the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy, and thereby to help promote nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. 
Over 
the past three years, Japan had made public the details of its plutonium stocks. Furthermore, it 
hoped to implement at an early date the international framework for enhancing the 
transparency of plutonium management which was currently being considered by the countries 
concerned. 
12. Turning to the issue of nuclear weapons development in the DPRK, he said that the 
lightwater 
reactor project of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization 
(KEDO) was well under way. The groundbreaking ceremony which had taken place on 
19 August had been an important milestone in the implementation of the project, which his 
country hoped would help to resolve that issue. Japan, which would continue to collaborate 
closely with KEDO, would like to see the DPRK allaying the concerns of the international 
community by complying strictly with the Agreed Framework and implementing in full its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. Japan would continue to support the Agency's efforts 
to achieve full compliance by the DPRK with the safeguards agreement. 
13. Since its establishment, the Agency's safeguards system had played a crucial role in 
ensuring nuclear nonproliferation 
against a background of increasing nuclear energy 
utilization for peaceful purposes. Japan, which had regarded the Agency's safeguards system 
very highly from the outset, was faithfully implementing its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. It had urged those countries which had not acceded to the NPT to do so and to 
conclude safeguards agreements with the Agency. It had also urged all countries which had 
concluded such agreements with the Agency to faithfully discharge the resulting obligations. 
14. Recent events in connection with the development of nuclear weapons in Iraq and the 
DPRK had led to strong international pressure in favour of strengthening the Agency's 
safeguards system. In that connection, Japan had been delighted with the adoption in 
May 1997 of the Model Protocol for the implementation of Programme 93+2 Part 2 measures 
for strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the system. It was grateful 
to the other countries which had participated in the negotiations and to the Secretariat. For its 
part, Japan, which had contributed actively to the adoption process and would endeavour to 
conclude an additional protocol with the Agency soon, hoped that the Programme 93+2 Part 2 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 6 


measures would be implemented without delay by all countries, including the nuclearweapon 
States. In the meantime, it would like the Secretariat to take further action to improve the 
efficiency of the safeguards system with a view to ensuring zero growth in the mediumand 
longterm 
costs of safeguards implementation. 


15. There had been remarkable progress in nuclear safety during the past year. At the 
Nuclear Safety and Security Summit held in Moscow in April 1996, the leaders of the G7 
and 
the Russian Federation had confirmed the importance of nuclear power as an energy resource 
compatible with the goal of sustainable development. Also, they had declared their 
commitment to ensuring international nuclear safety, strengthening the Agency's safeguards 
system and preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. At the Summit, Japan had made a 
proposal which had led to the holding in November 1996 of the Tokyo Conference on Nuclear 
Safety in Asia. The Conference, which had been the first intergovernmental meeting in Asia 
on the issue of nuclear safety, was to be followed by a similar one planned for Seoul in 
October 1997. Japan was grateful to the Agency for the expertise and knowhow 
it was 
making available for such international conferences. 
16. His country welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the 
first international agreement in the nuclear safety field. Ensuring safety was an essential 
prerequisite for the development and use of nuclear energy. Japan hoped that implementation 
of the Convention would enable a high level of safety to be achieved throughout the world 
and that many more countries would accede to the Convention. His country also welcomed 
the adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which it hoped would improve waste management 
safety worldwide. 
17. Mindful of the importance of technical cooperation 
with developing countries, Japan 
had participated in various initiatives to encourage the development and utilization of nuclear 
energy in Asia. Also, it had made significant contributions to the TCF and within the 
framework of the RCA, and it would continue to contribute as much as possible. 
18. Japan was currently undertaking drastic budgetary reforms in order to improve its 
financial situation. Given the importance of the Agency, Japan would continue to cooperate 
with it to the extent possible. However, it expected the Secretariat to continue striving for 
realistic and efficient management through for 
example the 
prioritization of activities. As 
an international organization specializing in nuclear energy, the Agency had a significant role 
to play in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and strengthening the 
nonproliferation 
regime, which was one of the foundations of world peace and security. For 
that reason, Japan was determined to maintain its active role in Agency affairs, and it very 
much hoped that other Member States would do likewise. 
19. Mr. PEÑA (United States of America) read out the following message from the 
President Clinton to the General Conference: 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 7 


"On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend to you my best wishes for a 
most successful meeting. The 1997 General Conference is clearly a special event affording 
us an opportunity to pause and reflect upon the important contributions that 
the IAEA has made to international peace and prosperity over the past 40 years. It 
also affords us an opportunity to recognize and pay tribute to the outstanding work of 
Dr. Blix during his tenure as Director General. And, it affords us the opportunity to 
look ahead, to a new millennium and to the role that this unique organization will play 
in our collective future. 


"Looking back over these four decades, there are several characteristics that mark the 
work of the IAEA and its Secretariat. Excellence at every level has been a hallmark. 
The Agency has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the most effective and wellmanaged 
members of the United Nations system. Commitment is equally obvious. 
Despite budget constraints, the IAEA and the Secretariat have remained dedicated to 
getting the job done. Creativity is another characteristic. IAEA personnel are 
constantly called upon to identify approaches to complex technical issues for which 
there are no convenient directions or road maps to follow. 


"In no small measure, the excellence, commitment and creativity of the IAEA have 
been exemplified and fostered by outgoing Director General Hans Blix. In his 16 years 
of service as Director General, he has grappled with some of the most difficult issues 
any international organization has been called upon to address. I would like to take 
this opportunity to extend my personal thanks to Dr. Blix for a job exceedingly well 
done, and to wish him the very best in the years ahead." 


20. As President Clinton had noted, the General Conference was meeting at a special time 
in the Agency's history at 
a time when the organization was celebrating its fortieth 
anniversary. On the present occasion, the Conference should, like Janus, the god with two 
faces, look simultaneously towards the past and towards the future. Although there were 
several reasons to be proud of what had been accomplished, it was necessary to focus on the 
challenges of the next 40 years. The nuclear arms race had ended, but a new race had begun one 
to settle the legacy of the Cold War by leaving to future generations a safer and more 
prosperous world. There could have been no victor in the nuclear arms race. However, 
everyone would share in the victory in the race to eliminate nuclear weapons and ensure the 
safe utilization of nuclear science for peaceful purposes, and future generations would reap the 
greatest benefits. 
21. In the new race, there were six milestones marking progress towards the finishing line: 
the establishment of stronger barriers against proliferation; deep reductions in nuclear 
stockpiles; extension to all nuclearweapon 
States of the verification of fissile material 
removed from military applications; an end to the production of fissile material for weapons; 
the safe operation of all nuclear reactors and the adoption of effective strategies for spent fuel 
and radioactive waste management; and expansion of the use of nuclear science and 
technology to meet critical human development goals. He would comment on each of those 
milestones, which the United States was helping to attain in accordance with its fundamental 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 8 


belief in fulfilling its nonproliferation 
and arms control commitments and in using the atom to 
promote world peace, prosperity and health. 


22. As regards barriers against proliferation, the Agency had in 1997 taken a momentous 
step with the completion of the Programme 93+2 Model Protocol. Having commended the 
Secretariat, its leader and the Member States which had worked together in bringing about 
approval of the new instrument, he said that it was now incumbent upon all concerned to 
ensure that it entered into force as soon as possible. The United States, for its part, would 
begin by applying all the new provisions on an experimental basis at the Argonne National 
Laboratory. Furthermore, it was planning to begin negotiating its protocol with the Agency at 
the beginning of 1998. 
23. The 1994 United States DPRK 
Agreed Framework had effectively frozen the 
sensitive elements of the DPRK's nuclear programme. In that context, the United States was 
leading the effort directed towards the safe storage of the DPRK's plutoniumbearing 
spent 
fuel, which was under Agency safeguards. The work would probably be completed by the end 
of 1997, thanks in large part to a partnership which the United States had with the Agency. 
Such a partnership was essential for dealing with a challenge which all were now facing the 
possible acquisition of nuclear weapons by terrorist groups. The Agency had an important 
role to play in preventing the smuggling of nuclear materials, and its efforts should be 
supported. The eight countries which had participated in the June 1997 Denver Summit had 
announced their collective determination to prevent the smuggling and theft of nuclear 
materials and all forms of nuclear terrorism. The United States would like to see all countries 
cooperating 
in ensuring that nuclear materials could not be stolen, diverted or used 
unlawfully. In a related effort, the United States had been cooperating 
with Russia and other 
countries since 1994 in upgrading the security of tons of weaponsusable 
nuclear materials. 
24. As regards the reduction of nuclear stockpiles, the United States and Russia had made 
considerable progress in fulfilling their arms control commitments. START I and II, once fully 
implemented, would reduce the strategic nuclear arsenals of the United States and Russia by 
about 70% from their Cold War peaks. Moreover, at the Helsinki Summit in March, the two 
countries had agreed on a framework for negotiations on START III, which would lead to a 
further reduction in nuclear forces and, for the first time, provide for the destruction of 
strategic warheads, making reductions irreversible. The United States looked forward to 
beginning the negotiations on START III as soon as START II entered into force. It hoped 
that the other nuclearweapon 
States would soon join it in what was a vitally important task. 
25. With regard to the third milestone, in accordance with its commitment to arms control 
and nonproliferation 
the United States was making every effort to ensure that its excess fissile 
material was never used again in weapons. Since 1995, it had declared more than 225 tons of 
fissile material as excess to its defence requirements, and President Clinton had given an 
undertaking that the material would never be used again in the manufacture of nuclear 
weapons. Twelve metric tons of that excess material were currently under Agency safeguards, 
and in 1996 the United States had undertaken to make 26 metric tons more available for 
inspection. Also, an additional 52 metric tons of plutonium and highly enriched uranium no 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 9 


longer in military use could soon be inspected by the Agency. Russia was likewise making 
progress in that area. The two countries were working with the Agency on the development 
of new techniques for verifying fissile material from nuclear weapons. However, he would like 
to see progress being made not only by the United States and Russia. All five nuclearweapon 
States had a responsibility to submit their excess fissile material to Agency inspections. 


26. He therefore hoped that all of them would remove from their military programmes a 
specific quantity of fissile material, never to be used again for military purposes. 
27. In order to make the world a safer place for future generations, it was also necessary 
to ensure that fissile material from dismantled nuclear weapons was managed safely and 
securely. That was a shared responsibility of all in an area where the United States and Russia 
were working hard. In accordance with an agreement that the two countries had concluded, 
over the next 20 years the United States would purchase from Russia approximately 
500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons which 
would be blended down and used in power reactors; that was the equivalent of more than 
20 000 nuclear weapons. The United States had previously undertaken to withdraw 
174 metric tons of excess highly enriched uranium from military use, and the Agency would 
shortly begin to inspect much of the blendeddown 
material for 
the first time verifying that 
fissile material from a nuclearweapon 
State's military sector, where it had signified death and 
destruction, had been converted into fuel for use in lighting homes and powering factories. 
28. Over the next 20 years, the United States and Russia would be faced with the task of 
managing, safely and securely, the vast quantities of plutonium freed by reductions in nuclear 
weapons. The United States, which had announced its intention to use two methods in 
disposing of excess plutonium, believed that those two methods namely, 
use in reactors and 
immobilization could 
serve its nonproliferation 
and global security objectives. 
29. In addition to reducing stockpiles and controlling excess fissile material, it was 
imperative to put a stop to the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. The 
negotiation of a fissile material cutoff 
treaty was a crucial and long overdue task. For that 
reason, his delegation regretted that the Conference on Disarmament had failed to launch 
negotiations on such a treaty; it hoped that the Agency's fortieth anniversary would lead to a 
breakthrough. Despite the current stalemate, progress had been made towards attainment of 
the treaty's objectives. The previous week, the United States and Russia had concluded, 
within the framework of the GoreChernomyrdin 
Commission, an agreement which would end 
the production of weaponsgrade 
plutonium. They had also concluded an agreement on 
cooperation 
in converting the three Russian reactors which were still producing weaponsgrade 
plutonium. 
30. The United States believed that nuclear science had great potential. When planning for 
the future, however, it was necessary to learn from the past. In that context, nuclear safety 
and environmental management should be a focus of concern. The Agency should continue to 
play a key role in the international efforts to ensure high levels of nuclear safety at commercial 
nuclear power plants throughout the world. The Convention on Nuclear Safety had marked 
an important step in that regard, and the United States, which was supporting the efforts to 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 10 


achieve the widest possible adherence to it, intended to become a Contracting Party in the near 
future. The United States was already collaborating in the international community's efforts 
to address one of the world's most pressing nuclear safety concerns the 
need to improve the 
safety of nuclear power plants in several countries of Central and Eastern Europe, including 
Ukraine. He and Russia's Minister for Nuclear Energy, Mr. Victor Mikhailov, would that day 
be signing an agreement on cooperation 
in dealing with international safety issues. 


31. The Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage would enable 
better use to be made of the technical resources available in countries where reactors were in 
operation. The Convention was part of a broad effort to improve nuclear safety throughout 
the world, and the United States hoped that other countries would join in becoming 
signatories. 
32. The historic initiative taken by the G7 
and Ukraine with a view to ensuring the safety 
and stability of the ageing Chernobyl sarcophagus was a further demonstration of a joint 
commitment to nuclear safety. At the Denver Summit, the G7 
had pledged US $300 million 
in support of what was to be a $750 million effort. A pledging conference at which 
consideration would be given to ways of raising the outstanding amount was to be held in 
November in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly's current session. The 
United States hoped that other Agency Member States would also support the initiative. 
33. It was essential to remain capable of ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors. Growing 
populations and rising standards of living in the world meant an everincreasing 
demand for 
energy. Nuclear power could play a significant role in helping to meet that demand and 
in 
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. However, concerted action was necessary in order to 
meet the environmental challenges associated with nuclear power generation. In particular, 
the nuclear community must remain committed to the effective management of radioactive 
waste and spent fuel. The international standards enshrined in the recently adopted Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management attested to its determination to promote a culture of nuclear safety, and he 
therefore hoped that many other delegates would join him in signing the Convention during 
the current week. 
34. The United States, which was committed to using the atom to promote world peace, 
prosperity and health, was the single largest donor to the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. It supported the Partners in Development approach because it believed that 
nuclear science and its numerous applications had great potential. However, one should never 
forget that the peaceful utilization of the atom carried with it a tremendous responsibility the 
responsibility to ensure that the atom was not used to cause harm. The international 
community had shown that it was capable of shouldering that responsibility by concluding, 
after almost 40 years, the negotiations on the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty 
(CTBT), which would help to end proliferation and to prevent further advances in the 
development of nuclear stockpiles around the world. 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 11 


35. The 146 countries which had joined the United States in signing the CTBT were to be 
commended. The previous week, President Clinton had announced that he would be sending 
the CTBT to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. All the countries 
represented at the General Conference's current session would, he hoped, ratify the CTBT 
soon so that it might enter into force with a minimum of delay. Despite the significant 
progress made since the first session of the General Conference, there was still much to be 
done. In urging the Agency to continue its mission, he pledged the continuation of his 
country's mission the 
fulfilment of nonproliferation 
and arms control commitments and 
utilization of the atom to promote world peace, prosperity and health. 
36. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) said he wished first of all to 
thank Dr. Blix for all he had done during his 16 years at the helm of the Agency and to 
congratulate the new Director General, whose experience would undoubtedly prove useful to 
the Agency in the pursuit of its goals, particularly for the benefit of the developing and the 
Islamic world. The Islamic Republic of Iran would do its best to support him. 
37. The international community was facing momentous issues. Contrary to expectations, 
the end of the Cold War had not terminated the arms race, and regional conflicts persisted. 
Although the threat of nuclear Power confrontation had been eliminated, complete nuclear 
disarmament had not been achieved. The Superpowers had not turned all their fissile material 
into nuclear fuel, and some States had even made the implementation of disarmament treaties 
conditional on other issues. Nuclear tests were continuing despite the Comprehensive 
NuclearTestBan 
Treaty, and the NPT was not being fully implemented, although 
some 180 countries had signed it. With the world's population and the developing countries' 
needs growing, the end of the Cold War should have led to an era of nuclear energy utilization 
by all for peaceful purposes and without obstacles or discrimination. Yet the utilization of 
nuclear energy, which was more indispensable now than ever before, was fraught with political 
obstacles. 
38. Under such circumstances, the Islamic Republic of Iran believed that a clear dividing 
line should be drawn between the use of nuclear technology and the production of nuclear 
material for nuclear weapons manufacturing, on one hand, and for peaceful purposes, on the 
other. With regard to nuclear disarmament, the NPT should be enforced scrupulously and 
equitably for all. The Agency should monitor and report regularly on its implementation by 
the nuclearweapon 
States, which had committed themselves to dismantling their nuclear 
weapons within a given time period. The Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty should be 
made universal and its defects eliminated, and the other nuclear disarmament treaties should be 
implemented as well. The Agency's safeguards system should be improved and strengthened, 
and related treaties concluded under the Agency's auspices should be observed by all Member 
States. That would eliminate the threat of undetected programmes not under Agency 
safeguards and make possible the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, which was less 
polluting to the environment. Finally, with regard to nuclear technology, the Agency was the 
best organization for organizing its transfer to developing countries; the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
programme should therefore be expanded. 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 12 


39. In all those areas, the Agency's mission was clear: it should adapt and respond 
effectively to changes in the world at large. Among its main tasks were efficient management 
of the world's peaceful utilization of nuclear technology and support for the cause of nuclear 
disarmament. Careful regulation in that connection was indispensable in order to avoid 
discrimination against certain States while the actions of certain others were ignored. 
40. The Agency's role must therefore be strengthened in the following fields: the 
dissemination of nuclear technology, the formulation of guidelines and the provision of 
consultative services; the enhancing of safeguards so that no State abiding by its safeguards 
obligation was deprived of the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
nonproliferation 
was ensured and a true nuclear safety culture was created; the transfer of 
nuclear technology to the developing world; the adoption and implementation of binding 
conventions such as the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage; the 
application of safeguards to nuclear materials and the prevention of illicit trafficking; the 
management of nuclear waste; informationgathering, 
so that the Agency no longer had to 
rely on the technical facilities of certain of its Member States and a stop could be put to 
disinformation campaigns against some Member States. 
41. The objectives of the Iranian nuclear programme were peaceful. In the past, the 
Agency had conducted many inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities, and its conclusions had 
always been to that effect. Following a recent visit, in July 1997, the Director General had 
once again announced that the Iranian nuclear programme was a peaceful, civilian programme. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran was a party to the NPT, and its nuclear programme excluded 
military uses of nuclear technology. The objective was for 20% of the country's electricity to 
be generated in 20 years' time by nuclear power plants. The Bushehr plant would produce 
1000 megawatts, and the Russian Federation, which was assisting with its construction, had 
undertaken to apply Agency standards at all construction stages. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran, which was using nuclear techniques in agriculture, industry and medicine, was 
participating in the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme and seeking to ensure a high 
standard of radiation safety in the various nuclear applications. Finally, it was cooperating 
closely with the Agency in the safety area and with other developing countries in the 
acquisition of peaceful nuclear knowhow 
for the benefit of mankind. 
42. The Islamic Republic of Iran had ratified or was in the process of ratifying the NPT, 
the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty, the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material, the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention, and the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
43. All States had an indisputable right to use the latest technology in the interests of their 
populations. Energy was central to the world economy, and every State needed to diversify its 
energy sources. The use of nuclear power plants should be considered in that light. 
Unfortunately, some nuclear States had engaged in disinformation campaigns against other 
countries, making accusations about their nuclear programmes. The Agency should take an 
unambiguous stand on that issue. It should gather information itself, rather than relying on 
certain States' technical facilities. It was not logical that the Islamic Republic of Iran, which 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 13 


respected all its commitments visavis 
the Agency, should be the subject of accusations. The 
Agency should be fair and should clearly announce its conclusions about the nuclear 
programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, one of its Member States. 


44. Among the factors strengthening the NPT regime was the establishment of 
nuclearweaponfree 
zones like those in Africa and SouthEast 
Asia. In 1974, his country had 
been the first to call for the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East, one of the 
strategically most important parts of the world. Israel had not been cooperative 
in that 
regard, rejecting Agency safeguards and refusing to become a party to the NPT. It had thus 
turned its back on the international community and world public opinion. How could a 
country which rejected responsibility for its nuclear programme impose itself on the Middle 
East and South Asia (MESA) Group when members of the Group were seeking to establish a 
nuclearweaponfree 
zone? As to the United States, it had been supporting Israel and 
approving its acts of aggression, thereby destroying peace and security in the Middle East. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran was very much in favour of the establishment of a 
nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East provided that Israel complied with all of the 
Agency's requirements. 
45. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy were an excellent basis for international 
cooperation 
and integration. Harnessing the atom's power under Agency safeguards was one 
of the avenues to global peace and security. As a Member State, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
had consistently cooperated 
in the implementation of the resolutions adopted by the Agency's 
policymaking 
organs and would continue to do so. In that connection, it believed that the 
Agency would succeed in attaining its goals only if those resolutions were implemented by all 
Member States equitably and without the intrusion of political considerations. Double 
standards would only harm the Agency. The reason why some international organizations 
with responsibilities in the field of peace and security had not been very successful was that 
they were overly politicized. The Agency's main goal was too important to be the subject of 
politics. He hoped that at its current session the General Conference, committed solely to the 
interests of the global family, would open up new horizons for the fair and peaceful utilization 
of nuclear energy by all Member States of the Agency. 
46. Mr. SCHÜSSEL (Austria), referring to the fortieth anniversary of the 
Agency's foundation, said that the Agency could look back on 40 years of remarkable 
achievements in the service of the international community. The Agency had contributed 
greatly to the maintenance of international security through nonproliferation, 
and its activities 
in the field of nuclear safety deserved the highest praise. Also, it was considered to be an 
international organization operating to the highest standards of efficiency. Accordingly, 
Austria congratulated the Agency and all its present and former staff members. Being host 
country to the Agency was a source of pride for Austria, which was sure that the Agency 
would play an increasingly important role in the years to come. However, its model 
organization status should never be taken for granted. The Agency with 
its constantly 
evolving activities, particularly in the safeguards area should 
never abandon the process of 
adaptation and selfexamination. 
It was in that spirit that Austria would on 20 October be 
hosting a symposium in 
Vienna on 
the future role of the Agency. 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 14 


47. Austria was profoundly grateful to Dr. Blix for the way in which he had managed the 
affairs of the Agency, whose present position was due in large measure to his efforts. He 
hoped that Dr. Blix would maintain his close ties not only with the Agency but also with 
Austria. At the same time, he was happy that Dr. ElBaradei, an international lawyer of great 
repute and proven administrative ability, would soon be taking up the duties of Director 
General. His many years of experience within the Agency were a guarantee of continuing 
efficiency combined with innovation. 
48. The position of the Member States of the European Union would be presented by the 
delegate of Luxembourg. Austria shared that position without reservation, so he would 
confine himself to some remarks on matters of particular interest to his own country. First of 
all, nuclear arms control and disarmament were items of utmost priority on the international 
agenda. Events like the Helsinki Summit, which had opened up the perspective of a rapid 
entry into force of START II and a beginning of negotiations on START III, or the recent 
breakthrough in distinguishing between strategic and tactical antiballistic 
missile defence 
systems in the context of the ABM Treaty were regarded by Austria as important steps 
towards an objective which was for all: the total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
49. The Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty (CTBT), designed to play a crucial role 
in countering both vertical and horizontal proliferation, had already been signed by over 140 
States. After the conclusion of its relevant constitutional procedures, Austria would soon be 
joining the seven countries which had already ratified that key instrument. He was pleased 
that Vienna had been chosen as the hub of the CTBT system. The fact that the Agency had its 
Headquarters in Vienna had played a decisive role in that choice, and there was no doubt that 
the Agency and the fixture Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty Organization (CTBTO) 
would benefit greatly from being situated close to each other through 
having common 
support services and through synergies resulting from cooperation. 
The Provisional 
Technical Secretariat of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO now had the task of 
setting up the international monitoring system foreseen by the CTBT. As the system would in 
many ways be quite unlike any verification system set up hitherto, the task was an 
extraordinarily challenging one. However, the Provisional Technical Secretariat, with the 
support of experts from a large number of signatory States, had already made remarkable 
progress. Austria was convinced that early completion of that task would make for 
comprehensive implementation of the CTBT and its timely entry into force. 
50. Important for the attainment of nonproliferation 
objectives were the Model Protocol 
extending the Agency's safeguards system adopted 
at the end of Programme 93+2 and 
the 
hoped for negotiations on a convention banning the production of weaponsgrade 
fissile 
material. Austria considered Programme 93+2 to have been an unprecedented victory in the 
cause of nonproliferation. 
The present safeguards system had made an important contribution 
to nonproliferation, 
but the international community had had to acknowledge at the beginning 
of the 1990s that it was possible for an extensive nuclear weapons programme to remain 
undetected for years despite the application of traditional safeguards. Programme 93+2, by 
widening the scope of safeguards to encompass all aspects of national nuclear programmes 
and not just those directly involving fissile material, had provided the right answer to the 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 15 


problem. The Secretariat was to be commended for having elaborated what had been an 
excellent programme and also for its unceasing activities within the framework of the present 
safeguards system; it had made an indispensable contribution to international security and 
stability. Austria was participating very actively, with its European Union partners, in working 
out modalities for the speedy conclusion of additional protocols by the Agency, the Member 
States of the European Union and EURATOM. 


51. The Agency's safeguards system, as efficient as it was or would be, nevertheless 
needed to be complemented by export control regimes like those applied by the Zangger 
Committee or the Nuclear Suppliers Group. With a view to promoting greater transparency, a 
seminar on the role of export controls in nuclear nonproliferation 
was due to be held soon in 
Vienna; it would undoubtedly be most instructive. 
52. It was impossible to discuss nuclear nonproliferation 
without mentioning the dangers 
inherent in illicit trafficking in nuclear materials by nonState 
entities. The Agency was to be 
highly commended for addressing that phenomenon, which was of increasing concern to all 
States. In the context of Agency activities relating to it, the Austrian Government had recently 
asked the Austrian Research Centre Seibersdorf to carry out a pilot study on border 
monitoring systems; upon completion of the study, the results would be presented to the 
Agency as a contribution in kind. 
53. The dangers associated with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy were rightfully 
receiving ever greater attention all over the world. Austria very much appreciated the broad 
range of activities undertaken by the Agency in relation to nuclear safety, such as the 
extrabudgetary programme on the safety of WWER nuclear power plants, to which it had 
contributed both in kind and financially. The elaboration of a system of legally binding 
international instruments concerning nuclear safety at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle was 
one of the chief objectives of Austrian foreign policy. Austria had renounced the nuclear 
power option, but it was exposed to the risks posed by the numerous nuclear installations 
located both in close proximity to and at some distance from its borders. The Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, which had entered into force in October 1996, could be considered the 
cornerstone of the system of international norms which Austria wished to see established. 
Austria attached particular importance to the peer reviews provided for in the Convention and 
in the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. Reviews of Contracting Parties' implementation reports 
were essential for ensuring that the objectives of the Convention on Nuclear Safety were 
achieved. Austria had recently joined the approximately 40 States which had ratified the 
Convention, and it hoped that many more States would ratify the Convention in the very near 
future. 
54. The adoption in Vienna, under the Agency's auspices, of the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had 
been a further step forward in the development of international nuclear law. The Convention 
on Nuclear Safety covered only the safety of nuclear reactor operations, whereas the Joint 
Convention subjected most other aspects of civil nuclear activities to an international regime 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 16 


which, thanks to the constant scrutiny of national safety measures, would help to improve 
international standards. Austria was particularly pleased that the Joint Convention also took 
into account the interests of States located very close to sites covered by that instrument; 
nevertheless, it expected that the development of convergent national safety standards would 
lead to the adoption of legally binding international standards for nuclear safety in general. 
The work of the Agency in that sphere provided an excellent starting point. Moreover, the 
scope of future negotiations should include military installations and those parts of the nuclear 
fuel cycle which were not yet covered by binding international rules. 


55. Turning to the recent adoption of the Protocol to amend the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation 
for Nuclear Damage, he said that in his country's view the main result of the amendment of 
the Vienna Convention was that the amount for which operators were liable in the event of a 
nuclear accident had increased to 300 million SDRs. That constituted progress, but even such 
a higher amount was only symbolic when viewed against, for instance, the damage caused by 
the Chernobyl accident on Austrian territory alone. At the same time, Austria attached great 
importance to the fact that environmental damage was now covered. The Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage was a further significant step in the 
development of international nuclear law in that it provided for the establishment, after a 
nuclear accident, of a fund to be financed by contributions from all the Contracting Parties. 
Austria welcomed the fact that the Convention stipulated that States should contribute to that 
fund in accordance with their nuclear capacities and that at least 50% of the fund would be 
available for the reparation of damage suffered outside the territory of the State in which the 
nuclear accident had occurred. Ultimately, the success of those two new instruments would 
depend largely on whether and when the main producers of nuclear power became Contracting 
Parties; the norms reflected in the two instruments would gain broad international acceptance 
only if those countries did become Contracting Parties. Before all nuclear damage was 
covered there would have to be further progress in international law. 
56. The Agency's technical cooperation 
programme encompassed very diverse elements 
reflecting differences in geography, climate, state of development and regional conditions. 
Austria attached great importance to those aspects of the programme which related to food 
and agriculture, health care, environmental protection, water resources, irrigation and at 
the 
forefront of its concerns given the nuclear power plants near its borders safety. 
57. In conclusion, he said that the Agency could look to the future with confidence. The 
aforementioned international symposium, to be held under the auspices of the Austrian 
Government should offer an opportunity to review the past achievements of the Agency and 
also the challenges likely to face it in the future. 
58. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) speaking 
on behalf of the European Union and 
the associated countries Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia said 
that the General Conference was 
meeting in a particularly solemn atmosphere as it was celebrating the fortieth anniversary of 
the Agency and also witnessing the handover 
of power from Dr. Blix to Dr. ElBaradei. The 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 17 


achievements of the Agency had been extraordinary, in both quantity and quality, and the time 
had now come to build on them while exploring new fields of endeavour. 


59. Dr. Blix had been the main author of those achievements, of which the Agency could 
be proud. With his energy, his human qualities, his great enthusiasm and his authority, he 
would be leaving a permanent imprint on the Agency. He deserved the congratulations and 
gratitude of all for the great services rendered by him. The succession would be difficult, but 
Dr. ElBaradei, who had proved his worth within the Agency, could count on the support of 
the European Union and associated countries in his efforts to maintain the great prestige and 
dynamism of the Agency and its effectiveness in the service of its Member States. Thanking 
Austria for the warm welcome and hospitality accorded by it to Member States, he said that 
the European Union was sure that Austria would continue with its greatly appreciated support 
for the Agency. 
60. For the European Union, the NPT remained the cornerstone of the international 
nonproliferation 
regime. The European Union welcomed the fact that since the General 
Conference's previous session Angola, Djibouti and Oman had acceded to the NPT and Brazil 
had expressed its intention to do so. The European Union, which was still calling for universal 
accession to the NPT, would like those States which had not yet done so to accede to the 
NPT and conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. The European 
Union had welcomed the important decisions taken in 1995 by the NPT Review and Extension 
Conference regarding the indefinite extension of the NPT, the "Principles and Objectives for 
Nuclear Nonproliferation 
and Disarmament" and "Strengthening the Review Process for the 
Treaty". It had also welcomed the generally very constructive atmosphere at the first session 
of the committee which had the task of preparing for the next NPT review conference, to be 
held in the year 2000, and was pleased with the results of that session. In the light of those 
results, the European Union intended to pursue the consideration of both procedural and 
substantive matters at the second session of the preparatory committee, and it hoped that all 
States would join in. 
61. The adoption and signing of the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty (CTBT) by 
146 States had been another major contribution to the prevention of nuclear weapons 
proliferation and to the process of nuclear disarmament. The international community should 
now intensify its efforts to attain the four following highpriority 
objectives: universality of 
the NPT, the accession of as many States as possible to the CTBT, the immediate opening and 
rapid conclusion of negotiations on a convention banning the production of fissile material for 
nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices, and the implementation of Article VI of 
the NPT (relating to nuclear disarmament). 
62. Referring to the very important results achieved by the Agency since the fortieth 
session of the General Conference, he said that the adoption by the Board of Governors on 
15 May 1997 of a Model Protocol designed to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the 
efficiency of the safeguards system, mainly with a view to the detection of undeclared nuclear 
activities, had been a remarkable success. Although developing the Model Protocol had been 
a very delicate and difficult task, the committee requested by the Board of Governors to draft 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 18 


the text had succeeded, under the enlightened and efficient Chairmanship of 
Ambassador Walker, in completing the job rapidly. The European Union was grateful to all 
those Agency Member States which had contributed to the work on the Model Protocol, 
which opened a new era in the field of nuclear nonproliferation. 
Within the European Union, 
there was strong determination to conclude additional protocols with the Agency as soon as 
possible. To that end, the European Union had begun preparatory work which was already 
well advanced and would soon be completed. It would like to see all Agency Member States 
displaying the same willingness so that additional protocols might soon become as universal a 
reality as possible. 


63. Another major event had been the Convention on Nuclear Safety's entry into force on 
24 October 1996, three months after ratification or acceptance by 22 States, 17 of them 
possessing at least one power reactor. A preparatory meeting in April 1997 had established 
the rules of procedure to be followed by the Contracting Parties at regular meetings to review 
national reports on the measures that each Contracting Party was talcing in order to comply 
with each of the safety obligations set out in the Convention meetings 
which were another 
strong point of the Convention. The European Union was sure that the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, with the regular meetings to review national safety reports, would contribute 
significantly to the general strengthening of nuclear power plant safety around the world. It 
would like all States to accede to the Convention soon and without reservations, particularly 
the States with nuclear power plants. 
64. The adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, drafted under the capable and effective 
leadership of Professor Baer, had been still another major event, both from the point of view 
of the protection of mankind and the environment and from the point of view of public 
opinion. The European Union welcomed the fact that the Convention covered the safety of 
spent fuel management in addition to the safety of radioactive waste management. Its main 
significance lay in the fact that it obliged all Contracting Parties to manage their spent fuel and 
radioactive waste in accordance with safety criteria which guaranteed, at the various stages of 
management, that individuals, society and the environment would be adequately protected 
against radiological risks, both now and during the lives of future generations. The European 
Union particularly welcomed the fact that two of its members owning spent fuel reprocessing 
facilities had declared at the Diplomatic Conference which had adopted the Convention that 
they would report voluntarily on reprocessing as a spent fuel management activity under the 
terms of the Convention. The European Union considered that the obligations set out in the 
Convention were appropriate to a high level of responsibility and nuclear safety culture. It 
hoped that all States would have acceded to the Convention before long. 
65. The European Union had noted with satisfaction the adoption of the Protocol to 
amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and, of the Convention 
on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. Those two new legal instruments the 
result of long, intensive and difficult negotiations inevitably 
represented a compromise. 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 19 


66. The European Union had consistently played a very active role in the Agency's 
technical cooperation 
activities, giving priority to multilateral and bilateral assistance designed 
to enable developing countries to benefit from all applications of nuclear technology and thus 
contributing to the general development of those countries. It approved in particular of the 
Model Projects which were part of the technical cooperation 
programme and met high 
standards of quality and effectiveness. Also, it welcomed the high rates of implementation of 
Agency technical cooperation 
projects. Member States and the Secretariat should do all they 
could to maintain or 
even increase the 
momentum achieved. 
67. The European Union was very much in favour of international cooperation 
in the 
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. Not surprisingly, therefore, it had suggested the holding 
of a Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) seminar on transparency in order to explain to interested 
States the policy pursued by the NSG, whose only aim was to promote the peaceful 
development of nuclear technology. The seminar was taking place on 7 and 8 October 1997. 
68. Although the achievements of the Agency since the previous session of the General 
Conference had been remarkable, the picture was not a completely rosy one. There remained 
problems with the implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between the Agency and 
the DPRK, and the European Union continued to be deeply concerned about the fact that the 
DPRK had not yet provided the Agency with all the information required for verifying that the 
DPRK had not diverted nuclear materials for illicit purposes and that its initial declaration was 
correct and complete. The DPRK's refusal to cooperate 
was contrary to the legal obligations 
accepted by the DPRK in the safeguards agreement which it had concluded with the Agency. 
As the European Union had stated on previous occasions, the DPRK must react positively to 
the profound concerns expressed by Agency Member States, finally honour its safeguards 
commitments and cooperate 
fully with the Director General. 
69. Because of a the lack of cooperation 
on the part of Iraq, the Agency's Action Team 
had not been able to complete its investigatory activities in that country. The fact that the 
Agency could not fully implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707, 715 and 1051 was a 
matter of grave concern to the European Union. The European Union had taken note of the 
letter which Iraq's Minister of Foreign Affairs had sent to the Director General on 1 May 1997 
and in which he had given assurances regarding the compliance of Iraq with its obligations 
under the NPT and the safeguards agreement concluded by it with the Agency. The European 
Union would like to see the assurances given by the Minister of Foreign Affairs translated into 
action in 
their totality and without delay. It was essential that the Action Team receive from 
Iraq all the information it required in order to carry out in full the investigations called for in 
the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
70. For several years, Member States had been considering the question of a possible 
revision of Article VI of the Agency's Statute. Essentially, three issues were involved: the 
number of members of the Board of Governors, the criteria for the designation of Board 
members and the composition of the regional groups. The European Union could accept only 
a balanced and lasting solution which would resolve all three issues. Such a solution would 
have to provide for an increase in the number of Board members while taking into account the 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 20 


need to maintain the Board's effectiveness and efficiency, for a redefinition of the designation 
criteria and for guarantees that each Member State could belong to the regional group 
corresponding to the geographical region where it was located. In accordance with the 
principles of fairness and justice, no Member State should be deprived of the possibility of 
serving on the Board as an elected member of a regional group. The European Union could 
therefore accept the proposal put forward by the Chairman of the Board of Governors a 
compromise proposal which would resolve the various issues relating to Article VT of the 
Statute. 


71. In conclusion, he said that the European Union and associated countries would give 
the Agency their full, active support and help to guide it towards new horizons under the 
leadership of its new Director General. 
72. Ms. BENKHADRA (Morocco), having welcomed the approval of Malta and 
Burkina Faso for membership of the Agency, said that the fortieth anniversary of the Statute's 
entry into force provided an opportunity to assess the progress made in strengthening 
international peace and the results obtained in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. 
73. Morocco was committed to the principles of international law and to the strengthening 
of regional peace, as shown by its accession to the NPT and the Pelindaba Treaty and by its 
having concluded a fullscope 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. Moreover, Morocco 
was ready to enter into negotiations with the Agency regarding the conclusion of a protocol 
additional to that fullscope 
safeguards agreement. At the same time, Morocco would like to 
see the Agency doing all it could to achieve universality of the NPT and working for general 
disarmament through the provision of appropriate assurances to States that did not possess 
nuclear weapons, particularly in the Middle East; that would reinforce the security also of 
African countries. The credibility of the safeguards system depended not so much on its 
capacity for exposing nondeclared 
nuclear activities as on its comprehensive and equitable 
application for the purpose of maintaining and strengthening international peace and security 
and thereby fostering mutual trust among neighbouring States. Accordingly, States should 
permit no exceptions to the rule of international law in such matters. 
74. The arduous tasks awaiting the Agency required the elaboration of plans and strategies 
for dealing with numerous problems, such as those caused by illicit trafficking in nuclear 
materials and other radioactive sources. Morocco was determined to work with the 
Secretariat and other Member States in combating that phenomenon, whose consequences 
could be so damaging to world peace and security. 
75. Morocco welcomed the achievements of the Agency and Member States in developing 
binding international agreements on nuclear safety, civil liability for nuclear damage and 
radioactive waste management. Morocco had just signed the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol 
to amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, important instruments aimed at ensuring 
the transfer of technology and nuclear materials for peaceful purposes with no adverse effects 
on the environment or health. During the Diplomatic Conference which had adopted the Joint 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 21 


Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, Morocco had spoken in particular about those provisions of the Joint 
Convention which related to the need to notify transit countries of any transport of radioactive 
waste concerning them. Morocco would like to see the Joint Convention supplemented as 
soon as possible by a convention on the safe transboundary transport of radioactive waste and 
hoped that a working group would be established for that purpose in the near future. 


76. As the strengthening of technical cooperation 
activities in the nuclear field with a view 
to promoting peace and development was one of the Agency's fundamental objectives, 
Morocco advocated not only Model Projects and other projects having an economic and social 
impact but also the development of mediumterm 
country programmes for using nuclear 
technology to promote development. 
77. As part of the efforts being made by it to strengthen its scientific and technical 
infrastructure in the nuclear field, Morocco had, inter alia, established a national radiation 
protection centre, a centre for nuclear studies and a facility for the irradiation of foodstuffs and 
had carried out studies and research with a view to the construction of a pilot plant for nuclear 
desalination. Other African countries were welcome to draw on the services of the national 
radiation protection centre within the context of AFRA. In addition, Morocco had embarked 
on the development of a legislative framework for nuclear activities, basing itself on the 
relevant international instruments which had been adopted. With regard to regional 
cooperation 
in Africa, Morocco welcomed the fact that the Agency was now focusing on the 
most pressing economic and social needs of Member States. In that connection, mention 
should be made of seawater desalination and sewage treatment using nuclear energy, the 
rehabilitation of arid and semiarid 
zones, the combating of locusts and other agricultural 
pests, food irradiation and nuclear safety. 
78. Putting nuclear energy to work for peace could help to remove two formidable 
obstacles to development: water shortages and energy shortages. The availability of water 
was especially critical for many countries, particularly in the Middle East and northern Africa, 
where the demand for water was rising constantly as a result of population growth and 
industrial and agricultural development. Hence the urgent need to formulate common 
strategies for coping with water shortages. That being a priority for Morocco, water had been 
the subject of an international symposium held under the auspices of King Hassan II in 
Marrakesh on 21 and 22 March 1997. At the end of the symposium, the participants had 
appealed to governments, international organizations, NGOs and the peoples of the entire 
world to work together in conformity with the Dublin Principles and Chapter 18 of Agenda 21 
with a view to launching a "blue revolution". Morocco welcomed the recommendations 
adopted at the end of the international symposium held in the Republic of Korea with Agency 
assistance. Also, it was looking forward to the contribution to be made by the Agency in its 
area of competence at the international meeting on water which the World Bank was planning 
to hold in the coming months. 

GC(41)/OR2 
page 22 


79. With regard to the question of amending Article VI of the Statute, she said that, as a 
result of changes on the international political scene and of scientific and technological 
progress, a revision of the composition of the governing bodies of a great many international 
organizations, including the Agency's Board of Governors, was necessary. Morocco 
considered that the proposal put forward by Sudan and 
supported by the Middle East and 
South Asia Group and by the Group of 77 constituted 
a formula that would rectify the 
present situation, ensuring the equitable and democratic representation of all regions within the 
Board of Governors and thereby reinforcing the credibility of international instruments 
originating with the Board. In any event, the question must be resolved by consensus, since it 
was for regional groups first and foremost to decide on their own composition and on the way 
in which their work was coordinated. 
80. Mr. SookIl 
KWUN (Republic of Korea), having commended Dr. Blix and the 
Agency's Secretariat on their hard work during the past year, said that his delegation was 
profoundly grateful to Dr. Blix for his dedicated service to the Agency over the past 16 years. 
Under his leadership, the Agency had grown into one of the most competent international 
organizations, and his contributions to the Agency would be long remembered by all. Also, he 
extended warm congratulations to Dr. ElBaradei on his appointment as Director General of 
the Agency. 
81. In the four decades of its existence, the Agency had played a significant role in 
promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. It had been generally recognized 
throughout the world that the use of nuclear energy for power generation and the application 
of nuclear techniques in medicine, industry and agriculture had helped to improve the quality 
of life. At the same time, however, the world had witnessed some setbacks when proper care 
had not been taken, as in the case of the Chernobyl accident. For that reason, the 
establishment of a global nuclear safety mechanism, as represented by the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, was of great significance. The Republic of Korea had welcomed the adoption, 
at recent diplomatic conferences, of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, of the Protocol to amend 
the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. He was sure that those international 
conventions would enhance nuclear safety culture worldwide. 
82. In the field of nonproliferation 
there had been significant accomplishments, such as the 
indefinite extension of the NPT. The Agency's safeguards system had evolved and been 
continuously strengthened in the past decades. The need for a still stronger system clearly 
brought out by events in Iraq and the DPRK had 
led to the adoption of the Model Protocol 
additional to safeguards agreements. With those recent favourable developments, the 
international community could enter the twentyfirst 
century with more confidence. It was 
now better prepared for the challenges that awaited in the next millennium. 
83. The Government of the Republic of Korea was greatly worried about the planned 
transboundary movement of radioactive waste from Taiwan to the DPRK, an issue with 
implications not only for the Korean Peninsula but also for neighbouring countries. At the 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 23 


Board's session in March 1997, his delegation had commented on that issue in detail and 
expressed its serious concern. The Board had duly taken note of the concerns expressed by a 
number of Member States in that regard. Since then, similar concerns had repeatedly been 
voiced in various international forums. The position of his Government remained firm: it was 
against the irresponsible deal in question, which simply must be called off Taiwan 
and 
the DPRK must cancel their plans. In that regard, his delegation looked forward to the early 
entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management, and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, a longawaited 
convention which would greatly 
contribute to the effective control of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. He had 
had the privilege of signing the Joint Convention that very morning on behalf of the 
Government of the Republic of Korea. 


84. His Government, which had consistently supported the efforts of the Agency to 
strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of its safeguards system, welcomed the 
adoption by the Board of Governors in May 1997 of the Model Protocol additional to 
safeguards agreements. It would make every effort to incorporate the provisions of the Model 
Protocol into its laws and regulations so that they might be implemented soon. In 
August 1997, the Republic of Korea had launched a national inspection system a 
system 
separate from the one operated by the Agency in 
order to enhance the transparency of its 
nuclear activities. His Government hoped that the national inspection system would help to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency's safeguards system. 
85. His country was doing a great deal to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, not 
only in power generation but also in industry, medicine and agriculture. In July 1997, the 
Government had finalized a nuclear development plan extending to the year 2010. The plan 
included goals for national research and development in the nuclear field over the next 
13 years. The plan's implementation would involve an investment of approximately $7 billion. 
Twelve power reactors were currently in operation in the Republic of Korea, and six more 
were under construction. By the year 2000, the country would have a total of 27 power 
reactors. The authorities were encouraging the development of small and medium power 
reactors which could be used for multiple purposes such as seawater desalination and district 
heating. Also, the Republic of Korea was working actively on the development of advanced 
reactors and in the field of nuclear fusion. 
86. It was expected that in the twentyfirst 
century Asia would become the world's most 
active region as regards the use and development of nuclear energy. Cooperation 
among 
Asian countries in the field of nuclear safety should therefore be strengthened. The Republic 
of Korea was ready to play its part. In October 1997, it would be hosting in 
Seoul a 
conference on ways of improving nuclear safety and strengthening nuclear cooperation 
in 
Asia. Soon, it would be opening an international nuclear training centre through which other 
countries, especially Asian ones, could benefit from its expertise and technology. 
87. The Republic of Korea continued to attach great importance to the question of 
amending Article VI of the Agency's Statute. Fundamental changes had taken place in the 
international nuclear community during the past 20 years, and they should be reflected in the 

GC(41)/OR.2 
page 24 


Board's membership without further delay. Noting that a number of concrete proposals had 
been made in that connection, he said that, in the light of present circumstances, his country 
would like to see the question laid to rest soon through the acceptance of a less problematic 
proposal. Enough effort had been spent on the question in the course of more than two 
decades. 


88. The Republic of Korea was deeply concerned about the continuing noncompliance 
of 
the DPRK with its safeguards agreement. Despite exhaustive efforts over the past three years, 
the Agency had not been able to preserve necessary information regarding the history of the 
DPRK's past nuclear activities, mainly owing to lack of cooperation 
by the DPRK. 
Regrettably, the DPRK was still behaving in an irresponsible manner. How could one justify 
the efforts being made to strengthen the safeguards system if the Agency could not effectively 
implement the system as it stood? His Government believed that the present frustrating 
situation should not be allowed to continue. 
89. It was also regrettable that there still existed a fundamental difference of view between 
the Agency and the DPRK regarding the safeguards agreement between them. The argument 
of the DPRK that it had a special status and was therefore not bound by treaty obligations was 
unacceptable. In his country's view, the safeguards agreement between the Agency and the 
DPRK remained binding and in force. The DPRK, which insisted that the issue be resolved 
through the United StatesDPRK 
Agreed Framework, should be reminded that, under the 
terms of the Agreed Framework, key nuclear components of the lightwater 
reactors to be 
built in the DPRK would not be delivered without verification by the Agency of the DPRK's 
past nuclear activities. Technically, the verification process should be starting now. The 
Republic of Korea therefore once again called on the DPRK to cooperate 
fully with the 
Agency in preserving, as an interim measure, the information necessary for verification of the 
correctness and completeness of its initial report. 
90. As the twentyfirst 
century drew near, many challenges lay ahead for the Agency. The 
Republic of Korea firmly believed that nuclear energy would prove to be one of the most 
sustainable sources of energy in the future. However, the "nuclear renaissance" would require 
a more active involvement on the part of the Agency. A swift and positive response must be 
made to the everchanging 
international environment. Also, it was necessary to erase the 
negative image of nuclear energy that had emerged in some parts of the world. The Agency 
must therefore rearrange its priorities and goals. A proper balance must be struck among the 
Agency's various functions in areas such as technical cooperation, 
safety and safeguards. His 
delegation would like to see the Agency drawing on the collective wisdom of its Member 
States. For its part, the Republic of Korea would remain a responsible member of the Agency 
and would continue to make every effort to promote the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy in the world.

REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 
(GC(41)/INF/7, 9, 11, 14, 16 and 18) 


91. The PRESIDENT drew attention to document GC(41)/INF/16, entitled 
"Statement of financial contributions to the Agency as at 26 September 1997". That 
document included a table indicating those Member States which had lost their voting rights 
by virtue of the application of Article XIX. A of the Statute. Since that document had been 
issued, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Niger had made payments and their voting rights had 
accordingly been restored. Iraq, Belarus, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay, 
which were among those Member States to which Article XIX. A of the Statute applied, had 
requested that their voting rights be restored; the corresponding communications were 
reproduced in documents GC(41)/INF/7, 9, 14 and 18. The General Conference also had 
before it document GC(41)/INF/11, containing a communication received from Kuwait. If 
there were no objections, he would take it that, following past practice, the General 
Conference wished to refer those requests to the General Committee for initial consideration 
and report. 
92. It was so decided. 
The meeting rose at 5.5 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40th ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


1. Mr. PADOLINA (Philippines), having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as 
new members of the Agency, said that for countries in the Asia and Pacific region, 1997 not 
only marked the Agency's fortieth anniversary, but also the twentyfifth 
anniversary of the 
Regional Cooperative 
Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to 
Nuclear Science and Technology for Asia and the Pacific, which had established a mature 
technical cooperation 
network with the Agency's sustained support and guidance. 
2. Having thanked the Director General and his staff for the Annual Report for 1996, he 
expressed his country's profound appreciation to Mr. Blix for his 16 years of sterling service 
at the helm of the Agency. Under his leadership, a number of international instruments had 
been adopted and the Agency had become one of the bestmanaged 
organizations within the 
United Nations system. He also wished to welcome the Director General elect, 
Mr. ElBaradei, who had a wealth of experience in atomic energy matters. 
3. Turning to key developments in the Philippines, he said that ten potential sites had 
been identified for nuclear power installations and their suitability was being assessed. The 
nuclear power steering committee had carried out activities to raise public awareness, and its 
efforts had been boosted significantly by the second Philippine Nuclear Congress, which 
Mr. Blix had attended as a keynote speaker. A national radiological emergency plan had 
been developed and he was pleased to report the recent entry into force for his country of the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in 
the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. 
4. With regard to safeguards, the Philippines welcomed the conclusion of 
Programme 93+2 and the Board's adoption of the Model Additional Protocol. In accordance 
with its commitment to the NPT, the Philippines would be one of the first countries to sign an 
additional protocol with the Agency and he urged other countries to do the same. His country 
expected that any amendment or expansion of Annex II of the Model Protocol to include 
"dualuse" 
equipment and materials would be guided by the principle enshrined in the 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 4 


safeguards agreement between the Agency and individual States that the implementation of 
safeguards should not hamper the economic and technological development of the State 
concerned. A verifiable safeguards system, technical cooperation 
and nuclearweaponfree 
zones were the pillars of the NPT. With the entry into force in March of the Treaty on the 
Southeast Asia NuclearWeaponFree 
Zone, he called upon the nuclearweapon 
States to 
accede to the Protocol of that Treaty. 


5. Turning to nuclear safety, he said that the Philippines had been honoured to be one of 
the countries invited in July to participate in the Agency's new initiative to develop an 
integrated approach in determining the safety status of nuclear installations in selected 
countries. It welcomed the technical cooperation 
programme designed to provide operators 
with essential handson 
experience in predisposal technologies for waste management, and he 
reiterated his country's offer to host a predisposal waste demonstration centre. 
6. The Philippines was in the process of ratifying the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and 
welcomed the recent adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. However, it was 
regrettable that the Joint Convention, unlike the Basel Convention on the Control of 
Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, failed to make explicit 
provision for prior notification and the consent of transit States with regard to transboundary 
movements of such waste. 
7. The Philippines welcomed the progress made on the new initiatives designed to 
increase the relevance, costeffectiveness 
and impact of the technical cooperation 
programme. His country had hosted the regional workshop on the future technical 
cooperation 
programme and hoped that Model Project standards would be applied to the 
entire programme. Collective efforts should be made to ensure funding in conjunction with 
the attempts to improve the programme. For its part, the Philippines had always endeavoured 
to pay its contributions on time and continued to give extrabudgetary contributions to the 
RCA and the International Consultative Group on Food Irradiation. Furthermore, as an inkind 
contribution, it had also hosted nine research coordination 
meetings, working group 
meetings and training courses. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 5 


8. Significant progress had been achieved in the Philippine Model Project on nuclear 
medicine techniques in preventive nephrology, and on the use of the sterileinsect 
technique 
in the Philippines. In the area of radiation technology, the pilot gamma facility at the 
Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had been utilized fully for sterilizing medical products 
and irradiating food items and the Philippine industry had now accepted radiation processing 
using gamma rays as a desirable alternative to the sterilization of medical products. A bill 
was pending for the establishment of an irradiation centre at the Philippine Nuclear Research 
Institute to be used for commercial purposes and research and development. 
9. With regard to regional cooperation, 
his country was pleased with the results of 
project UNDP/IAEA/RCA 92/073, which had been concluded in December 1996, and was 
encouraged to note that Member States participating in the RCA were looking towards a new 
vision for the agreement, with a view to harmonizing the actions undertaken under that 
agreement with those undertaken under other such regional agreements. 
10. His country welcomed the Agency's quick response to its request for assistance in 
using nuclear technology in order to address the problems associated with the "red tide" 
phenomenon and looked forward to its guidance and assistance in using nuclear techniques to 
manage the impending water crisis resulting from the effects of the "El Nino" weather 
phenomenon, which was causing drought in some areas of the country. 
11. Finally, his country appreciated the various initiatives to amend Article VI of the 
Statute with a view to increasing the representation of underrepresented 
regions. While he 
endorsed the criteria for designated members, he called for careful discussion of the proposals 
relating to the composition of regional groups and the allocation of seats. 
12. Mr. MIKHAILOV (Russian Federation) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as 
new members of the Agency and then read out the following message from Boris Yeltsin, 
President of the Russian Federation, to the General Conference: 
"I extend cordial greetings to the participants in this commemorative fortyfirst 
session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 


"For 40 years the IAEA has been working for the benefit of mankind, directing its 
efforts towards encouraging cooperation 
among States in the use of atomic energy to 



GC(41)/OR.3 
page 6 


solve a wide range of problems, primarily in the areas of power, health care and 
agriculture. The Agency has also distinguished itself as an effective and reliable 
instrument for multilateral cooperation 
between States to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 


"I trust that in the coming twentyfirst 
century, the IAEA will make a fundamental 
contribution to the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and that it will 
actively promote the development and introduction of nuclear technologies which are 
environmentally safe, costeffective, 
and can meet the growing energy demands of 
mankind. As in the past, nuclear safety and nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons will 
take priority in these activities, as confirmed at the Moscow Nuclear Safety and 
Security Summit held in April 1996. In the future we anticipate continuing to rely on 
the IAEA's great competence to ensure the consistent achievement of these objectives 
on a global scale. 


"Having a high regard for the IAEA's role, I confirm Russia's unfailing readiness to 
provide wideranging 
support for its activities. Committed as Russia is to the accords 
on strengthening nuclear safety and security reached at the Moscow Summit, I can 
announce Russia's decision to carry out the gradual withdrawal from nuclear defence 
programmes of up to 500 tonnes of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tonnes of 
plutonium released in the nuclear disarmament process. Naturally, the pace and 
timing of this process will depend not only on the progress made in dismantling 
nuclear weapons under the existing nuclear disarmament agreements, but also on the 
construction of the required storage facilities for the material being removed from 
military use. I believe that this decision will contribute directly to the irreversibility of 
the nuclear disarmament process and to strengthening confidence and global stability. 


"I wish all the participants a successful and productive Conference." 


13. Over the past 40 years, the Agency had enjoyed a wellearned 
reputation as a 
competent international organization in the nuclear sphere and had done its utmost to assist 


its Member States in the development of nuclear power. In that time, nuclear science and 


technology had made great strides forward and had become a key factor in human progress. 


14. He welcomed the Agency's increasing role in radioactive waste management, 
particularly with regard to the investigation of the longterm 
prospects for the construction of 


regional radioactive waste repositories and processing facilities. Here the Agency had a role 


to play not only as a disseminator of technical information, but also as a centre for technology 


transfer and the development of the criteria for those processes. 



GC(41)/OR.3 
page 7 


15. Russia attached the highest priority to nuclear safety. A sense of optimism and 
confidence in nuclear power's future as an advanced technology lay behind the agreements 
reached by the leaders of the G8 
at the 1996 Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit, 
and confirmed in 1997 in Denver. In spite of its difficult financial situation, Russia was 
spending up to US $150 million a year on improving the safety of its nuclear power plants, 
particularly those with first generation reactors. There were 9 operating nuclear power plants 
with 29 reactors in the Russian Federation, generating 22 GW of electricity. International 
collaboration, including collaboration with the European Union, was providing some 
additional $30 million for those purposes. Nuclear safety centres, established in Moscow and 
Washington under an agreement between Russia and the United States of America, had 
already started operations. He urged all those interested to take part in that extremely 
important and essential work to improve the safety of nuclear power plants worldwide. The 
Agency had made a welcome and substantial contribution to nuclear safety, notably through 
the elaboration of international legislative mechanisms for the regulation of nuclear activities. 
In addition, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety 
of Radioactive Waste Management had been developed under the Agency's auspices. 
16. The establishment of an international legal basis for nuclear activities was central to 
the successful development of nuclear power and technology. The Russian Federation was 
taking an active part in the preparation and improvement of new and existing international 
legal instruments. Ratification of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear 
Damage by the State Duma was likely by the end of the year. Work was also continuing on 
developing Russia's national nuclear legislative system. 
17. Recently, the world community had made substantial progress towards global 
stability. Russia was firmly committed to nuclear disarmament and, together with the United 
States, was systematically reducing strategic offensive arms under the START I Treaty. A 
Protocol to the START II Treaty, improving its likelihood of ratification by the Duma and 
subsequent implementation, had just been signed in New York and the Presidents of Russia 
and the United States of America had already reached an understanding on the main 
parameters of the START III Treaty, under which it was hoped to achieve complete 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 8 


transparency and control with regard to the strategic nuclear weapons left in the United States 
and Russia. Russia was prepared to go even further and envisaged incorporation of the 
nuclear armaments of all the five nuclear Powers into the systematic reduction measures. 
However, further progress in nuclear disarmament could only be achieved if appropriate 
assurances could be given that the arms race was a thing of the past and would not be taken 
up again in other parts of the world. 


18. One option being considered by Russia for the development of nuclear power was to 
use the vast scientific and technological potential of the former military programmes. Under 
the motto of turning megatonnes of nuclear explosives into megawatts of electricity, the 
fissile nuclear material which had accumulated under the defence programmes should be used 
as fuel for the good of mankind. The Agency could promote international cooperation 
with a 
view to finding an economically sound and environmentally safe use for weaponsgrade 
material in the civilian nuclear fuel cycle, and verify the irreversibility of the processes 
whereby fissile materials were withdrawn from the military sector. He was convinced that the 
world community would find the resources to fund the Agency's new and delicate verification 
task under the socalled 
Trilateral Initiative.1 
19. With regard to the safe storage of those materials, Russia, the United States and the 
Agency were developing important new approaches within the framework of the Trilateral 
Initiative involving the construction and submission to international verification of storage 
facilities for plutonium originating from nuclear weapons. There were plans to construct a 
storage facility for plutonium239, 
the first of its kind in the world, the estimated cost of 
which was some $300 million. Japan had declared itself ready to collaborate and he invited 
all those interested in nuclear disarmament and the utilization of the resulting nuclear 
materials as nuclear reactor fuel to take part. 
The Trilateral Initiative was launched by the Minister of the Russian Federation for Atomic Energy, the 
Secretary of Energy of the United States and the Agency's Director General on 17 September 1996 to 
consider practical measures for the application of IAEA verification to fissile material originating from 
nuclear weapons. 



GC(41)/OR.3 
page 9 


20. Russia was a staunch supporter of the Agency's activities aimed at enhancing and 
strengthening safeguards, and establishing reliable mechanisms to detect clandestine nuclear 
activities. 
21. Another cause for public concern was illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Russia 
was participating in Agency activities under the programme to combat such illicit trafficking 
which had been agreed upon at the 1996 Moscow Summit, in areas such as accountancy and 
control, physical protection of nuclear materials, personnel training and arrangements for 
international cooperation 
to procure the relevant special equipment. It had also already 
submitted for inclusion in the Agency's illicit trafficking database information on thefts of 
nuclear material from 1992 to 1997. 
22. The Russian Federation attached particular importance to the Agency's technical 
assistance and cooperation 
programme. Since the Agency's inception, it had been actively 
involved in that programme providing equipment, instruments and materials, and had also 
hosted interregional and regional training courses. 
23. In conclusion, having approved the Agency's Annual Report for 1996 and 
commended the Secretariat on its excellent work, he expressed heartfelt gratitude to the 
outgoing Director General, Hans Blix, for his 16 years of outstanding service to the Agency. 
24. Mr. JIANG Xinxiong (China) read out a message of congratulations from the 
Prime Minister, Mr. Li Peng, to the General Conference: 
"On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, I would like to extend to the General Conference our 
congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Government. 


"In the past 40 years, the Agency has done a tremendous amount of work in the fields 
of promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy and preventing the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, for which it has received widespread praise from all Member States. 
It is my conviction that under the guidance of the principles and objectives enshrined 
in its Statute, the Agency will be able to play a more active role in promoting the 
development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy in the years to come. 


"The Chinese Government will, as always, participate actively in the activities of the 
Agency and strengthen its friendly cooperation 
with the Agency and its Member 



GC(41)/OR.3 
page 10 


States, so as to make greater contributions to the maintenance of world peace and the 
promotion of economic development and social progress. 


"I wish the Conference a complete success." 


25. Having paid tribute to Mr. Blix and congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his designation as 
the next Director General of the Agency, he noted that, over the past 40 years, membership of 
the Agency had increased to 127 and the Agency had become the most authoritative 
international organization in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Promoting the 
contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity worldwide was one of the two 
objectives set forth in the Agency's Statute. Fruitful work had been done and notable results 
achieved through the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. In the past ten years or so, 
the Agency had paid special attention to issues of universal concern such as the environment 
and sustainable development, providing technical assistance each year to over 80 developing 
Member States in the form of expert services, training of personnel and supply of equipment. 
The Agency, together with other international organizations, had synthesized the valuable 
experience of different countries to produce various standards and guidelines in the areas of 
nuclear safety, radiation protection, and radioactive waste management. The basic 
international nuclear legal system governing nuclear safety and radioactive waste 
management comprised a number of international conventions concluded under the Agency's 
auspices. 
26. Another objective set out in the Agency's Statute was to verify the nonproliferation 
of nuclear material and the Agency had established a safeguards system to achieve that 
objective. In recent years it had made efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the 
efficiency of that system, efforts which had received widespread support from most countries 
culminating in the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol. For the past 20 years, since 
the NPT's entry into force, the number of nuclearweapon 
States had not increased a 
fact 
that was undoubtedly attributable in part to the effective role of the Agency's safeguards 
system. 
27. Although the Agency had made much progress in its fortyyear 
history, the question of 
how to keep a balance between the two objectives enshrined in the Statute had still not yet 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 11 


been properly resolved. For a long time there had been a tendency for certain Member States 
to emphasize only one function preventing 
nuclear proliferation while 
overlooking the 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Chinese Government had always 
maintained that while preventing nuclear proliferation, one should not ignore the legitimate 
demands of Member States, especially the developing countries, for the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, let alone restrict on 
the grounds of preventing proliferation their 
peaceful 
use of nuclear science and technology and the development of their nuclear energy industry. 
The Agency should adhere to the objectives and principles established in its Statute and 
maintain a proper balance between safeguards and promotional activities in the future. 


28. China had joined the Agency in 1984 and always enjoyed a good relationship and 
fruitful cooperation 
with it. China had consistently supported the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
activities and the various programmes to promote the development and 
application of nuclear technology. It had also actively advocated the strengthening of 
technical assistance to the developing countries and had made its own contributions in that 
regard. In addition to paying its assessed contributions to the Regular Budget on time and in 
full, China had always pledged and paid its full share of the target to the TCF in a timely 
manner. In addition, China had provided the Agency with $1.2 million extrabudgetary 
resources in 1995 for the establishment of a radiotherapy nuclear medical centre in Ghana and 
for the tsetse fly eradication project in Zanzibar. During the past 14 years, China had 
provided scientific and technical personnel training for about 720 persons from the 
developing countries and regions and Chinese experts had been invited to provide technical 
services and lectures in connection with technical cooperation 
projects and training courses. 
In addition to the Agency's overall technical cooperation 
programme, China had also 
supported regional cooperation 
programmes, such as the RCA for Asia and the Pacific, the 
region where China was located. As a developing country, China had also benefited from the 
Agency's technical cooperation 
in strengthening its nuclear industry infrastructure, training a 
number of scientific, technical and managerial personnel, enhancing R&D capabilities, and in 
particular, promoting the development of the Chinese nuclear power industry. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 12 


29. China had always supported the Agency's safeguards activities. It had signed a 
voluntaryoffer 
safeguards agreement soon after joining the Agency, and had subsequently 
acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the NPT. His 
country had also joined the universal reporting scheme and undertook to report to the Agency 
on its import and export of nuclear materials, as well as the export of nuclear equipment and 
specified nonnuclear 
materials. At the Board meetings in May, China had declared its 
acceptance of some of the measures identified in Programme 93+2 and had undertaken to 
negotiate a legally binding document with the Agency in due course for the implementation 
of those measures. 
30. Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and maintaining world peace were 
important aspects of China's foreign policy. China provided no assistance to unsafeguarded 
nuclear facilities of other countries and exercised strict control and approval over specific 
items of nuclear export in keeping with generally accepted principles that they should be used 
only for peaceful purposes, that they should be placed under Agency safeguards and that there 
should be no transfer to any third country without China's prior consent. Over the years, 
China's relatively comprehensive nuclear export control system had proved to be strict and 
effective. In order to further enhance the transparency and effectiveness of that regime, China 
had decided to join the Zangger Committee. 
31. The Chinese Government attached great importance to the development of nuclear 
power, which played an important role in the country's energy structure as a safe, reliable and 
clean source of energy. At present, there were three nuclear power reactors in operation in 
China and four nuclear power plants with a total of eight units were currently under 
construction or at the planning stage. Operation of the Qinshan nuclear power plant had 
demonstrated the reliable design and construction quality of major equipment, such as the 
domestically fabricated nuclear fuel elements, reactor and turbinegenerators. 
During the 
Agency's OS ART missions to the Guangdong and Qinshan nuclear power plants in 
October 1996 and January 1997 respectively, the Agency's experts had expressed their 
satisfaction with the safety of those plants, while also making some valuable 
recommendations and suggestions. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 13 


32. With the rapid development of China's economy, the demand for energy was rising. 
As a result, nuclear energy was expected to be much further developed as an alternative 
energy source. The total installed capacity of nuclear power in operation was expected to 
reach 20 000 MW by the year 2010, and exceed 40 000 MW by 2020. China would represent 
a vast market for nuclear power and was willing to develop technical cooperation 
and 
commercial transactions with advanced countries in that area under the principle of equality 
and mutual benefit. 
33. The recently adopted Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage 
would have a positive effect on the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
However, the amount of compensation for nuclear damage was too high to attract a very large 
number of signatories. Although China could not, for the time being, accede to those two 
instruments, it nevertheless attached great importance to nuclear liability. 
34. Turning to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, he said that it would help to raise the safety level 
of spent fuel and radioactive waste management. However, the Chinese Government had 
decided not to sign the Joint Convention, owing to the Convention's failure to regulate 
transboundary movements between a contracting party and a nonState 
entity. 
35. In the past year, the Agency had made considerable progress in establishing and 
implementing various new measures to strengthen technical cooperation. 
In recent years, 
notable results had been achieved through the implementation of Model Projects in fields 
such as nuclear medicine, agriculture, isotope hydrology, nuclear and radiation safety. With 
the demand for technical cooperation 
and assistance from vast numbers of developing 
countries constantly increasing, there was a pressing need to accelerate the industrialization of 
nuclear technology applications so that nuclear technology could play a greater role in 
national economic development. The Agency's Secretariat and Member States could make a 
joint effort to go further than the existing reform measures and achieve even better results. 
The Standing Advisory Group on Technical Assistance and Cooperation 
should listen more 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 14 


to the developing Member States, learn more about their needs and make suggestions for 
strengthening technical cooperation. 


36. In conclusion, he stressed the need to adhere to the purposes and principles laid down 
in the Statute and to maintain a balance between promotional and safeguards activities in 
order, through the joint efforts of all Member States, to ensure a better and brighter future. 
Mr. P. Walker (Canada) took the Chair. 


37. Mr. ABAZA (Egypt), having welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta as new 
members of the Agency, commended the many significant achievements of Mr. Hans Blix in 
his 16 years of outstanding service as Director General of the Agency and said that he was 
proud that an Egyptian had been selected to succeed him. He was sure that Mr. ElBaradei 
would be a worthy successor to lead the Agency into the twentyfirst 
century. 
38. The Agency was facing three major challenges requiring the concerted efforts of its 
Member States. Firstly, the Agency had to define and enhance the role of nuclear energy 
within the framework of sustainable development. To that end, efforts needed to be 
intensified in the fields of nuclear safety, radioactive waste management, nuclear power 
production, health, agriculture and water resources the 
transfer of technology for peaceful 
development purposes, through technical cooperation 
and other activities, being one of the 
Agency's main statutory functions. Secondly, the Agency had to enhance its positive 
contributions to international security through its verification activities and to promote the 
establishment of nuclearweaponfree 
zones in various regions of the world. He commended 
the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol and noted that the efforts to strengthen the 
Agency's safeguards system should involve all countries, regardless of the type of safeguards 
agreement they had concluded with the Agency. Thirdly, the Agency, while preserving its 
original lofty aims, should adapt itself to the new postCold 
War global realities and develop 
its ability to respond to the aspirations of Member States in spite of limited financial 
resources. In that regard, it was important to amend Article VI of the Agency's Statute and 
agree on a new formula for the financing of the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 15 


39. Egypt firmly supported global nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. 
The threat 
of proliferation in the Middle East region was a matter of urgency affecting the stability and 
security of the region, and beyond. Egypt had been advocating, since 1974, the establishment 
of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East and had launched, in 1990, an initiative to 
make the region a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons. However, presentday 
realities in the region were a long way from those 
lofty objectives since there was still an unsafeguarded nuclear programme on Egypt's eastern 
border creating a very dangerous situation in the region. The Egyptian initiative of 1977, 
aimed at achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region, had taken on new 
dimensions in Madrid in 1991 and Oslo in 1993. However, the peace process in the Middle 
East was currently facing many difficulties associated with wellknown 
unresolved problems, 
one of which was the question of nuclear weapons. Some countries in the region continued to 
refuse to apply Agency, or any other international or regional, safeguards to their nuclear 
programmes. Nevertheless, Egypt still believed that peace could be achieved through 
negotiation and dialogue, and the application of comprehensive safeguards. 
40. In 1996, the General Conference had responded positively to Egypt's request that the 
Agency organize a workshop on safeguards in the Middle East and the workshop had been 
held in May 1997 at the Agency's Headquarters in Vienna. Although the workshop had 
concentrated on general and technical aspects, rather than aspects specific to the Middle East, 
the workshop had nevertheless constituted a further step in the Agency's efforts to implement 
safeguards in the Middle East and a followup 
to the previous workshop on the subject in 
1993. Egypt urged the Agency to organize another workshop on the same subject in 1998. 
41. Egypt was pursuing its efforts to expand the scope of the peaceful applications of 
atomic energy for the benefit of its people and attached special importance to the 
enhancement of the nuclear safety culture and adoption of standards in the field of nuclear 
technology. Egypt also supported regional cooperation 
and had played an active part in 
AFRA activities. 
42. The second multipurpose research reactor in Egypt, developed in cooperation 
with 
Argentina, would become critical before the end of the year. Commissioning of the reactor 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 16 


would push Egypt into a new era of R&D in the testing of nuclear fuel and reactor materials, 
radioisotope production and silicon chip processing for electronic applications. The reactor 
had capabilities for nuclear medical applications, reactor engineering and reactor physics 
research, as well as for power generation research. Egypt was making a careful study of the 
use of nuclear energy for electricity generation and the production of drinking water. With 
that in mind, it was following closely new worldwide developments in the design of power 
reactors. In preparation for the contribution that nuclear power plants would make in meeting 
Egypt's needs, sites were being provided with the necessary facilities and training equipment. 
Egypt was also pursuing the prospecting for, extraction of, and processing of nuclear raw 
materials. 


43. In conclusion, he expressed renewed confidence in the Agency's important role in 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and opening up new vistas for economic 
development for the benefit of mankind. He also called for support for the effective 
application of its safeguards system. At the threshold of a new century of technological and 
scientific research, the Agency's role was set to expand. 
44. Mr. FAZAKAS (Hungary), having endorsed the statement made by 
Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union and associated countries, including Hungary, 
said that since its establishment 40 years previously, the Agency had carried out remarkable 
work to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and 
prosperity throughout the world and its name had become synonymous with the development 
of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Mr. Blix deserved special thanks for his dedicated 
work and strenuous efforts over the previous 16 years. Under his leadership, the Agency had 
become an organization held in high esteem all over the world and Hungary would miss his 
committed activity, diplomatic skill and experience that had been of assistance to it on so 
many occasions. Nevertheless, he was confident that, under Mr. ElBaradei's able leadership, 
the Agency would meet the challenges of the next millennium. 
45. Hungary greatly appreciated the Agency's work to strengthen the safeguards system 
and regarded the Model Additional Protocol as a useful tool which would improve the 
Agency's capability to detect undeclared nuclear activities and enhance the effectiveness of 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 17 


the safeguards system as a whole. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had begun a 
review of its legislation in order to harmonize it with the recently approved provisions of the 
Model Additional Protocol. When that work had been completed, his Government intended 
to sign an additional protocol. 


46. Hungary had already signed the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and the Protocol to 
Amend the Vienna Convention, and attached great importance to their early entry into force. 
47. In recent years, much had been done to create a legal framework for the peaceful uses 
of atomic energy in Hungary and a new atomic energy act had been adopted by the Hungarian 
Parliament in December 1996. Its provisions were completely in line with those of the 
Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention and also reflected the high priority attached to the 
issue of radioactive waste. A central nuclear financial fund would be set up to cover the costs 
of radioactive waste management, including decommissioning. Furthermore, the regulatory 
requirements for nuclear facilities had been elaborated on the basis of Agency safety 
standards and new nuclear safety regulations had also been issued. 
48. Nuclear energy continued to play an important role in Hungary and in 1996 the Paks 
nuclear power plant had again achieved and maintained a high standard of safe and reliable 
operation. Significant safety upgrading measures had been carried out and the Agency had 
been invited to conduct a review mission in November 1996 to assess the safety upgrading 
process at the plant. The summary report of that review had stated that all the issues had been 
properly addressed and that a significant number of the problems had already been solved. 
49. The Agency's technical cooperation 
programme had enabled Hungary to build up a 
significant nuclear infrastructure and a group of highly qualified experts. As a result, it had 
been possible for Hungary to provide training for more than 600 Agency fellows. Hungary 
had been one of the first countries to acknowledge the importance of the Agency's new 
initiatives in the area of technical cooperation, 
particularly the Model Project concept. The 
Model Project to establish a training programme for nuclear power plant personnel in order to 
enhance operational safety at the Paks nuclear power plant had been successful, with the 
inauguration of the plant's maintenance training centre in April 1997. In that connection, he 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 18 


expressed his gratitude to the Agency, and Japan, Spain, the United States of America and the 
European Union, which had provided extrabudgetary contributions. For its part, his 
Government had decided to pledge a voluntary contribution to the Agency's TCF for 1998 in 
an amount corresponding to its share of the target, thereby demonstrating its commitment to 
the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. 


50. In conclusion, he expressed his confidence in the Agency's ability to meet the political 
and technical challenges that lay ahead. 
51. Mr. KÜHNL (Czech Republic) welcomed the Republic of Malta and Burkino 
Faso as new members of the Agency and expressed his delegation's support for the statement 
made on behalf of the European Union and associated countries. 
52. Looking back over the forty years of the Agency's existence, he noted that during that 
time, atomic energy had never been used against mankind. Although at the time of the 
Agency's establishment the world had feared the global proliferation of nuclear technology 
for military purposes, the number of nuclearweapon 
States had practically remained 
unchanged. On the other hand, peaceful nuclear technology, which had then been the 
privilege of just a few of the leading industrialized countries, was now available to almost any 
country wishing to use it. While 40 years earlier nuclear energy had represented the 
nightmare of Hiroshima, it was today part of everyday life electricity 
generation, medical 
science, food sterilization and the production of potable water could scarcely be imagined 
without it. 
53. The nuclear sector of the former Czechoslovakia had begun to develop during the 
second half of the 1970s in line with the Agency's recommendations and safety standards. 
Throughout its existence, the Agency had time and again demonstrated its ability to reflect 
the needs of its Member States. Having gradually redirected its emphasis from general 
support for all forms of peaceful uses of atomic energy and ionizing radiation to the 
elaboration of basic principles of nuclear safety and radiation protection, it had more recently 
focused on the problem of radioactive waste and the nuclear fuel cycle. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 19 


54. The Agency's mission to ensure global security in relation to the NPT remained the 
top priority. The Agency's safeguards system was central to international efforts to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the Czech Republic had welcomed the adoption of 
the Model Additional Protocol, which strengthened confidence that signatory States would 
refrain from acts which were contrary to their commitments under the NPT. The Czech 
Republic had initiated steps to conclude an additional protocol and in so doing sought to 
demonstrate that the new stage in the safeguards system was viable, effective and practicable. 
In addition, the new agreement between the Czech Republic and the Agency for the 
application of safeguards pursuant to the NPT had recently been adopted by the Czech 
Parliament and signed by the President of the Republic. The new agreement had been drawn 
up for the Czech Republic as an independent State and recognized its decision to withdraw 
the reservations of the former Czechoslovakia regarding the settlement of disputes before the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
55. The Czech Republic was one of the countries which used nuclear energy for electricity 
generation. With regard to the Temelin nuclear power plant, major changes, such as the 
replacement of the entire instrumentation and control system and the use of an entirely new 
type of fuel, had caused far greater problems than had initially been expected. The 
Government nevertheless remained determined to improve the safety of the WWER1000 
reactor units by upgrading the plant's design and demonstrating the feasibility of that 
alternative. The Dukovany nuclear power plant was a stable part of the country's energy 
system. All four units had been put into operation ten years previously and had all undergone 
a thorough safety review during the past year. Part of that process had been the elaboration 
and assessment of new safety reports which had been prepared for each unit. In deciding to 
allow the power plant to continue operating, the regulatory body had set a number of 
conditions, including preparation for safety improvements to bring it in line with the 
commitments arising out of international conventions and treaties. 
56. There had been fundamental changes in the country's nuclear legislation in 1997. In 
January, the Czech Parliament had passed the new Atomic Act regulating the use of nuclear 
energy and ionizing radiation. The Act laid down the basic conditions for ensuring nuclear 

GC(41)/ 
OR.3 
page

safety, 
radiation 
protection, 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
physical 
security 
and 
defined 
the 
system 
of 
State 
administration 
and 
control, 
establishing 
the 
State 
Office 
for 
Nuclear 
Safety 
as 
the 
relevant 
authority. 
It 
also 
regulated 
certain 
problems 
relating 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
which 
had 
not 
previously 
been 
codified, 
including 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal 
system, 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage 
and 
emergency 
preparedness 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
radiation 
accident. 
The 
State 
Office 
for 
Nuclear 
Safety 
had 
already 
drawn 
up 
a 
set 
of 
regulations 
specifying 
ways 
of 
complying 
with 
obligations 
under 
the 
Act. 


57. 
The 
Czech 
Republic 
highly 
appreciated 
the 
Agency's 
efforts 
in 
developing 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management

The 
development 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
in 
the 
Czech 
Republic 
were 
closely 
linked 
to 
international 
co-operation 
and 
technical 
assistance 
programmes. 
The 
Agency's 
technical 
co-operation 
programme, 
implemented 
at 
both 
the 
regional 
and 
national 
levels, 
traditionally 
ranked 
among 
the 
most 
important. 
The 
Czech 
Republic 
highly 
appreciated 
the 
Agency's 
work 
over 
the 
past 
four 
decades 
and 
commended 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
staff 
on 
their 
excellent 
results. 
59. 
Lastly, 
he 
thanked 
the 
outgoing 
Director 
General, 
Mr. 
Blix, 
for 
his 
devoted 
work 
to 
the 
organization 
in 
a 
period 
that 
might 
well 
be 
described 
as 
difficult 
and 
wished 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
new 
Director 
General,Mr. 
ElBaradei, 
every 
success 
in 
their 
future 
work. 
Mr. 
Niewodniczanski 
(Poland') 
resumed 
the 
Chair. 


60. 
Mr. 
CODORNIU 
PUJALS 
(Cuba),joined 
other 
speakers 
in 
welcoming 
Malta 
and 
Burkina 
Faso 
as 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Like 
other 
developing 
countries, 
Cuba 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
co-operation 
activities 
and 
had 
recently 
been 
a 
far 
more 
active 
participant 
in 
those 
activities 
than 
in 
previous 
years, 
providing 
experts 
and 
services 
and 
offering 
its 
facilities 
to 
train 
specialists. 
In 
carrying 
out 
its 
functions, 
he 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 21 


hoped that the Agency would continue to abide by Article III.C of the Statute, which 
stipulated that it should not make assistance to members subject to any political, economic, 
military, or other conditions incompatible with the provisions of the Statute. 


61. Regrettably, there were forces in the international community which attempted to use 
international organizations as a vehicle for their own political interests. In that connection, he 
drew attention to document INFCIRC/537, which contained a circular letter from the 
Permanent Mission of Cuba describing the attempts of a neighbouring State to boycott the 
Cuban nuclear programme. The United States Congress was seeking to approve a series of 
amendments to the HelmsBurton 
Act designed to strengthen the actions provided for in that 
Act and hinder Cuba's participation in the Agency and in its technical assistance programme. 
Such action was a blatant violation of the Agency's Statute and should be condemned by the 
entire international community. 
62. Despite the unjust economic, commercial and financial blockade which had been 
imposed on Cuba and despite the HelmsBurton 
Act and the amendments thereto, Cuba was 
continuing to pursue its peaceful nuclear programme and was making new strides in medical, 
stockbreeding and industrial applications every year. Cuba still planned to commission its 
first nuclear power plant when the economic conditions were right and it was working on the 
establishment of the requisite infrastructure, paying particular attention to nuclear safety and 
radiation protection. 
63. Turning to technical cooperation 
in Latin America and the Caribbean, he said that the 
first meeting of the Highest Nuclear Authorities of the countries participating in the ARCAL 
programme had been held in Havana in March. A number of important agreements and 
recommendations had been adopted at that meeting and he hoped that an intergovernmental 
agreement for ARCAL, which would undoubtedly give impetus to regional cooperation 
activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, would be adopted in the near future. Cuba 
strongly supported the ARCAL programme and was keen to work towards the strengthening 
of ARCAL. 
64. Cuba appreciated the Agency's work in important fields such as nuclear safety and 
radiation protection. A number of legal instruments had been concluded and the Agency's 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 22 


numerous efforts, including those to develop standards, regulations and guidelines had done 
much to increase the global safety culture. 


65. Turning to the Board's recent adoption of the Model Additional Protocol, he said that 
Cuba continued to believe that there was no legal basis for extending its scope of application 
to countries with INFCIRC/66type 
safeguards agreements. The highly discriminatory nature 
of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime made universality an impossible goal at the present 
juncture. Care should be taken to ensure that the Agency's safeguards activities did not pose 
an unacceptable financial burden on countries, such as Cuba, facing crucial problems 
associated with their development. Cuba's right to nuclear technology was being violated 
constantly and it was clear in Cuba's case that the transfer of technology did not depend on 
Cuba's signing of bilateral or multilateral instruments, but on recognition by all countries 
once and for all that Cuba was a free and sovereign country. 
66. Cuba remained committed to peace and universal disarmament. In April, it had 
ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention and had recently deposited its instrument of 
accession to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
Nonproliferation 
measures would remain palliative as long as countries continued to possess 
nuclear arsenals capable of destroying the whole of mankind in a matter of minutes the 
only 
solution lay in the total elimination of nuclear weapons. 
67. Despite the Agency's many achievements over the previous 40 years there were still 
areas, in addition to nuclear disarmament, where more progress was needed. For example, 
there was a need to improve public opinion with respect to nuclear energy, which continued 
to be rather negative, otherwise there was a danger that nuclear techniques might no longer be 
used in the future because of a lack of public confidence. 
68. As a part of the United Nations system, the Agency needed to become more 
democratic and develop to reflect the changes that had taken place in the international 
community. Although many countries were advocating change with respect to Article VI of 
the Statute, there appeared to be little political will on the part of the most developed 
countries to look for constructive solutions. The current situation was not conducive to 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 23 


creating the climate of cooperation 
necessary for the Agency to continue working efficiently 
and the issue should therefore be resolved once and for all. 


69. He concluded by congratulating all those who had contributed to the Agency's success 
over the previous 40 years and expressed particular gratitude to Mr. Blix, who had led the 
Agency so ably for so long. Finally, he also congratulated Mr. EIBaradei on his appointment 
and assured him of Cuba's full support in accomplishing the objectives enshrined in the 
Agency's Statute. 
70. Mr. CHAFE (Nigeria) welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta as new members of 
the Agency. Noting that there had never been any doubt about the Agency's efficiency under 
Mr. Blix's leadership, he wished him the very best in his welldeserved 
retirement and 
congratulated him on his new status as Director General Emeritus. He also congratulated 
Mr. EIBaradei on his appointment as the Agency's new Director General and assured him of 
Nigeria's full support and cooperation. 
His election was not only an acknowledgement of 
his managerial capability and his remarkable contributions to the Agency over the years, but 
also a recognition of Egypt's contribution to the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. 
71. Since its establishment 40 years ago, the Agency had grown into one of the most 
efficient specialized agencies in the United Nations system. The Agency's many 
achievements over the years had included playing a major role not only in stemming the 
nuclear arms race, but also in making an immense contribution to human development 
through the application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. However, much more 
could still be done to support sustainable development, particularly in the developing 
countries. 
72. As a member of the Agency for over 30 years, Nigeria had taken gradual steps to 
utilize nuclear technology to improve the lives of its people. His delegation appreciated the 
Agency's assistance and looked forward to more active cooperation. 
One of the Agency's 
current projects in Nigeria was the installation of a research reactor, which would be 
commissioned before the middle of 1998 and would stimulate new developmental efforts 
among countries in the West African subregion. The Agency had also assisted Nigeria in 
hosting the regional training course on the application of nuclear analytical techniques in 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 24 


mineral exploration and in organizing the national workshop on project formulation, design 
and implementation. 


73. Celebrations of the Agency's fortieth anniversary in Nigeria were taking the form of 
lecture series and an exhibition describing the Agency's contribution to the wellbeing 
of 
Nigerians and the benefits of membership of the Agency. 
74. The Annual Report for 1996 showed that progress had been made in implementing the 
initiatives to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
programme. He commended the Secretariat and, in particular, the Department 
of Technical Cooperation 
for the high implementation rate achieved. In order to maintain a 
high level of efficiency, the new strategies should be kept constantly under review. He 
welcomed the Model Project concept, which was being pursued through a broad geographic 
distribution of projects, particularly the Model Project on water resources management, in 
which Nigeria was actively participating, and looked forward to greater participation in such 
projects by countries in the African region. 
75. Technical cooperation 
was a crucial mechanism for the promotion of the peaceful 
applications of nuclear technology. It was therefore disturbing that the financing of technical 
cooperation 
was neither assured nor predictable. The Informal Working Group on the 
Financing of Technical Assistance should continue to seek a solution and, in the meantime, 
efforts should be pursued to secure extrabudgetary funding from the United Nations and other 
relevant international and private sector bodies. All Member States should pledge and strive 
to pay their contributions to the TCF in a timely manner. For its part, as a mark of Nigeria's 
unwavering support for the technical cooperation 
programme, his Government was pledging 
$100 000 to the TCF, an amount that was some 22% more than his country's share of the 
target for 1998. 
76. The African Regional Cooperative 
Agreement for Research, Development and 
Training related to Nuclear Science and Technology, of which Nigeria had been Chairman 
since the previous session of the General Conference, had proved an important framework for 
the exchange of information and experience among African scientists and technicians in the 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 25 


field of nuclear science and technology and for the development of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear technology. 


77. One important area of focus of AFRA activities was the issue of sustainable 
development in the region. Reorientation of AFRA programmes had been initiated in 1994 
and finalized in 1996 at the seventh technical working group meeting held in Zaria, Nigeria. 
In January 1997, AFRA had commenced thematic programming, focusing on specific 
problems confronting the region as identified by African nuclear scientists, in areas such as 
health, agriculture and hydrology. He was grateful to the Governments of France, Spain and 
the United States of America, and the OPEC Fund for International Development for the 
assistance they had provided to AFRA; to the Secretariat for its commitment to AFRA's 
activities in the past year; and to all AFRA Member States for their cooperation 
during that 
period. 
78. His delegation welcomed the increased prospects for the application of the sterile 
insect technique to combat, and possibly eliminate, the tsetse fly and noted with satisfaction 
the extension of that technique to other countries in the African region. He also welcomed 
the proposal to develop a single document on a coherent safety philosophy, embracing 
nuclear safety, radioactive waste management and radiation protection. Following the signing 
into law of the decree on nuclear safety and radiation protection by the Government of 
Nigeria, preparations were under way for the establishment of a regulatory authority to 
control and regulate the use of radioactive substances, material and equipment emitting and 
generating ionizing radiation in Nigeria. 
79. The recent adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage would undoubtedly help to improve public confidence in 
the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
80. His delegation was also pleased that the efforts to improve the safeguards system had 
borne fruit with the adoption in June of the Model Additional Protocol. Nigeria would be 
signing an additional protocol as soon as the necessary preparatory work had been concluded. 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 26 


81. Turning to the amendment of Article VI, an issue which had been on the agenda of 
both the Board of Governors and the General Conference for over two decades, he said that it 
was not very encouraging that no agreement was in sight. Nevertheless, he hoped that a spirit 
of compromise would prevail so that a consensus could be reached on a solution which would 
correct the present underrepresentation 
of Africa and MESA. 
82. Finally, he expressed his appreciation for the measures taken by the Director General, 
in response to resolution GC(40)/RES/18, to increase, particularly at the policymaking 
level, 
the number of staff from developing countries, and from other Member States that were not 
represented or were underrepresented 
in the Secretariat. He was confident that those efforts 
would continue. 
83. Ms. WÜLFING (Germany) said that for the past forty years the Agency had 
been a successful promoter of the peaceful application of nuclear energy and technologies, 
and had contributed to the improvement of safety and to ensuring the nonproliferation 
of 
nuclear weapons. Credit for the fact that it had fulfilled its functions so effectively was due to 
its Director General for the last 16 years, Mr. Blix, under whose able leadership it had 
enhanced its worldwide reputation. Germany was convinced that under Mr. ElBaradei's 
leadership the Agency's tradition of efficiency would continue. 
84. The Agency had been instrumental in creating a nuclear safety and security culture, 
through its role in the preparation of international conventions in areas such as the safety of 
nuclear facilities and the safety of nuclear waste and spent fuel management, transport 
regulations, physical protection standards, export control mechanisms, and measures to 
prevent and combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and through its significantly 
improved safeguards system. The agreement on the indefinite extension of the NPT reflected 
the international community's continuing commitment in that area. Her Government, which 
attached great importance to the universal acceptance of the NPT, welcomed the accession to 
that Treaty of three more States since the fortieth session of the General Conference, as well 
as Brazil's declaration that it would soon be joining. She called on the remaining States, 
especially those operating unsafeguarded facilities, to remain no longer outside what was an 
almost universal system of nonproliferation. 
A major achievement in the field of nuclear 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 27 


disarmament and nonproliferation 
had been the adoption in October 1996 of the 
Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty. Five States had already ratified the CTBT, which 
146 had signed, and she urged all States that had not yet done so to add their signatures. She 
hoped that those that had already signed would ratify the CTBT as soon as possible in order 
to bring about its formal entry into force. 


85. For some time, her Government had been advocating the immediate start and rapid 
conclusion of negotiations within the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on a 
nondiscriminatory, 
multilateral and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of 
fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. The verification 
system for such a fissile material cutoff 
treaty should be as efficient and effective as the 
current Agency safeguards system, and it would be appropriate to entrust the Agency with 
that task. Another step towards promoting the objectives of nonproliferation 
was the recent 
agreement on international guidelines for the management of nonmilitary 
plutonium; the 
international plutonium regime was a useful example of how transparency could be improved 
and safeguards applied even in nuclearweapon 
States. Her Government welcomed the 
progress made in talks between the United States of America, the Russian Federation and the 
Agency regarding the safe and effective management of fissile material that was no longer 
required for defence purposes; placing such sensitive material in safe storage under Agency 
safeguards could make a significant contribution to the confidence and transparency needed 
to prevent further proliferation. 
86. Technical options had been identified for the safe and secure management of weapons 
plutonium, in particular, consumption as MOX fuel in reactors and immobilization. France, 
Germany and the Russian Federation were cooperating 
in the construction of a pilot plant to 
produce mixed oxide fuel elements with material made available as a result of nuclear 
disarmament. The elements were to be used in civilian Russian reactors, and appropriate 
international verification of the peaceful use of that material was one of the central elements 
of the trilateral cooperation 
project. 
87. One of the main events in the past year had been the approval of new strengthened 
measures to verify the commitments by States not to produce nuclear weapons. Those 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 28 


measures would enhance the Agency's ability to detect possible clandestine nuclear activities 
and it was now important that the Model Additional Protocol should enter into force as soon 
as possible. Integration of those measures into the traditional safeguards system would ensure 
greater effectiveness and efficiency. 


88. Her Government welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
and had been very satisfied with the progress achieved at the preparatory meeting of the 
Contracting Parties in April 1997. It encouraged all States which were not yet party to the 
Convention to accede to it as soon as possible and urged all States engaging in nuclear 
activities to participate in the first review meeting to be held in April 1999. It was also to be 
hoped that a large number of States handling spent fuel elements and radioactive waste would 
soon sign and implement the recently adopted Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. Her Government 
welcomed the fact that the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage 
had both been adopted; although some concerns remained for her Government, it considered 
that both agreements were a good starting point for facilitating international cooperation 
and 
providing increased compensation for victims in the event of a nuclear accident. 
89. Turning to nuclear energy developments in her own country in the past twelve 
months, she said that Germany's 19 operational nuclear power plants had achieved their best 
operating results ever, with nuclear energy continuing to be the largest single source of 
electricity. There had been no incidents at German nuclear plants in 1996 that had constituted 
any danger to the public or the environment. Indeed, had the annual nuclear output been 
generated by coalfired 
stations, an additional 160 million tonnes of CO2 would have been 
released into the atmosphere. While nuclear energy was accepted by the majority of the 
German population, there was also a latent concern about possible accidents, and disposal of 
radioactive waste was not yet considered to be satisfactory. Although no new nuclear power 
plants were currently being built or planned, her Government considered the further 
advancement of nuclear energy to be justified in view of the high safety standards achieved 
and it intended to maintain the option of constructing new power plants with advanced safety 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 29 


technologies. The German Government also intended to remain actively involved 
internationally in determining enhanced safety standards and improving the safety of nuclear 
plants worldwide. It expressly advocated the development of reactors such as the 
FrancoGerman 
joint project for a European pressurized water reactor, which was designed to 
meet the increased safety standards introduced in Germany in 1994 to limit the effects of 
accidents to the reactor itself, even in the case of a core meltdown. 


90. Germany's preferred waste management policy was to dispose of all radioactive waste 
in deep geological formations on its territory. One disposal site was in operation and two 
were in the planning stage. The slow progress in exploring waste disposal sites reflected the 
controversy regarding nuclear energy policy in Germany. Two interim storage facilities had 
been constructed at the Gorleben and Ahaus sites, but the three transports of spent fuel and 
vitrified waste from reprocessing to Gorleben in 1995, 1996 and 1997 had all led to militant 
protests in the area, despite the fact that all types of nuclear material and waste had been 
transported safely in Germany for more than 30 years. It was a very difficult situation for the 
German Government. 
91. Noting that increasing attention in discussions on future power generation was being 
paid to the concept of sustainable development, she said that, since the energy contribution of 
renewable energies remained very limited, only countries with a significant proportion of 
nuclear power production were in a position to achieve the agreed reductions in greenhouse 
gases. If the reduction of energyrelated 
carbon dioxide emissions continued to be a priority, 
nuclear energy would have to be pursued and indeed expanded. Furthermore, in Germany's 
case, a nonnuclear 
strategy would burden the economy with excessive costs and result in a 
loss of jobs and a loss of international competitiveness. 
92. Mr. PESCI BOUREL (Argentina), having expressed his Government's deep 
appreciation for the achievements of the outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix, and wished the 
Director General elect, Mr. ElBaradei, every success in his future work, he extended a warm 
welcome to Malta and Burkina Faso. 
93. If one looked back over the forty years of the Agency's existence, there was no 
denying the immense progress that had been achieved in promoting international cooperation 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 30 


in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in implementing the safeguards system to guard 
against nuclear proliferation. 


94. Argentina actively supported the international community's efforts to improve global 
security. For its part, Argentina had signed an agreement with Brazil for the exclusively 
peaceful use of nuclear energy; a quadripartite safeguards agreement with the Agency, Brazil 
and ABACC; the Tlatelolco Treaty; and the NPT. In addition, it supported international 
controls on the export of nuclear and dualuse 
materials, as demonstrated by its membership 
of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger Committee. 
95. Argentina had long used nuclear energy for peaceful purposes to generate electricity, 
and in the fields of medicine, agriculture, veterinary science, food and industry, as well as in 
research and development. Its nuclear sector comprised the National Atomic Energy 
Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Authority, and the Empresa Nucleoelectrica Argentina. 
The promulgation of the new National Law on Nuclear Activity in 1997 provided a legal 
framework for nuclear activity in Argentina, making the State responsible for research and 
development, regulation and supervision, and leaving the production side largely to the 
private sector. The adoption of the new Law had also resulted in the internal restructuring of 
the National Atomic Energy Commission to prepare it for its future tasks and responsibilities 
and of the Empresa Nucleoelectrica Argentina in preparation for its entry into the private 
sector. 
96. Between January and June 1997, nuclear power had accounted for 10.62% of national 
electricity produced in Argentina, with an availability factor of 85.65%, a result attributable to 
the quality of the nationally manufactured supplies and national technical assistance services. 
A milestone in the development of a national lowpower 
reactor had been the starting up at 
the end of June 1997 of the RA8 
critical facility, which would be used to adjust the design 
parameters for the construction of the reactor. As to research reactors, construction work on 
the third research reactor to be exported by Argentina was nearing completion. 
97. The Nuclear Regulatory Authority had been formally established as a fully 
independent organization by the National Law on Nuclear Activity, which had also confirmed 
its powers in the areas of radiation protection, nuclear safety, safeguards and physical 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 31 


protection, all of which had continued to develop effectively in the course of the past year. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Authority had continued its tradition of international cooperation 
by 
participating in the establishment of the Forum of Latin American Regulatory Bodies, which 
had held its first meeting in Mexico and which Argentina believed would serve as a valuable 
instrument for the exchange of experience in regulatory matters with the countries of Latin 
America, Spain and Portugal. 


98. The additional protocols to safeguards agreements were an important contribution to 
the international nonproliferation 
regime and opened the way to a new stage in the Agency's 
international control and verification activities. In considering the application of the Model 
Additional Protocol, the Secretariat should take due account of the specific nature of 
individual safeguards agreements, which in Argentina's case included Brazil and ABACC. 
99. The international instruments adopted at the two recent diplomatic conferences 
constituted important contributions to the development of international regulations and would 
undoubtedly provide a solid foundation for the future development of nuclear energy and 
improve public acceptance. Consultations were currently under way in the appropriate 
government departments in Argentina in connection with its accession to the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, and to the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 
However, other aspects of the international regulation of radioactive waste, such as transport, 
which was a matter of great concern to many countries, still needed to be addressed in 
appropriate international forums. 
100. Another area which the Agency should address was the development of an integrated 
programme to study the environmental impact of uranium, and its emissions into the air, 
water and the working environment, as well as the decommissioning and rehabilitation of 
uranium sites within the framework of the existing Joint IAEA/NEA Uranium Group. 
101. Human resource training in radiation and nuclear safety should also continue to be a 
priority for the international community. In that connection, he pointed out that the 

GC(41)/OR.3 
page 32 


postgraduate course in radiation protection and nuclear safety held by Argentina under the 
auspices of the Agency was making an important contribution. 


102. Argentina attached particular importance to the cooperation 
agreement between the 
Agency and ABACC reproduced in document GC(41)/26, which would permit even greater 
interaction and synergy between the Agency and ABACC, which had successfully carried out 
its task of establishing a verification system pursuant to the Quadripartite Agreement. He 
therefore urged Member States to endorse the agreement. 
103. Turning to technical cooperation 
within Latin America, he expressed Argentina's 
strong support for the ARCAL programme and noted that States participating in that 
programme had recently been considering a draft governmental agreement which, if adopted, 
would provide a framework for cooperation 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the 
region. 
104. In conclusion, he noted that Argentina had maintained a fruitful relationship with the 
Agency over the past year and had participated actively in the technical cooperation 
programme, which it fully supported by hosting courses and workshops, training scientists 
and fellows and by making available to the Agency a large number of experts. Furthermore, 
it intended to make a voluntary contribution to the TCF for 1998.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 


(a) 
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS FOR INITIAL 
DISCUSSION 
1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the 
agenda for the session should consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in 
document GC(41)/1, as well as the two supplementary items contained in documents 
GC(41)/l/Add.l and GC(41)/l/Add.2. 
2. 
It was so decided. 
3. As regarded the allocation of items for initial discussion, the Committee recommended 
that all the items listed in document GC(41)/1 be taken up for discussion as indicated in that 
document. It further recommended that the supplementary items entitled "Cooperation 
agreements with intergovernmental organizations" and "International Initiative for Chernobyl 
Sarcophagus" be taken up for discussion by the Committee of the Whole. 
4. 
It was so decided. 
5. With regard to the order of items, the Committee recommended that the order 
proposed in document GC(41)/1 be maintained, except that the two supplementary items 
entitled "Cooperation 
agreements with intergovernmental organizations" and "International 
Initiative for Chernobyl Sarcophagus" should be taken up immediately after item 20 of the 
provisional agenda entitled "Article VT of the Statute", thus becoming items 21 and 22 
respectively, with the subsequent items being renumbered accordingly. It was understood that 
that order could be modified, in the light of progress, as long as due notice was given. 
6. 
It was so decided. 
7. All of the General Committee's recommendations regarding the agenda for the current 
session were adopted. The agenda was adopted. 
(b) 
CLOSING DATE OF THE SESSION AND OPENING DATE OF THE NEXT 
SESSION 
8. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee recommended that the 
General Conference set Friday, 3 October as the closing date of the fortyfirst 
regular session; 
it further recommended that the fortysecond 
regular session should open on Monday, 
21 September 1998, in Vienna. 
9. 
The Committee's recommendations were adopted.

REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 


10. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had had before it requests 
from Iraq, Belarus, United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay that the last sentence in 
Article XIX. A of the Statute be invoked in order that they might be permitted to vote during 
the current session of the General Conference. 
11. The Committee had recommended that the General Conference reject the request from 
Iraq and grant those of Belarus, United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay in accordance with 
the terms of Article XIX. A of the Statute. 
12. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia), noting that consultations on the requests for the 
restoration of voting rights by Belarus, the United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay were 
under way, requested that any decision on the matter be deferred to the following day. 
13. Mr. ALGHAIS 
(Kuwait) asked the General Conference to give a ruling on the 
first request, as the three others were entirely different cases. 
14. Mr. YAKOVENKO (Russian Federation) expressed the view that, if 
discussions on the matter were under way, it would be better to wait for their conclusions and 
defer consideration of all four cases to the following day without distinction. 
15. The PRESIDENT announced that Liberia had also just submitted a request for 
the restoration of voting rights which would have to be referred to the General Committee. 
He therefore proposed that the General Conference give a ruling on all five requests after the 
next meeting of the General Committee. 
16. Ms. TOLLE (Kenya), announcing that her country had also submitted a request 
for the restoration of voting rights, asked that it be considered with the others. 
17. Mr. ALGHAIS 
(Kuwait), noting that the Committee had reached a consensus 
with regard to the first request, said he failed to understand why the General Conference could 
not give a ruling at least on that case with a view to speeding up its work. 
18. The PRESIDENT, concluding from the discussion that it would be preferable 
to deal with all the requests for the restoration of voting rights together, proposed that 
consideration of the matter be deferred to the following day. 
19. The President's proposal was accepted. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


20. Mr. FRANK (Israel), having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new 
members, said that the Agency, whose fortieth anniversary coincided with the present session, 
had always been a prominent member of the United Nations system. For Israel, which was 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 7 


one of its founder members, the Agency had distinguished itself as a professional organization, 
committed to fulfilling its mission and contributing to all aspects of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. 


21. Over the previous 40 years, the world had witnessed considerable changes particularly 
with regard to the use of nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. When the Agency had 
been established, it had been hoped that those technologies, particularly nuclear energy, would 
provide a solution to many problems in the world. The first 20 years of the Agency had seen 
the development of nuclear technologies, not only in the energy field but also in several other 
fields. Throughout that period, the Agency's technical cooperation 
programmes had 
contributed, as they were still doing, to the transfer of technologies primarily concerned with 
food production and conservation, the use of fresh water resources and the promotion of 
human health. In carrying out those vital activities, the Agency had certainly fulfilled one of 
the principal tasks contained in its Statute, namely, to assist the developing countries in 
acquiring and using nuclear technologies. 
22. The following period was overshadowed by doubt. Two serious reactor accidents, 
fatal accidents caused by the misuse of radiation sources, as well as the perceived problem of 
largescale 
waste disposal clouded the optimistic outlook. Once again, the Agency had risen 
to the occasion by coordinating 
international assistance and helping to find solutions to the 
numerous problems that had emerged. That was why the promotion of nuclear safety had 
become one of the most important Agency activities. 
23. The Agency's intensive programmes on improving nuclear safety standards, the 
operation of research reactors, radiation protection and waste disposal had yielded impressive 
results, which in turn had served as a beacon for all concerned with nuclear safety to the point 
where it was difficult to envisage progressing in that complex area without the groundwork 
performed by the Agency. However the challenges ahead were still formidable. Risk 
management and the related question of public acceptance of nuclear power were generally 
considered crucial to the future development of industrial nuclear applications. In view of its 
exceptional contribution to nuclear safety, the Agency was also in the best position to seek 
ways of improving communication with the general public on nuclear risk issues. 
24. In view of the Agency's mandate and recent history, its work in the area of safeguards 
had assumed particular importance and undergone rapid evolution and development. In recent 
years, verification activities, hitherto based primarily on nuclear material accountancy, had 
been redirected, with an increasing amount of data now being actually collected and monitored 
in the field. The need to deal effectively with recent international developments coupled with 
the availability of excellent new analytical methods had significantly improved the Agency's 
technical verification capabilities. 
25. At a more conceptual level, the Agency had further improved the effectiveness of its 
verification by adopting a systematic approach, taking into consideration the national 
infrastructure as a whole, and also seeking to detect illicit activities not necessarily confined to 
the diversion of nuclear material. Thus, the technical verification capabilities had been greatly 
enhanced. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 8 


26. However, there were still major deficiencies to be overcome. One of the main 
difficulties had been the need to switch to an approach focusing more on undeclared facilities 
and activities. That fundamental change in approach had been the basis for the Agency's 
Programme 93+2; however, in Israel's opinion, the technical implications had not yet been 
satisfactorily resolved. Further development was necessary, particularly with regard to the 
capability for widearea 
detection of undeclared facilities. 
27. In the fields of nuclear safety and safeguards, the Agency had spearheaded important 
and fascinating developments involving science, technology and diplomacy. Recent effort on 
Programme 93+2 had led to the Model Protocol for strengthening the effectiveness and 
improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. The activities undertaken and the support 
provided by the Agency in the area of nuclear safety had resulted in three new safety 
conventions, two of which had been finalized in recent months. 
28. Turning to the future, he said that any realistic assessment of world energy resources 
pointed to the important role that nuclear power would have to play in the long term. The 
finite nature of fossil fuel reserves and the environmental damage caused by using those fuels 
were arguments in favour of employing different energy sources. Since renewable energy 
sources were only available in very limited quantities, nuclear energy was the only major viable 
energy source. Problems such as safety and waste disposal were technical problems which 
could be overcome. The Agency had to play a leading role, as it had done in the past, and 
help pave the way for a revival of nuclear energy. 
29. The Agency was to be congratulated on its fortieth anniversary for all that it had 
accomplished in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Israel hoped that the Agency 
would continue to fulfil its important function of facilitating the safe use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes and had decided to mark the anniversary in a plenary session of the Israeli 
nuclear societies due to take place shortly. Noting that Mr. Blix would shortly be leaving 
office to be succeeded by Mr. ElBaradei, he congratulated him and thanked him for his 
outstanding achievements at the helm of the Agency which were now widely recognized. The 
Agency had had to face formidable challenges in recent years. Under Mr. Blix's guidance, 
effective measures and solutions had been devised and implemented enabling the Agency not 
only to continue to perform its vital tasks but also to improve its performance despite all the 
constraints. On behalf of his Government, he wished to congratulate Mr. ElBaradei, the 
Director General elect, whose distinguished service in international organizations, particularly 
the Agency, had demonstrated his exceptional qualities and prepared him well for the high 
office of Director General. 
30. He invited the General Conference to consider two resolutions on its agenda relating 
to Israel and the Middle East. The first was entitled "Application of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle East". Since 1991, that resolution had been adopted by consensus. The consensus 
had been difficult to achieve at the beginning, but since 1994 it had been maintained without 
change. In the past, Israel had reluctantly joined the consensus in spite of the resolution's 
inherent deficiencies, because it recognized that the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone would help to further the peace process, security and arms control in the region. At the 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 9 


same time, Israel had made no secret of its fundamental reservations over the language and 
relevance of that resolution and had formally distanced itself from its modalities. 


31. From a more general point of view, Israel was hoping for a regional arrangement for 
the Middle East combining bilateral as well as multilateral elements. In the light of the 
experience of other regions, particularly Latin America, Asia and Europe, Israel was more 
hopeful than ever that proliferation problems would be settled through a combination of 
internal democratization and economic development, bilateral settlements and regional 
arrangements such as those that had become commonplace in other regions. 
32. The nuclear issue could not realistically be dissociated from such a global framework 
of peace and security in any region. The imperativeness of such an overall setting for 
achieving disarmament and nonproliferation 
had to be recognized. Taken out of that context, 
formal NPT commitments for either selfrestraint 
or nuclear export controls, even when 
coupled with Agency safeguards, could not by themselves provide adequate guarantees of 
compliance. The pertinence of those two caveats was nowhere more apparent than in the 
present day Middle East. Thus, it could only be counterproductive to modify the agreed text 
of the resolution on the application of safeguards in the Middle East, not least because it might 
inspire false hopes that the peace process could be circumvented by manipulating resolutions 
in international bodies. The current text of the resolution should remain unchanged, if the 
consensus was to be preserved. 
33. Another important question for the Agency and for Israel, which called for the 
attention of the General Conference, was the Chairman's package of proposals regarding 
amendment of Article VT of the Statute. The Director General had stated in paragraph 7 of his 
report the previous year (document GOV/2864): "It is evident that Article VI is premised 
upon the assumption that every Member State of the Agency is within one of those areas. If 
this were not the case, a Member State that was not within an area would be ineligible to serve 
as a member of the Board. Such ineligibility would be contrary to the principle of the 
sovereign equality of all of its Member States, upon which the Agency is based and which is 
enshrined in Article VI.C of the Statute". Certain Member States of the Middle East and 
South Asia (MESA) area were still trying to deprive Israel of its basic rights and the General 
Conference should intervene to rectify that situation. Once again, the very character and 
culture of the Agency was at stake: was the Agency a technically oriented international 
organization as envisaged in its Statute or was it an international organization where political 
coercion prevailed in defiance of its Statute? 
34. In 1996, the General Conference had endorsed an agreed statement presented by the 
President reaffirming the principle of the sovereign equality of all Member States of the 
Agency and requesting the Chairman of the Board of Governors to consult with Member 
States and to submit for consideration at its 1997 session specific proposals to include each 
Member State within the appropriate area. After tireless efforts, the Chairman of the Board of 
Governors had proposed a package which dealt simultaneously with three important issues, 
namely the expansion of the Board of Governors, the criteria for the designation of members 
of the Board and the composition of the eight areas, including the placing of Israel in the 

GC(41)/OR.4 


page 10 


MESA area. Israel urged all Member States to support the Chairman's package. Any 
derogation from the rights enshrined in the Statute was bound in the long run to undermine the 
very basis of Member States' participation in the Agency's activities. There was nothing more 
important, urgent and just than restoring the principle of sovereign equality in the 
Policymaking 
Organs of the Agency. Israel called upon all Member States to oppose any 
proposal to amend Article VI involving expansion of the Board without guaranteeing each 
Member State full enjoyment of its sovereign rights under the Statute, including Israel's place 
in the MESA area. In the light of the two aforementioned issues concerning the Middle East, 
he wondered how it was possible to ignore obvious political and geographical realities in the 
Middle East and at the same time support resolutions such as that entitled "Application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East", which pertained to the region as a whole. The General 
Conference should not become a political arena or a venue for political discrimination, as that 
would be quite inconsistent with the responsibilities of the Agency laid down in its Statute. 


35. Israel commended the Secretariat on its support for the conventions in the field of 
nuclear safety which had been developed and negotiated since the previous General 
Conference. It supported the objectives of all conventions concerning nuclear safety and had 
participated fully in the negotiations of those instruments. Israel had always attached great 
importance to nuclear safety and had spared no effort to ensure compliance with the latest 
international safety standards. 
36. His Government congratulated the Department of Technical Cooperation 
on its 
excellent work. The Agency's activities in that area had culminated in the adoption of new 
criteria for project evaluation; whereby projects had to meet real needs, have a 
socioeconomic 
impact for the enduser 
and demonstrate that the nuclear techniques were 
costeffective. 
His delegation welcomed the Agency's support for regional and interregional 
technical cooperation 
projects. The medfly eradication project in the Middle East was a good 
example of cooperation 
which responded to actual needs and should contribute to 
confidencebuilding 
in the region. 
37. In principle, Israel supported the strengthening of safeguards, and the Model Protocol 
to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system was a step 
in the right direction. However, no verification activity could guarantee compliance with 
agreements and his Government therefore believed that the political context and culture were 
just as important as safeguards, if not more so, in that respect. The Model Protocol was a 
valiant effort but it could not offer lasting guarantees in the absence of the political will and an 
internal system of checks and balances. The experience of UNSCOM and the Action Team 
should serve as a warning in that regard. Under certain circumstances the Model Protocol 
could improve the safeguards regime, but there should be no complacency. 
38. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radioactive sources had been a matter of 
great concern in recent years. Israel supported the Agency's activities in that area covering 
prevention, response, training and information, and appealed to the General Conference to 
step up those and other activities so that the Agency could spearhead the campaign against 
that threat in all areas.

39. 
The 
Agency 
was 
celebrating 
its 
fortieth 
anniversary 
at 
a 
time 
of 
global 
and 
regional 
changes 
in 
various 
fields. 
It 
was 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
empower 
the 
Agency 
to 
perform 
its 
statutory 
tasks, 
meet 
the 
challenges 
ahead 
and 
fulfil 
its 
extensive 
responsibilities. 
40. 
In 
conclusion, 
wishing 
the 
Director 
General 
elect, 
Mr. 
ElBaradei, 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
every 
success, 
he 
expressed 
confidence 
that 
under 
the 
able 
leadership 
of 
Mr. 
ElBaradei, 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
shielded 
from 
political 
pressures 
and 
constraints 
and 
thus 
free 
to 
pursue 
its 
technical 
contribution 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Israel 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
areas 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
present 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
reinforce 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
its 
goal. 
41. 
Mr. 
CESNE 
K 
(Slovakia), 
having 
endorsed 
the 
statement 
made 
by 
Luxembourg 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
welcomed 
Burkina 
Faso 
and 
Malta 
as 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
He 
congratulated 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
on 
his 
appointment 
as 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
expressed 
confidence 
that 
under 
his 
leadership 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
fulfil 
and 
extend 
its 
role, 
a 
goal 
to 
which 
Slovakia 
was 
ready 
to 
contribute. 
He 
particularly 
wished 
to 
commend 
the 
contribution 
made 
by 
Mr. 
Blix 
to 
the 
general 
development 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Agency's 
activities. 
During 
his 
16 
years 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
organization, 
the 
Agency 
had 
become 
a 
recognized 
institution 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
42. 
The 
forty-first 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
also 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
the 
work 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Agency 
during 
the 
previous 
40 
years. 
The 
Slovak 
Republic, 
one 
of 
the 
successor 
States 
of 
the 
former 
Czechoslovakia, 
had 
been 
present 
at 
the 
birth 
of 
the 
organization. 
Slovak 
diplomats 
in 
the 
Czechoslovakian 
delegation 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
six-country 
negotiations 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
Geneva 
in 
1955, 
and 
in 
1956 
in 
the 
negotiations 
involving 
12 
countries 
to 
prepare 
the 
Agency's 
Statute. 
After 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
independent 
Slovak 
Republic, 
Slovak 
experts 
had 
been 
actively 
involved 
in 
all 
the 
activities 
related 
to 
the 
organization. 
As 
a 
country 
with 
an 
active 
nuclear 
programme, 
Slovakia 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
and 
importance 
of 
an 
international 
organization 
which, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
promoted 
the 
general 
development 
and 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
controlled 
its 
exclusively 
peaceful 
application 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
mankind. 
Even 
though 
for 
the 
last 
ten 
years 
there 
had 
been 
a 
decline 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
it 
had 
become 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
power 
production 
in 
many 
countries. 
Slovakia 
regarded 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
one 
of 
the 
fundamental 
conditions 
of 
environmental 
protection. 
43. 
During 
recent 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
served 
as 
the 
centre 
for 
the 
development 
of 
significant 
international 
legal 
documents 
covering 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Those 
documents, 
which 
assigned 
an 
important 
role 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
which 
would 
have 
an 
impact 
for 
decades 
in 
the 
relevant 
areas, 
included 
the 
Convention 
on 
Early 
Notification 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident, 
the 
Convention 
on 
Assistance 
in 
the 
Case 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
or 
Radiological 
Emergency, 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
the 
Model 
Protocol 
additional 
to 
safeguards 
agreements, 
the 
Protocol 
to 
Amend 
the 
Vienna 
Convention 
on 
Civil 
Liability 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage, 
the 
Convention 
on 
Supplementary 
Compensation 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage 
and 
the 
Joint 

GC(41)/OR4 
page 12 


Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. 


44. An information campaign had been conducted in the Slovak Republic on the occasion 
of the Agency's fortieth anniversary describing its mission and activities: a press conference 
had been organized, the Slovak Nuclear Society had visited the Agency's Headquarters, a 
specialized publication on the Agency had been published, and during the General Conference 
the main post offices in Slovakia would use a commemorative stamp. The Slovak Association 
for the United Nations, which had just been established in Bratislava, was in the process of 
organizing a new information campaign on the Agency. 
45. Turning to the political aspects of the Agency's activities, he said that two years had 
elapsed since the indefinite extension of the NPT, one of the pillars of global stability, 
confidence and nuclear disarmament. The next review conference of the Parties to the Treaty 
in the year 2000 would enable the progress achieved since 1995 in the Treaty's 
implementation to be evaluated. The adoption of the Cairo Declaration in 1996 and the 
signing of new safeguards agreements also represented significant progress. Slovakia had 
followed with great interest the steps taken by the nuclearweapon 
States to reduce their 
nuclear military potential. It supported all measures to strengthen the nuclear 
nonproliferation 
regime and called on all countries which had not yet signed a safeguards 
agreement with the Agency under Article III of the NPT to honour the commitments they had 
undertaken in acceding to the Treaty. 
46. The safeguards system was a tool for verifying compliance with the NPT and its 
importance grew with the increasing number of nuclear facilities and the quantity of nuclear 
materials subject to control. Slovakia noted with satisfaction the conclusions of the 
Safeguards Implementation Report for 1996, which stated that nuclear material and other 
items which had been declared and placed under safeguards remained in peaceful use. 
47. On the other hand, the application of safeguards in the DPRK and, in particular, the 
verification of that country's initial declaration continued to pose problems. Slovakia appealed 
to the DPRK to cooperate 
with the IAEA so that verification of its initial declaration could be 
finalized as soon as possible. 
48. The Slovak Republic had supported the steps taken by the Agency to strengthen 
safeguards, in particular Programme 93+2. Slovak experts had participated actively in the 
negotiations in the Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the 
Efficiency of the Safeguards System. In that context, he paid tribute to the work done by 
Mr. ElBaradei, as well as by Mr. van Ebbenhorst Tengbergen and Mr. Walker. The Model 
Protocol would undoubtedly be a reliable tool for the control of the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy throughout the world. Slovakia therefore also welcomed the fact that the United 
States of America, the Russian Federation, China, France and the United Kingdom had stated 
that they were ready to examine the Model Protocol and to make proposals regarding its 
scope of application. Slovakia also appealed to States which had not concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements to find a way of implementing the Model Protocol. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 13 


49. In view of the importance and complexity of the document, the Slovak authorities had 
set up a working group of legal and technical experts under the direction and coordination 
of 
the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic with the task of developing swiftly a 
procedure for domestic approval of the Model Protocol. At the same time, Slovakia would 
welcome any advice from the Secretariat in that connection. 
50. The Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty was a new instrument in the area of 
nuclear nonproliferation 
and a further step on the road to nuclear disarmament. Slovakia, 
both in its national policy and as Chairman of the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, 
supported the endeavours of the signatory States interested in effective cooperation 
between 
the two organizations in the field of verification and in administrative and technical matters. It 
welcomed the positive attitude of the Agency's Secretariat to that issue and was convinced 
that such cooperation 
would be of benefit to both organizations. 
51. Another important mission of the Agency under its Statute was the general 
development of international cooperation 
in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Slovakia 
noted with satisfaction that the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme was coordinated 
with the United Nations Development Programme. Slovakia fully endorsed the Technical 
Cooperation 
Report for 1996. Technical cooperation 
was of particular significance for 
Slovakia. In 1996, Slovak organizations had taken part in 7 national projects and 18 regional 
projects. Slovakia was actively involved in research projects, and technical cooperation 
projects had become an integral part of its technical development. One of the most important 
projects to date, a project aimed at strengthening the national nuclear regulatory body, had 
been successfully completed. Fruitful cooperation 
was being established with regulatory 
authorities of other countries in the region, in particular with Armenia, Bulgaria and Ukraine. 
In 1997, cooperation 
with the regional coordinator 
for upgrading radiation protection 
infrastructure, based in Bratislava, had been very active and fruitful. Furthermore, since the 
previous session of the General Conference, Slovakia had hosted six events organized by the 
Agency with more than 200 participants from all over the world, and was ready to host similar 
events in the future. 
52. In order that the scope and efficiency of the technical cooperation 
programme might 
be still further increased, Slovakia urged all countries to fulfil their financial obligations in 
accordance with the scale of assessment. Slovakia had paid its contribution to the Regular 
Budget, its share of the TCF for 1997 and its assessed programme costs in full. It had also 
resolved to fulfil its financial obligations in 1998. 
53. With regard to the current and future use of nuclear energy in Slovakia, the 
Government had asked the relevant ministries to draw up a national energy plan covering the 
period up to the year 2005. Under the proposed plan, nuclear energy had and would continue 
to have an irreplaceable role to play, not only because it was the main source of electricity and 
heat but also for environmental reasons. As a result of the economic recovery under way 
since 1994, electricity consumption was increasing rapidly in Slovakia (about 8% per year) 
despite an extensive energy saving programme. In 1996, Slovak nuclear power plants had 
produced nearly 50% of the total electricity consumed. Thanks to substantial investments, 

GC(41)/OR4 
page 14 


the safety of operating plants had been considerably improved. Significant safety measures 
had also been implemented at the Mochovce plant, which was under construction and where 
commissioning of the first unit was expected to take place in June 1998. Slovakia hoped that 
the efforts it was making to improve safety would lead to increased confidence among its 
partners, as well as understanding of the importance of nuclear energy for the Slovak 
economy. 


54. Nuclear safety was strictly controlled in Slovakia by an independent national nuclear 
regulatory body, whose decisions were based on purely technical considerations employing the 
latest scientific and technical knowledge and backed up by broad international cooperation, 
mainly through the Agency. As Slovakia was keen to promote international acceptance of its 
nuclear power programme, it looked forward to the first review meeting under the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety to be held in April 1999. 
55. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Agency's Statute, which had been 
discussed at different levels for many years, Slovakia recalled that that Article had been 
amended in 1963, 1973 and 1989. Any such amendment had significant and longterm 
effects 
on the Agency's work and therefore had to be considered very carefully. Slovakia was in 
favour of a comprehensive longterm 
solution. It drew the attention of Member States to the 
fact that the East European Group was underrepresented 
on the Board of Governors owing 
to geopolitical changes which had taken place since 1989. However, it was the region which 
had the highest number of countries with dynamic nuclear power programmes. The Slovak 
Republic would therefore support a proposal acceptable to all regional groups that would 
ensure their equitable geographical representation in the Board of Governors and reflect the 
level of nuclear energy use in the various regions. 
56. Mr. PUSCA (Romania), having welcomed the admission of Malta and Burkina 
Faso to the Agency, said that the Agency's fortieth anniversary was a good opportunity to 
stress the important role which the Agency played in the nuclear field. He paid tribute to 
Mr. Blix for all his efforts during his tenure as Director General, welcomed the election of 
Mr. ElBaradei as new Director General and associated himself with the statement made by the 
delegate of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union. 
57. Since November 1996, the political and economic structure of Romania had undergone 
important changes. The Government (and more particularly the Ministry of Research and 
Technology) was engaged in reorganizing research and development activities, including those 
in the nuclear field, and to that end had published decree No. 8/1997. It intended henceforth 
to pursue a policy of structural reform. 
58. The principal objectives of the National Atomic Energy Agency were as follows: to 
determine the nuclear facilities of national importance with a view to obtaining financial 
support from the State, to identify the nuclear sectors which could be privatized, to elaborate a 
methodology for privatization conforming to the standards of the European Union and to 
elaborate the national research and development programme. The aims of that programme 
would be to decentralize nuclear R&D activities, to make better use of the results of those 
activities, to enhance the technical level of the equipment used by nuclear 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 15 


R&D establishments, to afford all research workers in the country equality of access to 
budgetary resources, to involve the private sector in nuclear R&D financing, to reduce to a 
minimum the cost of administrative activities, to make better use of resources and to increase 
management efficiency. 


59. He announced that unit 1 of Cernavoda nuclear power plant had been commissioned 
on 2 December 1996. That unit was designed to produce 4.5 TWh per year which represented 
around 8 to 10% of the energy production of the country and a saving of 1.2 million tonnes of 
oil equivalent to US $100 million. On 30 June 1997, the Canadian and Italian teams had 
transferred full responsibility for operation to the Romanian team. The Regulatory Authority 
had given its authorization for provisional operation on 1 August 1997. Studies on the lowcost 
development of the Romanian energy sector had indicated that it would be possible to 
complete construction and commission unit 2 of Cernavoda nuclear power plant by 2001. The 
latter would benefit from all the experience acquired on unit 1, as well as from the presence of 
qualified personnel and the infrastructure and facilities already in place. 
60. International cooperation 
was essential for developing programmes on heavy water 
reactors. Romania had experience in that field but still needed the knowhow 
and experience 
of other Member States. That was why it wished to participate in the work of the 
International Working Group on Advanced Technologies for Heavy Water Reactors. 
61. Thanks to the Agency's support, the level of safety in Romania was in compliance with 
international standards. On the basis of the recommendations of an IRRT mission carried out 
in 1992, the National Nuclear Supervisory Commission had taken measures to increase the 
efficiency of regulatory activities. Romania hoped that the IRRT followup 
mission due to 
take place in 1998 would produce good results. 
62. In recent years Romania had been participating in the Agency's technical assistance 
activities not only as a recipient but also as a provider of assistance. For example, its experts 
had participated in international missions organized by the Agency in Turkey and Argentina 
and it had received fellows from Nigeria, Iran, Viet Nam and Pakistan. Romania's 
contribution to the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme could none the less be even 
greater in such fields as vocational training and expert services. Moreover, in view of the 
human resources possessed by the country, the Agency should consider the possibility of 
appointing Romanian specialists to posts in the Secretariat. 
63. Romania was in favour of strengthening cooperation 
with European countries, in 
particular Eastern Europe. It could contribute to the regional programme by providing 
training courses in several of its nuclear facilities, such as the TRIGA nuclear research reactor 
at Pitesti, the experimental laboratory for postirradiation 
examination at Pitesti, the nuclear 
fuel testing facilities at Pitesti, the multifunction 
simulator at Cernavoda and the Research and 
Design Institute for the Energy Sector. 
64. He stressed the importance of the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme for 
Romania. The Agency's technical assistance was an efficient tool for technology transfer and 
development of the nuclear sector. The Romanian Government hoped that the Agency would 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 16 


maintain its financial assistance in 1998 at the same level as in 1996. In particular, thanks to 
the assistance which it provided to Member States through expert missions, training courses, 
fellowships and national and regional projects, the Agency was making a major contribution to 
the operating safety of nuclear power plants. 


65. The Romanian delegation reiterated its support for the Agency's activities in the fields 
of development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and nonproliferation. 
All 
international agreements concerned with the transfer of nuclear material should, like 
safeguards agreements, be applied in all Member States as an integral part of the 
nonproliferation 
regime. Romania fully supported the Agency's safeguards programme, 
which played a major role in preventing nuclear material, equipment and technology being 
diverted for nonpeaceful 
purposes. It also supported the efforts made by the Agency to 
establish a multilateral legal framework comprising specific instruments such as the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
66. The PRESIDENT, with the Conference's permission, gave the floor to the 
representative of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
67. Mr. BUSTANI (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons) 
congratulated Mr. Blix on being awarded the Uranium Institute's gold medal for his 
outstanding contribution to the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and paid 
tribute to the determination, vision and dedication he had displayed during his period at the 
head of the Agency. He also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his election as new Director 
General and looked forward to establishing with him a mutually beneficial cooperative 
relationship. 
68. The implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention would contribute to 
strengthening the international regime being set up to prevent the proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. The implementation of the Convention posed unprecedented challenges to 
the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) which would thus be glad 
to draw on available experience in that field of activity. 
69. He thanked the IAEA Secretariat for the useful advice and assistance it had provided 
to the OPCW during the preparatory phase in all areas relevant to the successful operation of 
an international verification agency, including logistical aspects of inspections, travel 
documents for inspectors, security aspects, the dissemination of information, routine 
administrative matters and the organization of annual conferences. He was sure that both 
organizations would profit from mutual cooperation 
and he looked forward to further 
strengthening the links between them. The OPCW had much to learn from the IAEA but he 
hoped that it would in turn have something to offer the Agency in future. 
70. The OPCW and the IAEA shared an important goal: to ensure the nonproliferation 
of 
an entire category of weapons of mass destruction. In its 40 years of existence, one of the 
most important contributions the Agency had made to verification had been the development 
of onsite 
inspections and an accounting system to verify that activities were not being pursued 
that could lead to nuclear weapons proliferation. It was because the Chemical Weapons 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 17 


Convention relied on a like system that it held so much promise compared with previous 
efforts to eliminate chemical weapons or halt their proliferation. The Convention provided not 
only for routine onsite 
inspections to verify the accuracy of declarations provided by its States 
Parties, but also for investigations into the alleged use of chemical weapons and for 
shortnotice 
challenge inspections to clarify and resolve any questions concerning possible 
noncompliance. 
He was confident that those powerful tools would be used with discernment 
and would prove successful both from the political and practical points of view. 


71. During the preparatory phase, it had been assumed for budgetary and planning 
purposes that only three States, the Russian Federation, the United States and one other 
unnamed State would declare possession of chemical weapons. In fact, eight States had 
already declared that they possessed or had possessed chemical weapons, not including the 
Russian Federation which had still to ratify the Convention. Thus, a clearer picture was 
already emerging about the quantity and locations of chemical weapons in the world, which 
was the first essential step towards their elimination. Participation by the Russian Federation 
in that process was particularly important, not only because it was the largest declared 
possessor of chemical weapons 40 
000 tonnes but 
also because of its role in global security, 
its permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, its important chemical 
industry and its high level of technical development. Without the active participation of the 
Russian Federation, it was difficult, if not impossible, to envisage achievement of the 
objectives of the Convention regarding the elimination of all chemical weapons stockpiles and 
related production facilities within a set timetable and ensuring that the civil chemical industry 
was not involved in illegitimate activities. He had visited Moscow recently, however, and had 
good reason to believe that the Russian Federation would soon accede to the Convention and 
submit the world's largest stockpiles of chemical weapons to the verification regime. 
72. The initial declarations already received by the OPCW provided information not only 
on former and existing chemical weapons but also on the facilities and activities relating to 
chemicals identified in the Convention as posing a special risk. Intended transfers of highly 
toxic chemicals produced in small quantities for various peaceful purposes "
Schedule 1 
chemicals"were 
now also being declared to the OPCW, allowing their movements to be 
tracked. The immediate nonproliferation 
aims of the Convention were thus being met along 
with its longer term disarmament goals. 
73. The first OPCW inspection had been conducted on 4 June 1997, a month after the 
entry into force of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It had taken place at a facility in the 
United States which had been in the process of destroying its stockpiles of chemical weapons 
at the time the Convention had entered into force. To date, over 80 initial inspections and 
visits had been conducted on the territory of 18 States. That included visits to military 
facilities as well as to facilities producing Schedule 1 chemicals which had to be completed 
within six months of entry into force of the Convention. In addition, permanent monitoring of 
chemical weapons destruction operations was under way at three facilities in the United 
States. All initial inspections of declared chemical weapons or related facilities had now been 
undertaken and it was estimated that more than 100 inspections would be completed before 
the end of the year. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 18 


74. Work had also progressed satisfactorily on the establishment of the administrative 
structure required to back up that verification system. The Conference of the States Parties, 
which was the principal organ of the OPCW comprising all of the States Parties to the 
Convention, had held its first session on 6 May 1997, seven days after entry into force of the 
Convention. The session had lasted for three weeks, during which time the OPCW had 
successfully launched its activities. The Conference had in particular approved a whole series 
of recommendations put forward by the Preparatory Commission with regard to administrative 
matters and the procedures for verification and the conduct of inspections. The Conference 
had adopted a budget of around $44 million for 1997, which was modest by comparison with 
the budget of the IAEA, and had approved the top management structure for the Technical 
Secretariat. During the same period, the Executive Council, a 41 member body charged with 
overseeing the daytoday 
operations of the Organisation, had been elected and met for the 
first time. Since May, the Executive Council the 
equivalent of the Agency's Board of 
Governors had 
met roughly once per month to monitor the implementation of the 
Convention. That high work intensity had been necessary with the Convention having just 
entered into force, but the rhythm should become more normal in 1998. The second session 
of the Conference of the States Parties was scheduled for December. 
75. Over the years, the IAEA had acquired a reputation as a wellmanaged 
and efficient 
organization. The OPCW had had the good fortune to inherit competent and experienced staff 
from the Preparatory Commission. The transition from preparation to implementation 
evidently required additional staff, and every effort was being made to recruit qualified 
personnel in the Secretariat with as broad a geographical distribution as possible. He intended 
to lead a dynamic Secretariat avoiding excessive bureaucratic expansion. The new 
headquarters building, where operations would be centralized, would be ready for occupation 
in the coming months. 
76. As with the IAEA, it was essential for the OPCW verification system to have highly 
qualified inspectors. 111 inspectors and assistants had been appointed following a rigorous 
selection process and intensive training. The credibility of the OPCW verification system 
would depend on the technical competence, the professional background and the deportment 
of the inspectors. A second training course for a further 90 inspectors was planned for 1998. 
The exact number of inspectors needed by the OPCW would depend on the number of States 
Parties and on the content of their declarations. 
77. Another common goal of the Agency and the OPCW was the promotion of technical 
cooperation 
and assistance. There could be no doubt that the achievement of the objective of 
nonproliferation 
called for a careful balance between disarmament and nonproliferation 
commitments on the one hand and free trade and cooperation 
for peaceful purposes on the 
other. In that connection, it was essential to preserve confidentiality in the field of legitimate 
industrial activities whilst being as transparent as possible about military activities. 
78. In conclusion, he hoped that there could be a fruitful exchange of experience between 
the Agency and OPCW, especially in the areas of verification and technical assistance and 
cooperation. 
He wished the Agency every success with its fortyfirst 
General Conference. 

GC(41)/OR4

79. Mr. CHIDAMBARAM (India), after welcoming Malta and Burkina Faso to 
membership of the Agency, read out the following message to the General Conference from 
the Indian Prime Minister: 
"This auspicious year marks the fortieth anniversary of the IAEA as well as the fiftieth 
year of India's independence. I am very happy to convey greetings and felicitations on 
behalf of the people of India and on my own behalf to the IAEA, with which we have 
been associated from its very inception as a founder member". 


80. The Agency had been established to promote research, development and the practical 
applications of atomic energy for peaceful purposes worldwide. Electrical energy was 
essential for economic and social growth and there was a strong correlation in all developing 
countries between growth and per caput power consumption. Nuclear energy opened up vast 
prospects for prosperity and represented a panacea for the future by boosting power 
generation capacity, improving human health, increasing and enhancing agricultural 
production, contributing to more effective pest control, facilitating better management of 
water resources and providing potable water through desalination. That was the vision all 
should continue to work for. There had to be a truly global partnership in the area of nuclear 
energy and sustainable development in order to foster a climate of genuine cooperation. 
The 
Agency had a unique role to play in facilitating that development process and translating that 
vision into reality. 
81. India had used the occasion of the Agency's fortieth anniversary to organize an 
international seminar with the Agency in New Delhi on the role of nuclear energy in 
sustainable development. The Director General, Mr. Blix, and the Deputy Director General 
for Research and Isotopes, Mr. Machi, had participated in that seminar, from which it had 
become clear that fission energy was going to be the inevitable option for countries in Asia and 
for developing countries and would be indispensable for the longterm 
energy security of the 
world. That had also been the message of the international symposium organized by the 
Agency in June 1997 on nuclear fuel cycle and reactor strategies. He wished to thank 
Mr. Blix for his service to the Agency over the past 16 years. He had himself had the 
opportunity of working closely with Mr. Blix in 1994 and 1995, when he had been Chairman 
of the Board of Governors, and had happy memories of that association. 
82. Accelerated development of India's industry, agriculture and infrastructure designed to 
bring the standard of living of its population close to that of developed countries called for the 
per caput electricity consumption to be increased by eight to ten times. It was also expected 
that nuclear power would account for an increasingly large share of national electricity 
production in the next century. The Indian Government had therefore established a sound 
infrastructure to meet that demand. At present, four nuclear reactors of Indian design were 
under construction. Of the ten reactors in operation, the two oldest were boiling water 
reactors and the others were pressurized heavy water reactors. Construction of two 
500 MW(e) pressurized heavy water reactors of Indian design was expected to start shortly. 
Negotiations with Russia on cooperation 
in the construction of two 1000 MW(e) WWER 
reactors in Tamil Nadu were at an advanced stage. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 20 


83. The performance of Indian nuclear power plants had improved considerably and the 
plants of the new generation were attaining load factors comparable with the highest 
international standards, the average load factor in August 1997 being 90%. During the last 
few years, remote handling techniques and tools had been developed to carry out intricate 
tasks in high radiation fields, e.g. for inservice 
inspection of reactor core internals and 
maintenance. The difficult job of replacing the highly radioactive coolant channels of one of 
the two pressurized heavy water reactors in Radjasthan had been performed using technology 
and equipment developed in India; a zirconiumniobium 
alloy with very low impurity levels 
and higher sag resistance had been developed for the new coolant channels to replace the old 
ones. The Indian database on postirradiation 
examination of irradiated coolant channels had 
been considerably expanded, permitting sound validation of models that had been developed in 
India for assessing the ageing of coolant channels. He noted with satisfaction that the 
Agency's International Working Group on Advanced Technologies for Heavy Water Reactors 
had begun its work and he looked forward to very fruitful cooperation 
in that area. India 
would be happy to share its R&D results through the mechanism of coordinated 
research 
programmes under the auspices of that International Working Group. It was a member of the 
World Association of Nuclear Operators, which it had recently invited to carry out a peer 
review of its nuclear power plant at Kakrapar. 
84. The existing oncethrough 
fuel cycle strategies used a mere 1% of the energy potential 
of uranium. In the context of sustainable development, attention should be focused on breeder 
reactors, which would permit far more efficient use of uranium. The fastbreeder 
test 
reactor at Kalpakkam had been operating satisfactorily for a decade at power levels of up 
to 12 MW(th). The new fuel, of Indian design, which consisted of 70% PuC and 30% UC, 
had made it possible to achieve a burnup of 36 000 MWd/t without any pin failure, and the 
results of postirradiation 
examination of the fuel and the performance of the sodium systems 
of the steam generators were very encouraging. An important milestone had been reached in 
July 1997 with the connection of the fastbreeder 
test reactor to the regional electricity grid. 
A decade of operation of that reactor had provided valuable knowledge which had paved the 
way for the design and development of a sodiumcooled 
prototype fastbreeder 
reactor, 
construction of which was expected to start by the turn of the century. The 30 kW Kamini 
233U

experimental reactor, which used fuel fabricated in India, had gone critical in 
October 1996 and had reached full power very recently. It would be used for neutron 
radiography, particularly of fast reactor fuel and for neutron activation analysis. The 
technology had been developed for the reprocessing of thorium irradiated in Indian reactors, 
for the extraction of 233U and for the fabrication of fuel elements using that fissile material, 
marking a further milestone in India's efforts to exploit its vast thorium reserves to meet its 
longterm 
energy needs. The design of an advanced heavy water reactor using plutonium and 
233U was nearing completion and preparations were being made to establish an experimental 
critical facility for studying the physics of that reactor and of 500 MW(e) pressurized heavy 
water reactors. The programme of progressive introduction of MOX fuel in the reactors at 
Tarapur was proceeding satisfactorily. On the basis of its own technology along with 
imported lightwater 
reactors, India hoped to have 20 000 MW(e) installed nuclear capacity 
by 2020. 



GC(41)/OR.4 
page 21 


85. The Indian nuclear industry aimed to achieve total safety, which presupposed a 
constant quest for excellence. India was one of the few countries which had implemented the 
recommendations contained in ICRP publication 60 on the dose limits for radiation workers. 
The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board had done so by progressively applying lower dose limits 
from 1991. The Board enforced radiation safety measures not only in nuclear power plants 
but also in installations of the Department of Atomic Energy and other facilities that used 
radiation and radioactive materials for medical, industrial and research purposes. The Board 
was also pursuing a unique project aimed at bringing 30 000 medical Xray 
units under formal 
regulatory control. 
86. India had always been keen on the development of a convention on the safety of 
radioactive waste management and had participated actively in the relevant negotiations. 
Although in 1994 the General Conference had requested that the future convention cover 
waste safety, spent fuel had now also been included. India, which had a closed fuel cycle, had 
consistently been opposed to the inclusion in the Convention of spent fuel, which it considered 
to be a valuable resource. 
87. A dynamic nuclear power programme also provided the impetus for the accelerated 
development of other nuclear applications in medicine, agriculture and industry and had many 
beneficial spinoffs. 
India was producing over a hundred types of radioisotope. Using a 
radiationinduced 
mutant variety and the latest agricultural techniques, a farmer from the State 
of Maharashtra had achieved a record harvest of 9.4 tonnes of groundnuts per hectare. The 
Ministry of Health had approved irradiation processing of several food products, and an 
irradiation plant with a capacity to process up to 12 000 tonnes a year was under construction 
at Navi Mumbai. 
88. The Indian Centre for Advanced Technology was developing two synchrotron 
radiation sources of 450 MeV and 2 GeV, and it had also developed powerful lasers for 
industrial applications. More than a dozen surgical CO2 lasers were currently used in Indian 
hospitals. The Centre had also developed a laser fluorimeter which could detect extremely 
low concentrations of uranium in water. Two of those fluorimeters had been donated to the 
Agency's laboratories in Seibersdorf. Another unit of the Department of Atomic Energy the 
Electronics Corporation of India was 
involved in the design, development and manufacture 
of complex control and instrumentation equipment for Indian nuclear power plants. Indian 
research workers had successfully developed neutron instrumentation, radiation monitoring 
and radiation data acquisition systems, as well as a computerized operator information system 
which provided data on some 10 000 plant parameters. Spinoff 
techniques had been 
developed by other units of the Department of Atomic Energy and by other organizations in a 
number of fields such as cancer research, molecular biology, astronomy and management of 
municipal waste. 
89. India had established a very efficient export control regime. There were three lists of 
monitored items one 
for items whose export was banned, another for substances and 
equipment whose export could only be conducted through specific organizations, and a third 
for special materials, equipment and technology whose export was authorized by the 

GC(41)/OR4 
page 22 


competent ministries in conjunction with the Ministry of Commerce. By applying such a 
regime with selfimposed 
controls on the export of sensitive material and technology, India 
could pride itself on never having transferred nuclear technology or material to a country 
which had then misused it. Like any other responsible member of the nuclear community, it 
was in favour of export controls to prevent diversion of sensitive items. 


90. The Agency's fortieth anniversary was a good time to take stock of technical 
cooperation 
activities. India had repeatedly stressed the need for a balance between the 
Agency's promotional and regulatory activities. Having always supported the Agency's 
technical cooperation 
activities, India wished to reiterate the need for TC to have assured and 
predictable funding. In the coming year, the indicative planning figures for 1999 and beyond 
would be discussed and it would be necessary to ensure that those figures were adequate. As 
in the past, India would be pledging the full amount of its share of the TCF for 1998 and 
would honour its commitments as it had always done. 
91. India welcomed the satisfactory implementation of Model Projects. Indian experts had 
participated in water desalination projects initiated by the Agency. A nuclear desalination 
plant was being set up at Kalpakkam and wider applications of that technology were being 
considered. India was also interested in the sterile insect technique, which could perhaps one 
day be used to control the anopheles mosquito, which was a carrier of malaria, and was 
pleased that the Agency was showing interest in starting a project in that area. 
92. RCA had now been in existence for 25 years. Having started as a joint project 
between India, Philippines and the Agency, it had then been extended to 17 countries and had 
served as a model for similar initiatives in Africa and Latin America. The RCA was thus a 
focus for technical cooperation 
among developing countries; it should be even more proactive 
in tackling development questions, both through its own projects and by combining its efforts 
with those of other organizations such as the UNDP. India hoped that the Agency would act 
as a catalyst in promoting the RCA's activities, and it would continue to make substantial 
inkind 
contributions to that programme. 
93. The Agency's fortieth anniversary was also an occasion for examining whether the 
Agency's original objectives were still being pursued. The Agency's mission was to promote 
the development of nuclear power in developing countries, where it would be an indispensable 
option to meet future energy needs. The time had come to ask whether the Agency had not 
faltered in that task and whether it was indeed still performing the role of scientific and 
technological pioneer. Its lack of dynamism in promoting nuclear energy to eliminate poverty 
and to protect the global environment had had the result that in a recent United Nations 
document, nuclear energy was referred to only in the context of safety and nonproliferation. 
In the coming years, the Agency should aim to promote nuclear technology and its 
applications in developing countries more vigorously. In that respect, he welcomed the 
appointment of Mr. ElBaradei as the next Director General of the Agency. The rosy future for 
nuclear energy painted in the late 1950s had only been partially realized, mainly in developed 
countries. A change in orientation would perhaps help to make those hopes materialize more 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 23 


in the developing countries where, in addition to providing electricity and numerous other 
benefits, nuclear programmes served as a catalyst for all high technology development. 


94. Mr. SADIQUE (Bangladesh) paid tribute to the Agency which was 
celebrating 40 years of activities in the interests of nonproliferation 
and the promotion of the 
use of nuclear techniques in many areas. Bangladesh was deeply grateful to the IAEA and 
Mr. Blix for the services they had rendered, and congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his 
appointment as Director General. It also welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as members of 
the Agency. 
95. Human knowledge, often acquired at great pains, should be applied to help improve 
the quality of life and enhance economic prosperity. Bangladesh was resolved to use nuclear 
energy solely for the good of humanity and, as the only country in its region which had signed 
the NPT and CTBT, it was heartened to see some signs of peace. However, as it entered the 
third millennium, humanity was confronted with various problems and barriers to development 
which threatened to get worse, and the supply of energy was of vital importance if they were 
to be overcome. The developing countries currently accounted for the vast majority of the 
world population yet their per caput energy consumption was very low. Even a modest 
increase in that level of consumption would exert unprecedented pressure on the dwindling 
global reserves of fossil fuel, which would certainly have an impact on availability and price. 
96. In the event of an energy crisis, the developed countries would be less severely 
affected since they had the financial and physical resources, expertise and infrastructure to 
allow them to adapt to a new situation more easily. In most of those countries, nuclear energy 
could mitigate the effect of an energy crisis; however, the rest of the world was not so 
fortunate. In many countries, greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels constituted a 
potential danger to the environment which could hold back the development of the energy 
sector. In that connection, "clean" nuclear power could prove invaluable since its particularly 
advanced technology considerably diminished the threat to the environment. Nuclear energy 
would therefore seem to provide the answer to energy security problems. Uncertainties over 
safety and waste management were often perceived as the main obstacle to the adoption of 
nuclear technology, but realistic technical solutions to those difficulties were now available. 
97. Bangladesh attached high priority to increasing energy production. In view of the 
country's power shortage, its very limited resources, and its vulnerability to the environmental 
risks of the swiftly decreasing forest cover, the Prime Minister had emphasized time and again 
the need to introduce nuclear power. 
98. There was still some concern that nuclear technology could be diverted for military 
purposes. However, international inspection and surveillance capabilities were so highly 
developed as to make such fears groundless. It was inconceivable that any diversion should 
occur in the face of current and planned safeguards measures. 
99. Concerted and objective efforts would be required from the Agency to convince the 
international community of the viability of and the increasing need for nuclear power, in 
particular in the developing countries. It would have to persuade international financial 

GC(41)/OR4 
page 24 


institutions and credit guarantee agencies to increase their contributions in order to respond to 
those needs; those institutions had to be shown that nuclear power was safe, economical, 
reliable and workable in developing countries. The Agency should include in its agenda, as a 
priority item, the introduction of nuclear power in developing countries in the hope that, when 
it celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, that objective would have been achieved. 


100. Bangladesh was continuing its efforts to exploit the results of various R&D projects, 
including such concerned with applications of nondestructive 
testing techniques in industry, 
health care services, elemental analysis, maintenance of electronic equipment, environmental 
monitoring, radiation protection, food preservation and sterilization of medical supplies. Since 
the enactment of the nuclear safety and radiation control law in 1993, activities in those areas 
had intensified and nuclear safety and radiation control regulations had just been published. 
The public authorities were currently strengthening the infrastructure and developing the 
human resources required to apply the law. In that context, Agency technical assistance to 
Bangladesh was of crucial importance. Apart from the various technical assistance projects 
under way, additional projects had been launched under the Agency's research contract 
programme. Bangladesh appreciated the Agency's unfailing support for its various R&D 
programmes on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and hoped that that cooperation 
would 
continue and expand in the future. 
101. Bangladesh was actively involved in various projects under the RCA. The exchange of 
experience between countries in the region facilitated by the RCA had many positive effects 
and those activities should be expanded. In particular, projects on the application of nuclear 
techniques in industry, medicine and agriculture would help the region confront the challenges 
of the next century. The scope of the project on energy, electricity and nuclear power 
planning should also be extended. 
102. Mr. KENIK (Belarus), speaking on behalf of the Prime Minister and 
Government of Belarus, congratulated the Agency on its fortieth anniversary and recalled that 
Belarus was one of the founder members of that august body whose mission was to promote 
multilateral cooperation 
in the area of nuclear and radiation safety. Belarus considered the 
Agency to be one of the most efficient organizations in the United Nations system and hoped 
that the constructive relations between it and the Agency would be further developed in the 
interests of the Belarus people who had suffered more than any other from the Chernobyl 
disaster the 
most serious radiological accident of the twentieth century and 
would also 
contribute to nuclear safety at the regional and global levels. His country was convinced that 
the Director General elect, Mr. ElBaradei, would give new impetus to intergovernmental 
cooperation 
within the Agency and would be able to capitalize on the invaluable legacy left by 
his predecessor, Mr. Blix. 
103. In achieving independence, Belarus, like other newly independent States had been 
faced with a host of problems in the area of nuclear safety and radiation protection. Nuclear 
safety was a matter of particular importance to the people of Belarus who had suffered terribly 
from the Chernobyl disaster. Belarus was especially concerned about the safety of nuclear 
facilities located around its borders. Recognizing the role and importance of the Convention 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 25 


on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, which it had signed in May 1997, Belarus had taken 
steps at the political and industrial level to strengthen international cooperation 
in the nuclear 
field. Furthermore, specialists from Belarus were currently carrying out an indepth 
analysis of 
another important document aimed at strengthening safety the 
Convention on Nuclear 
Safety with 
a view to Belarus' possible accession. 


104. Belarus attached great significance to the strengthening of the international safeguards 
system. Technical issues relating to nuclear material accounting and control were to a large 
extent dealt with at the facilities of the "Sosny" scientific and technical complex of the 
National Academy of Sciences, where almost all the country's nuclear material was located. 
The relevant departments of the Academy of Sciences were overseeing Belarus' compliance 
with the NPT and its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
105. The United States, Japan and Sweden had provided Belarus with considerable 
technical assistance to help it establish a national system for accounting and control of nuclear 
materials. A physical protection system for nuclear materials had been established, a new 
storage centre had been commissioned and the accounting and control system was currently 
being computerized. The measuring systems that had been set up provided a means not only 
of accounting for nuclear material, but also of monitoring the movement of such material 
within the country. That greatly facilitated the preparation of reports during national and 
international inspections, and the Government of Belarus therefore wished to thank the donor 
countries once again for their assistance. 
106. The "Sosny" complex had a good infrastructure for the control of nuclear material and 
its safeguards experts had very high standard qualifications. Belarus would therefore be happy 
to establish a regional training centre there with Agency assistance for the control and physical 
protection of nuclear materials. 
107. In July 1997, one of the most powerful neutron generators in the world had been put 
into operation at the complex. It would enable scientific studies to be carried out on nuclear 
and neutron physics, neutron therapy for cancer, radiation chemistry and other aspects of 
modern science. As far as practical applications were concerned, it would be widely used in 
medicine and in agriculture. Theoretical research by Belarus specialists also gave grounds for 
hoping that work on the transmutation of radioactive waste could be undertaken in the very 
near future. 
108. Belarus, like many other States, was implementing the Part 1 measures of 
Programme 93+2 by providing the Agency with more detailed information on its nuclear 
activities and allowing inspectors greater access to its facilities. 
109. In May 1997, the Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the 
Efficiency of the Safeguards System had completed its work to develop a draft Additional 
Protocol. The Committee was to be congratulated on elaborating the Protocol, aimed at 
strengthening the nonproliferation 
regime and building a climate of confidence essential for 
complete disarmament, the more especially as it had been called upon to resolve difficult issues 
affecting the sovereignty of States, such as complementary access and the provision of 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 26 


confidential information. Belarus experts were studying the Protocol, which had been 
approved by the Board of Governors, very carefully and were conducting additional 
consultations with countries producing nuclear materials with a view to reconciling the 
provisions of the Protocol with the terms of the bilateral agreements concluded with those 
countries. 


110. Belarus was taking various steps to strengthen all aspects of radiation protection. 
Parliament was currently considering two bills, one on the use of nuclear energy and radiation 
safety and the other on the radiation protection of the population. With regard to the latter, 
the Government of Belarus had made it a priority to tackle the safety problems associated with 
the waste arising in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. It had therefore completed the 
work on the establishment and certification of stores for decontamination waste containing 
radionuclides. Belarus believed that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management that had recently been 
adopted would help to harmonize action taken and consolidate the efforts of various countries 
aimed at strengthening international cooperation 
in that area. 
111. Belarus was pleased to note that its links with the Agency in the area of technical 
cooperation 
had increased considerably over the previous three years. The improvement in 
the modalities of provision of Agency technical assistance, such as consideration of national 
interests, qualitative selection of project proposals and tailoring the projects to the endusers 
was contributing greatly to increased project efficiency. 
112. Belarus had welcomed the Model Project entitled "Upgrading Radiation Protection 
Infrastructure" and was satisfied with the initial results achieved. Involving other States of the 
region in tackling problems associated with the radiation protection of the population gave the 
project a regional character and could in the long term give new impetus to intergovernmental 
relations in that sphere. 
113. The implementation in Belarus of projects such as the one on biolubricants from 
rapeseed grown on contaminated land was a good illustration of the close and efficient 
cooperation 
that his country had developed with the Agency. The reincorporation into the 
economic cycle of land contaminated after the Chernobyl accident, the improvement in the 
sociological and psychological climate in the region and the commercial impact of the products 
obtained illustrated that the humanitarian and economic interests of Belarus and the Agency 
coincided. 
114. In addition to the aforementioned priorities, Belarus wished to strengthen its 
cooperation 
with the Agency in the short term in the following areas: improvement of 
nuclear medicine services, efficient use of land contaminated by the Chernobyl disaster and 
creation of a reliable emergency response system in the event of a nuclear accident, all of 
which was consistent with Belarus' programme of sustainable development for the third 
millennium. 
115. In conclusion, having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso to the Agency, he 
recommended approval of the Annual Report for 1996 and the budget for 1998.

Mr. 
VALENTUKEVICIU 
S 
(Lithuania) 
congratulated 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
on 
his 
election 
and 
assured 
him 
of 
Lithuania's 
support. 
He 
also 
welcomed 
Malta 
and 
Burkina 
Faso 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
they 
would 
make 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
Lithuanian 
delegation 
commended 
the 
role 
played 
by 
Mr. 
Blix 
in 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
international 
legal 
documents 
regulating 
the 
obligations 
of 
States 
in 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
sphere. 
117. 
For 
five 
years 
now 
Lithuania 
had 
been 
a 
major 
producer 
of 
nuclear-generated 
electricity. 
The 
previous 
year, 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
produced 
84% 
of 
the 
country's 
electricity. 
Lithuania 
therefore 
reiterated 
its 
thanks 
to 
Mr. 
Blix 
for 
helping 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
energy, 
which 
had 
become 
an 
intrinsic 
part 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
118. 
His 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency's 
fortieth 
anniversary 
had 
been 
marked 
by 
the 
signature 
of 
several 
documents 
which 
would 
have 
a 
significant 
bearing 
on 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
twenty-first 
century. 
The 
implementation 
of 
their 
provisions 
would, 
however, 
pose 
a 
number 
of 
difficulties, 
particularly 
with 
respect 
to 
financing. 
Lithuania, 
for 
example, 
had 
the 
problem 
of 
insuring 
the 
Ignalina 
plant, 
which 
could 
only 
be 
done 
through 
the 
large 
international 
insurance 
companies. 
119. 
Lithuania 
supported 
Programme 
93+2 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
endorsed 
the 
statements 
made 
by 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
that 
regard. 
It 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
in 
1991 
and 
had 
signed 
the 
corresponding 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
1992. 
In 
order 
to 
applytheNPTandto 
be 
able 
to 
controlnuclearmaterialinLithuania, 
the 
StateNuclear 
Power 
Safety 
Inspectorate 
-VATESI 
-was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
creating 
a 
State 
control 
and 
accounting 
system 
and 
had 
already 
drawn 
up 
the 
necessary 
regulations. 
The 
bulk 
of 
the 
material 
concerned 
was 
spent 
fuel 
from 
Ignalina 
but 
some 
also 
came 
from 
other 
industrial 
and 
medical 
applications. 
120. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
specific 
nature 
of 
the 
nuclear 
material 
in 
Lithuania, 
the 
Agency 
was 
arranging 
quarterly 
inspections 
to 
verify 
that 
all 
the 
material 
reported 
by 
other 
States 
as 
having 
been 
exported 
to 
the 
country 
had 
reached 
its 
destination 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
changes 
in 
the 
volume 
of 
nuclear 
material 
corresponded 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
electricity 
produced. 
Lithuania 
had 
accepted 
the 
Agency's 
proposals 
regarding 
the 
simplified 
procedure 
for 
the 
designation 
of 
inspectors 
and 
had 
made 
the 
necessary 
arrangements 
to 
facilitate 
their 
entry 
into 
the 
country. 
121. 
Physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
was 
another 
important 
aspect 
of 
the 
NPT. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material, 
to 
which 
Lithuania 
had 
acceded 
in 
1994, 
the 
national 
authorities 
had 
elaborated 
procedures 
adapted 
to 
local 
conditions 
but 
also 
meeting 
international 
standards. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Economy, 
in 
close 
co-operation 
with 
VATESI, 
was 
supervising 
export 
procedures, 
analysing 
requests 
for 
import, 
export 
and 
transit 
of 
material 
and 
issuing 
licences. 
Lithuania 
looked 
forward 
to 
further 
strengthening 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
was 
preparing 
to 
sign 
that 
very 
day 
the 
Additional 
Protocol 
to 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
Government 
of 
Lithuania 
and 
the 
IAEA 
for 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 28 


122. Lithuania was making great efforts to improve the safety of the Ignalina nuclear power 
plant. It was grateful to its Western partners and the international organizations which had 
provided assistance in that area. Recalling the national policy of transparency with regard to 
nuclear power, he said that the safety analysis report which had been completed the previous 
year was the first exhaustive document of that type for RBMK reactors. With the support of 
the Lithuanian Government, the Ignalina nuclear power plant had developed a new safety 
improvement programme up to the year 1999. One outstanding strategic issue which would 
be difficult to resolve in the near future was that of the final repository for spent nuclear fuel. 
A coordinated 
effort on the part of many countries would be required to deal with it. In 
welcoming the Agency's activities with respect to the management of radioactive waste from 
medical, industrial and agricultural applications, Lithuania looked forward to similar 
programmes being developed to tackle the problems associated with spent fuel. 
123. Lithuanian experts were receiving considerable assistance in various fields through the 
Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. At present, four national projects were being 
implemented and Lithuania was involved in several regional projects. Lithuanian experts thus 
had the opportunity to expand their knowledge through participation in international 
workshops, conferences and symposia. That cooperation 
had enabled them to gain a better 
understanding of local problems and share their experience with foreign experts. 
124. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) congratulated the new Director General 
on his election and paid tribute to his predecessor. Welcoming Malta and Burkina Faso as 
members of the Agency, he noted that the increase in the number of Member States was clear 
evidence of the Agency's success in its mission. The Agency could indeed be proud of its 
achievements over the past 40 years, particularly the access of the developing countries to 
nuclear technology, which had been greatly facilitated by the Agency's training programmes. 
The nineweek 
training course to be held in Damascus in Arabic was particularly welcome and 
it was to be hoped that others would follow. The Agency should increase its technical support 
to the developing countries to enable them to exploit the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy and close the technological gap. 
125. The policy of the Syrian Arab Republic was based on the principle of enhancing 
international peace and security in accordance with the principles and objectives of the United 
Nations, as demonstrated by its accession in 1969 to the NPT, its commitment in 1992 to 
accept comprehensive safeguards and its active participation in the Committee on the 
establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. However, 
whereas Syria was working towards strengthening the effectiveness and improving the 
efficiency of the safeguards system, Israel still maintained the threat of its nuclear arsenal and 
sought to impose its status quo policy on the region. 
126. The fact that Israel was the only country in the region with a military nuclear 
programme, which was not subject to any kind of international control, endangered the already 
explosive situation in the Middle East. Its persistent postponement of its accession to the NPT 
to a later stage of the peace process could not but raise doubts as to its real intentions and thus 
further hamper that process. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 29 


127. The peace process had been deadlocked since the present Israeli Prime Minister had 
taken office. His Government had reneged on all the agreements concluded by the previous 
Government and continued to violate international law by making extensive plans to build new 
settlements in the Golan Heights, the West Bank and Jerusalem as part of a largescale 
occupation process, in defiance of the United Nations General Assembly resolution of 
17 July 1997. One wondered how long the international community was prepared to allow the 
Israeli Prime Minister to destroy all chance of peace and exacerbate tension in the Middle 
East. 
128. Israel continued to create obstacles to a just and global peace and to block all 
international initiatives to bring the peace negotiations back into line with the Madrid 
Conference resolutions and the "land for peace" principle, and sought only to occupy Arab 
lands by force whilst threatening to use nuclear weapons. Syria aspired to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace that would bring security to all peoples of the region and not only Israel. 
Security was the product of peace, not of force. Syria therefore demanded that the Israeli 
Government resume negotiations from the point reached under the previous Government, 
which had agreed to complete withdrawal from Golan to the borders of 4 June 1967. That 
demand was in line with the most elementary international standards. 
129. In view of the conclusions of the Group of Experts appointed in 1981 by the United 
Nations SecretaryGeneral 
to make a study of Israel's nuclear armaments, and the resolution 
on the Middle East passed by the NPT Review and Extension Conference, it was regrettable 
that the report of the Director General on the implementation of resolution GC(40)/RES/22 
had not revealed the results of his negotiations with the countries of the region aimed at 
having all nuclear activities in the region placed under comprehensive safeguards. The report 
should at least have indicated the States with which consultations had been held and their 
positions on the relevant resolutions. 
130. The Syrian Arab Republic now called upon the General Conference to implement the 
relevant international resolutions, especially resolution 487(1981) which required Israel to 
place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. As Israel was the only country in the 
region that possessed nuclear weapons, the General Conference should also expressly call on 
Israel to apply Agency safeguards. His delegation urged the Director General to take the 
necessary measures to implement the relevant resolutions, and to put pressure on Israel to 
submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, bearing in mind that the nuclearweaponfree 
zone in Africa would not have been possible, had South Africa not abandoned the nuclear 
option in response to international pressure. 
131. Any waiving of the rules to accept Israel's nonaccession 
to the NPT, any attempt to 
avoid mentioning the fact in the General Conference resolution on the application of 
safeguards in the Middle East or failure to exert pressure on Israel to comply with 
international law would point to the use of double standards, and encourage the arms race. 
132. The purpose of amending Article VI of the Statute was to increase the representation 
of the areas of Africa and Middle East and South Asia on the Board of Governors so as to 
achieve equitable representation of the eight area groups referred to in that Article. Linking 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 30 


the question of the composition of regional groups to that of expansion of the Board of 
Governors would only delay resolution of the latter, which was by far the most pressing issue. 
In that connection, it should be recalled that the Director General's report to the 40th session 
of the General Conference (GC(40)/l 1) had stated that "According to information provided by 
the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, the composition of the various groups is entirely in 
the hands of the groups themselves." Syria did not deny any country the right of belonging to 
a regional group but it refused to admit Israel to the Middle East and South Asia area group 
while some countries of that group were subject to Israeli aggression. Israel was occupying 
Arab lands and building new settlements there, threatening to use nuclear weapons, driving out 
Arab people and subjecting them to extreme violence, while at the same time claiming that it 
was the object of discrimination. One might well ask what the General Conference hoped to 
achieve by imposing a member on an area group that did not want it, thereby risking disrupting 
or even paralysing the activities of that group within the Agency. The principle of 
geographical proximity was obsolete. Paragraph 8 of the Director General's report, 
(GC(40)/ll) stated that "Article VI.A.I of the Statute does not speak of 'geographical 
groups' but rather refers to areas, not all of which are necessarily geographical .... Further, 
even with respect to 'areas' that appear to be purely geographical (e.g. 'Middle East and 
South Asia' ...) the Statute gives no guidance as to the boundaries of, or the Member States 
that are within, these ... areas. Nor has the Board or the General Conference developed any 
criteria or other guidance to determine whether a Member State is within one of the areas 
specified in Article VI of the Statute." The same report also stated in paragraph 14 that "... 
the attribution of a State to a particular area is one in which factors other than geographical 
considerations play a role." 


133. The matter of amendment of Article VI had already cost too much time, energy and 
money, and linking it to two other quite unrelated issues, would never lead to consensus. 
134. The role played by INIS as a source of information on the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy was extremely valuable. Syria wished to pay tribute to its staff and called on the 
Agency to provide it with all the necessary resources. 
135. The Agency was also to be commended on its efforts in support of technical 
cooperation 
projects aimed at solving the economic and social problems of Member States, 
for example the regional project on isotope hydrology techniques in water resource 
management. The economic feasibility studies on the use of miniature reactors to produce 
potable water and electricity in areas affected by or likely to be affected by water shortages 
were also important. Syria also commended the Agency on the information it provided to 
Member States on illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources in view 
of the real and potential danger it posed to people and the environment. 
136. In conclusion he emphasized the importance of cooperation 
between the Arab Atomic 
Energy Agency and the IAEA in the context of regional technical cooperation 
projects. 
137. Mr. JOSEPH (Australia), having congratulated Burkina Faso and Malta on 
joining the Agency, welcomed the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei as new Director General and 
paid tribute to Mr. Blix for his model professionalism. After tracing the events leading to the 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 31 


Agency's establishment 40 years previously, he noted that Australia was one of the founder 
members of the organization and had been closely involved in drafting the Statute. The 
Agency's original atoms for peace vocation had rapidly diversified and negotiations had begun 
with a view to establishing a safeguards system designed to prevent the diversion of nuclear 
material for military purposes and limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thus, from the 
outset, the Agency had had a dual mission: to promote the contribution of nuclear energy to 
peace, health and prosperity and to ensure, through the application of safeguards, that nuclear 
material and facilities were used exclusively for peaceful purposes. 


138. With the entry into force of the NPT in 1970, the Agency had been given the 
responsibility of verifying, through onsite 
inspections, that States were complying with their 
obligations under the Treaty, which involved an unprecedented surrender of national 
sovereignty. During the subsequent two decades, the safeguards system had never been 
seriously tested. Each year, the Agency had informed the Board of Governors that no 
safeguarded material had been diverted for military or other unknown purposes. Confidence 
in the system had grown and an increasing number of nonnuclearweapon 
States had acceded 
to the NPT. Furthermore, the safeguards system had become a model for other areas of arms 
control. The START I and II Treaties, the negotiations for the Chemical Weapons 
Convention and the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty and the Treaty on Conventional 
Armed Forces in Europe all provided for inspection systems reflecting the safeguards system 
developed by the Agency in the 1950s. 
139. The system's integrity and reliability had suddenly been called into question with the 
discovery in 1991 of Iraq's clandestine nuclearweapons 
programme and then by the DPRK's 
false declaration regarding its plutonium inventory. The consequent effort to strengthen the 
safeguards system had resulted in the Additional Protocol approved in May. Although that 
new instrument was by no means infallible, the obligation to supply far more detailed 
information and to provide inspectors with greater freedom of access, together with the 
authority for the Agency to use new technologies, would make for more thorough verification. 
The new Protocol therefore adapted the safeguards systems to presentday 
realities and should 
make it more efficient. 
140. Australia, which had always supported the strengthening of safeguards, had taken part 
in all the negotiations. The previous week, it had been the first Member State to conclude and 
sign a bilateral protocol with the Agency incorporating the new provisions. The Protocol now 
had to be made a living reality and States had to be encouraged to adopt it as soon as possible 
as the new standard for safeguards agreements with the Agency. While it was important to 
focus on States with significant nuclear activities, assistance should also be provided to other 
States in clarifying the extent of their obligations and demonstrating that for many of them 
compliance would not be onerous. Only through universal accession could the common 
objective of a strengthened safeguards system be achieved. 
141. The strengthening of safeguards, the Agency's role and the NPT were inextricably 
linked. The NPT in particular had proved extremely successful. To date, it had 186 parties, 
with Brazil also due to accede shortly. The large membership showed that the international 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 32 


community was confident that the Treaty could prevent the spread of nuclear military 
technology and that it also recognized the Agency's efficiency in verification matters. 


142. Two years after the indefinite extension of the NPT preparations were now beginning 
for the sixth Review Conference to be held in the year 2000. The decisions that had 
accompanied the indefinite extension and the activities to be undertaken as part of the review 
process presented the international community with an exacting task in which the Agency 
would again be called upon to play a key role. 
143. In addition to safeguards, the Agency had two other important functions, namely to 
promote the adoption of the best international standards for nuclear safety and radiation 
protection and to promote the peaceful development of nuclear energy, including in 
developing countries. The Agency's dual role was part of the political compact between 
States that underpinned the international nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. Australia was 
therefore a keen supporter of the Agency's cooperation 
programmes and would again be 
contributing an amount approximately equivalent to $ 1 million to the TCF the following year. 
It would also continue to participate in the work of the Standing Advisory Group on Technical 
Assistance and Cooperation 
(SAGTAC). 
144. Australia also attached great significance to the RCA which was celebrating its 25th 
anniversary in 1997. That programme had proved to be an effective tool for regional 
cooperation 
in the nuclear area with the emphasis on regional management arrangements in 
line with the objectives of TCDC. It was important to broaden the funding base for the RCA 
and, in that regard, the increasing number of participating States making direct financial 
contributions to the programme was particularly welcome. 
145. Australia was considering providing extrabudgetary funding of approximately 
1.5 million Australian dollars over the following three years in order to finance a RCA/IAEA 
project on the application of radioisotope technology to sustainable infrastructure 
development in Asia and the Pacific. The areas covered, such as civil engineering, radiation 
protection and regional education in nuclear medicine, were of a high enough priority to 
attract significant matching funding from UNDP. 
146. Another direct contribution by Australia to regional technology was its own research 
capability. His Government had announced that it was intending to replace the HIFAR 
research reactor, which dated back to the 1950s, with a stateoftheart 
research reactor that 
would cater for the scientific and technical needs not only of Australia but also of the Asia and 
Pacific region as a whole. 
147. In accordance with its Statute, the Agency had contributed significantly to nuclear 
safety by developing the various conventions that had entered into force in the 1980s and, 
more recently, the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Each of those instruments required that the 
Parties observe certain basic standards and be subject to peer reviews. Furthermore, over the 
years, it had developed nuclear safety standards which took the form of recommendations, as 
well as organizing training activities and peer reviews and providing advisory services via 
panels of safety experts. Finally, there were now three new instruments dealing with spent fuel 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 33 


management, radioactive waste management and liability in the event of a nuclear accident 
which together formed a vital part of the international legal infrastructure in the nuclear field. 
It was now important that States, particularly those with nuclear programmes or those which 
were considering such programmes, sign and ratify the new conventions, not least to reassure 
neighbouring States. 


148. Australia had been one of the first signatories of the Convention on Nuclear Safety 
which it had proceeded to ratify. It was also intending to sign the new Joint Convention on 
the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management when 
domestic consultations were completed; furthermore, it would also be signing the Convention 
on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage during the present session of the 
General Conference. That Convention offered particular protection to countries that did not 
have nuclear power facilities but were exposed to the same risks as those with such facilities 
because of their proximity or other factors. Australia attached special importance to the 
provision of that Convention which accorded jurisdiction to the coastal State in the event of an 
accident within the exclusive economic zone. 
149. In general, greater importance was being attached to nuclear safety issues everywhere, 
including the Asia and Pacific region. For that reason, Australia had welcomed the 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in Asia which had been held the previous year on Japan's 
initiative, and it was looking forward to the next conference to be held in Seoul. For its part, 
Australia would continue to contribute in different areas. It had hosted a workshop on nuclear 
safety culture at the beginning of the year, and another workshop on the application of safety 
culture to research reactors was planned for the following year. The Government had recently 
announced the setting up of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency 
(ARPANS A) with the task of developing a regulatory framework and an integrated licensing 
and auditing system covering the country's radiation and nuclear activities. 
150. The transboundary movement of radioactive waste was a matter of particular concern 
in the region. The intended shipment of waste from Taiwan to the DPRK had caused great 
anxiety, as had the shipment of highlevel 
radioactive waste from Europe to Japan at the 
beginning of the year. At the time of that shipment, Australia had been pleased to receive 
assurances that the waste was being shipped under conditions which met or exceeded relevant 
IAEA and IMO safety standards. While it had welcomed the efforts made to inform the South 
Pacific countries of the shipment, there was still room for greater transparency, particularly 
with regard to the route and the liability coverage. Such information should be made public 
when that was consistent with the safety and security requirements of the shipments. Wide 
adherence to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage would 
obviously help to promote public acceptance of future shipments of highlevel 
radioactive 
waste or spent fuel through the South Pacific. 
151. One of the Agency's most difficult tasks was monitoring the freeze on the reactors in 
Nyongbyon in the DPRK. Although the monitoring process itself was progressing 
satisfactorily, it evidently did not extend to allowing some important measurements of the 
piutonium content of the spent fuel rods. Furthermore, little progress had been made on the 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 34 


issue of the preservation of certain information relevant to the history of the DPRK's nuclear 
programme, making it difficult for the Agency to verify whether the DPRK was in compliance 
with its safeguards agreement. The situation had become a stalemate. Rightly or wrongly, the 
question of the DPRK's acceptance of its obligations had become a regular item on the agenda 
of the General Conference and remained a grave regional and global security concern. It was 
therefore essential that the DPRK be induced to accept its obligations, including accounting 
for its past reprocessing activities. 


152. On the other hand, the Agreed Framework between the United States and the DPRK 
was yielding better results. Australia welcomed the progress achieved through the Korean 
Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), which had begun preparing the site for 
the lightwater 
reactors and had also delivered appreciable quantities of heavy fuel oil to the 
DPRK. Australia was providing substantial financial assistance to KEDO which it considered 
as an investment not 
only for the energy requirements of the DPRK, but also for the peace 
and security of the Korean peninsula and for North East Asia as a whole. 
153. Iraq was another issue of concern. The efforts by UNSCOM and the Agency's Action 
Team had succeeded in gaining an accurate picture of Iraq's past nuclear programme in the 
face of Iraqi prevarication and misinformation. Although it was important to know the extent 
of that programme, it was even more important to ensure that it was not revived. The onus 
for that lay not just on the Agency but also on prospective suppliers of nuclear material and 
technology, who should be ultracautious. 
154. Australia remained a strong supporter of nuclear export controls which were an 
essential component of the NPT regime and a useful complement to the safeguards system. 
The controls should not be interpreted negatively since they underpinned the NPT, served the 
objectives of the several nuclearweaponfree 
zones and facilitated transfers consistent with 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The decision to convene an international seminar on the 
role of export controls at the end of the General Conference was a very welcome initiative. 
155. Australia was very interested in the study undertaken under the Agency's auspices on 
the radiological situation of the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls in the South Pacific. That 
study had been in progress for almost two years and would lead to recommendations on the 
form, scale and duration of any remedial action or monitoring required. According to the 
progress report before the General Conference, the study was quite advanced and some 
preliminary findings had already been formulated. Australia was looking forward to receiving 
the final text of the report in February 1998. Its scientists had participated in the sampling 
programme conducted at the atolls, in the analysis of samples at Australian laboratories and in 
coordinating 
the study to assess the longterm 
impact of the nuclear tests carried out at the 
atolls. Having thanked the Secretariat for keeping the South Pacific Forum informed of 
developments and taking steps to involve it in followup 
activities after publication of the 
report, he commended the French Government on the quality of the data provided to the 
Agency and on its spirit of cooperation. 

GC(41)/OR.4 
page 35 


156. The Agency deserved the excellent reputation that it had earned over the previous 
40 years. Over the next 40 years, it would continue to shoulder a heavy responsibility in a 
climate of budgetary stringency, and difficult decisions on priorities would need to be taken. 
Safeguards, the further development and updating of safety standards, and technical 
cooperation 
would remain key activities. The management of fissile material from dismantled 
nuclear weapons and illicit trafficking in nuclear material and technology were also important 
issues. The Agency might be called upon to play an important new verification role if the 
negotiations on a cutoff 
treaty were successful. It would also be charged with other 
verification responsibilities resulting from the implementation of various treaties establishing 
nuclearweaponfree 
zones. The agenda was burdensome and the Agency had therefore to 
have sufficient human and financial resources. An increase in costs would be inevitable as 
more material and facilities were brought under the Agency's various monitoring systems, and 
as the Agency discharged its task of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; however, 
the cost was negligible when set against the crucial role the Agency had to play. 
157. Stressing once again the vital importance of safeguards, he said that the Agency's 
ability to detect undeclared nuclear activity was the key to the attainment of a nuclearweaponfree 
world. Safeguards needed to be gradually extended to nuclear activity in the 
nuclearweapon 
States, the undeclared nuclearweapon 
States and threshold States,with 
the 
ultimate objective of fullscope 
safeguards being applied in all States. 
158. Mr. GHABRIAL (Organization of African Unity) read the following message 
from the SecretaryGeneral 
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Mr. Salim Ahmed 
Salim: 
"I wish to congratulate you (Mr. President) and the members of the General 
Committee on your unanimous election to direct the proceedings of the fortyfirst 
General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 


"The Organization of African Unity (OAU) and its Member States have great 
expectations of the role of the Agency in helping to achieve peace and development in 
the world in general and in Africa in particular. As you know, African leaders last year 
signed the Pelindaba Treaty in Cairo, demonstrating their will and commitment to 
make Africa a nuclearweaponfree 
zone. Moreover, we believe that the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear technology is of great benefit to our communities. Africa is intent 
on integrated sustainable socioeconomic 
development which depends totally on peace, 
security and stability. It is therefore Africa's hope that the Agency will continue its 
efforts in this respect, extending the scope of its activities in the region and stepping up 
its technical assistance to OAU Member States. I should also like to confirm that the 
OAU will continue to support the AFRA agreement under which important projects 
are under way or have already been implemented. I should also like to commend the 
IAEA on all its accomplishments in Africa which, I am sure, will be followed by many 
more. It is most gratifying for Africa to see one of its sons elected as head of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. I am confident that, as Director General, 



GC(41)/OR.4 
page 36 


Mr. ElBaradei will spare no effort to achieve the noble objectives of the Agency laid 
down in its Statute. 


"I should also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the outgoing 


Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, for the valuable service he rendered to the world at 


large and to the Agency in particular during his years of service with the Agency."

GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (continued) 
(GC(41)/8) 


1. Mr. GHAFOUR (Iraq) said that his country expected the Agency, as a 
specialized professional organization, not to bow to political influences when carrying out its 
obligation to implement paragraphs 12 and 13 of Section C of Security Council 
resolution 687. In accordance with paragraph 12, the Agency had destroyed, removed or 
rendered harmless the components of Iraq's nuclear programme, which included the nuclear 
material now in the custody of the Agency. The final dispatch of nuclear fuel to Russia had 
taken place in February 1994, and in a briefing to the Security Council on 7 November 1996, 
the Director General had stated that the Agency saw "no evidence of any remaining nuclear 
weapons capacity". 
2. The activities related to ongoing monitoring and verification had begun in 1992 and 
the Nuclear Monitoring Group, which carried out all field activities for that purpose, had been 
established in August 1994. According to paragraph 24 of the report by the Director General 
on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq which 
was contained in document GC(41)/20, the Agency had conducted 400 monitoring 
inspections at some 130 locations during the previous year. No indication of prohibited 
equipment, materials or activities had been detected during those inspections. He noted that 
all the monitoring activities had been carried out with the full cooperation 
of the Iraqi 
counterpart, which had been submitting semiannual 
declarations since 1992 and had 
continued to respond to any changes made to the format of the declarations. 
3. Iraq had submitted the final version of the full, final and complete declaration 
(FFCDF) 
on 7 September 1996. Although it had responded to the many remarks, requests 
and queries that had been received over the year which had elapsed since then, and despite the 
fact that several rounds of talks had taken place and a number of letters had been exchanged 
during that year, the Director General's report stated that the clarifications were still under 
evaluation. Furthermore, it claimed that the Iraqi counterpart had adopted a "minimalistic 
approach" in its replies which had resulted in the expenditure of additional time and effort to 
produce the necessary improvements in the FFCDF. 
However, most of the queries raised by 
the Agency's Action Team had been political in nature and, as such, had gone far beyond 
what was required for the declaration and far beyond the Agency's mandate. The remaining 
queries had been marginal and superfluous and could not alter the main picture which the 
Agency had already formed of Iraq's programme. 
4. Iraq had been concerned at the proposal submitted by the Action Team at the end of 
May 1997 to add a new chapter to the FFCDF 
summarizing the achievements and 
capabilities of Iraq's nuclear programme. Such information was already included in all the 
chapters of the declaration, and the proposed additional chapter would only delay submission 
of the Agency's report to the Security Council and the subsequent lifting of sanctions on the 
Iraqi people. 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 6 


5. Security Council resolution 687 had imposed obligations on the Agency as well as on 
Iraq, and it was incumbent upon the Agency to discharge its duties under that resolution 
without resorting to technically unjustified action that would delay the process. The Agency 
had a humanitarian responsibility towards the people of Iraq and should therefore not be a 
party to, or allow, intentionally or unintentionally, any attempts to subject the Iraqi people to 
starvation and genocide; nor should it permit obstacles to be put in the way of the provision 
of medical or agricultural assistance, as in the case of the IAEA/FAO joint project for the 
eradication of the screwworm. Furthermore, it should not allow its credibility to be called 
into question and should not become involved in raising minor issues that could be dealt with 
once paragraph 22 of Security Council resolution 687 had been put into effect. 
6. Mr. KALLIONÄKI (Finland) said that it seemed appropriate, in celebrating 
the Agency's 40th anniversary, to express appreciation to the three Directors General who 
had contributed decisively in the past to making the Agency such a wellfunctioning 
organization. Mr. Blix, had given it outstanding service during an eventful term of office, and 
Finland offered his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, its full support and cooperation 
in the 
Agency's further development. 
7. During the week Finland would be signing the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and he urged 
all other Member States to do the same as soon as possible. The Convention would 
contribute to a highlevel 
nuclear safety culture worldwide, although, regrettably, it did not 
cover the management of all spent fuel and radioactive waste. The issue was not a purely 
national one; it required that neighbouring countries be taken into account as well. Finland 
appealed especially to those countries which had been hesitant during the Diplomatic 
Conference to reconsider their positions and make a positive contribution towards the 
Convention's effective implementation. 
8. Finland also appreciated the completion of the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and looked forward to its wide ratification, 
although it would have preferred to see a higher level of compensation than was in fact 
provided for. 
9. The adoption of the Model Additional Protocol to supplement existing safeguards 
agreements was another important step deserving special recognition. It was important that 
adequate financial and organizational resources be allocated within the Agency to implement 
effectively the measures provided for in the Additional Protocol. 
10. Finally, he expressed Finland's appreciation of the draft Medium Term Perspective 
for 19982003, 
which provided a better basis for the Board of Governors and the General 
Conference to consider the Agency's programme and budget. 
11. Mr. WALKER (Canada), after praising Mr. Blix for managing the Agency so 
magnificently and welcoming his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, said that the past year would be 
seen as an eventful and even historic one for Agency safeguards. Important steps had been 
taken towards the creation of a safeguards system that confronted and remedied the 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 7 


shortcomings of the previous system which had been made particularly evident by events in 
Iraq. The new approach of developing a safeguards system mat was appropriate to a world 
with significantly fewer nuclear weapons would contribute to enhanced global security. 
Canada had indicated that it was prepared to enter into early consultations to conclude a 
bilateral protocol additional to its safeguards agreement, and those consultations should begin 
in the coming days. It was in the interest of every State with a safeguards agreement to 
conclude such a protocol, for that would enable the international community to move in the 
direction of a more effective system which focused on where problems either could or did lie 
and which related resources to potential or actual problem areas rather than to the size of a 
State's nuclear activities. 


12. Canada had been particularly eager to see the entry into force of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, which it had been the first country to sign. It also intended to sign in the very 
near future the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety 
of Radioactive Waste Management, and encouraged all Member States to do likewise. The 
promotion of nuclear safety both at the regulatory and at the operational level was the key to 
the promotion of nuclear power. 
13. The Agency played an important role in promoting the safe and peaceful uses of 
nuclear technology, but the public at large had to be better informed, as a priority, if it was to 
be properly equipped to compare the nuclear energy option with other forms of energy. The 
Agency was in a unique position to provide the necessary information. As to the Agency's 
activities in the nuclear power area in the past year, Canada particularly appreciated its efforts 
to implement a new international working group on heavy water reactors, in which it looked 
forward to participating. The safe use of nuclear power also required high standards of 
management systems and personnel qualifications, and Canada attributed great importance to 
such standards, as events at Ontario Hydro had demonstrated. Confronted in recent years 
with a number of management and personnel issues, Ontario Hydro, while never allowing 
shortterm 
safety to be compromised, had concluded that decisive measures had to be taken if 
it was to regain its past standard of excellence, and had consequently laid up a number of its 
reactors temporarily in order to concentrate on areas that needed improvement. 
14. In 1996, nuclear power stations had produced about 16% of Canada's electricity, most 
of it being generated in Ontario. CANDU 6 reactor units were being constructed in the 
Republic of Korea, and after being fully operational for over a year the first unit at Cernavoda 
was generating about 10% of Romania's electricity. A contract had been signed with the 
China National Nuclear Corporation for two CANDU 6 units. In 1996 CANDU 6 units had 
shown gross annual capacity factors and gross lifetime capacity factors of over 80%. As for 
the nuclear regulatory regime in Canada, the Nuclear Safety and Control Act had received 
Royal Assent in March 1997, replacing an Act of 1946. 
15. Canada was the world's leading exporter of uranium and was interested in 
encouraging the industry worldwide to operate on the principle of sustainable development. 
There was a need to demonstrate that uranium could be produced, and uranium mines and 
mills decommissioned, while applying the highest standards of health, safety and 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 8 


environmental protection, and such demonstrations should be communicated effectively to 
the public. Canada commended the Agency's efforts to address public concern following the 
closure of uranium facilities and believed that it should also take up environmental 
considerations early on in the planning process for new uranium mining projects. 
Considering that guidance on sound environmental protection practices was best coordinated 
within the framework of the NEA/IAEA Uranium Group, Canada urged the Agency, as a 
means of further reducing duplication of effort within secretariats, to determine the most 
effective way in which such initiatives could be undertaken. 


16. Turning to the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme, he praised the reforms 
which had been carried out and said that his Government would continue to contribute to the 
Technical Cooperation 
Fund, and that the Canadian nuclear industry would increase its 
involvement in projects and consultation exercises, organizing interregional training courses 
and study programmes and providing experts. Canada encouraged Member States to 
contribute to the TCF and to participate in technical cooperation 
projects, and it encouraged 
the Agency to continue to develop approaches which would interest and attract the many 
potential donors. 
17. Canada's policy for all international organizations was one of zero nominal growth, 
and accordingly it believed that the Agency should focus its activities on what was truly 
essential. Canada recognized the efforts that had been made in the past year, and was 
generally satisfied with the 1998 budget, which was very close to zero nominal growth. It 
expected that the budget for the next cycle would continue along the same lines and show 
additional efficiency gains and savings. In the year ahead, Canadian resources would be 
dedicated to activities lying within both the promotional and the regulatory areas of the 
Agency's mandate. Canada hoped to see renewed vigour being given to the DECADES 
project and the issuing of documentation for public consumption; the conclusion of a protocol 
additional to the Canada/IAEA safeguards agreement; compliance with reporting 
requirements under the Convention on Nuclear Safety; and implementation of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. The Agency should help to ensure that each Member State was able to 
participate fully in its activities, and Canada looked forward to working with its partners at 
the Agency towards the common objective of using nuclear energy for sustainable 
development on a global scale. 
18. Mr. PHAM KHOI NGUYEN (Viet Nam), expressing gratitude to the outgoing 
Director General, Mr. Blix, for his 16 years of dedicated service to the Agency, which had 
helped it to become one of the most competent international organizations, and extending 
congratulations to his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, said that in the past 40 years the Agency had 
achieved great success in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. The substantial progress made in the last 12 months 
alone was exemplified by the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Model Additional Protocol 
and the Strengthened Safeguards System, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 9 


the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Funding. 


19. Viet Nam was highly appreciative of the Agency's many initiatives to strengthen the 
effectiveness and efficiency of technical assistance for developing countries and strongly 
supported the Model Projects concept being implemented by the Agency Secretariat, which 
took into account the economic development priorities and needs of recipient countries. 
Viet Nam had made significant progress in developing its nuclear activities and was carrying 
out a comprehensive study on the future introduction of nuclear energy. The second phase of 
Viet Nam's nuclear programme was under way, with valuable assistance from the Agency. 
20. Viet Nam attached great importance to the amendment of Article VI of the Agency's 
Statute, believing that the Board of Governors needed to be restructured in order to reflect the 
changes that had taken place in the world in the past ten years. It also supported the 
strengthening of the safeguards system with a view to making the world more peaceful and 
secure. 
21. Mr. BORG (Malta) paid tribute to Mr. Blix, whose personal efforts, 
professionalism and dedication over 16 years had ensured that his legacy was a dynamic 
Agency well attuned to the needs of the present international climate, and congratulated his 
successor, Mr. ElBaradei, on his appointment. 
22. The Agency had the dual objectives of dissemination of knowledge concerning the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy and application of international safeguards on nuclear 
material to ensure its use solely for peaceful purposes. 
23. As the world had changed, the challenges and priorities of the international 
community had also changed, and the priorities and tasks of international bodies had had to 
adapt to the new environment. The Agency was no exception. In recent years, the Agency 
had shifted its focus increasingly to the fight against the illicit trafficking of nuclear material; 
to the safe use of nuclear installations; to the physical protection of nuclear material; and to 
the safe disposal of nuclear waste. 
24. In addition, relatively recent violations of international nonproliferation 
norms had 
compelled the Agency to increase the extent and scope of its verification activities. The 
Government of Malta had on various occasions expressed its support for Programme 93+2 
and a strengthened safeguards system, and it welcomed the agreement reached on the Model 
Protocol for the implementation of measures that would enhance the Agency's capability to 
detect undeclared nuclear activities. 
25. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the international nonproliferation 
regime. The 
collective commitment of the international community to curbing the spread of nuclear 
weapons had been demonstrated by the indefinite extension of that Treaty in 1995, and 
progress towards universality of the Treaty continued. Those States that were not yet parties 
to the NPT should accede at the earliest possible date and conclude safeguards agreements 
with the Agency. 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 10 


26. The number of treaties establishing nuclearweaponfree 
zones was also increasing 
and reinforcing wider nonproliferation 
efforts on a regional basis, hi 1996, two new treaties 
had been signed with a view to establishing nuclearweaponfree 
zones in Africa and in South 
East Asia, both of which relied on the Agency for verification. Malta did not permit the entry 
into its harbours of vessels carrying nuclear weapons, and it believed that creating a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Mediterranean as well, on the basis of arrangements unanimously 
agreed to by all the States of the region, would inevitably contribute to peace and stability in 
that area. That fact had been acknowledged by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference, which had encouraged the creation of such zones. In the same spirit, Malta 
supported efforts for the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East. 
27. The Agency's activities in the area of nuclear safety had expanded as nuclear energy 
programmes had grown and public attention had focused more on safety issues. The Agency 
had important functions to carry out under two international conventions related to emergency 
response and preparedness, namely the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear 
Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological 
Emergency. His Government intended to examine those Conventions with a view to 
becoming a State Party. 
28. A notable achievement in the past 12 months had been the entry into force of the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, which contained provisions concerning the regulation, 
operation, and management of civil nuclear power plants. The Maltese Government believed 
that the Convention would enhance a global nuclear safety culture and encouraged all States 
to adhere to it. 
29. The fear of use, or of the threat of use, of nuclear weapons not only by States but also 
by groups engaged in international terrorism was increasing. Such groups operated in clear 
defiance of internationally accepted norms of behaviour. Universal adherence to a permanent 
treaty on physical protection would demonstrate the resolve of the international community to 
address emerging threats from groups operating across borders. 
30. The programme for preventing and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear material, 
agreed upon by the participants at the eightnation 
Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security 
Summit in the previous year, was very important. 
31. Nuclear export control measures were an important feature of the efforts to stem the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. He urged all nuclear exporting countries to 
accept the Nuclear Export Guidelines as set out in document DSfFCIRC/254 and to 
supplement that by establishing effective national mechanisms for export control. 
32. Now that the CTBTO had started its work in earnest, Malta considered that 
cooperation 
between it and the Agency was of the highest importance. The choice of Vienna 
as the headquarters for the CTBTO should minimize duplication between the two 
organizations in terms of administrative and logistic support. 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 11 


33. The third central component of the Agency's activities was technical cooperation. 
Given adequate funding, the Agency's technical assistance activities would contribute 
significantly to sustainable economic development through the transfer of peaceful nuclear 
technology to developing countries. 
34. Turning to his country's role on the nuclear scene, he said that Malta had always had a 
clear and consistent policy on nuclear weapons and had always supported and would continue 
to support and encourage any measure for nuclear disarmament. Malta was a State Party to 
the NPT, having deposited its instrument of ratification in 1970, only two years after it had 
been opened for signature, and in November 1990 the Government of Malta had signed a 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
35. Although Malta was a small country and did not own or produce nuclear weapons, it 
had a moral and political duty to support organizations such as the Agency. It was painfully 
aware that the Mediterranean region was plagued by multiple sources of instability and 
presented particular dangers with regard to the proliferation of armaments. In terms of both 
quantity and destructive potential, the flow of arms into the region was daunting. 
Accordingly, Malta encouraged other States in the region to adhere to nonproliferation 
regimes such as the NPT, which would build confidence, enhance stability and strengthen 
cooperation 
among all States of the Mediterranean littoral and even beyond. 
36. In conclusion, his Government was ready to support the Agency and work closely 
with it in exploring all avenues through which its objectives could be advanced, bearing in 
mind that it had been established to "accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy 
to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world". 
3 7. Mr. HEATHCQTE (United Kingdom) said that 1997 was much more than just 
the year in which the Agency was celebrating its 40th anniversary; it had proved to be a 
landmark year. One of the Agency's most important achievements for some time had been 
the agreement reached in May 1997 on the new Model Additional Protocol, which would lead 
to a substantial strengthening of the safeguards system. The United Kingdom was working 
actively both at home and with its European partners towards the earliest possible 
implementation of the commitments it had made in May, and urged other States to do 
likewise. 
38. It had also been a landmark year in nuclear safety: the United Kingdom was proud to 
have been among the original Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which 
had entered into force in October 1996, and it had been pleased with the progress made 
during the first preparatory meeting in April 1997. The United Kingdom wished to commend 
those who had worked on the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management; its only regret had been that no agreement 
had been possible to include reprocessing on a mandatory basis. His country would include 
its reprocessing facilities under the Joint Convention and called on all other countries which 
carried out reprocessing of nuclear fuel to do likewise. It further urged all countries which 
had not done so to join it in signing the Joint Convention without delay. The United 
Kingdom also welcomed the recent adoption of the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 12 


Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 


39. The excellent results that had been achieved were built on sound administration, and 
the Agency justly enjoyed a high reputation among international organizations for the quality 
of its management. The United Kingdom welcomed the Secretariat's continuing efforts to 
make the best possible use of the resources at its disposal and the efficiency gains that had led 
to a return to zero real growth in the 1998 budget. His Government expected the same 
discipline to be exercised in the preparation of future budgets. 
40. The strengthened review process of the NPT was under way and gave States parties a 
greater opportunity than ever to address issues of substance in the areas of disarmament, 
nonproliferation 
and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. One such issue was that of nuclearweaponfree 
zones, and in that context he took pleasure in informing the Conference that the 
United Kingdom had recently ratified the Protocols to the Treaty of Rarotonga. Another 
welcome development was the agreement reached recently among a group of nine countries, 
including the United Kingdom, on a set of guidelines for the management of civil plutonium; 
it was the group's intention that those guidelines would be forwarded to the Director General 
for publication in December 1997. Statements of strategy for the management of plutonium 
and first annual figures on national holdings would be published shortly thereafter. The 
United Kingdom considered that the guidelines represented an important new commitment to 
transparency and would make a valuable contribution to strengthening the international 
nonproliferation 
regime. 
41. Finally, he paid tribute to Mr. Blix, whose retirement as Director General signalled the 
end of an era. He had guided the Agency with great integrity and wisdom through some of 
the most difficult issues to face the international community, and it should be a source of 
pride to him that he was leaving the Agency equipped with the right tools to face the 
challenges of the future. The international community owed him a great debt of gratitude. In 
Mr. ElBaradei the Agency would have a worthy successor. 
REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS (resumed) 


42. The PRESIDENT noted that, at the previous plenary meeting, a decision on 
the report of the General Committee on restoration of voting rights had been deferred to the 
present meeting on account of ongoing consultations, and recalled that the Committee had 
recommended, without a vote, that the voting rights of Belarus, United Republic of Tanzania 
and Uruguay be restored and that the voting rights of Iraq not be restored. 
43. Mr. ASWAD (Iraq) said that all delegates would be aware that for seven years 
his country had been subject to extremely restrictive sanctions which had prevented it using 
normal bank transfers in order to pay its contributions to international organizations. That 
surely constituted a case of force majeure. 
44. Between 1959, when it had joined the Agency, and 1990, when the embargo had been 
imposed, Iraq had always paid its contributions in a regular fashion. It remained willing to do 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 13 


so, and urged the Conference to consider its case on a purely legal basis and in a professional 
manner that eschewed all political considerations. 


45. Mr. YAKOVENKO (Russian Federation) said that in the General Committee 
his delegation had spoken in favour of accepting Iraq's request, on the grounds that its 
indebtedness was a consequence of force majeure. 
46. That situation had come about because of the full embargo, to which Iraq was subject, 
and the freeze on its assets abroad. It was therefore not in a position to pay its contributions 
to the Regular Budget, although it would make every effort to fulfil its obligations in future, 
as stated in its request contained in document GC(41)/INF/7. 
47. Russia had not blocked a consensus in the General Committee, but had reserved its 
position with regard to Iraq's request. That remained its position for the purposes of the 
current meeting. 
48. The PRESIDENT, observing that there were no further speakers in connection 
with any of the requests submitted, said he took it that the Conference accepted the 
Committee's recommendation that Iraq's right to vote not be restored, and that the voting 
rights of Belarus, United Republic of Tanzania and Uruguay be restored under the terms of 
Article XIX. A of the Statute. 
49. It was so decided. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


50. Mr. ADAM (Belgium) said that the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol 
had been a major event and welcomed the fact that the safeguards effort deployed would no 
longer be linked to the size of a State's nuclear programme. In support of the Agency's 
safeguards system, Belgium would be focusing on measures related to MOXtype 
fuels, a 
training session on the description of reprocessing plants and their verification through the 
entire production cycle, and a feasibility study on detection systems and procedures for 
preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear, radioactive or fissile materials in seaports of European 
Union Member States. 
51. The quality and management of the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme had 
improved markedly in recent years, especially through the introduction of Model Projects. In 
that context, Belgium was continuing to make extrabudgetary contributions to the tsetse fly 
eradication programme in Zanzibar and was financing a new coordinated 
research 
programme for the development of new banana genotypes. In 1997, Belgium had continued 
to contribute to the extrabudgetary programme on the safety of RBMK and WWER reactors 
in Eastern Europe and to the contact group for international cooperation 
on radioactive waste 
management in the Russian Federation. At the end of 1996 Belgium had organized a regional 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 14 


course on the safe transport of radioactive materials with the support of the European 
Commission. 


52. As for the revision of Article VI of the Agency's Statute, Belgium favoured a limited 
enlargement of the Board of Governors that would ensure better representation of States with 
significant nuclear programmes. None of the proposals presented thus far was entirely 
satisfactory, but in a spirit of compromise Belgium was prepared to support the approach 
proposed by the Chairman of the Board of Governors, Mr. Walker. 
53. Turning to his country's energy policy, he said that nuclear power stations generated 
57% of Belgium's electricity. Annual production of MOX fuel had increased from 35 tonnes 
in 1995 to 36 tonnes now; it was chiefly for export, and only to a small extent for the 
domestic market; the plant was undergoing substantial modernization to meet increased 
demand. The timetable for modernizing Belgium's power stations was on track: the 
equivalent of US $150 million had been invested in 1996, chiefly for the progressive 
replacement of steam generators. During the work the radiation protection results had been 
excellent: radiation doses had been reduced to a level that was unprecedented. 
54. Along with other Western countries, Belgium was participating in improving the 
safety of nuclear installations in the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Belgian 
companies were undertaking more than 30 projects in Eastern Europe in 1996, and Belgian 
engineers were playing a prominent role in the modernization of the Novovoronezh nuclear 
power plant and the production of a simulator for the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant, both of 
which were being undertaken by European consortia. 
55. As for the fuel cycle, a report was being prepared for the Belgian parliament on the 
reevaluation 
of the choice to be made between reprocessing and the open cycles on the basis 
of a series of programmes including work on geological disposal and the conditioning of 
irradiated fuel. 
56. While the Agency was celebrating its 40th anniversary, Belgium was celebrating the 
40th anniversary of its first research reactor: fortyone 
years ago Belgium had been the first 
State to order a lowpower 
nuclear plant from the United States, which had become the first 
PWR plant in service in Europe. 
57. In conclusion, he paid tribute to the achievements of the outgoing Director General, 
Mr. Blix, and expressed his country's confidence in his successor, Mr. ElBaradei. 
58. Ms. BE.KER (Croatia), having welcomed the new members Malta and 
Burkina Faso, said that the Agency's important contribution to nuclear safety, 
nonproliferation 
and the use of the atom for peaceful purposes had been well demonstrated 
over the previous four decades. Although the knowledge, expertise and capabilities it had 
developed would stand the Agency in good stead in meeting the challenges to come, it had to 
receive unequivocal support from its members if it was to serve them well in the future. 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 15 


59. Croatia welcomed the progress made during the previous year; however, it was 
disappointed that there had been little improvement in some areas, particularly as far as 
universality and full compliance with safeguards standards were concerned, and it hoped that 
political will would prevail over longstanding 
divisions so that the international community 
could look forward to a safer and better future. 
60. She was pleased to note that Croatia had been involved actively in the Agency's 
efforts to promote technical cooperation 
in recipient Member States. While her country had 
welcomed the opportunity to demonstrate its expertise in the application of nuclear 
techniques in areas including radiation protection and radioactive waste management, its 
performance in other areas had not been satisfactory owing to ongoing internal adjustments. 
Croatia recognized the merit of TCDC and attached great significance to the Model Project 
approach. Regular and rigorous performance evaluation together with careful preplanning 
and formulation would contribute greatly to the more effective implementation of technical 
cooperation 
projects. Her country was particularly grateful to the Department of Technical 
Cooperation 
for the attention it had given to Croatia's projects, and it also thanked the 
Department of Research and Isotopes for its role in project implementation. With regard to 
the funding of technical assistance, Croatia was concerned about the decrease in the expected 
level of new resources for technical cooperation 
programmes and hoped that the major 
donors would reverse their decisions so that a satisfactory balance between the Agency's two 
most important activities could be maintained in the future. 
61. Croatia welcomed the progress made in the area of nuclear, radiation and waste safety. 
As a joint owner of the Krsko nuclear power plant, Croatia had been particularly interested in 
the negotiations on radioactive waste management and liability for nuclear damage and 
welcomed the adoption of new legal instruments which would contribute significantly to the 
global safety culture. 
62. The adoption of the Model Protocol was a major breakthrough in strengthening the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system and Croatia would be signing an 
additional protocol once the requisite domestic formalities had been completed. It expected 
all Member States, both nuclear and nonnuclear, 
to contribute to attaining the goals of the 
new safeguards system, since the nonproliferation 
regime would only be successful if the 
new, as well as the old, measures were universally and fully applied. 
63. Finally, she commended Mr. Blix on his distinguished service to the Agency and 
wished Mr. ElBaradei every success in leading the Agency into the twentyfirst 
century. 
64. Mr. KOSTENKO (Ukraine), after paying tribute to the central role Mr. Blix 
had played during the past 16 years in guiding the Agency and strengthening its contributions 
to the promotion of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to the cause of international 
peace and security, congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment and assured him that 
Ukraine would continue to support him and the Agency in its activities. 
65. Since the previous session of the General Conference several key events had taken 
place: the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty had been signed, the Convention on 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 16 


Nuclear Safety had entered into force, and Programme 93+2 had been completed with the 
adoption of the Model Additional Protocol. 


66. Ukraine was fully aware of the need to strengthen the international nuclear 
nonproliferation 
regime, and to prove it had arranged for the withdrawal of all nuclear 
weapons from its territory during the preceding year. In addition, the safeguards agreement 
with the Agency was being successfully implemented, and the Government of Ukraine had 
decided to help enhance controls on illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and radiation 
sources by joining the Agency's scheme to collect reports on such activities in a database. 
67. The issues of nuclear safety and radiation protection were rightly receiving ever more 
attention, and the Secretariat had spared no effort in organizing international cooperation 
to 
assess and improve the safety of nuclear power plants of Soviet design in Central and Eastern 
Europe. However, solving the problems of nuclear power plant safety would take time and 
would call for a great deal of legislative, economic and administrative changes. In that 
context, Ukraine was currently developing and reviewing laws on radiation protection, 
regulatory activities, and physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities, and its 
parliament was considering ratification of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
68. Ukraine appreciated what the Agency was doing in order to establish a comprehensive 
regime of civil liability for nuclear damage and had adhered to the Vienna Convention in 
December 1996. Similarly, it welcomed the progress made in reaching an international 
consensus on the safe disposal of radioactive waste and had been one of the first States to 
sign the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. 
69. Turning to the issue of Chernobyl, he said that Ukraine had made progress in 
implementing the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa on 
20 December 1995 between G7, 
CEC and Ukraine. Despite a severe power shortage, the 
Government of Ukraine had decided to shut down Unit 1 of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant in 1996 and to discontinue longterm 
safetyrelated 
programmes there. Currently, 
appropriate safety levels were being maintained at the single reactor which remained in 
operation, and shortterm 
safety projects had been developed for it. Thus, Ukraine was 
standing by its commitment to decommission the Chernobyl plant by the year 2000. 
However, complete decommissioning would be feasible only if Ukraine could compensate by 
bringing on line the new units at the KJimelnitski and Rovno nuclear power plants. To that 
end, the Government was carrying out extensive reforms in the energy sector with a view to 
creating a costeffective 
electricity market, but without the support of international financial 
institutions those efforts might not be wholly successful. 
70. Among the important projects of the socalled 
Chernobyl package, the Government of 
Ukraine paid particular attention to the Shelter covering the remains of Unit 4, and it 
welcomed the United States Government's initiative to implement a major project for the 
enhancement of the safety of the sarcophagus enclosing the destroyed reactor. 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 17 


71. With regard to the safety deficiencies detected during an inspection by WANO 
experts, the Ukrainian authorities had developed a plan which should allow startup of Unit 3 
after its maintenance outage. However, activities to provide resources for those endeavours 
seemed insufficiently intense, and the Government of Ukraine feared that failure to 
implement the plans which had been agreed upon would bring negative responses from both 
within and outside Ukraine, as well as adversely affecting the peaceful use of nuclear energy 
in general. 
72. On the subject of technical cooperation, 
he said that both the practical significance of 
the projects being conducted in Ukraine and the involvement of Ukrainian experts in regional 
projects were highly satisfactory. 
73. Ukraine endorsed the Agency's draft budget for 1998. Although the economic 
difficulties which it was experiencing had prevented it from paying all its assessed 
contributions to the Regular Budget, it was doing its best to meet its financial obligations to 
the Agency while remaining committed to the principle of zero real growth. Ukraine 
considered that the Agency's principal activities should be financed from the Regular Budget. 
74. In conclusion, he expressed approval for the Annual Report for 1996 and assured the 
Agency of his country's continued cooperation 
and support. 
75. Mr. ERSKOV (Denmark), after paying tribute to Mr. Blix for his distinguished 
and successful tenure and congratulating Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment as Director 
General, welcomed the two new Agency members, Malta and Burkina Faso. 
76. His country associated itself fully with the statement made by the representative of 
Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union but wished to make some additional remarks. 
In the four decades since its inception, the Agency had become an extremely successful 
organization. The adoption of the Model Additional Protocol as the outcome of 
Programme 93+2 and the conventions on waste management and nuclear liability had been 
among its notable accomplishments during the past year; however, some extremely important 
tasks remained to be carried out. 
77. Denmark considered the NPT to be the cornerstone of the international 
nonproliferation 
regime and strongly endorsed the principles and objectives for nuclear 
nonproliferation 
and disarmament adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference. It also considered that the Agency's safeguards system played an indispensable 
role in the implementation of the NPT. The next step in strengthening that system must be to 
conclude additional protocols to the comprehensive safeguards agreements of as many States 
as possible with a view to enhancing the Agency's capability of detecting undeclared nuclear 
activities. 
78. Another vital instrument for preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
strengthening the nonproliferation 
regime was export controls on nuclear material, 
equipment and technology. Denmark hoped that the forthcoming Nuclear Suppliers Group 
seminar on export controls would provide an opportunity for supplier countries to promote 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 18 


greater transparency in nuclear export controls in accordance with the principles and 
objectives adopted by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. 


79. Denmark attached great importance to the question of nuclear safety and, having 
decided for reasons of safety not to use nuclear energy for electricity generation, noted 
regretfully that many nuclear safety and waste disposal problems remained unsolved, and in 
particular that many nuclear power plants were continuing to operate at unacceptably low 
levels of safety. It therefore strongly supported all efforts to create a strengthened and more 
dynamic safety culture, including the Agency's endeavours to assist the Central and Eastern 
European countries and the newly independent States in making their nuclear power plants 
safer. Nevertheless, it feared that for certain reactors operating in those countries the only 
solution would be an early shutdown. 
80. Denmark also supported efforts to develop legally binding agreements in the field of 
nuclear safety and liability and accordingly welcomed the three instruments adopted the 
previous month. 
81. Turning to Article VI of the Statute, he said that Denmark endorsed the package of 
proposals put forward by the Chairman of the Board of Governors on that subject because 
finding a solution to the linked issues of Board expansion and composition of regional areas 
after two decades of debate would considerably enhance the efficiency of the work of the 
Agency's policymaking 
organs. 
82. In conclusion, he expressed his country's support for the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
activities and for continued growth thereof. The target for voluntary 
contributions of $71.5 million for 1998 was acceptable, and indeed Denmark had already 
pledged its full share of that target. 
83. Mr. AHMAD (Pakistan), paying tribute to the outgoing Director General, 
Mr. Blix, and welcoming his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, said his country had made a number 
of proposals for the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in South Asia, and had 
offered to discuss any other ideas for an equitable and nondiscriminatory 
nonproliferation 
regime in the region. Pakistan would be following with great interest the gains in 
effectiveness and costefficiency 
as the strengthened safeguards system became fully 
operational over the next five to ten years. 
84. The only proven and sustainable option for meeting the inevitable steep increase in 
energy consumption in developing countries was the nuclear option, but it was unfortunately 
beset with risks and fears most 
of which were based on misinformation or misapprehension. 
The fallacy in the supposed link between nuclear power development and proliferation 
derived from the fact that all five recognized nuclearweapon 
States had developed their 
bombs before using nuclear power for generating electricity. For any State aspiring to 
nuclearweapon 
status there were now much less costly shortcuts than civilian nuclear power, 
so opposition to nuclear power was either based on a misunderstanding or it was a deliberate 
pretext to deny the technology to less favoured countries. Despite the Chernobyl accident, the 
nuclear industry's safety record was unmatched by any other major enterprise. Pakistan had 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 19 


been one of the first signatories of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and had now ratified it. 
It was to be hoped that the national reporting and peer review process envisaged in the 
Convention would strengthen both national commitment and international cooperation 
in the 
field. 


85. Turning to the financing of technical cooperation, 
he noted with pleasure that the 
Agency's implementation rate had again exceeded 75%; however, the excellent efforts of the 
Secretariat had to be matched by ungrudging and timely contributions by Member States to 
the TCF. He appealed to all Member States to honour the collective voluntary commitment 
to one of the Agency's principal statutory objectives. Pakistan would be pledging its full 
share of the target for 1998 and hoped that there would be no reduction in the overall level of 
pledges and payments to the TCF. 
86. His country wished to acknowledge the benefits it had derived through the Agency in 
nuclear safety, pest control and the development of better crop varieties. It was more than 
willing to share its experience and expertise with other developing countries, and had 
provided, through the Agency, research and training facilities at its various centres. He 
recalled that it had been the late Nobel laureate, Professor Abdus Salam, who, on behalf of 
Pakistan, had proposed to the Agency's General Conference in 1960 the idea of setting up a 
network of international science centres through the agencies of the United Nations. His 
idea that 
the centres would contribute to the development of science and technology in 
developing countries had 
crystallized in the establishment of the International Centre for 
Theoretical Physics at Trieste, which remained a living testimony to Professor Salam, who 
had died in late 1996. 
87. In 199697 
Pakistan's operational power plant and two research reactors had 
continued safe operation with the benefit of Agencysupported 
safely upgrades. Construction 
work on the country's second nuclear power plant had been completed, and equipment was 
being installed and commissioned satisfactorily. The country's main research and 
development institute was continuing its wideranging 
multidisciplinary programme in 
support of activities in nuclear technology, industry, medicine and agriculture. 
88. Finally, he congratulated the Agency on a particularly eventful year which had seen 
the conclusion of three longrunning 
exercises: Programme 93+2, the drafting of a 
convention on radioactive waste management safety, and the drafting of two instruments 
relating to civil liability for nuclear damage. It would have been an even better year if the 
longstanding 
issue of Article VI of the Statute had also been resolved, for there was now a 
general conviction among Member States that the efficiency, representativeness and 
credibility of the Board of Governors would be enhanced by the carefully considered addition 
of active stakeholders. Pakistan would continue its cooperation 
with other Member States in 
attempting to reach a generally agreed formula for the expansion of the Board. 
89. Ms. LAJOUS VARGAS (Mexico) paid tribute to the outstanding work of 
Mr. Blix in his 16 years as Director General of the Agency. Under his capable leadership the 
Agency had been well prepared to face the challenges of the twentyfirst 
century.

90. She welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso to membership of the Agency and 
congratulated the Governments of Argentina and Brazil on the conclusion of the cooperation 
agreement between the Agency and ABACC. 
91. It was a happy coincidence that in the year in which the Agency was celebrating its 
forty years of existence, the Tlatelolco Treaty was commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of 
its opening for signature in 1967. Mexico's early accession to both the Tlatelolco Treaty and 
the NPT had been based on a consistent policy aimed at the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
While nonproliferation 
regimes helped prevent the spread of such weapons of mass 
destruction, the only way to achieve global peace and security was through the total absence 
of nuclear weapons. For more than four decades Mexico had dedicated a large part of its 
multilateral diplomatic effort to balanced promotion of that twofold 
objective disarmament 
and nonproliferation. 
It therefore welcomed recent progress made in both spheres and took 
note of the discussions under way between the United States of America and Russia. 
92. The events of the past year bore witness to the unquestionable benefits of international 
cooperation. 
Key legal instruments had been concluded: the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the 
Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. The first confirmed the 
importance of international cooperation 
in improving the nuclear safety regime and the 
others helped establish a global regime of liability and compensation for nuclear damage. 
Mexico also welcomed the conclusion and approval of the Model Additional Protocol for 
States having safeguards agreements with the Agency. Her Government shared the desire of 
the international community to promote nuclear nonproliferation 
further by strengthening the 
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the Agency's safeguards system. The Model 
Additional Protocol not only strengthened the international safeguards system but also 
consolidated the control system of the Tlatelolco Treaty, since Contracting Parties were 
obliged under Article 13 of that Treaty to negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements with 
the Agency for the application of safeguards to their nuclear activities. 
93. Mexico attached particular importance to Article IV of the NPT and accordingly 
recognized the need for broader international cooperation 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy and for strengthening of the Agency's role in that regard. The Tlatelolco Treaty, and 
subsequently the NPT, had clearly set forth the indivisible dual objective of guaranteeing 
human safety and promoting cooperation 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Another 
notable aspect of the Tlatelolco Treaty was that it had been the first international legal 
instrument to make provisions for the prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation in a large 
and densely populated geographical area. Other regions had followed suit and nuclearweaponfree 
zones had been established under the Treaties of Rarotonga, Bangkok and 
Pelindaba. She hoped that yet further regions, particularly Central and Eastern Europe, would 
go down the same road and help reduce the risk of nuclear confrontation. 
94. hi reflecting on achievements of the past and the challenges of the immediate future, it 
was important to highlight the work done by the Agency to promote nuclear energy within the 

GC(41)/OR.5 
page 21 


framework of national and regional efforts aimed at sustainable economic and social 
development, in the course of which the Agency had also provided substantial technical and 
advisory assistance to the countries of Latin America. Mexico had been an enthusiastic 
participant in many of the 12 technical cooperation 
projects being carried out under ARCAL. 
It had hosted regional training courses and seminars and also provided specialists for missions 
in the region, hi order to ensure that the cooperation 
between the Agency and the Latin 
American countries remained successful, however, there was a need for renewed commitment 
on the part of the Agency's Member States. 


95. Mexico attached particular importance to the social and economic impact of nuclear 
technologies on the endusers, 
a key consideration taken up by the Agency in its Model 
Project concept. Such a project, entitled "National Programme of Training in Medical 
Physics", had been carried out in Mexico and had led to the awarding of ten diplomas in 
medical physics and to the establishment of a postgraduate training programme in the subject 
to cover future needs. That programme was now continuing without Agency assistance. Her 
country also planned to install two cyclotrons in 1998 for the production of radioisotopes for 
use in nuclear medicine, a project which would also have a significant social impact. She 
urged the Agency to adopt additional measures to strengthen its cooperation 
activities and 
called on all Member States to continue contributing to the TCF. 
96. In conclusion, she stressed that the Tlatelolco Treaty was not only an instrument 
which prohibited nuclear weapons but also one that aimed to support the development and 
dissemination of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Its close relationship with the 
Agency's activities would be consolidated in future as a result of Latin America's renewed 
efforts with regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (continued) 
(GC(41)/8) 


1. Mr, D'ESCATHA (France), welcoming the admission of Malta and Burkina 
Faso to membership of the Agency, associated himself with the statement made on behalf of 
the European Union by the representative of Luxembourg, who had rightly commended the 
richness and diversity of the work done by the Agency since the entry into force of its Statute 
40 years previously. 
2. The first meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the NPT Review Conference, which 
had been held that year in New York, had provided an indication of the progress achieved 
towards the universality of the Treaty. That trend had recently been reconfirmed by the 
welcome announcement by Brazil of its intention to accede to it. The international community 
was thus approaching an objective which, although not within immediate reach, had to be 
relentlessly pursued, since it was the precondition for the effectiveness of the international 
nonproliferation 
regime. 
3. It was common knowledge that the regime was not immune to crises: Iraq and the 
DPRK still remained subjects of concern. In Iraq, the work done by UNSCOM and by the 
Agency and its Action Team had been justly commended by many delegations. In renewing 
the appeal that had frequently been made to the Iraqi authorities to comply with the 
resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, he paid tribute, on behalf of his 
Government, to the action being undertaken by the Agency in that country, and more 
particularly to the late Professor Zifferero who had long been responsible for that action and 
who, in the course of that delicate mission, had displayed universally acknowledged 
professional and human qualities. 
4. The North Korean question was another source of preoccupation for all those who 
were concerned with respect for international commitments on nonproliferation. 
France had 
noted with interest the important stage that had just been reached in the implementation of the 
Agreed Framework between the United States and the DPRK. It intended, both on a national 
basis and as a member of the European Union, to contribute to the implementation of that 
arrangement in the context of KEDO. However, it regarded as unacceptable the obstruction 
by the DPRK authorities of the Agency's legitimate mission of verifying the implementation of 
the DPRK's safeguards agreement. It was essential to pursue that objective and to be resolute 
in reaffirming the urgency and necessity of completing the task. 
5. Iraq and the DPRK showed clearly what a difficult theatre of operation 
nonproliferation 
was for the international community. The slow maturation of the 
programme for strengthening safeguards illustrated the scale and diversity of the challenges 
involved in improving the Agency's investigational tools. The approval by the Board of 
Governors in May 1997 of Part 2 of Programme 93+2 thus constituted a major political 
commitment on the part of all the States parties to that decision. Being better equipped to 
detect any clandestine prohibited activities, the Agency, for its part, would have to adapt its 
operational methods to a new safeguards approach. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 6 


6. Admittedly, no system, however complex, would ever guarantee against violations, but 
the package of new control measures under Programme 93+2 would make it extremely 
difficult for a potential "proliferator" to engage in prohibited activities. It was thus important 
that the measures provided for in the Model Protocol should be put into effect as early as 
possible. France urged all States with a safeguards agreement to lose no time in concluding an 
Additional Protocol to that end. 
7. His country, which had supported Programme 93+2 from the outset, had already 
announced that it would assume its responsibilities as a nuclearweapon 
State. Accordingly, it 
had declared its readiness to apply numerous measures in the Model Protocol. As soon as 
present discussions had ended within the European Union to define the respective roles of the 
Commission and the Member States in negotiating Additional Protocols with the Agency, his 
Government would do everything it could to bring that process to a rapid conclusion. 
8. Only a year after the opening of the CTBT for signature, gratifying progress had been 
made towards its implementation, and his country, which had been among the first signatory 
States, would initiate in the autumn the constitutional procedures required to ratify it. France 
was actively participating in the establishment of the CTBTO in Vienna, within the framework 
of the Preparatory Commission which had just held its third session. It was important to 
prepare without delay the institutional, administrative and technical framework necessary for 
the implementation of the Treaty, in particular the international surveillance system for 
verifying compliance with the commitments undertaken by the States parties. France was 
ready to make a major contribution to that end by providing the international community with 
the benefit of its experience and making equipment available to the four technical surveillance 
networks, where appropriate, in cooperation 
with other States parties willing to accept such 
equipment in their territory. 
9. Even before signing the CTBT, France had decided to end testing and begin the 
process of dismantling its experimental site, which was now well under way. At the same 
time, the international scientific mission mounted by the Agency at France's request to 
evaluate the radiological situation on the Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls, as well as their 
geological stability, was continuing its work in close collaboration with the French authorities. 
France was confidently awaiting its conclusions which were to be submitted in a few months' 
time. 
10. France had also taken the lead in a field no less significant for disarmament and 
nonproliferation 
by deciding unilaterally to cease production for weapons purposes of 
plutonium (from 1993) and of highly enriched uranium (in June 1996). Other nuclearweapon 
States had taken an identical decision. That was to be welcomed, but such measures did not 
relieve the international community of the task of seeking a collective commitment to a 
universal, nondiscriminatory 
and fully verifiable convention the mandate for which had been 
given in 1995 at the Conference on Disarmament. France approved that objective and 
regretted the continuing disagreements within the Disarmament Conference which had hitherto 
prevented negotiations getting under way. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 7 


11. For countries opting for spent fuel reprocessing, plutonium was a most valuable energy 
resource. It needed to be handled under optimum safety conditions and in accordance with the 
international nonproliferation 
regime. It was in that spirit that France was participating, with 
eight other countries, in drafting guidelines on the management of that material in all peaceful 
nuclear activities. Although not binding, those guidelines would introduce transparent 
practices which, moreover, were already largely observed by the French Government. 
Accordingly, the civil plutonium holdings in France had just been published, as they had been 
in 1996. 
12. With respect to fissionable material from the dismantling of weapons, the procedures 
for safe and effective management had been examined at the international experts meeting held 
in Paris the previous year with Agency participation. Longterm 
storage, vitrification and, 
above all, consumption in power reactors in the form of MOX fuel had been identified as 
possible options. The recycling as MOX fuel of plutonium extracted from weapons now 
appeared to be the best option from the point of view of disarmament and nonproliferation, 
while simultaneously yielding energy. International cooperation 
was working in that 
direction: France was collaborating with the Russian Federation and Germany under the 
expanded AIDAMOX 
programme to demonstrate the feasibility of the MOX option. The 
aim of that venture, which was open to other potential partners, was to establish a first pilot 
fuel fabrication unit in the Russian Federation. 
13. France endorsed the statements made by the Director General of the Agency, Mr. Blix, 
at the special session of the United Nations General Assembly on sustainable development 
and, more recently, at the annual conference of the Uranium Institute. Mr. Blix had rightly 
emphasized the advantages of nuclear power to meet the growing energy demand throughout 
the world. The full benefits thereof could only be obtained in parallel with an optimal safety 
regime, however. There again, international cooperation 
was essential and the French 
Government applauded the progress being made in that direction. 
14. France welcomed the adoption, by the Contracting Parties to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, of the provisions covering the review meetings which would constitute the 
machinery for implementation of the Convention. It called on all countries that had not yet 
done so to accede to the Convention. That was no more than a first step, however. 
15. A Diplomatic Conference had just adopted the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. That Convention, 
the first legally binding international instrument concluded in that field, would be an invaluable 
aid to all States for managing the back end of the nuclear cycle. It was, indeed, an instrument 
that could be used both by the countries that favoured direct storage of their spent fuel and by 
those that opted for reprocessing. France, for its part, had already stated that it would report 
under the Convention on its reprocessing activities, and it urged all countries undertaking 
reprocessing to do likewise. France, which had signed the Convention on 29 September, 
called on the international community to spare no efforts to see that the Convention enter into 
force as soon as possible. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 8 


16. The French delegation also welcomed the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. The adoption of new legal and financial 
frameworks covering nuclear damage would facilitate international cooperation 
with the 
countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the field of safety. It was more than ever necessary 
to pursue efforts, hitherto insufficient and no doubt too fragmented, to assist those countries in 
close collaboration with their authorities. French experts from the Institute for Radiation 
Protection and Nuclear Safety were already providing such assistance. 
17. The accident at Chernobyl on 26 April 1986 had been the most serious ever in a 
nuclear power plant, and it had had catastrophic consequences for populations and for the 
environment which could not be borne solely by Ukraine. Given that situation, it was essential 
that international cooperation 
for the benefit of the populations concerned be continued. The 
stakes involved and the scale of that cooperation 
gave it a worldwide dimension which had 
prompted the appeal for international solidarity made by the G7 
at the Denver Summit. 
France hoped for a favourable response to that appeal from the international community at the 
pledging conference that was to be held shortly in New York under the cochairmanship 
of 
Ukraine and the G7. 
18. The development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy rightly remained a major 
objective of the Agency. Great efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of technical 
assistance had been under way for several years and were beginning to bear fruit. It was 
therefore important to continue to increase the involvement and commitment of the countries 
receiving technical assistance. Greater cooperation 
between those countries should also be 
encouraged, particularly in the framework of the Agency's regional assistance programmes. 
19. Such action could not be undertaken without the sustained support of the donor 
countries. More than ever, their contribution to the TCF appeared essential, even though their 
economic situation might be difficult and was likely to remain so for a long time. 
20. The Agency was faced with a heavier workload as a result of its increased 
responsibilities. The necessary strengthening of safeguards, at least in the initial phase, would 
involve additional expenditure, which would need to be offset by administrative savings. In 
particular, when operating with a zeroor 
near zerogrowth 
budget, it was essential to avoid 
duplication of activities among the various intergovernmental organizations concerned with 
nuclear energy, particularly between the Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of 
OECD. 
21. The question of the composition of the Agency's Board of Governors had long been 
the subject of various proposals and intensive debate. It had to be recognized that hitherto no 
proposal had received wide support whether concerning the revision of Article VI.A, the 
question of the representation of certain Member States on the Board, or their membership of 
the regional groups provided for under the Statute. The deadlock clearly reflected the 
complexity of those issues. Any attempt at reform should therefore be carried out prudently, 
taking a longterm 
view of all the issues involved. Such was, indeed, the task entrusted the 
previous year by the General Conference to the Board of Governors. In that spirit, the global 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 9 


compromise proposed by the Chairman of the Board seemed to represent a chance that should 
be taken in order to avoid a succession of fruitless discussions that were likely to jeopardize 
the harmony and success of the Agency's work. 


22. At the national level, several significant events had occurred since the previous General 
Conference. French nuclear generating plant now comprised 56 pressurized water 
reactors (PWR) with a total capacity of 60 GW(e), plus two reactors under construction. 
Nuclear electricity generation in 1996 amounted to 378 billion kWh, i.e. 5.4% more than in 
1995. That represented 77% of the national electricity production. Sixtynine 
billion kWh had 
been exported to neighbouring countries and that level was likely to be maintained in future. 
The availability of the pressurized water reactors was 82.7% in 1996, 1.7% more than in 1995. 
That availability level confirmed the good performance of the nuclear plants. On the basis of 
studies conducted by Electricite de France since 1985, the lifetime of its reactors had been 
estimated at at least 40 years. 
23. In 1996 the high safety standard of the French nuclear plants had been maintained. 
Sixtythree 
events had been classified at level 1 and two incidents at level 2 on the 
International Nuclear Event Scale (INES). The programme for the construction of four 
standardized nuclear power generation units (series N4) was continuing: two units were 
operating at Chooz, while at Civaux fuel loading had just started at one unit and construction 
of the second unit was continuing. Series N4 was characterized by three major innovations: 
its digital control and monitoring system, the 1500 MW Arabelle turbine, which was lighter 
and shorter than the 1300 MW turbines, and a new generation of steam generators. 
24. In addition, France, in collaboration with Germany, was continuing the study of the 
EPR reactor (European pressurized water reactor) which was still more competitive and safe. 
The detailed preliminary design was now complete and work was now proceeding on the basic 
design optimization phase. 
25. In the general policy statement he had made on 19 June 1997 to the National 
Assembly, the Prime Minister had announced that the Superphenix fast reactor would be 
abandoned. That decision was motivated not by safety considerations but by the cost of the 
reactor which was regarded as excessive. Indepth 
studies had been started at all levels to 
determine the decommissioning procedures. The Government had made clear that neither that 
decision nor the abandonment of the Le Carnet site affected France's longterm 
commitment 
to nuclear energy, which was essential for its energy selfsufficiency 
and for limiting 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
26. With regard to the nuclear fuel cycle, the MELOX MOX fuel fabrication plant would 
reach its rated capacity of 120 tonnes per year in 1997. Twelve pressurized water reactors 
were currently using MOX fuel and four others had already been authorized to use it. In all, 
28 reactors would be able to use that fuel. 
27. the field of reprocessing, the La Hague plant had exceeded its rated capacity of over 
1600toanes per year in 1996. In all, since 1976, close on 11 000 tonnes of irradiated fuel 
from lightwater 
reactors had been reprocessed at La Hague. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 10 


28. In 1996, research on the management of highlevel 
longlived 
waste had progressed. 
The National Agency for Radioactive Waste (ANDRA) had filed three requests for 
authorization to install and operate underground laboratories (two in clay and one in granite). 
During the first half of 1997 the local authorities concerned had examined those applications, 
and public enquiries had also been held. The Directorate for the Safety of Nuclear 
Installations (DSIN) would then issue its own assessment and it would be for the Government 
to decide which underground laboratories it was prepared to authorize. At the same time, 
intensive research was proceeding in two other directions longterm 
surface storage, on the 
one hand, and separation and transmutation of longlived 
wastes, on the other. 
29. In conclusion, he paid tribute to the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, who, during his 
successive terms of office, had strengthened the role and prestige of the Agency which, 
through him, had gained the trust of the international community as the competent authority 
for verifying compliance with safeguards agreements. At the same time, under his stewardship 
the IAEA had taken on an essential role in promoting the use of nuclear techniques for 
peaceful purposes. It had been no easy task to find a successor to such an outstanding 
Director General and he therefore welcomed the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei to that post. 
The qualities the latter had displayed since joining the Agency in 1984 would ensure that the 
tradition of efficiency and competence established by his predecessor would be maintained. 
30. Mr. FERNANDEZCUESTA 
LUCA DE TENA (Spain) said he would not 
attempt to recount the Agency's achievements since its establishment in 1957 as they spoke 
for themselves, but simply noted that in recent years the organization, after several decades of 
growth in all its areas of activity, had, with the help of Member States, reached a stage of 
maturity and consolidation characterized by a growing trend towards continuous internal 
evaluation that had seen considerations such as usefulness, quality, effectiveness and the sound 
management of available resources come to replace quantitative or purely technological 
aspects. That trend reflected the Agency's adaptation to a changing environment 
characterized by highly restrictive budgetary policies in Member States, by a profound change 
in the mediumterm 
prospects for nuclear energy, and by the widespread dissemination of 
nuclear technology and its applications. 
31. His delegation wished first of all to express its gratitude to the Director General for his 
leadership of the Agency since 1981, in particular during recent years when, despite many 
difficulties, he had managed the vital adaptation process with skill and dynamism, such that the 
Agency was now a prestigious organization equipped to meet the real needs of its Member 
States and the international community. 
32. Looking to the future, his delegation was sure that the election as Director General of 
Mr. ElBaradei, whose personal and professional qualities were well known, was a guarantee of 
success for the Agency. Both the present and the future Director General could count on 
Spain's full support in achieving the Agency's statutory objectives, which were still as valid as 
when they had been set 40 years previously. 
33. The Spanish delegation, which fully supported the statement made by Luxembourg on 
behalf of the European Union, would confine itself to commenting on aspects of the Agency's 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 11 


activities of particular interest to Spain, and to presenting the most important developments 
which had taken place in the Spanish nuclear industry since the previous General Conference. 


34. Nuclear electricity production in 1996 had amounted to 56 323 GWh an 
increase 
of 1.6% over 1995. That record figure represented around 35% of national electricity 
production. The average load factor had remained high at 86% thanks to the high quality 
levels in nuclear power plants and the constant attention devoted to safety and operator 
training. Moreover, constant investments were being made to maintain production equipment 
in the best possible condition and, in certain cases, to improve its performance. Thus, 
programmes begun in 1995 to replace generators and turbines had now been completed, 
optimizing the output of a number of power plants. 
35. With regard to lowand 
intermediatelevel 
radioactive waste, the El Cabril storage 
facility was equipped to handle all stages of its management, and was estimated to have 
sufficient capacity to cope with all Spain's needs until around 2013. 
36. Regarding the storage of spent fuel, the work to replace storage racks with a view to 
increasing pool capacity in nuclear power plants was continuing, and should be completed in 
the coming months. Additional dry storage of fuel in metal containers was planned while 
pools were full to capacity. 
37. Another activity receiving special attention in Spain was the dismantling of facilities. 
In the next few months it was hoped to begin dismantling unit 1 of the Vandellos nuclear 
power plant, once the plan for dismantling and closure had been approved by the Ministry of 
Industry and Energy. The plan provided for an initial dismantling phase lasting five years 
which would release over 80% of the site. That would be followed by a waiting period of 25 
to 30 years, after which complete dismantling would be undertaken. Once that was 
completed, the site would be able to be used without restriction. 
38. Finally, he wished to highlight the significant research effort being undertaken by Spain 
in order to provide sufficient support for its operational nuclear reactors, and to keep abreast 
with the latest developments in regard to both facility design and radioactive waste. Spain was 
resolved to continue strengthening those activities, as demonstrated by the signing the 
previous week of a framework agreement between the Nuclear Safety Council and the 
electricity industry, under which they would collaborate on research projects relating to 
nuclear safety and radiation protection which were of common interest. 
39. Turning to the Agency's activities, he said his delegation welcomed the successful 
outcome of the negotiations on reforming the safeguards system. The Board's adoption in 
May 1997 of the Model Protocol intended to increase the effectiveness and improve the 
efficiency of the system was a fundamental stage in the process of adapting the Agency to the 
changing environment he had mentioned. The adoption and speedy application of their 
respective protocols on a universal basis by Member States, together with full implementation 
of the Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2, should dispel any doubts as to the effectiveness 
and credibility of the safeguards system. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 12 


40. A further noteworthy aspect of the Agency's work was its support for Member States' 
efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radioactive sources. In 
particular, his delegation attached great importance to the operationalization of the illicit 
trafficking database. The regular publication of information on recorded incidents was very 
useful, providing a means of assessing the actual scale and development of the problem and 
serving as a basis for preventive action without unduly alarming the public. 
41. In the area of nuclear safety, as it had indicated during the meetings prior to the 
General Conference, the Spanish delegation was paying close attention to the Agency's 
progress in adopting rules of procedure for the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Following the 
meeting of representatives of the Contracting Parties in April that year, he was convinced that 
countries were well aware of their commitments regarding the submission of national reports 
in September 1998 and comments on those reports in 1999. Likewise, he felt sure that the 
countries with a high level of development in that field but which had not yet ratified the 
Convention would be able to do so before the first review meeting in 1999. 
42. With respect to measures to strengthen international cooperation 
on nuclear safety, 
radiation protection and waste management, Spain welcomed the recent adoption of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, in the preparation of which it had played an active role. As had been the case 
with the Convention on Nuclear Safety, Spain intended to sign that new international legal 
instrument as soon as possible. 
43. Spain also supported the measures taken to establish demonstration centres for waste 
management prior to disposal, and encouraged the Secretariat to continue those international 
initiatives. 
44. As Spain had always believed in the need to pool experience in the regulatory sphere as 
a means of promoting safety culture worldwide, it had participated actively in the setting up of 
the International Nuclear Regulatory Association and the Forum of IberoAmerican 
Regulatory Bodies. 
45. Spain would continue to collaborate on Agency programmes aimed at increasing 
nuclear safety in the countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It attached 
special importance to the efforts being made to reorganize those countries' regulatory bodies 
and train their staff, and was contributing to them. 
46. In radiation protection, and more specifically the health impact of exposures to low 
radiation doses, he wished to draw attention to the international conference to be held in 
Seville from 17 to 21 November that year under the joint auspices of the Agency and the 
World Health Organization. The large number of enrolments and of technical papers already 
submitted showed the level of interest in the conference among the international community. 
The Spanish delegation was convinced that the conference's conclusions would be 
instrumental in optimizing radiation protection for radiation workers and the general public. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 13 


47. Spain had supported and welcomed the establishment of the Advisory Commission for 
Safety Standards (ACSS) and had participated actively in its meetings and those of the 
Radiation Safety Standards Advisory Committee (RASSAC) and the Waste Safety Standards 
Advisory Committee (WASSAC). It was highly important that those bodies be strengthened 
as soon as possible and fulfil the tasks entrusted to them. Spain welcomed the consensus 
achieved by the experts on the transport of radioactive material and the amendments made to 
the new transport regulations. 
48. Spain attached great importance to the Agency's OSART, ASSET and RAPAT 
services. It had asked for an OSART mission to be carried out at the Asco nuclear power 
plant in 1998. It supported and was collaborating on the Agency's policy of establishing a 
worldwide safety culture, to which the International Nuclear Event Scale and the Incident 
Reporting System were making a positive contribution. 
49. Lastly, with regard to technical assistance, Spain was pleased to note that the new 
strategies adopted in recent years based on innovative ideas such as Model Projects and 
Country Programme Frameworks had proved successful and were being reflected in a 
redirection of activities towards the transfer of technologies conducive to solving specific 
economic and social problems in developing countries. 
50. That redirection was consistent with the current scarcity of financial resources, a 
situation that seemed likely to persist, given the large number of Member States facing 
budgetary restrictions which made it difficult to pay the voluntary contributions on which the 
funding of technical assistance depended. Spain was satisfied with the change of strategy, 
believing that efforts should be concentrated on using available resources as efficiently as 
possible rather than on seeking indefinite increases, quite apart from the fact that the Agency's 
Regular Budget was subject to a de facto freeze. 
51. For its part, Spain had made great efforts in recent years gradually to increase its 
voluntary contribution to the TCF to around US $350 000, a level that it would try to maintain 
in future. 
52. In addition to its contribution to the TCF, Spain contributed in a variety of ways to the 
Agency's technical assistance activities, for example by providing fellowships, hosting training 
courses, and in particular by funding certain technical assistance projects. Those voluntary 
contributions had also suffered from the restrictions he had mentioned. Nevertheless, the 
Spanish Government had responded to the request for financial support for the AFRA regional 
programme, and he was pleased to inform the Conference that Spain would be making a 
contribution of around $150 000 to that programme. 
53. In conclusion, he said that his Government would continue to do everything within its 
power to maintain and expand collaboration between Spain and the Agency. 
Mr. Lopez Rodas ("Guatemala*) took the Chair.

54. Mr. ALNOWAISER 
(Saudi Arabia) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as 
members of the Agency, congratulated the new Director General, and paid tribute to his 
predecessor. It was natural that the developing countries should attach as much importance to 
technical cooperation 
as the developed countries did to issues relating to nuclear safety, 
safeguards and illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Although nuclear energy applications in 
areas such as health, quality control, etc., were no longer the sole prerogative of the industrial 
countries, the contribution of the most advanced countries and the role of the Agency in 
technical cooperation 
should not be underestimated. 
55. Mr. Blix had spoken of nuclear energy as a possible option for dealing with the 
dangers facing humanity and the environment due to pollution from the use of traditional fossil 
fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The Saudi Arabian delegation would dispute that analysis on 
the grounds that it was inappropriate to compare nuclear energy to other sources which were 
safer by far, and that in any case it was stated in the Annual Report for 1996 at the beginning 
of the chapter on the comparative assessment of nuclear power and other energy sources a 
subject that was still being studied under an IAEA/UNEP/UNIDOAVHO project that 
"All fuel chains for electricity generation involve some health risks and lead to certain 
environmental impacts". In that connection, it was sufficient to recall the Chernobyl accident. 
56. Turning to technical cooperation, 
he welcomed the Agency's initiatives, including 
Model Projects and Country Programme Frameworks (CPF), that aimed to strengthen the 
technical and scientific capacity of developing countries. In that connection, a technical 
meeting on the Agency's energy planning programme had been held in May 1997 in Riyad. It 
should however be noted that the implementation rate for technical cooperation 
projects had 
been approximately 75% and that only 39 countries had paid their contributions to the TCF in 
full. His country therefore believed that the TCF should be financed from the Regular Budget. 
57. Saudi Arabia highly appreciated the Agency's efforts to develop nuclear safety 
standards and legally binding international agreements on liability for nuclear damage. It had 
participated in the discussions of the working groups and standing committees which had 
elaborated the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to 
Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. It had also supported the Agency's 
programme on the strengthening of the safeguards system, as it was convinced that such a 
mechanism would ensure that countries respected their commitments. It had no objection to 
the measures to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the system, despite 
the extra work and additional commitments involved for the Agency and for Member States. 
However, it would be difficult to understand the need or justification for strengthened 
safeguards if those safeguards were not applied to all countries with advanced nuclear 
programmes. His country would like to see a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East 
and hoped that the General Conference would urge Israel to accede to the NPT and to place 
all its military facilities under Agency safeguards. His country would support any such 
initiative. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 15 


58. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, his delegation opposed any 
linkage of the expansion of the Board of Governors to the composition of regional groups. It 
also opposed the list of States by areas contained in Attachment 3 to Appendix I.A of 
document GC(41)/11, as that issue should first be the subject of consensus on the part of the 
regions concerned. The African proposal could be a reasonable starting point if it were 
modified as suggested by the Resident Representative of Saudi Arabia in his letter to the 
Agency of 29 July 1997. 
59. Mr. OMER (Sudan) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as members of the 
Agency, congratulated the new Director General and paid tribute to his predecessor. The 
Agency should establish a balance between its technical assistance programmes and its 
safeguards programmes. He recalled that in resolution GC(XXV)/RES/388, adopted in 1981, 
the General Conference had requested that the necessary measures be taken for technical 
assistance to be funded from the Agency's Regular Budget or through other comparably 
predictable and assured resources. Thus, either all countries should be requested to make their 
voluntary contributions on time, or technical assistance should be partially or fully financed 
from the Regular Budget. 
60. The situation in Africa required special treatment with regard to technical assistance 
programmes. Accordingly, greater attention should be given to the financing of AFRA 
projects relating to the applications of nuclear technology and training. He thanked the donor 
countries which had provided financial support for those projects and urged other countries, 
including the African countries, to do the same. He also requested the Agency to give more 
attention to the training of African personnel. Technical assistance to the developing countries 
was all the more important as rapid economic globalization and the easing of restrictions on 
international trade were taking place in the absence of any guarantee of fair competition. 
61. Sudan welcomed the Additional Protocol to comprehensive safeguards agreements 
intended to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system, 
and also the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil 
Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
Nuclear Damage. 
62. The African continent had concluded a treaty to establish a nuclearweaponfree 
zone. 
However, the security of the continent would be strengthened if the Middle East region was 
also denuclearized and if all nuclear facilities and activities in that region were placed under 
Agency safeguards. To that end, the international community should work resolutely to 
induce Israel to accede to the NPT and submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. 
That was all the more necessary as the radioactive leaks coming from the Israeli Dimona 
reactor an 
incident which, according to some Israeli media, had taken place the previous 
yearwere 
an ill omen for the region. Similarly, he welcomed the fact that the African 
countries were continuing to work to resolve local conflicts by expanding participation in the 
political and economic process. Sudan, for example, was endeavouring to establish peace on 
its territory by means of a negotiated settlement acceptable for all parties. Ample proof of that 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 16 


lay in the signing of the Khartoum peace agreement by the Sudanese Government and the 
majority of the rebel factions. 


63. With regard to amendment of Article VI of the Statute, he recalled the relevant 
provision of resolution GC(XXV)/RES/389 and said that his delegation of course supported 
the African proposal presented by Sudan, particularly as, in its report to the General 
Conference, the Board of Governors had noted that it would be possible to reconcile the 
African and Canadian proposals on the expansion of the Board. The African proposal was 
supported by the Africa Group and the Middle East and South Asia Group, and had been 
welcomed by the Group of 77, China, and other countries. He therefore called on Member 
States to support that proposal, particularly as it differed from the Canadian proposal only in 
that it provided for an additional seat to be granted to the Africa Group. 
64. With regard to the composition of the Agency's staff, he maintained that the 
representation of women and the recruitment of nationals from developing countries were 
insufficient and called on the Agency to make further efforts to obtain a fair balance in that 
area. 
65. Sudan fully appreciated the technical assistance provided to it by the Agency over the 
past years, particularly in the areas of medicine, radiotherapy, food, agriculture, zootechnics, 
and animal reproduction, as well as in the location and evaluation of groundwater resources, 
radiation protection, environmental monitoring, maintenance and staff training. 
66. Mr. TOSHEVSKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) thanked 
Mr. Blix for the services he had rendered to the Agency over the previous 16 years, 
congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his election to the post of Director General and welcomed the 
new members of the Agency. At a time when the Agency was celebrating the fortieth 
anniversary of the adoption of its Statute, its members could be proud of all it had achieved 
and the reputation it had earned. 
67. The activities carried out by the Agency in collaboration with the Member States and 
other international organizations had contributed to the attainment of its main objective, 
namely to promote the utilization of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes while providing 
safeguards against the harmful effects of nuclear activities. His country fully supported the 
activities designed to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards 
system, to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources, and to 
make nuclear safety truly international. 
68. His delegation attached great importance to the measures for strengthening 
international cooperation 
in nuclear safety, radiation protection and waste management. It 
supported Agency activities aimed at resolving international waste management issues. The 
improvement of regional cooperation 
with a view to a more integrated approach to problems 
of mutual interest was particularly important in that regard. 
69. His Government appreciated the very valuable technical assistance provided to it in 
recent years in the application of nuclear techniques in nuclear medicine, animal production, 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 17 


radiation protection and nondestructive 
testing. That support, tailored for endusers, 
was of 
crucial importance to his country. 


70. The top priority for his country was cooperation 
to strengthen the radiation protection 
infrastructure. As a country in transition it also needed to adopt a new approach to energy 
planning and looked forward to cooperation 
with the Agency in those fields. 
71. His country would welcome any training programme organized by the Agency on its 
territory in areas for which it possessed appropriate facilities and the requisite knowhow. 
72. In conclusion, his delegation reaffirmed its support for the Agency's programmes and 
activities which had been effective in promoting the application of nuclear science and 
technology for global security and development. 
73. Mr. HOGBERG (Sweden), having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as 
members of the Agency, delivered the following message from the Swedish Prime Minister, 
Mr. Goran Person, on behalf of the Government on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of 
the Agency and the forthcoming retirement of the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix. 
"The International Atomic Energy Agency can this year look back at four decades in 
the service of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The IAEA is entrusted with the 
important task to verify that basic obligations under the Nuclear NonProliferation 
Treaty are complied with to prevent diversion of nuclear technology from peaceful 
uses to nuclear weapons. It is also incumbent upon the Agency to promote globally 
the application of the highest standards of safety in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, 
both through its safety programme and through part of its technical cooperation 
programme. In celebrating its fortieth anniversary, the IAEA can, indeed, be proud of 
the achievements. The efficient and dedicated work by the Agency has also laid the 
foundation for further achievements in the decades to come. Sweden joins all other 
Member States in their heartfelt congratulations to the Agency. 


"Sweden is greatly honoured by the fact that two Swedes have served as Director 
General during altogether 36 of the 40 years of the Agency's existence. We thank all 
the Member States for the confidence which has been placed in Dr. Eklund and 
Dr. Blix over the years. For Sweden, it has been a unique epoch. We are glad and 
proud that Swedish nationals have been able to make this contribution to the IAEA 
and to the United Nations. 


"As Dr. Hans Blix will soon retire from the post as Director General, the Swedish 
Government seizes this occasion to extend to him our deepfelt 
appreciation and 
gratitude for the excellent work he has carried out during his 16 years as head of the 
Agency. Dr. Blix and the rest of the staff of the Agency have, with the solid support of 
the Member States, created an organization which has, indeed, fulfilled its tasks well 
and rands ready to take on new challenges in the coming century. We salute a 
distir iished international civil servant and a fellow countryman on his retirement from 



GC(41)/OR.6 
page 18 


active service. In doing so, we wish at the same time, Hans Blix and his family the 
very best for the years to come. 


"The Swedish Government also avails itself of this opportunity to warmly welcome the 
appointment of Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei as the next Director General of the IAEA. 
We look forward to cooperating 
with him in meeting the important challenges facing 
the IAEA in the years to come." 


74. Associating himself with the statement made by Luxembourg on behalf of the 
European Union, he said that the NPT was the cornerstone of efforts to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Under that Treaty, the States Party had also undertaken to 
pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament. 
Sweden urged those States which had not yet done so to accede to the NPT and to conclude 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. 
75. The CTBT had been signed by more than 145 States which testified to the strong will 
to put an end to all nuclear weapons testing and other nuclear explosions. It was of the 
utmost importance that all States ratify that Treaty as soon as possible, particularly the 44 
States whose ratification was required for its entry into force. It was deeply regrettable that 
the Conference on Disarmament had not yet commenced negotiations on a cutoff 
treaty. 
Sweden sincerely hoped that it would be able to do so in 1998. 
76. While welcoming the positive developments in recent years in nuclear disarmament, 
Sweden urged the nuclearweapon 
States to pursue with determination systematic and 
progressive efforts to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, with the ultimate goal of 
eliminating those weapons. 
77. It was imperative that all States comply fully with their safeguards obligations. The 
fact that the Agency had still not been able to verify the correctness and completeness of the 
DPRK's initial declaration remained a source of deep concern. Sweden reiterated its call for 
full cooperation 
by the DPRK with the Agency. 
78. The Agency had been entrusted with the important task of monitoring and verifying 
Iraq's compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions in the nuclear field. Sweden 
commended the Agency for the work it had done in close cooperation 
with UNSCOM. It 
urged Iraq to cooperate 
fully with the Agency's Action Team to ensure complete 
implementation of the resolutions in question. 
79. On 15 May that year, the Board of Governors had approved the Model Protocol 
elaborated under Programme 93+2, which constituted an important milestone in the process of 
strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the Agency's safeguards 
system. However, it also marked the starting point of the following phase, which was 
particularly important, namely the early conclusion of additional protocols on the basis of the 
Model Protocol and their implementation. Sweden urged all States having safeguards 
agreements with the Agency to conclude additional protocols without delay and to ensure that 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 19 


all the measures foreseen under those protocols were folly implemented. Only then would it 
be really possible to say that the goal of strengthening safeguards had been attained. 


80. Sweden welcomed the fact that the Convention on Nuclear Safety had entered into 
force and that the preparatory meeting organized under the Convention had laid the 
foundations for an efficient review process. It also welcomed the adoption of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management and had signed that Convention on the first day it had been opened for signature. 
It urged all Member States, especially those with nuclear power plants in operation, to accede 
to both Conventions as soon as possible to make them truly comprehensive. Moreover, 
Sweden believed that the Agency had a very important role to play in promoting nuclear safety 
through its various programmes and initiatives in that area. Thus, the Agency would be able 
to exert an indirect, but important, influence on the review process foreseen under both 
safetyrelated 
conventions. 
81. Before taking any decision regarding the development of the nuclear fuel cycle or the 
use of radioisotopes for medical, industrial or other purposes, Member States should consider 
the broad safety and environmental aspects involved. The two aforementioned conventions 
were good examples of how Member States endeavoured to reach international agreement on 
those aspects. It was important that the Agency itself take them into account in its own 
activities, particularly within its technical cooperation 
programme. Also, Sweden would like 
the Agency to take a comprehensive look at uranium resources and the environment under the 
auspices of the existing Joint IAEA/NEA Uranium Group and develop an integrated 
programme covering environmental impacts, emissions into air and water, the working 
environment, radiation safety, decommissioning and restoration of sites, in line with its 
commitment to contribute to global sustainable development. 
82. He was pleased to announce that Sweden had just pledged its full share of the TCF 
target for 1998. Sweden supported and appreciated the Agency's efforts to coordinate 
its 
activities with bilateral cooperation 
in such areas of mutual interest as nuclear safety, 
radiation protection and national systems for accounting and control of nuclear materials. 
83. In conclusion, he congratulated the staff of the Agency and the Director General on 
their performance. 
84. Ms. OK (Turkey), after welcoming the admission of Malta and Burkina Faso to 
the Agency, paid tribute to Mr. Blix who was leaving the Agency after having realized a 
longterm 
dream: the strengthening of safeguards and the improvement of nuclear safety. The 
measures that had been adopted to strengthen the safety of nuclear installations and of the 
management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, and in particular the safety of the 
transboundary movement of radioactive waste, were of particular importance to her country. 
85. Her delegation also congratulated the new Director General whose vast experience in 
safeguards, external relations and, above all, in human relations would undoubtedly help him 
to continue successfully the work begun by Mr. Blix, in particular for the benefit of the 
developing countries. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 20 


86. She welcomed the establishment in Vienna of the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty Organization and hoped that the countries that had objections to the principle of 
stepbystep 
disarmament would see their way to join in the implementation of the CTBT. 
Her country intended to play a significant part in the verification regime established by the 
Treaty. Situated on a critical seismological site, it possessed seismic research and control 
facilities which it would make available to the CTBTO. Her delegation hoped that there 
would be close cooperation 
between the Agency and the CTBTO Secretariat. 
87. Turkey was surrounded on its eastern and western borders by WWERtype 
reactors 
and was faced with the possibility of the transboundary movement of radioactive waste and 
spent fuel through its internal and territorial waters. Her delegation considered that the 
countries operating those reactors should be responsible for their safety and for the safe 
management of radioactive waste and spent fuel generated by them. It therefore hoped that 
the two conventions that had just been adopted would come into force without delay and 
would constitute a framework within which those countries would assume responsibility for 
their nuclear activities. Her delegation considered, however, that a start should be made on 
the preparation of a separate binding instrument on the safe transport of radioactive materials. 
88. Programme 93+2 had been completed in a spirit of cooperation. 
The United States 
and other nuclearweapon 
States had entered into voluntary commitments that would help 
promote the universalization of the strengthened safeguards system. She hoped, in that 
connection, that, in spite of the problems facing them, the countries of Asia and the Middle 
East which had concluded INFCIRC/66type 
agreements would shortly join the full safeguards 
system. 
89. During the past year, the Agency had been actively assessing and improving the 
situation of reactors with low safety standards, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe and 
in the Newly Independent States. Her Government was following very closely the Agency's 
work on assessing the safety of RBMK and WWERtype 
reactors in those regions. She was 
pleased to note that followup 
missions and seismic review missions had been arranged in all 
WWER440/
230 plants. Article 6 of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which had already 
entered into force, provided that, if the safety of an installation could not be upgraded, plans 
should be made to shut it down as soon as possible. The Secretariat, in cooperation 
with 
Member States, in particular those operating old power plants, should therefore continue to 
ensure that the activities undertaken by the Agency to strengthen the safety of such plants 
were as transparent as possible. It should submit periodic reports on that subject to the 
Review Meetings of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and formulate recommendations as to 
whether plants should or should not continue in service. Furthermore, it should provide any 
information it possessed on accident risks to the Member States concerned. 
90. In that connection, the authorities of her country were cooperating 
with those of 
Armenia to prepare emergency plans, develop early warning systems, train staff and exchange 
views and equipment, as necessary. The purpose of such cooperation 
was to help upgrade 
the safety of the old WWERtype 
reactor at Medzamor which had been shut down in 1988 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 21 


and restarted five years later, and to take the necessary measures for the protection of people 
living in both countries. 


91. The services provided to Member States by the Agency's Engineering Safety Section 
had been particularly useful in clarifying questions concerning the seismic safety of 
WWERtype 
power plants, several of which were located in neighbouring countries. Such 
matters were regarded as very important in that region where seismic events were frequent 
and where the public was keenly aware of the problem. Furthermore, Turkey welcomed the 
considerable effort being made to revise the NUSS standards and guides, in particular those 
concerning the siting and design of nuclear power plants, and it intended to make substantial 
use of those documents in the licensing process for the power plant due to be built at Akkuyu. 
92. During the previous century, energy had brought vast social and economic benefits. 
Driven by the rapidly industrializing countries, global energy demand would certainly increase 
in the coming decades, particularly in the electricity sector where it was expected to double in 
25 years. Her country was itself in an energyintensive 
phase of development and expected 
sharp growth in the electricity sector. Annual per caput consumption was currently 
1500 kWh, i.e. half that in Eastern Europe and a quarter that in Western Europe. 
93. During the past ten years, electricity generation capacity had increased by an average 
of 9% per year and reached 21 000 MW at the end of 1995, a tenfold 
increase as compared 
with 1970. A further fourfold 
increase would be required to meet expected demand in 2020. 
Turkey planned to award contracts during the current year for the construction of nuclear 
units with a total capacity of 3000 MW, the entry into service of the first unit being scheduled 
for 2005. Nuclear and hydroelectric energy would provide 11% and 23% respectively of the 
increase in capacity over the coming 20 years. The need to conserve energy and improve the 
efficiency of the transmission and distribution system would also play a role. Her country was 
actively promoting the use of solar energy, particularly for residential purposes. 
94. Turkey reaffirmed its belief that illicit trafficking in nuclear materials was a 
transboundary problem which could not be resolved at the national level. The identification of 
the international dimensions of the problem and their solution would become possible only 
through the conclusion of a binding international instrument which would commit the parties 
to ensure the control and security of radioactive sources and to report any loss or theft of such 
sources to the Agency. Her delegation therefore urged the Secretariat to initiate the drafting 
of such an instrument. 
95. She supported the idea of reviewing the Agency's recommendations concerning the 
physical protection of nuclear material (INFCIRC/225/Rev.3), as proposed in document 
GOV/INF/818. She also favoured more flexible use of the Regular Budget and the technical 
cooperation 
programme to support effective measures. The Agency had now realized that it 
would have to enter into a longterm 
commitment for activities previously covered by 
extrabudgetary funding. 
96. Her delegation was satisfied with the implementation of resolution GC(40)/RES/12, 
relating to the establishment of predisposal waste demonstration centres. Two training 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 22 


courses had already been held in Istanbul and she hoped that a resolution would be adopted to 
encourage the establishment of new centres in other regions. 


97. Her country had very close political, social, economic and historical links with the 
Middle East and was concerned that the Director General had made little progress in his quest 
for ways of establishing an effective verification system, particularly through fullscope 
safeguards, in a future nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the Middle East, and she urged him to 
pursue consultations and use opportunities as they arose during the coming year. 
98. She commended the Department of Technical Cooperation 
on its efforts to strengthen 
collaboration with other international organizations, and also paid tribute to the Secretariat for 
its cooperation 
with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, 
UNEP, WMO, UNDP and the World Bank in a project designed to improve regional capacity 
to evaluate pollution of the Black Sea. That project, which provided for the establishment of 
six laboratories, would serve as a model for other regions of the world, in particular the 
Caspian Sea region. 
99. Her delegation welcomed the Secretariat's activities to strengthen technical 
cooperation 
between the Agency and Member States. It particularly thanked the Department 
of Research and Isotopes and the Department of Technical Cooperation 
for the assistance 
they had provided under the project entitled "Technical support for an electron beam facility". 
The technical and economic advantages which countries, particularly the developing countries, 
derived from the use of ionizing radiation for industrial and environmental purposes were 
considerable. More than 40 developing Member States, including her own country, had 
acquired industrial radiation sterilization facilities with the help of the Agency. 
100. The Turkish Atomic Energy Authority had been hosting more and more coordinated 
research meetings and regional and interregional courses, and a regional workshop of IAEA 
Member States in Europe on the technical cooperation 
programme would be held in Istanbul 
from 15 to 17 October 1997. The Turkish authorities were prepared to allocate additional 
resources to host other such Agency activities. 
101. The use of nuclear technology to improve the management and assessment of water 
resources in the Member States continued to be a significant activity in the Agency. In that 
context, her delegation considered that the wider use of isotope hydrology techniques, 
particularly in arid regions, should be a priority of the Agency, and it welcomed the initiatives 
taken by the Agency to improve the integration of such techniques in the activities of Member 
States. It was vital for the Agency's isotope hydrology subprogramme to produce concrete 
results at the national, regional and global levels. Her delegation urged the Agency to 
continue the activities it was conducting to incorporate isotope hydrology into university 
curricula, to establish regional isotope hydrology laboratories for assuring quality of analyses 
and to develop cooperation 
with other relevant international organizations. 
102. While further research and development in isotope hydrology might be desirable, her 
delegation considered that the Regular Budget should also fund practical applications in 
addition to national and regional projects implemented within the framework of technical 

GC(41)/ 
OR.6 
page

co-operation 
programmes. 
In 
that 
context, 
her 
country 
would 
be 
interested 
in 
co-operating 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
making 
its 
expertise 
and 
infrastructures 
available 
with 
a 
view 
to 
incorporating 
isotope 
hydrology 
more 
fully 
into 
regional 
activities 
in 
arid 
zones, 
such 
as 
those 
in 
West 
Asia, 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
Balkans. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
initiate 
regional 
projects 
which 
would 
enable 
the 
experience 
gained 
in 
one 
region 
to 
be 
applied 
easily 
in 
others 
with 
similar 
climatic 
and 
geological 
features. 


103. 
A 
resolution 
had 
been 
adopted 
at 
the 
fortieth 
session 
designed 
to 
improve 
the 
representation 
of 
women 
in 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
to 
correct 
the 
gender 
imbalance 
at 
the 
Professional 
and 
higher 
levels. 
Her 
delegation 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
the 
detailed 
information 
it 
had 
provided 
on 
that 
matter 
in 
document 
GC(41)/19 
and 
for 
the 
efforts 
it 
had 
made 
to 
improve 
the 
situation 
in 
1996. 
The 
results 
had, 
however, 
been 
disappointing: 
the 
proportion 
of 
women 
in 
that 
category 
had 
risen 
from 
18% 
to 
18.6% 
between 
1 
August 
1996 
and 
1August 
1997 
and, 
although 
it 
had 
reached 
62.8% 
in 
the 
General 
Service 
category, 
it 
had 
remained 
very 
low 
in 
scientific 
and 
technical 
areas 
(10.6%). 
104. 
She 
appreciated 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
to 
recruit 
women 
nuclear 
engineers 
and 
safeguards 
inspectors, 
but 
she 
considered 
that 
other 
Professional 
posts 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Research 
and 
Isotopes, 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Co-operation, 
or 
the 
Department 
of 
Administration 
should 
be 
easier 
to 
fill. 
She 
therefore 
urged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
a 
more 
equitable 
representation 
of 
women 
in 
the 
Secretariat. 
Mr. 
Niewodniczanski 
(Poland) 
resumed 
the 
Chair. 


105. 
Mr.LOPEZ 
ROD 
AS(Guatemala)expressed 
thedeepgratitudeofhiscountry, 
which 
throughout 
36 
years 
of 
civil 
war 
had 
known 
it 
could 
count 
on 
the 
friendship 
and 
support 
of 
the 
peoples 
and 
governments 
represented 
at 
the 
Agency. 
After 
the 
signing 
of 
lasting 
peace 
agreements 
by 
the 
Guatemalan 
Government 
and 
the 
National 
Revolutionary 
Union 
in 
December 
1996 
with 
support 
from 
the 
international 
community, 
Guatemala 
had 
again 
found 
dignity 
and 
hope 
and 
could 
once 
more 
take 
its 
place 
among 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world. 
In 
a 
climate 
of 
peace 
and 
reconciliation 
it 
was 
now 
preparing, 
confidently 
and 
with 
pride 
in 
its 
own 
special 
characteristics, 
to 
take 
on 
the 
challenges 
of 
the 
third 
millennium. 
106. 
Guatemala 
had 
long 
considered 
the 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
be 
a 
vital 
aid 
to 
its 
development 
and 
the 
well-being 
of 
its 
population. 
Fourteen 
years 
previously, 
in 
expanding 
its 
ongoing 
programme, 
the 
General 
Directorate 
for 
Nuclear 
Energy 
(DGEN) 
had 
stepped 
up 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques. 
From 
that 
time 
on, 
the 
authorities 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
provide 
for 
the 
radiation 
protection 
of 
the 
population, 
the 
environment 
and 
occupationally 
exposed 
personnel. 
A 
legal 
framework 
for 
radiation 
protection 
was 
in 
force 
to 
ensure 
that 
those 
objectives 
were 
met. 
A 
law 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
licensing 
regulations 
had 
been 
promulgated, 
and 
regulations 
on 
radioactive 
waste, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
would 
soon 
come 
into 
force. 
The 
Centre 
for 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Storage 
and 
Management, 
due 
to 
come 
into 
operation 
in 
1998, 
would 
collect 
all 
spent 
radioactive 
material 
which 
had 
already 
been 
located 
and 
recorded. 
The 
Centre 
would 
be 
commissioned 
shortly 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
from 
expert 
missions. 
In 
addition, 
a 
licensing 
procedure 
had 
been 
initiated 
for 
radiodiagnostic 
facilities 
in 
public 
hospitals 
and 
health 
centres, 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 24 


which constituted one of the main sources of population exposure, the aim being to protect the 
large number of people using such services. 


107. Guatemala was demonstrating its commitment to the development of nuclear 
techniques by making its infrastructure available to the Agency for regional courses and by 
accepting fellows, who came to acquire and exchange scientific and technical knowledge, thus 
contributing to Latin America's development. Such cooperation 
also enabled Guatemala to 
raise its standards and to benefit from the technical assistance, equipment and advice provided 
by the Agency's Departments and by various friendly countries. 
108. Guatemala was a participant in the ARCAL Programme, under which it had hosted 
regional meetings. It favoured the continuation of that programme, whose socioeconomic 
advantages would be felt by all the countries of Latin America. 
109. With regard to health, the progress made in medical imaging and in endocrinology 
based on the use of radioimmunoassay had led to the introduction of scintigraphy studies, 
enabling Guatemalan doctors to make accurate diagnoses and thus treat their patients more 
effectively. In particular, those techniques had facilitated the early diagnosis and treatment of 
congenital hypothyroidism, a very common complaint in Guatemala. In July 1997, 32 588 
such examinations had been carried out on Guatemalan children. 
110. In the agricultural sector, the DGEN had developed improved plant varieties using 
biotechnology and radiationinduced 
mutation. The DGEN was also helping industry through 
its nuclear analytical, nondestructive 
assay and gamma spectrometry laboratories. 
Radiological monitoring of the national territory was being conducted by means of gamma 
spectrometry, which was also being used to check that imported and exported foodstuffs were 
not radioactively contaminated. With regard to environmental protection, radioactive tracer 
techniques had been employed to monitor contamination and eutrophication of various water 
bodies in the country. All the information now available on Guatemala's lakes had been 
obtained through a study of the main water courses and lakes, as well as of the waste which 
had led to their contamination. Lastly, pest control activities carried out in cooperation 
with 
the United States Department of Agriculture had brought success with the suppression of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly under the MOSCAMED programme. 
111. The Agency had contributed substantially to the development of nuclear applications in 
Guatemala which now urged that a balance be maintained in the distribution of the Agency's 
resources so that the maximum possible number of requests for assistance could be met. 
Guatemala was resolved to accede to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. Guatemala pledged itself to support 
technical assistance projects and to pay a voluntary contribution to the TCF for 1998. 
112. He paid tribute to the Director General and his staff for all the work accomplished over 
the year. He congratulated Mr. ElBaradei and wished him every success in his difficult job as 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 25 


new Director General of the Agency. Finally, he urged everyone to work with energy, 
creativity and dedication for the common good and world peace. 


113. He presented Mr. Blix with a commemorative plaque in gratitude for all the assistance 
and support the Agency had given to his country. 
114. Mr. STUB (Norway), having welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta to the 
Agency, paid tribute to Mr. Blix for his remarkable leadership of the Agency over more than 
15 years. The professionalism with which he had performed his duties was the key to the 
many positive results achieved during that period. Norway now looked forward to 
cooperating 
in the future with his successor, Mr. ElBaradei. 
115. Pointing to the Agency's successful record over its 40year 
existence, he noted that the 
most recent example of the Agency's effectiveness had been the adoption the previous month 
of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. Norway had signed the Convention and intended to ratify it 
in the near future. It welcomed the broad scope of that instrument which also covered on a 
voluntary basis reprocessing and military spent fuel and waste. His delegation commended 
France, Japan and the United Kingdom for having already declared their intention to report on 
their reprocessing activities in accordance with the provisions of the new Convention. 
116. The revision of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 
adoption of the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage were also 
important developments. Norway welcomed the expanded definition of nuclear damage and 
the increase in liability levels, although it still considered those to be inadequate. The 
supplementary funding system would be based on the principle of solidarity with all victims of 
civil nuclear accidents. Norway believed that the strengthening of the channelling principle, 
under which claims had to be addressed to the operator of a nuclear facility, would encourage 
participation in international nuclear safety projects and facilitate the development of a safety 
culture. 
117. Norway attached great importance to the establishment of coherent and uptodate 
legislative and regulatory frameworks for nuclear activities and was actively supporting, 
through the International Group of Legal Experts, the development of new nuclear legislation 
in several countries whose economies were in transition. 
118. The new conventions which had been adopted and those which had already entered 
into force should serve as an added stimulus to international cooperation, 
and in particular to 
technical cooperation 
activities targeted at countries whose economies were in transition and 
developing countries. Norway strongly supported the technical cooperation 
programme and 
had already pledged its contribution to the 1998 target in full. 
119. Norway attached great importance to the Agency's efforts to strengthen nuclear 
nonproliferation 
by enhancing the effectiveness of its comprehensive safeguards system. It 
welcomed the Board's approval of the Model Additional Protocol arising from 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 26 


Programme 93+2. Norway intended to conclude an Additional Protocol to its 1972 
safeguards agreement and would shortly be contacting the Secretariat for that purpose. 


120. Norway urged the widest possible accession by States to the four new binding 
international legal instruments that had been developed under the auspices of the Agency. It 
also strongly supported the efforts to encourage the largest possible number of countries to 
accede to the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty adopted the previous year. It regarded 
the permanent banning of all nuclear test explosions as vitally important, and was disappointed 
that a few countries continued to defy world opinion by preventing the Treaty's entry into 
force. 
121. Illicit trafficking of nuclear material was also a matter of international concern. 
Norway was actively involved in various projects to strengthen systems for prevention and 
detection. It appreciated the initiatives taken by the Agency in that regard, and recommended 
that its efforts be further intensified, including assisting various countries to establish national 
legal frameworks and transparent mechanisms that would enable them to combat such 
trafficking more effectively. 
122. Norway welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. In 1992, 
the Norwegian Government had initiated an assistance programme to enhance safety and 
reduce the risk of any accidental radioactive releases from the Kola nuclear power plant until it 
was shut down. In order to protect human health and the environment, it was essential to shut 
down as soon as possible all nuclear facilities where satisfactory safety levels could not be 
achieved. 
123. Norway advocated the use of alternative energy sources posing less risk to the 
environment, and also stressed the fact that improved energy efficiency would reduce the need 
for further increases in energy production. 
124. Norway recognized that a serious nuclear accident could have worldwide 
repercussions. The 1986 Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident was a good 
basis for giving the alert, but in its current form it could not provide the necessary 
communications in a crisis situation. Norway thus urged the Agency to take the lead in 
establishing a communications system that would enable Member States to obtain the 
information they needed in order to take decisions and actions on a fully informed basis in the 
event of a nuclear accident. 
125. Although Norway itself produced very little radioactive waste and spent fuel, it 
attached great importance to their safe management. It therefore welcomed the adoption of 
the Joint Convention but felt that, in addition to a proper legal and regulatory framework, 
practical measures were required in order to deal with the problem. Engineering and 
management skills, political commitment and financial resources were also necessary as were, 
in many cases, joint international efforts. 
126. Accordingly, within the framework of its "Plan of Action for Nuclear Safety Issues", 
Norway had devoted considerable effort to collaborative ventures, particularly with Russia. In 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 27 


the areas near the RussianNorwegian 
border and the Arctic seas, there were large 
accumulations of radioactive waste and spent fuel, of both civil and military origin. Norway 
intended to develop further its cooperation 
with Russia in order to establish improved 
infrastructures and management systems, especially for dealing with the problems posed by the 
decommissioning of a large number of nuclear submarines. 


127. An important part of that effort was the Contact Expert Group (CEG) which had been 
set up under the Agency's auspices to work with Russia in identifying priority projects and 
exchanging information, and to facilitate technical discussions in general between Russia and 
its foreign partners. The large quantities of waste and spent fuel from decommissioned 
submarines in the Russian Federation were a cause of great concern. The CEG was preparing 
a report for submission to the Agency's Board of Governors. The Norwegian Government 
was prepared to take new initiatives, if necessary, in order to improve international 
cooperation 
on the matter. 
128. In 1993, the International Arctic Seas Assessment Project had been launched by the 
Agency in close cooperation 
with the Norwegian and Russian Authorities in order to evaluate 
the future impact of the radioactive waste dumped by the former Soviet Union, and to 
formulate recommendations on possible remedial action. The evaluation had led to a report 
which was to be presented at the forthcoming consultative meeting of the 1972 London 
Convention later that month. The report's findings concurred with the results of the scientific 
work carried out jointly by Norway and Russia, which were submitted regularly to the 
consultative meetings of the London Convention. One of the report's conclusions was that, 
because of their diet, the populations of the Arctic regions were generally exposed to higher 
levels of radionuclides than the populations of temperate zones. Radioactive contamination in 
the Arctic arose from longrange 
transport of radionuclides from three main sources outside 
the region: releases from reprocessing plants, fallout from Chernobyl and nuclear weapons 
testing. 
129. Although Norway had no nuclear energy programme, like most countries it used 
ionizing radiation in industry, medicine and research. As recent history showed, no country 
could remain unaffected by the fallout from nuclear accidents. For that reason, it was vitally 
important that all applications of nuclear energy be subjected to the highest safety standards 
and that safety be given absolute priority, as stressed in the Declaration of the Moscow 
Nuclear Safety and Security Summit. In that regard, the Agency's efforts to formulate safety 
fundamentals and safety standards were of the greatest importance. 
130. Mr. KIENER (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, 
welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new members of the Agency, and congratulated 
Mr. ElBaradei on his election to the post of Director General; he also complimented Mr. Blix 
on the integrity and courage he had shown in defending the ideals of the Agency in the face of 
all the opposition and criticism to which nuclear energy was subject. 
131. Two important diplomatic conferences had been held recently, the first on an 
instrument for the safety of spent fuel management and the safety of radioactive waste 
management, which would complement the 1994 Convention on Nuclear Safety and serve as a 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 28 


global reference in that field. The purpose of the second was to adopt a Protocol to Amend 
the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and a Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. Those new documents were in line with 
Swiss policy which had always been in favour of a modern civil nuclear liability regime taking 
into account both the concerns of populations and existing risks; Switzerland was grateful to 
all those responsible for the preparation and adoption of those texts, particularly the chairmen 
of the negotiating groups. 


132. In order to tackle the major problems associated with the growth in the world 
population and its future needs, ways of converting energy would have to be found which 
were economical, safe and environmentfriendly. 
In that context, the Agency was playing a 
pivotal role in preparations for the Kyoto Conference; thanks to its efforts, there was reason 
to hope that the advantages of nuclear energy would not be overlooked at that Conference, 
where the role of energy would be acknowledged as critical for climate change. 
133. The Treaty on the NonProliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons provided for a balanced 
commitment by making it obligatory, on the one hand, for States renouncing nuclear weapons 
to conclude safeguards agreements with the Agency and, on the other, for those with nuclear 
weapons to undertake without delay negotiations aimed at the elimination of nuclear arsenals 
and the conclusion of a comprehensive disarmament treaty. In 1995, the NPT Review and 
Extension Conference had set forth principles and objectives for nuclear nonproliferation 
and 
disarmament, as well as recognizing the principal role of the Agency in that regard. At its first 
session, in the spring of 1997, the Preparatory Committee for the NPT Review Conference to 
be held in the year 2000 had taken stock of what had been accomplished since 1995; one of 
the objectives set in 1995 had been the negotiation of a cutoff 
treaty; it was extremely 
regrettable that the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva had still not started negotiations on 
that subject, that the nuclear arsenals of NPT signatory countries had still not been 
substantially reduced and that no international control had been introduced although more 
than 180 countries were party to the NPT, 115 of which had signed safeguards agreements 
with the Agency. Clearly, the balance hoped for when the NPT had been concluded had not 
yet been achieved. He feared that the slow progress towards disarmament might provide 
excuses for those hesitating to commit themselves further down the NPT road; he was also 
surprised to see certain nuclear powers demanding more and more transparency and 
safeguards from States which had made considerable efforts in that direction, without offering 
anything equivalent in return. 
134. With the adoption of the draft Model Protocol on the strengthening of safeguards by 
the Board of Governors, the process aimed at improving the effectiveness of the safeguards 
control system had reached completion. Switzerland had supported the venture from the 
outset but, although in the course of the negotiations it had called for all States to undertake 
commitments on an equitable basis, the prospects for universal application of the Protocol 
were somewhat vague. Furthermore, the provisions of the Protocol would require greater 
efforts from the countries with comprehensive safeguards agreements than from the others, 
particularly those with nuclear weapons. Before adopting that instrument, Switzerland would 
wait and see how the statements made by the nuclearweapon 
States were put into practice 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 29 


through additional safeguards agreements with the Agency and through amendment of their 
national legislation. Switzerland had participated actively in the pilot experiment on the 
remote monitoring system and was ready to start the second phase of that operation. The 
system would be extended to five Swiss power plants and to the Paul Scherrer Institute. 


135. In Switzerland the nuclear energy situation had hardly changed in the past year. The 
country was still highly dependent on it for its electricity supply. On the political front, nuclear 
energy was being opposed by every possible legal means although a moratorium on the 
construction of nuclear power plants was in place until the year 2000. The Swiss Government 
had held talks on future electricity supply with leading figures in the energy field with a view 
to establishing a favourable political base for future decisiontaking. 
Nuclear energy had 
occupied an important place in those discussions and in particular it had been proposed that 
the views of the Swiss population be sought each time there were plans to build a nuclear 
power plant. 
136. With regard to nuclear waste management, construction of an interim storage centre 
at Wiirenlingen was proceeding according to plan. With respect to the plan to store lowand 
intermediatelevel 
radioactive waste in central Switzerland, the Government was hoping to 
win the confidence of the local population, which would be consulted on the construction of a 
pilot gallery. The management of lowand 
intermediatelevel 
radioactive waste remained 
much more a political than a technical issue. 
137. The Secretariat had recently issued a document on the mediumterm 
perspective 
showing the trends for the Agency's main activities and assessing the resources required for 
their implementation. That paper had been extremely useful and Switzerland hoped that the 
work envisaged would be performed for the benefit of the great majority in a spirit of peace. 
On the fortieth anniversary of the creation of the Agency, Switzerland reaffirmed its support 
for the vital role the organization was playing in the promotion of international cooperation. 
138. Mr. KASEMSARN (Thailand), having welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta as 
new members, congratulated the Agency on its fortieth anniversary and on its remarkable 
success in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The Agency had also served as an 
intermediary for international exchanges in nuclear science and as the principal agent for 
nuclear technology transfer while at the same time performing its verification role through its 
safeguards system which was widely accepted as an integral part of the international 
nonproliferation 
regime. As a developing country, Thailand had benefited from the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy for its economic and technological development, and he considered that 
the Agency, in pursuing its constructive role, would continue to serve international peace and 
security. He also paid tribute to the Agency's Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, whose 
remarkable efforts had resulted in reforms and, in particular, had contributed to strengthening 
of the safeguards system and the technical cooperation 
programme. He was confident that 
those activities would be vigorously pursued by the new Director General, Mr. ElBaradei. 
139. During the past year, progress had been made in the safeguards field. The Model 
Protocol adopted by the Board of Governors in May 1997 could be perceived as a major 
achievement but, in his delegation's view, for the enhanced safeguards system essential for 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 30 


maintaining international security to be credible, effective and nondiscriminatory, 
and satisfy 
the international community's desire for tighter nonproliferation 
control, it would need to be 
implemented in its entirety by all Member States. Mindful that those new measures required 
proper preparations, his Government was now in the process of concluding an Additional 
Protocol. 


140. It was encouraging to note the outcome of the recent diplomatic conferences on the 
management of nuclear waste and spent fuel and on liability for nuclear damage. The 
Conventions and the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention that had been adopted should 
contribute to protection of the environment and thus a safer world. Those instruments should 
not negatively affect the least developed countries or States with no nuclear installations, and 
he took the opportunity to thank the Secretariat for the role it had played in their adoption. 
141. The creation of the Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO in Vienna had given new 
impetus to global nonproliferation 
and disarmament efforts aimed at a nuclearweaponfree 
world, and had increased Vienna's importance in the eyes of the international community. 
Referring to Article VI of the NPT, he stressed that all the States Parties shared responsibility 
for taking the necessary measures to eliminate existing nuclear weapons and should endeavour 
to create a favourable environment for such measures. The effective verification regime set up 
by the CTBTO and the Agency's strengthened safeguards system were part of that 
environment. They should be implemented in a complementary manner and be the cornerstone 
of the global arms control regime. 
142. As the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference had reaffirmed, the establishment 
of internationally recognized nuclearweaponfree 
zones strengthened global and regional 
peace and security. There were now four nuclearweaponfree 
zones, including the one in 
South East Asia recently established by the Bangkok Treaty, for which Thailand was the 
depositary. That Treaty had been signed in Bangkok by the heads of government often South 
East Asian countries on 15 December 1995 and had entered into force on 27 March 1997. To 
date, nine of the ten signatory States had ratified it and Thailand, as depositary, had formally 
deposited it with the United Nations in accordance with the Charter. 
143. For the Treaty to be more effective, the cooperation 
of all the nuclearweapon 
States 
was essential. His delegation believed that the consultations between the States Parties and 
each of the nuclearweapon 
States in June 1997 in Kuala Lumpur, had been very useful and it 
hoped that that process would continue with a view to finding a solution which satisfied both 
sides. His delegation urged the nuclearweapon 
States, as a demonstration of their 
commitment to security in that part of the world, to endorse the Treaty by signing its Protocol, 
currently being reviewed by the States Parties. 
144. The creation of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in South East Asia was a 
positive contribution to nuclear nonproliferation 
and disarmament efforts aimed at a 
nuclearweaponfree 
world. He underlined the important role being played by the Agency in 
verifying compliance of the States Parties to the Bangkok Treaty with their obligations by 
means of its safeguards system, which would be supplemented by the regional control bodies 
and mechanisms provided for under the Treaty. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 31 


145. As had been reported in the media, Thailand was facing severe economic and financial 
difficulties. Austerity measures had been taken and the State budget for 1998 had had to be 
cut substantially. Thailand therefore urged the Agency to adhere to the zero real growth 
budget principle and called on all Member States to pay their contributions to the Regular 
Budget on time. Thailand was concerned about financing of the technical assistance 
programme and considered it desirable to incorporate the TCF in the Regular Budget, so as to 
make its resources more predictable and assured and facilitate longrange 
planning. 
146. Mr. de OUROPRETO 
(Brazil), after welcoming Burkina Faso and Malta to 
the Agency, paid tribute to Mr. Blix for the efficiency and dedication with which he had 
managed the Agency, and expressed confidence that Mr. ElBaradei would discharge his duties 
at the head of the Agency with the same dedication and skill as his predecessor. 
147. Brazil had been actively involved in the work of the Agency over its 40 years' 
existence. It was a Brazilian, Mr. Joao Carlos Muniz, who had presided over the Conference 
on the Statute of the IAEA, which had opened at United Nations Headquarters in New York 
on 20 September 1956. Brazil had been among the first 18 countries to ratify the Statute, 
which had entered into force on 29 July 1957. 
148. Despite the confrontations of the Cold War, which until recently had constantly 
influenced the Agency's activities, it had accomplished its role in nonproliferation 
very 
successfully. The latest example of its work in that area had been the adoption the previous 
May of the Model Additional Protocol for the application of safeguards, which was a 
significant step towards strengthening the safeguards system. The Agency had also been 
responsible for important developments in nuclear safety and the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. In that regard, Brazil intended to sign the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
149. Turning to safeguards, he noted that the BrazilianArgentine 
Agency for Accounting 
and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) had been in operation over five years and had 
gradually improved its technical capability. It had helped improve confidence in the 
international safeguards system, in which the Agency played the central role, and would 
shortly be concluding a cooperation 
agreement with the Agency. That agreement would help 
greatly to improve the coordination 
of the two organizations' activities, and would strengthen 
the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards in Brazil and Argentina. 
150. For Brazil, 1997 had been a remarkable year in the nuclear sphere. At the international 
level, Brazilian policy on nonproliferation, 
elaborated jointly with Argentina, had been 
strengthened by President Cardoso's decision in June 1997 to submit the NPT to the Brazilian 
Congress with a view to Brazil's accession. Technically speaking, Brazil already fulfilled all 
the requirements of the Agency's comprehensive safeguards system through the entry into 
force of the Tlatelolco Treaty and the quadripartite safeguards agreement between Brazil, 
Argentina, ABACC and the Agency. However, the decision to accede to the NPT could not 
but strengthen Brazilian policy on nuclear nonproliferation 
and disarmament. As President 
Cardoso had stated recently, the legal justification for and strategic and political importance of 
nuclear weapons were diminishing. In the modern world, power lay in competitiveness and 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 32 


social cohesion. Brazil's accession to the NPT which 
had become more universal, dynamic 
and participative would 
further the cause of disarmament and nonproliferation. 


151. On the domestic front, the preceding year in the nuclear field had been notable for the 
resumption of construction work on the Angra II nuclear power plant, the inauguration of 
nuclear fuel cycle activities on an industrial scale, the production of 20% enriched uranium, 
national implementation of the requirements of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the 
completion of a repository for the nuclear waste arising from the radiological accident at 
Goiania, a significant increase in the production of radioisotopes for medical, industrial and 
scientific purposes, the initiation of decentralization of Brazil's nuclear sector and the inclusion 
of a distinct social component in Brazil's nuclear programme. 
152. Those initiatives were part of a programme organized by the Presidential Secretariat 
for Strategic Affairs (SAE), in collaboration with the National Commission for Nuclear 
Energy (CNEA), Brazilian Nuclear Industries (INB), the Nuclebras Company and the Navy 
Technological Centre, whose principal aims were: to establish a nuclear fuel cycle on an 
industrial scale; to maintain the safety of nuclear facilities; to develop the uses of nuclear 
energy for the benefit of society; to promote research and development in nuclear technology; 
and to ensure the commercial viability of the nuclear industry's heavy equipment sector and 
maintain its technological and productive capacity. 
153. For the Brazilian nuclear programme, the resumption of work at Angra II was a highly 
important event in view of all the various projects and positive effects that would derive 
directly from it. In that regard, he also wished to mention the new institutional arrangement of 
the Brazilian electricity industry: a new enterprise specifically responsible for nuclear 
electricity generation was being set up through the merging of NUCLEN and the Furnas 
electricity plant. It was hoped that the new structure would make nuclear electricity 
generation more efficient, enabling it to take on a more important role in the Brazilian energy 
mix. 
154. With regard to the nuclear fuel cycle, a start had been made on the Lagoa Real project 
in Bahia, with the aim of producing 300 t of uranium concentrate per year. All the necessary 
work on the project was well advanced, including geological and geotechnical studies for 
mining operations and research on the environmental impact of the plant, which was due to 
become operational in the first half of 1998. 
155. Also in connection with the nuclear fuel cycle, preliminary studies were under way for 
construction of an isotope enrichment plant using technology developed by the Navy 
Technological Centre in Sao Paulo in collaboration with the Energy and Nuclear Research 
Institute of CNEN. The plant was expected to become operational in eight years' time, and 
would probably meet all the enrichment needs of Angra I and part of those of Angra II. 
156. Another important project in that field was the Resende nuclear fuel rod fabrication 
plant. The project was of strategic importance, as it would enable Brazil to become one of 12 
fuel element producers worldwide. Its implementation would result in foreign exchange 
savings of around $12 million on the initial fuel loading of Angra II alone, and in additional 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 33 


savings of $8 million on periodic refuelling of Angra I and Angra II. Total investment in the 
project amounted to $24 million, and the plant should produce 50% of the nuclear fuel used in 
Brazil. 


157. In nuclear safety, a series of measures were being taken to reassure the population and 
to fulfil the international commitments undertaken by Brazil as a Contracting Party to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. The number of inspections of nuclear facilities had increased, 
a financing system for radiation protection and nuclear safety had been established, and 
appropriate legislation was in preparation. In addition, a national system for the investigation 
of radiation events had been set up over the whole of Brazilian territory, enabling a prompt 
response to be made to any radiological emergency. On the subject of emergency 
preparedness, Brazil had successfully conducted a full emergency drill in Rio de Janeiro in 
June with the participation of Agency technicians. 
158. With respect to the social uses of nuclear energy, the $2 million invested in nuclear 
medicine over the past two years had significantly increased production of 
radiopharmaceuticals and led to the manufacture of new products such as samarium, thallium 
and fluorine18. 
The public had benefited, latest figures indicating that over a million patients 
in Brazil were now being treated with radiopharmaceuticals. 
159. Another important project was the construction of a prototype food irradiator. Studies 
in that field were being carried out in collaboration with the Agency. The development of 
food irradiation would reduce losses of agricultural products, boost food exports, and increase 
the availability and hygienic qualities of food in general. Several other socially important 
nuclear application projects were under way in the industrial and environmental sectors. 
160. Mr. CACCIA DOMINION! (European Commission), associating himself fully 
with the statement made by Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union (EU) and 
associated countries, said that the current General Conference constituted a special occasion in 
that it marked the Agency's 40th anniversary. During that period the Agency had become one 
of the most effective international organizations. 
161. It was a fact that the use of nuclear energy, not only for electricity production but also 
for medical, agricultural, industrial and other purposes, played a highly important role in daily 
life. The Agency had made an essential contribution in that context, in particular through the 
elaboration and worldwide harmonization of safety and radiation protection standards, the 
implementation of a global safeguards system against the proliferation of nuclear material for 
military purposes, and the provision of technical assistance in the area of peaceful nuclear 
applications. The European Commission offered its best wishes to the Agency for the future, 
and trusted that it would continue to fulfil its important tasks. 
162. The results achieved to date by the Agency were inseparably linked with two men: 
Mr. Eklund, who had served as Director General from 1961 to 1981, and his successor, 
Mr. Blix, who had been in office since 1981. He was sure that Mr. Blix, who was due to retire 
later in the year, would continue advocating vigorously the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 34 


extended his best wishes to him. He also expressed his sincere congratulations to Mr. Blix's 
successor, Mr. ElBaradei. 


163. In July the Commission had formally expressed its opinions on the applications for 
accession to the EU submitted by a number of States, and the matter was currently being 
discussed by the EU's other institutions. The actual negotiations on accession would begin 
in 1998. 
164. The energy sector would play a big part in those negotiations. Applicants having 
nuclear power plants on their territory most 
of which were Russian designed would 
have to 
undertake firm commitments regarding nuclear safety matters. In anticipation of their 
accession, those States had made significant efforts to adapt their legislation in the areas of 
radiation protection, safety and radioactive waste management to that of the EU. 
165. With regard to the EU's energy policy, the strategic choices outlined in the 
Commission's White Paper of December 1995 placed particular emphasis on integration of the 
European energy market, with a view to increasing competitiveness and promoting 
employment, managing external dependency in order to assure future energy supplies, and 
ensuring the compatibility of energy and environmental objectives for the sake of sustainable 
development. 
166. With regard to the integration of the European energy market, the electricity directive 
which had been adopted at the beginning of the year had now entered into force, and the 
gradual process of opening up the market, due to last six years, had begun. The gas directive 
was expected to be adopted shortly. That would improve the competitiveness of the 
electricity and gas sectors and enable users in the EU to obtain energy supplies regardless of 
national boundaries. 
167. In September 1996 the Commission had adopted, in draft form, the fourth illustrative 
nuclear programme (PINC), pursuant to Article 40 of the EURATOM Treaty. After a 
comprehensive consultative and information process, involving inter alia the European 
Parliament, the nuclear industry, NGOs and environmentalists, a slightly revised final text had 
been approved by the Commission the previous week. The main objective of the document 
was to assess how nuclear energy could contribute to the realization of the major energy 
objectives he had mentioned. It expressly concluded that the nuclear option should be kept 
open for the future. 
168. Turning to the forthcoming Kyoto Conference on climate change, he stressed that 
nuclear energy had an important role to play in tackling that serious problem. The use of 
nuclear energy already served to avoid the emission of some 700 million tonnes of CO2 each 
year in Europe as a whole. 
169. It was true that, for the time being, the low cost of natural gas made the nuclear option 
less attractive, especially as the latter involved high investment costs and long construction 
times. Therefore, in the next decade the construction of new nuclear power plants could only 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 35 


come about through a reasoned decision by investors to opt for combating the greenhouse 
effect or for the longterm 
advantages. 


170. The Commission had welcomed with great satisfaction the adoption by the Board of 
Governors of the Additional Model Protocol under Programme 93+2 aimed at strengthening 
the Agency's safeguards. It was now important for the Additional Protocols to enter into 
force without delay throughout the world. In July, the Commission had submitted to the 
Board draft negotiating mandates for Additional Protocols to the three safeguards agreements 
in force between the Agency, the European Community and its Member States. The 
Commission was sparing no effort in the matter and hoped that the EU would be able to begin 
negotiations with the Agency's Secretariat in the very near future. 
171. He was pleased to report that the application of Agency safeguards in the EU had 
gained much in efficiency as a result of the verification arrangements adopted under the New 
Partnership Approach. Various technical issues relating to particular facilities, such as nuclear 
power plants using MOX fuel, had been resolved. The two parties would continue to 
cooperate 
closely on the Agency verification measures approved by the Board in 1995, 
including the use of new equipment and unannounced inspections. 
172. Another important area in which the European Community had a direct role to play 
was the common European supply policy for nuclear fuels. On the uranium market, the price 
increase seen during the first half of the previous year had been followed by a slight decrease. 
That had led the Commission and the EURATOM Supply Agency to continue monitoring the 
markets closely and to pursue a policy of diversification of sources of supply in line with the 
EURATOM Treaty objectives of security of supply and viability of the EU's basic nuclear 
industries. That policy, which had been implemented in a flexible manner, using the Supply 
Agency's exclusive right to conclude contracts, was aimed at avoiding overreliance 
on any 
single source of supply. The Supply Agency continued to recommend the EU's uranium users 
to cover most of their needs through multiyear 
contracts at prices allowing recovery of 
normal production costs. 
173. The Commission and the Supply Agency were paying close attention to the effects of 
the entry on the world market of uranium and enriched material derived from the dismantling 
of nuclear warheads, in particular the introduction of the equivalent of 500 tonnes of highly 
enriched weaponsgrade 
uranium which was to be diluted and transferred over the next few 
years under the terms of an agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States. 
The Commission urged all the parties involved to ensure that such material was placed on the 
market in a regular, equitable and responsible manner, in order to avoid any destabilizing 
effects. 
174. The EU was contributing to the efforts to establish a worldwide nuclear safety culture 
through nuclear safety research programmes carried out in Member States on a costsharing 
basis and its Joint Research Centre, and by promoting constant efforts in the competent bodies 
of the EU to achieve consensus on safety requirements and the best safety procedures. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 36 


175. The European Union's assistance to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in the 
nuclear safety field involved a considerable human and financial effort. The Commission was 
particularly anxious, in view of future EU expansion, that safety standards comparable to 
those of the EU should be attained in all European countries. In order to help achieve that 
objective, in 1997 about $95 million had been allocated for nuclear safety projects under 
the TACIS and PHARE assistance programmes, taking the funds provided since the beginning 
of those programmes, to over $800 million. That figure included a contribution 
of $ 110 million to the G7 
Action Plan for Ukraine, which was intended to help solve the 
sensitive problems concerning the shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the safety 
of the shelter over unit 4, and the achievement of acceptable safety levels in the two units 
under construction at Rovno and Khmelnitsky. In accordance with the conclusions of the 
Denver Summit, additional funding would be made available for the shelter implementation 
plan. 
176. It should also be mentioned that on 22 September the Commission had approved aid 
amounting to $1.1 million for the victims of the Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, the Russian 
Federation and Belarus. The total amount of assistance already approved in favour of 
Chernobyl victims was around $9 million. 
177. EU assistance in the nuclear safety field continued to be planned in coordination 
with 
other donors, and to take into account the valuable work carried out under the Agency's 
auspices. The EU hoped that that important assistance would help countries which had not 
yet acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety to do so in the near future. Cooperation 
among 25 nuclear regulatory bodies from the EU, countries of Central and Eastern Europe 
and the Newly Independent States was promoted through the Commission's CONCERT 
group, which had recently drawn up conclusions on the experience acquired with nuclear 
safety assistance to date, and had prepared guidelines for future cooperation. 
178. The Commission welcomed the entry into force of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
and would endeavour to resume the discussions on EURATOM's accession. It also 
welcomed the successful conclusion of the diplomatic conference to adopt a Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. That convention should help assure the public that the safety of spent fuel and 
of radioactive waste management was an objective being pursued at the international level. 
The Commission was likely to seek a mandate to sign and accede to the convention. 
179. With regard to radiation protection, on 30 June 1997 the EU Council of Ministers had 
adopted a revised version of the directive on protection against the dangers of medical 
exposures to radiation, which had to be included in the national legislation of EU Member 
States by 15 May 2000, the date by which the new Basic Safety Standards adopted in 1996 
also had to be brought into force under national legislations. 
180. In the hopefully unlikely event that a nuclear accident could not be avoided, a liability 
regime was needed which offered prompt and adequate compensation to the victims. The 
existing regime had been extended through the adoption on 12 September of the Protocol to 
Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 37 


on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. Those instruments took account of the 
developments which had occurred in the legal, technical and economic spheres since the 
adoption of the Paris and Vienna Conventions in the 1960s, and provided for considerable 
additional compensation. The Commission therefore welcomed the adoption of those two 
instruments. 


181. The Commission also supported the Agency's work to combat illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material. Among other things, the EU was cooperating 
with the Agency on means of 
detecting radioactive substances at borders. The Commission had also been continuing its 
cooperation 
with certain third countries with a view to ensuring reliable nuclear material 
accountancy, control and physical protection. 
182. In addition the Commission, in cooperation 
with Member States, was organizing 
courses for customs officers on the detection of radioactive substances and on the nature of 
radiation hazards. Particular emphasis was placed on participation by countries from Central 
and Eastern Europe. 
183. With regard to the nuclear fission safety programme, following the call for proposals 
published in 1995, 168 sharedcost 
projects and 41 concerted actions had been selected in 
1995, 1996 and the first half of 1997, with Community funding amounting to 
around $144 million. The projects covered five areas: study of innovative solutions, reactor 
safety, management and storage of radioactive waste and decommissioning, radiological 
impact on man and the environment, and historical liabilities. The European Community Joint 
Research Centre had carried out activities in several areas, especially prevention and 
management of severe accidents, safety of the fuel cycle with a view to reducing the impact on 
man and the environment, and nuclear safeguards and fissile material management. In the area 
of safeguards, the Joint Research Centre was responsible for implementing the Commission's 
support programme for the Agency. 
184. With regard to research in the field of controlled thermonuclear fusion, which was 
focused on magnetic confinement, two new association contracts had been concluded with 
Ireland and Austria. In addition, the trilateral Euregio agreement which 
linked the fusion 
activities carried out in Belgium, the Netherlands and North RhineWestphalia 
had 
been 
ratified. Construction of the TJII 
stellarator in Madrid had been completed; the JET facility 
at Abingdon (United Kingdom) had achieved a world record in fusion energy production, and 
a socioeconomic 
fusion research programme for 199798 
(SERF) had been established. 
185. The ITER Council had adopted the ITER detailed design report, cost review and 
safety analysis, and had issued guidelines for the work to be completed by July 1998. The 
ongoing research looked as if it would require an extension of the current agreement to cover 
a transition period of around three years from July 1998 to prepare the ground for 
construction decisions. 
186. With regard to EURATOM's external relations, an important event had been 
EURATOM's accession to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO), 
which had taken effect on 19 September. The European Community had thereby become a 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 38 


member of the KEDO Executive Board alongside its founding members, the United States, 
Japan and the Republic of Korea. The European Community would contribute to attempts to 
solve the nonproliferation 
problem on the basis of reestablishment 
of compliance with 
the NPT and safeguards in the DPRK in return for the construction of two safe and reliable 
light water reactors and the interim supply of other energy sources. 


187. In conclusion, he said that the European Commission had always participated actively 
in international cooperation 
in the nuclear field. The Commission considered that efficient 
international regimes for nuclear safety, safeguards, physical protection and nonproliferation 
would always be necessary in order to ensure the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy in 
the future. With that in mind, the European Commission would continue to cooperate 
closely 
with the Agency and its new Director General. 
188. Mr. POOLOKASINGHAM (Sri Lanka), welcoming Malta and Burkina Faso as 
new members of the Agency, sincerely thanked both the Agency and Mr. Blix, on the fortieth 
anniversary of the Agency and the eve of its Director General's retirement, for the 
contribution they had made to the international community. 
189. The Agency was a specialized organization within the United Nations system with a 
dual mandate: to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy and to ensure that fissionable 
material was not diverted to military purposes. 
190. The Agency's promotional activities had been responsible for most, if not all, of the 
transfers of peaceful nuclear technology to developing countries, including Sri Lanka. It was 
held in high esteem by the entire world hence 
its remarkable financial stability and 
was rated 
amongst the best, if not as the best, of the United Nations specialized agencies thanks to its 
efficiency in fulfilling its mandate as regards technology transfer and support for research and 
development, and now also its explicit insistence that its technical cooperation 
activities lead 
to visible enduser 
benefits. Since nuclear science and technology were viewed as an 
additional tool for integrated use with conventional methods, the Agency's activities had also 
had the important spinoff 
of giving tremendous impetus to the overall development of science 
and technology in developing Member States. 
191. Under the leadership of Mr. Blix, the Agency had effectively met the challenges to the 
future of nuclear power posed by the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 and the even more 
serious Chernobyl accident in 1986. Despite those setbacks, which had led to widespread 
adverse public reaction against nuclear power, the amount of electricity generated by nuclear 
power plants had increased by 39% over the past decade, with 443 power plants operating 
worldwide as opposed to 374 in 1986, and a further 35 plants under construction. That was 
attributable to the prompt action taken by the Agency to strengthen nuclear power plant safety 
and emergency radiation protection measures, to the growing demand for electricity, and to 
increasing concern over the greenhouse effect and acid rain. Nevertheless, it was important to 
note that most of the technical cooperation 
budget had been spent on nonpower 
sectors such 
as agriculture, industry and medical applications which, together with energy planning, were 
priority sectors in most developing countries such as Sri Lanka. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 39 


192. Sri Lanka was pleased to note that some of its scientists had contributed actively to the 
Agency's international activities, particularly in the field of agriculture and medicine. The 
Agency's efforts to strengthen and streamline its safeguards activities in response to recent 
concerns about its credibility in that sphere were also praiseworthy. 
193. There was no doubt that the effective way the Agency had carried out its mandate and 
tackled the serious crises with which it had been confronted over the past 15 years was due to 
the dynamism and innovative spirit of the outgoing Director General, Mr. Hans Blix. The 
following extract from the statement of the President of the IAEA Staff Council at the thirtyninth 
Ordinary Staff Assembly held in December 1996 was perhaps the best tribute to him: 
"Unlike many other organizations, the Agency has a long tradition of openness and 
transparency in its staff/management relations. ...We have benefited from the 
unflinching support of our Director General, who has made no bones about the prime 
need for competence and integrity when recruiting staff. ... the Director General and 
Staff Council are united in their conviction of the need to maintain a truly independent 
and competent civil service ..." 


That was fundamental to the success of any organization, and Member States were responsible 
for ensuring that the Agency not only continued to maintain but also strengthened that 
invaluable attribute. 


194. He congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his unanimous appointment as Director General to 
succeed Mr. Blix. With the experience he had acquired both at the Agency and in the United 
Nations, he was well equipped to guide the Agency in the years ahead and Sri Lanka wished 
him every success. 
195. Now that the halfway 
mark had been reached in preparations for the Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the NonProliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons to be 
held in the year 2000, it was opportune to take stock of the followup 
to the decisions taken 
in 1995. Achieving universality of the Treaty remained a key objective, but nonproliferation 
strategies should not obstruct the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and nuclear technology. It 
was therefore imperative to negotiate a legal instrument to ensure the complete elimination of 
nuclear weapons and stockpiling of fissile material. Agency safeguards were essential to 
guaranteeing compliance with the NPT. Sri Lanka urged States Party which had not yet done 
so to sign safeguards agreements and expected the Agency to continue to play a central role in 
nuclear nonproliferation, 
the regime on the production and stockpiling of fissile material, and 
safeguards. 
196. All nuclear and nonnuclear 
States alike had the inalienable right to produce and use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to undertake research in that field without 
discrimination. The obligation undertaken by States Party pursuant to Article IV of the NPT 
was important. The unilateral application of restrictive measures which went beyond the 
safeguards required under the Treaty and which hampered peaceful nuclear development 
should be eliminated. Preferential treatment should be given to nonnuclearweapon 
States, 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 40 


taking particular account of the needs of developing countries with respect to the promotion 
of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 


197. Sri Lanka had consistently supported the creationby 
a consensus of the 
countries concerned of 
nuclearweaponfree 
zones. Given the strategic importance of the 
States of Central Asia, his delegation welcomed the initiative aimed at establishing a 
nuclearweaponfree 
zone in that region. 
198. Turning to Sri Lanka's nuclear programme, he said that his country had no large 
nuclear facilities such as power or research reactors. Its activities were directed towards the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy for agricultural, medical and industrial purposes. Keenly aware 
as it was of the contribution which nuclear technology had already made and could still make 
to national development, his Government had allocated the necessary funds for strengthening 
the infrastructure of the Atomic Energy Authority. Cooperation 
between the Agency and a 
number of Sri Lankan institutes under the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme had 
resulted in socioeconomic 
benefits through the application of nuclear techniques in 
agriculture, medicine and industry. 
199. In the medical sector, a human tissue bank, nuclear imaging facilities and 
radioimmunoassay laboratories had been established, and cancer therapy facilities upgraded, 
with support from the technical cooperation 
programme. A project on high dose 
brachytherapy was being implemented under the 19971998 
cycle. A project had been 
launched in 1997 with a view to remedying iron deficiencies with ironfortified 
wheat which 
would help overcome malnutrition among lowincome 
groups. He noted with satisfaction that 
the Agency had identified the development of food and nutrition strategies as a key area for 
the 19992000 
programme and suggested that the aforementioned project be extended up to 
the end of the 19992000 
cycle in order to ensure its successful completion. 
200. In the agricultural sector, the productivity of certain crops had been improved through 
better agronomic practices developed via research employing nuclear techniques, and through 
the breeding of better crop varieties via radiationinduced 
mutation. Nuclear techniques had 
also been applied successfully to improve reproduction in buffaloes, cattle and goats, to 
improve nutrition, and in the control of diseases. 
201. In the industrial sector, the use of nuclear techniques in the preventive maintenance 
programme of the petroleum refinery had led to a significant reduction in down time. 
Considerable gains had been made by a number of industries through the use of NDT 
techniques. The Atomic Energy Authority now had the capacity to conduct NDT training 
programmes up to level III, except in eddy current testing. 
202. Sri Lanka welcomed the initiatives taken by the Agency to ensure that the technical 
cooperation 
programme generated greater socioeconomic 
benefits and was better oriented 
towards the needs of endusers. 
The Model Project concept, Country Programme 
Frameworks and Integrated Evaluation Framework would no doubt lead to the realization of 
those goals. However, due consideration should be given to the vastly differing conditions in 
Member States when defining country programmes. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 41 


203. For Sri Lanka, nuclear power was not a viable option for electricity generation at the 
current time as the commercially available reactors had too large a capacity to be connected to 
the national grid. Although the demand for electricity was growing rapidly and was doubling 
approximately every eight years, that option could not be not open to the country in the near 
future unless small and economic nuclear power plants became commercially available. 
204. In recent years, considerable improvements had been made to the national regulatory 
programme on radiation safety. Additional staff had been recruited and the necessary 
equipment acquired, some of it through the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. The 
national regulations were being revised to ensure conformity with the Basic Safety Standards. 
The staff of the Atomic Energy Authority had received training through Agency training 
courses and fellowships. Sri Lanka was participating in the interregional Model Project 
activities on upgrading of radiation protection and waste management infrastructures and was 
confident that it would be in a position to conform to the Basic Safety Standards in the near 
future. 
205. The RCA, to which Sri Lanka was party, had brought considerable benefits to the 
participating countries. He thanked the Agency and the Member States concerned for 
organizing a programme to highlight the achievements and activities of the RCA during the 
25 years it had been in existence. Sri Lanka welcomed the changes which were being made to 
the management structure of the RCA but felt that care should be taken to ensure a smooth 
transition of responsibilities in order to maintain the programme's continuity. 
206. His country would continue to pursue its policy of utilizing nuclear science and 
technology to improve the quality of life of its people. That policy was implemented through 
the Atomic Energy Authority, which was also the national focal point for Agency activities. 
207. In conclusion, he reconfirmed his Government's active support for the Agency's 
programmes and activities which had been very effective in promoting the application of 
nuclear science and technology for development, and without which developing countries such 
as Sri Lanka would have made little progress. 
208. Mr. HOBEICA (Lebanon), having welcomed the new Director General and 
paid tribute to his predecessor, said that one of the main responsibilities of the Agency, which 
was celebrating its fortieth anniversary, was the setting up of nuclearweaponfree 
zones. In 
that regard, the Middle East region was of special interest, particularly as the peace process 
was not moving forward. The fact that Israel had reneged on the Oslo agreements and was 
pursuing its settlement policy in defiance of international resolutions was not likely to advance 
the process. As long as Israel continued to occupy part of Lebanese territory and resort to 
violence, repression and detentions without trial in its dealings with the region's inhabitants, 
the threat of war would continue to loom over the Middle East and Israel's undeclared arsenal 
of weapons of mass destruction would continue to cause concern. 
209. It was also the Agency's responsibility to strengthen the safeguards system and ensure 
that certain safety standards were established through legally binding international agreements. 
In that respect, he welcomed the Model Protocol aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and 

GC(41)/ 
OR.6 
page

improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
of 
the 
Agency's 
inspectors 
responsible 
for 
verifying 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
were 
Lebanese 
nationals. 
However, 
safeguards 
should 
be 
fully 
implemented 
in 
all 
countries 
on 
a 
systematic 
basis. 
There 
was 
one 
State 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
namely 
Israel, 
whose 
undeclared 
nuclear 
reactors 
were 
a 
threat 
to 
its 
neighbours 
and 
other 
countries. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
put 
pressure 
on 
Israel 
to 
accept 
Agency 
safeguards 
as 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
had 
done. 


210. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
amendment 
of 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute, 
the 
African 
proposal 
seemed 
to 
be 
the 
most 
acceptable 
to 
a 
large 
number 
of 
Member 
States. 
However, 
linking 
the 
enlargement 
of 
the 
Board 
to 
the 
inclusion 
of 
Israel 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia 
Group 
was 
both 
unprecedented 
and 
unacceptable. 
Though 
every 
country 
did 
have 
the 
right 
to 
belong 
to 
a 
regional 
group, 
equally 
every 
group 
had 
the 
right 
to 
accept 
or 
reject 
any 
request 
for 
admission 
to 
it. 
211. 
Turning 
to 
technical 
co-operation, 
he 
said 
that, 
although 
the 
Agency 
was 
not 
properly 
speaking 
a 
development 
body, 
the 
rapid 
economic 
globalization 
which 
was 
taking 
place 
meant 
that 
it 
would 
have 
to 
move 
beyond 
its 
traditional 
role 
and 
strengthen 
its 
partnership 
with 
counterpart 
organizations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
building 
new 
partnerships 
with 
national 
planning 
and 
development 
ministries, 
international 
aid 
organizations 
and 
the 
private 
sector. 
In 
that 
respect, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
focusing 
on 
technology 
management 
aimed 
at 
resolving 
economic 
and 
social 
problems. 
212. 
After 
years 
of 
forced 
delay, 
Lebanon 
was 
trying 
to 
make 
up 
for 
lost 
time: 
thus, 
with 
the 
co-operation 
of 
the 
Agency, 
it 
had 
set 
up 
the 
National 
Atomic 
Energy 
Centre 
which 
was 
responsible 
for 
several 
Agency-approved 
projects, 
in 
particular 
on 
monitoring 
of 
rinderpest 
and 
control 
of 
the 
medfly. 
Also 
worth 
mentioning 
was 
the 
project 
on 
the 
use 
of 
a 
Van 
de 
Graaff 
accelerator 
which 
was 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
co-operation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
should 
help 
the 
National 
Atomic 
Energy 
Centre 
strengthen 
its 
capacity 
for 
elemental 
analysis. 
His 
country 
found 
the 
increased 
use 
which 
was 
being 
made 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
in 
the 
development 
and 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
particularly 
interesting 
and 
saw 
it 
as 
an 
important 
factor 
as 
regards 
stability 
and 
development 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
Agency 
should 
intensify 
its 
efforts 
in 
that 
area 
at 
both 
national 
and 
international 
level 
with 
a 
view 
to 
making 
isotope 
hydrology 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
water 
management. 
213. 
Finally, 
he 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
Lebanon 
had 
signed, 
on 
the 
preceding 
day, 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management, 
the 
Protocol 
to 
Amend 
the 
Vienna 
Convention 
on 
Civil 
Liability 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
Supplementary 
Compensation 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage. 
Furthermore, 
in 
1997 
the 
Lebanese 
parliament 
had 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
on 
Early 
Notification 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident, 
the 
Vienna 
Convention 
on 
Civil 
Liability 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage, 
the 
Convention 
on 
Assistance 
in 
the 
Case 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
or 
Radiological 
Emergency 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material. 
It 
had 
already 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
in 
the 
preceding 
year. 
214. 
Mr. 
GREGORIC 
(Slovenia), 
after 
congratulating 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
on 
his 
appointment 
to 
the 
post 
of 
Director 
General 
and 
paying 
tribute 
to 
the 
work 
of 
Mr. 
Blix 
during 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 43 


his 16 years at the head of the Agency, welcomed the Agency's two new members, 
Burkina Faso and Malta. 


215. A number of important events had occurred in 1997, which marked the fortieth 
anniversary of the Agency's establishment, including the adoption of the Protocol to Amend 
the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. The work done by the legal and technical 
experts in that regard was to be commended. Congratulations were also due for the speed 
with which the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety 
of Radioactive Waste Management had been negotiated and adopted. Slovenia, which had 
signed the Convention on the day it had been opened for signature, was fully convinced that 
those three new international instruments would promote even closer collaboration between 
Member States and enhance nuclear safety worldwide. 
216. Turning to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, to which Slovenia was party, he said 
that the Contracting Parties, in adopting the Convention, had established a framework for peer 
review of national reports. That peer review process implied a firm obligation on the part of 
the Contracting Parties to submit regular reports for review. During the meeting of the 
Contracting Parties held at the Agency in April 1997, the date of the first review meeting had 
been set and all the Contracting Parties were now obliged to do their best to prepare their 
national reports. 
217. The thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of the Tlatelolco Treaty, an 
instrument which had helped keep nuclear weapons out of Latin America and had encouraged 
the acceptance of global nonproliferation, 
also fell in 1997. The regional approach to 
nonproliferation 
established by the Tlatelolco Treaty had been followed in the South Pacific 
by the Rarotonga Treaty, in Africa by the Pelindaba Treaty, and in South East Asia by the 
Bangkok Treaty. Those four treaties establishing nuclearweaponfree 
zones were an 
encouragement to other regions of the world, in particular the Middle East and the Indian 
subcontinent, to take positive steps towards elaborating a similar treaty which required the 
States Party to it not only to comply with nonproliferation 
obligations but also to abide by 
undertakings in the areas of nuclear trade, nuclear safety and the management of radioactive 
material. 
218. In June 1997, the Slovenian parliament had ratified the country's safeguards agreement 
with the Agency. Moreover, Slovenia welcomed the text of the Model Protocol which had 
been elaborated by the Committee on Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the 
Efficiency of the Safeguards System, and intended to conclude an agreement of that kind in 
the near future. In that regard, he took note of the progress which had been made with the 
implementation of other measures to strengthen the efficiency and improve the effectiveness of 
Agency safeguards within the framework of Programme 93+2. 
219. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material was another matter of concern to Slovenia and all 
Member States. The Agency's role in combating such trafficking deserved the praise of the 
international community. Slovenia was honoured to be among the fifty countries taking part in 
the programme set up by the Agency to support the global efforts to combat illicit trafficking 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 44 


and the unauthorized use or movement of nuclear material and other radioactive sources 
dangerous to public health. In December 1996, a successful mission had been carried out in 
Slovenia by the newly established International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS). 


220. The past year had been a particularly busy one for his country. As a new Agency 
member, it had sought a seat on the Board of Governors for the first time. It was firmly 
committed to the Agency's objectives and attached great importance to its role and activities 
in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He thanked his colleagues from the Eastern 
Europe Group for supporting his country's candidature. 
221. Slovenia continued to attach great importance to the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. The Agency's efforts to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of technical 
cooperation 
activities and to promote sustainable development were to be commended. He 
also welcomed the introduction of the Model Project concept, and the regional approach to 
technical cooperation 
projects and regional cooperation 
agreements. 
222. All Member States should bear in mind that further efforts were needed to achieve 
additional savings without impairing the Agency's capacity to meet its programme objectives. 
Prompt payment of assessed contributions by all Member States would improve the Agency's 
financial situation, promote stability and facilitate the planning of activities. 
223. Ms. DORAN (Ireland), associating herself with the statement which had been 
made by the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union, paid tribute to 
Mr. Blix for his accomplishments during his 16 years at the head of the Agency, and 
congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment. Ireland welcomed the achievements of 
recent years in the area of nuclear nonproliferation, 
such as the START Treaties, the 
Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty, and the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol 
aimed at strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system, 
which demonstrated that progress was possible with the necessary political will. 
224. Her country particularly welcomed the fact that, since the last General Conference, 
Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Djibouti had acceded to the NPT, and Brazil had stated 
its intention to do so. All the commitments entered into by States under the NPT, reinforced 
by the principles and objectives agreed upon at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference, were the foundations on which any further action should be based. 
225. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly the previous week, Ireland's Foreign 
Minister, Mr. Raphael Burke, had said: "Now is the time for serious consideration of an 
integrated approach, encompassing both bilateral and multilateral negotiations, culminating in 
an international agreement on a total ban on nuclear weapons. We must inject a real sense of 
urgency into translating the goal of the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons into a more 
concrete reality. My plea is for reflection on the part of all; for compromise and for 
cooperation, 
and for a flexible rather than a dogmatic approach." 
226. In order to achieve the early elimination of nuclear weapons, it was essential to 
strengthen confidence in the effectiveness of the nonproliferation 
regime. In that regard, the 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 45 


adoption in May 1997 by the Board of Governors of the Model Additional Protocol to 
safeguards agreements was a welcome development. Ireland urged all Member States to 
conclude an additional protocol with the Agency as soon as possible. As had already been 
mentioned by the representative of Luxembourg speaking on behalf of the European Union, all 
members of the Union including Ireland were determined to conclude their protocols at the 
earliest possible date. 


227. Ireland was one of the Member States of the Agency which had decided not to use 
nuclear energy to generate electricity. While it recognized that the application of radioactivity 
brought benefits in science, technology and medicine, her country believed that nuclear power 
was unacceptable in view of the dire consequences that could arise from a nuclear accident. It 
was also clear that there was still considerable public anxiety over the environmental impact of 
radioactive waste management and disposal. In the recent past, the issues of waste transport 
and dumping at sea, siting of facilities and monitoring of waste disposal arrangements had 
provoked international controversy, and it was likely that radioactive waste management and 
its related problems would continue to give rise to vociferous concern at international level. 
228. For the Irish Government, safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel was 
one of the most important aspects of nuclear safety and it therefore welcomed the adoption of 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. That Convention was a useful addition to those 
negotiated under the auspices of the Agency with the aim of strengthening safety and 
international cooperation 
in the nuclear sector. The final text was a significant improvement 
on the original proposal, and her delegation particularly welcomed the fact that the scope of 
the Convention had been extended to include spent fuel management. Ireland would have 
preferred the Convention to include reprocessing as an integral part of spent fuel management 
and had supported proposals to that effect; however, consensus had only extended to 
voluntary arrangements. Nevertheless, in time the concern expressed at international level 
might influence those countries which had opposed the inclusion of reprocessing within the 
scope of the Convention. It was to be hoped that the voluntary declaration provided for in 
Article 3 of the Convention would act as an incentive to all countries to declare their 
reprocessing activities. 
229. Having no nuclear power plant of its own, Ireland welcomed the provisions in the new 
Joint Convention which obliged States to consult their neighbours on the siting of facilities 
they planned to build. A similar consultation procedure was to be found in Article 17 of the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. Those consultation obligations were relevant to Ireland's 
longstanding 
objections to the operation of nuclear facilities at Sellafield on the west coast of 
Great Britain, mainly on the grounds that a serious accident at that site could cause 
contamination in Ireland. Although the new Joint Convention would not, of course, lead to 
the closure of Sellafield, its entry into force should promote an international climate where the 
legitimate fears and concerns of neighbouring countries would be accorded greater 
understanding and respect. Ireland had just signed the Joint Convention and it urged all 
Member States to do likewise without delay. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 46 


230. With respect to the issue of liability for nuclear damage, Ireland as a country with no 
nuclear facilities had a clear interest in securing the broadest possible liability regime covering 
operators, insurance companies and the States where facilities were sited. That regime should 
provide for the highest possible levels of compensation and offer simple, effective, speedy and 
impartial mechanisms for settling claims. 
231. In 1986, the Chernobyl accident and its transboundary effects had revealed the 
inadequacy of the existing nuclear liability law. Since then, the Agency had been seeking ways 
to harmonize, strengthen and broaden the international legal regime on civil liability for nuclear 
damage, and to develop a liability instrument that would attract wide adherence by both 
nuclear and nonnuclear 
countries with a view to achieving a single and comprehensive legal 
system. The Agency's Secretariat, its Legal Division, and those involved in the negotiations 
which had culminated in the adoption of legal instruments at the recent diplomatic conference, 
should be congratulated. 
232. However, Ireland felt that the funding which would be made available to victims of 
nuclear damage under the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the new Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear 
Damage was inadequate. It would have preferred a system of unlimited liability under which 
compensation would be granted for all nuclear damage. Nevertheless, it hoped sincerely that 
the instruments concerned would provide a framework for the modernization and 
strengthening of the international nuclear liability regime. Without an effective and generally 
recognized liability regime, international efforts to improve nuclear safety would be 
substantially undermined. 
233. Mr. ALBOUANIN 
(Qatar) congratulated the new Director General on his 
appointment, paid tribute to his predecessor and welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso to the 
Agency. He urged Member States to give more support to the Director General so as to 
enable him to step up his consultations with countries in the Middle East with a view to 
achieving fiill application of the safeguards system and the placement of all facilities in the 
region under Agency control. The conclusion of an agreement establishing a zone free of 
nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East would clearly be a 
decisive factor in promoting a climate of mutual trust, and an important step towards a 
general, just and lasting peace in the region. 
234. Drawing attention to the Director General's report on the application of Agency 
safeguards in the Middle East, he said that his country, aware of the need for all countries in 
the Middle East without exception to accede to the NPT, was extremely concerned over the 
failure of the peace process owing to the repressive measures and acts of provocation of the 
Israeli Government which was continuing to establish settlements on Araboccupied 
territory 
and was trying to shirk its obligations under agreements concluded with the Palestinian 
Authority. He stressed the need to work towards the establishment of a general peace in 
accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly. 
235. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, the increase in the number 
of Member States had made the question of equitable representation of the developing 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 47 


countries on the Board of Governors more urgent than ever. As for the composition of the 
regional groups, account should be taken of all the pertinent political factors, but the decision 
should be taken by the regional group concerned. 


236. The Agency should not concentrate its activities on safeguards and the safety of 
reactor operation and radioactive waste management: it should also allocate more resources 
to assisting developing countries with technology transfer, an objective which was its 
raison d'etre. The developing countries should be able to benefit from the peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy in such fields as agriculture, health, protection of the 
environment and food preservation. In that connection, Qatar attached great importance to 
projects relating to the supply of water to arid zones and hoped that the Agency would play an 
active and effective role in the application of nuclear techniques to exploitation of 
groundwater resources. It was time to see tangible results from the projects on the 
construction of economically competitive and ecologically safe facilities for the production of 
potable water by nuclear desalination. 
237. Mr. FÖRSTER (Netherlands) first of all fully endorsed the statement made by 
the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union. He paid tribute to the 
Director General and the Secretariat of the Agency on its fortieth anniversary and welcomed 
its two new members, Malta and Burkina Faso. He also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his 
appointment as Director General on the eve of the third millennium. The mission the Agency 
had been entrusted with 40 years ago had been twofold: 
to enable all countries to make the 
best use of progress in nuclear science and technology, while at the same time safeguarding 
the world from their use for military purposes. That mission remained as relevant now as it 
had been in 1957, from both the political and the environmental point of view, and the Agency 
should continue its work. 
238. The main objective of the Netherlands energy policy was to improve energy efficiency 
by a third over the next 25 years and ensure that, by the year 2010, 10% of its total primary 
energy consumption came from renewable energy sources, with a view to stabilizing 
CO2 emissions which should not exceed the 1990 level at that point. In addition, the electricity 
and gas markets should open up as a result of liberalization of the international energy market. 
One direct consequence ofthat development had been the closure, on 26 March 1997, of the 
Dodewaard reactor. That decision had been taken by the Netherlands electricity company 
SEP because the reactor could no longer produce electricity at a competitive price in the light 
of the impending deregulation 
of the European electricity market. The closure of Dodewaard 
would be used to gain experience in decommissioning. 
239. In the Netherlands, as in several other countries, nuclear power had a number of 
drawbacks: public acceptance was limited owing to the problems of radioactive waste, 
perceived proliferation risks and its low competitiveness. However, it also had a number of 
advantages such as its relatively stable price, the high level of uranium reserves and the lack of 
any CO2 emissions. Weighing up the advantages and disadvantages was no simple matter, and 
unnecessary at present in the Netherlands where there was a surplus rather than a shortage of 
energy; however, changing circumstances could shift the balance one way or another in the 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 48 


future. Therefore, the Netherlands Government had stated that the nuclear power option 
would be kept open; in order to maintain a certain level of competence, the Netherlands would 
remain involved in a broad range of nuclear R&D activities. It would continue to take part in 
work on the development of common safety standards and practices, mainly within the 
framework of the Agency, and would participate in international research programmes on new 
reactor types. 


240. As had been mentioned by the representative of Luxembourg and the Director General, 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was still not cooperating 
fully with the Agency as 
regards verification activities, and was therefore not complying fully with the safeguards 
agreement it had signed. It was true that the discussions with the DPRK on KEDO had 
progressed somewhat. The European Union was now a member of KEDO and had committed 
itself to contributing a maximum of 15 million ECU per year. The monitoring and verification 
tasks in Iraq continued to be hampered by the unwillingness of the Iraqi authorities; UNSCOM 
was consequently unable to carry out its mandate in full and very little progress had been made 
during the past year. 
241. Technical assistance to developing Member States, which remained one of the 
Agency's main activities, was making a definite contribution to the social and economic 
development of those countries. As always, the Netherlands would pay its assessed voluntary 
contribution to the TCF in full and on time. 
242. The CTBTO had settled in Vienna at the beginning of 1997. Evidently, Vienna had 
been selected by the international community with a view to taking advantage of the 
competence accumulated there, and benefiting from synergy with the Agency. Cooperation 
between the two organizations would be helpful to both and should lead to cost savings by 
avoiding duplication of effort. He thanked the Director General for his positive attitude in that 
regard and trusted that he would explore further the scope for cooperation. 
243. Mr. ALQAMTTI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), after welcoming Malta and 
Burkina Faso to the Agency, congratulated the new Director General on his appointment and 
paid tribute to his predecessor. The fortieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Statute 
offered an opportunity for reflecting on what approaches should be adopted in the future to 
enable the Agency to contribute to solving key problems affecting economic and social 
development, the environment, health, food reserves, water resources, peace and security, on 
which the fate of the entire world population depended. He hoped that the Agency would 
continue to play a role in attaining those noble objectives by promoting constructive dialogue 
between Member States. 
244. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya attached high priority to the Agency's technical 
cooperation 
activities in all fields in which nuclear energy was used. For that reason, despite 
the difficulties it faced as a result of the economic sanctions imposed on it, it was making 
efforts to strengthen its economic cooperation 
relations with the Agency, as could be seen 
from the projects aimed at increasing livestock productivity using RIA techniques, raising the 
quality of radiotherapy and improving certain barley varieties. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 49 


245. Technology transfer was nevertheless subject to the iniquitous embargo placed on the 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which meant that the country was being held back on the 
technological front. Evidence of that were the measures the Agency had taken with regard to 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, such as the cancellation of the project on nondestructive 
testing, 
and the fact that equipment was no longer being supplied to it and its engineers were being 
excluded from training fellowships or other activities, even though it had concluded a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement under which the Agency was conducting regular 
inspections. He therefore called upon the Agency to lift all restrictions on technology transfer 
to the developing countries, and to put an end to such practices where they were being applied 
to his country so that the latter could benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in 
accordance with the principles governing technical cooperation, 
and the Agency's Statute. 
Failing that, all the agreements concluded between the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and the Agency 
would be worthless. 
246. Many developing countries, including his own, would not be able to meet their 
growing energy needs in the coming decades without having recourse to nuclear power. 
Lowand 
mediumcapacity 
reactors were well adapted to the consumption levels of small 
countries. In 1989, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had submitted a draft resolution on seawater 
desalination using nuclear reactors which had been approved by the General Conference in 
resolution GC(XXXIII)/RES/515 and which requested the Director General to assess the 
technical and economic potential for using nuclear reactors in seawater desalination. An 
international advisory group had recently been set up to carry out that study and it seemed 
likely that practical results would be achieved as regards the commissioning of demonstration 
reactors. His country attached enormous importance to that project and intended to 
participate in all the activities related to it. 
247. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also attached high priority to disarmament and 
international security because it was convinced that weapons of mass destruction were a threat 
to international peace and security. For that reason, it had been a constant advocate of 
denuclearization of the Middle East in international fora. In that regard, it was essential that 
Israel the 
only country in the region with nuclear weapons submit 
its nuclear installations to 
Agency safeguards and control, in accordance with the Treaty on the NonProliferation 
of 
Nuclear Weapons. There could be no peace in the region as long as some powers continued 
to help and support Israel. 
248. His country welcomed the Agency's efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the safeguards system under Programme 93+2 whose aim was the 
nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. The mere use of the term nonproliferation, 
as opposed 
to elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, was a direct acknowledgement of the right 
of certain countries to possess such weapons, and that was flagrant discrimination and 
conjured up the spectre of mass destruction. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya felt that, for 
Programme 93+2 to be truly universal, all weapons of mass destruction had to be eliminated. 
He recalled that Israel, which had an arsenal of weapons of that type, had not accepted either 
Agency safeguards or any other international control. Under those circumstances, safeguards 
merely allowed a number of countries possessing such weapons to dominate others. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 50 


249. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, the developments which 
had taken place in the world were arguments in favour of an expansion of the Board of 
Governors, and the latter's credibility and moral and political authority would be enhanced by 
such a move. Africa was very much the poor relation in that respect, and he recalled that 
resolution GC(XXV)/RES/389 had recognized that state of affairs and recommended 
remedying the situation. He therefore hoped that the ongoing consultations on that issue 
would reach a successful conclusion. 
250. Though he appreciated the Agency's efforts to achieve better representation of the 
developing countries among its staff, no significant progress had been made in that regard and, 
for that reason, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had continued to press for the recruitment of more 
people from those countries to senior posts. 
251. Mr. MINTY (South Africa) first of all welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso to 
the Agency which had been founded 40 years previously to promote the idea of "Atoms for 
Peace". With the help of the Agency, considerable developments had taken place in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy since that time, but the investments to date in that area had 
unfortunately been far outweighed by the resources invested in nuclear energy's destructive 
potential. It was true that in recent years there had been a slow shift towards the gradual 
abandonment of those destructive uses: some nuclear weapons had been dismantled by the 
nuclearweapon 
States, and the weaponsgrade 
material released had been placed under 
Agency safeguards albeit 
different safeguards from those applied to most Member States. 
However, that was only a beginning and enormous destructive potential remained, especially 
since not all countries in possession of nuclear weapons had taken such measures. The total 
elimination of nuclear weapons was still a remote objective. 
252. South Africa had been a founder member of the Agency, which occupied an 
outstanding place among the United Nations specialized agencies, and the part it had played in 
the organization had been remarkable. After playing an important and enthusiastic role during 
the Agency's early years, South Africa had been excluded from the General Conference and 
the Board of Governors owing to the policies of the apartheid regime and suspicion of its 
nuclear weapon ambitions. Then came a period of transition during which his Government 
had joined the NPT in 1991 and announced the dismantling of its nuclear arsenal in 1993. 
With the advent of the new democratic Government in 1994 the situation had begun to return 
to normal, and South Africa had been reintegrated into the United Nations system and the 
Agency. It now attached the very highest priority to the promotion of global disarmament and 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, particularly in Africa. No longer outlawed by the 
international community, South Africa was able to join other countries in seeking solutions to 
global problems. He thanked the Agency and its Director General, Mr. Blix, who had helped 
his country during that transitional phase, and the Africa Group whose collective action over 
that period had culminated in the adoption of the Pelindaba Treaty. South Africa joined in the 
tributes which had been paid to Mr. Blix both in the Board of Governors and during the 
current session of the General Conference for the work he had done during the past 16 years. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 51 


253. The Agency had always played an important role in nonproliferation 
through its 
safeguards system and should be commended on the adoption in 1997 of the Additional 
Protocol to strengthen the safeguards system. The approval of those new measures showed 
the international community's determination to pay greater attention than ever to 
nonproliferation 
and highlighted the Agency's vital role in that effort. A sound balance had 
been struck between the Agency's promotional work and its safeguards activities, and he 
trusted that it would be maintained in the future. 
254. The Agency's founders had intended that it should promote the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy as a contribution to universal peace, health and prosperity, an objective which 
the African countries found most appropriate. He commended the work the Agency had 
carried out in Africa in the past 40 years, especially the great expansion in technical 
cooperation 
activities in recent years. Under the wise guidance of Mr. Qian, the Department 
of Technical Cooperation 
had made extraordinary progress in terms of both organizational 
efficiency and project planning and implementation. In the context of that ongoing 
restructuring and improvement, South Africa was eager to contribute to the promotion of 
technical cooperation 
in developing countries, in particular in Africa. It had placed its nuclear 
infrastructure at the disposal of the Agency so as to help it achieve its objectives in a continent 
that had so much need of the international community's support. In that regard, he welcomed 
the fact that the Agency's new Director General was an African who well understood the 
situation in that region and would be particularly well qualified to assist it. Now that the 
international community and the United Nations were focusing their attention on Africa, it 
seemed an appropriate time for the Agency to reevaluate 
all aspects of its relations with that 
continent. It was common knowledge that Africa was underrepresented 
on the Board, and 
the Africa Group's position on that score was well known. 
255. Apart from strengthened safeguards and the improvements which had been made in the 
Department of Technical Cooperation 
through the introduction of Model Projects, the 
Agency could pride itself on the adoption of new legal instruments which owed much to the 
influence of Mr. Blix, and which South Africa supported. 
256. The establishment of nuclearweaponfree 
zones had been one of the most significant 
developments of the past 40 years. South Africa had been the only country to decide 
unilaterally to dismantle its nuclear arsenal, thereby demonstrating that provided 
the political 
will was there it 
should be possible to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world completely. 
South Africa's international and regional security was made more assured by total nuclear 
disarmament than by the possession of nuclear weapons. Once it had destroyed its nuclear 
weapons and joined the NPT, the way was paved for the ideal of the military denuclearization 
of Africa to become a reality. 
257. Worrying indications had emerged regarding the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. During the discussions of the Informal Working Group on the Financing of 
Technical Assistance held over the past year under the chairmanship of South Africa's 
Ambassador to Vienna, it had become very clear that implementation of the technical 
cooperation 
programme could be threatened if steps were not taken to ensure that the level of 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 52 


resources in the TCF increased at a rate sufficient to enable the many very worthwhile projects 
in the technical cooperation 
programme to be funded. Now, apparently because of the 
financial problems countries were experiencing, the target levels traditionally attained by 
certain donor countries in recent decades might not be met in 1998. That would be very 
worrying, as a decline in the Fund would be a clear indication of lack of commitment to 
technical cooperation, 
which would be particularly unfortunate at a time when Member States 
had just reached agreement on issues such as the draft protocol for the strengthening of 
safeguards. He appealed to all Member States, particularly the major donors, to pay their 
contributions in full. For its part, South Africa would pay its full contribution for 1998, which 
was no easy matter given the very difficult situation in which it found itself. However, it was 
prepared to do all it could to meet its obligations as it attached great importance to the 
Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. 


258. In conclusion, he said that the Agency was in good shape overall and well equipped to 
confront with vigour the problems of the next millennium. Its Member States should not lose 
sight of the intentions and ideals of the Agency's founders, nor the aspirations of the many 
developing countries which supported its work. 
259. Mr. HASHIM (Malaysia) paid tribute to the Agency which for 40 years had 
adapted itself successfully to the many changes which had taken place in the world, and had 
worked unceasingly to achieve the objectives set forth in Article II of its Statute. After 
welcoming Malta and Burkina Faso to the Agency, he commended Mr. Blix for the work he 
had done in his 16 years at the head of the Agency and said that the appointment of 
Mr. ElBaradei constituted a historic step for the Agency's developing Member States. 
260. The fortyfirst 
session of the General Conference coincided with the 25th anniversary 
of the Regional Cooperative 
Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to 
Nuclear Science and Technology (RCA). The latter had facilitated, inter alia, the 
establishment of nuclear science and technology infrastructures, capacity building, and the 
development of peaceful applications of nuclear technology. Malaysia, which was one of the 
most active members of the RCA, had already agreed to its extension. 
261. In order to take better advantage of the benefits for sustainable development of nuclear 
science and technology, cooperation 
with nontraditional 
or nonnuclear 
organizations should 
be increased. Almost all the national nuclear institutes in the Agency's Member States had 
links with one another through the Agency or in some other way, but they should make further 
efforts to cooperate 
with organizations not involved in nuclear energy. 
262. Turning to the financing of technical assistance, and in particular the issue of eligibility 
for technical assistance, he drew attention to the principles and objectives for nuclear 
nonproliferation 
and disarmament agreed upon at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference and, in particular, the undertaking by the signatory Parties to facilitate the fullest 
possible exchange of equipment, materials, and scientific and technological information for the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In addition, the States Party to the NPT were required to 
make every effort to provide the Agency with the financial and human resources it needed to 
fulfil its responsibilities, including those relating to technical cooperation. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 53 


263. In contrast to other organizations in the United Nations system, the Agency was 
responsible for other activities besides technical assistance and cooperation, 
for example 
safeguards. Although the UNDP's guidelines on the eligibility of projects for funding were 
relevant up to a point, the fact remained that technical assistance at the Agency also included 
cooperation 
and the promotion of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The 
responsibilities and obligations of UNDP and the Agency were therefore different. 
264. He noted with concern that the TCF seemed likely to record a deficit of five million 
dollars in 1997. Malaysia had paid its full contribution to the Fund on time, in line with the 
negotiated and agreed EPF. It would continue to meet its financial obligations in 1998 and 
called upon other Member States to do likewise. 
265. Malaysia welcomed the adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, despite the unresolved 
problems that remained. One outstanding issue which directly concerned his country was 
prior notification of transit States of transboundary movements of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste, and the need to obtain those States' consent for such movements. 
266. He also welcomed the fact that the diplomatic conference had adopted a resolution 
urging all States which acceded to the Joint Convention to take full account of the Agency's 
Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material in connection with such 
transboundary movements, especially when formulating and implementing national laws and 
regulations. Given the multidimensional nature of the issues involved in transboundary 
movements, Malaysia also welcomed the decision to strengthen collaboration between the 
Agency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the United Nations Environment 
Programme (UNEP). 
267. Prior to the entry into force of the Joint Convention, the transport of radioactive waste 
should comply fully with international safety standards and the Agency's guidelines on the 
export, transport and disposal of nuclear wastes, including lowlevel 
waste, as urged at the 
meeting of foreign ministers of European and Asian countries held in Singapore in February. 
That request had been echoed at the fourth meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum held in 
Kuala Lumpur in July. 
268. Malaysia also took note of the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and of the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage. In that regard, it was regrettable that the concerns of 
nonnuclear 
States had not been met. The Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
Nuclear Damage required in effect that States which did not contribute to the risk of nuclear 
damage contribute to the compensation, which ran contrary to the "polluter pays" principle. 
His country believed that such an arrangement would create a dangerous precedent and might 
prompt the countries concerned to assign lower priority to the safety of industrial facilities 
within their territories. Liability costs for nuclear facilities should be fully taken into account 
at the planning stage by the States constructing such installations. Those States should be 
fully liable for accidents caused by their facilities, which should encourage them to promote a 
nuclear safety culture in their country. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 54 


269. His country remained fully committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear 
weapons and supported all the international community's efforts to strengthen nuclear 
nonproliferation. 
It therefore welcomed the entry into force of the Treaty on the Southeast 
Asia NuclearWeaponFree 
Zone. It also noted with satisfaction the adoption of the text of 
the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements between States and the Agency, and 
had begun familiarizing its relevant national agencies with the implications of the Protocol and 
the internal mechanisms which would have to be instituted to meet the obligations deriving 
from it. At the same time, Malaysia was conscious that legitimate international trade might be 
restricted by new export control measures. 
270. Malaysia hoped that any further efforts to strengthen the international safeguards 
system, especially in connection with dualuse 
items, would be characterized by greater 
transparency. Serious consideration should be given to the concerns of States which had 
signed the NPT and other international instruments prohibiting the development, testing and 
acquisition of nuclear weapons, and which were at the same time becoming important players 
in legitimate international trade. In that context, his delegation welcomed the initiative taken 
by the Nuclear Suppliers Group in organizing an international seminar on the role of export 
controls in nuclear nonproliferation 
which was to be held in Vienna in the coming week. 
Though that Group and the Agency did have interests in common, his delegation was 
particularly concerned that any close cooperation 
between the two organizations should be 
transparent for the Agency's Member States. 
271. Mr. SUBKI (Indonesia), having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new 
members of the Agency, thanked Mr. Blix for his eloquent statement highlighting the results 
obtained by the Agency over the past year and emphasizing the need to continue improving 
the efficiency of its work. He also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment as 
Director General and assured him of his Government's full support in the discharge of his 
onerous task. In addition, he paid tribute to Mr. Blix for the valuable work he had done over 
16 years in which the Agency had had to face such serious challenges as the Chernobyl 
accident, and the implementation of the Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq and to the 
DPRK's nuclear programme. 
272. Indonesia attached great importance to the safeguards system and felt that it should be 
strengthened in order to promote cooperation 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and 
prevent its use for other purposes which ran counter to the safeguards agreements concluded 
by States. 
273. In parallel with the efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of 
the safeguards system, the South East Asian countries, including Indonesia, had concluded the 
Bangkok Treaty in 1995 establishing a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in South East Asia. That 
Treaty was important because it helped enhance peace and stability in the region and the world 
as a whole. His delegation hoped that the nuclearweapon 
States would accede to the 
Protocol to the Treaty. He commended the Chairman of the Committee on Strengthening the 
Effectiveness and Improving the Efficiency of the Safeguards System for the work he had 
done in the past year. Furthermore, he noted with satisfaction finalization of the draft Model 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 55 


Protocol, which instrument should promote the achievement of nuclear nonproliferation 
objectives. 


274. With respect to measures to strengthen international cooperation 
in the safety field, 
significant progress had been made through the conclusion of new legal instruments relating to 
nuclear safety, the safety of spent fuel and waste management, liability and safeguards. The 
adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety 
of Radioactive Waste Management should help strengthen the global nuclear safety culture 
and demonstrate to the public that governments were agreed on what methods to apply. 
Indonesia was therefore ready to sign that new instrument in due course. 
275. As a contribution to the global nuclear safety culture, his Government had enacted a 
law in 1997 containing various provisions on regulation, waste management and liability for 
nuclear damage. That law stipulated, inter alia, that no part of Indonesia could be used by 
another country as a radioactive waste repository and it provided for the establishment of an 
independent nuclear energy regulatory body. He welcomed the adoption of the Protocol to 
Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which covered not only legal but also 
technical and economic aspects of nuclear liability. 
276. Turning to the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme, he said that his delegation 
was grateful to the Director General for the comprehensive report contained in document 
GC(41)/INF/4. It supported the new initiatives adopted by the Agency to strengthen technical 
cooperation 
through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving the 
scientific and technical capabilities of developing countries in the peaceful application of 
nuclear energy. Along those lines, Indonesia had implemented research and development 
projects aimed in particular at accelerating human resources development. The Agency had 
made a significant contribution to economic development in Indonesia, and was continuing to 
do so through a Model Project on feed supplementation using urea molasses multinutrient 
blocks to increase livestock production. 
277. With respect to the use of nuclear energy for power production, his country thanked 
the Agency for the valuable help it had given its National Atomic Energy Agency (BATAN), 
particularly with the reviewing of the feasibility study for the proposed first nuclear power 
plant. A group of experts had been recruited by the Agency and sent to Indonesia for that 
purpose. His delegation hoped that the Agency would continue to provide assistance and 
advice. Indonesia was committed to finalizing the feasibility study especially 
the financial 
aspects, the geological research and the public information side because 
it was convinced 
that nuclear power was one of the most promising energy options for the country in both the 
short and the long term. 
278. Moreover, his delegation was following with interest the followup 
measures taken by 
the Agency to strengthen the technical cooperation 
programme and was ready to cooperate 
with it in the formulation of Country Programme Frameworks. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 56 


279. Turning to Article VI of the Statute, he said his country was dissatisfied that, after so 
many years of work, hardly any progress had been made. He hoped that, after its examination 
of the three proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Board of Governors, the Africa 
Group and Canada, the General Conference would finally arrive at a compromise solution 
acceptable to all. 
280. During the past 25 years, RCA activities had brought significant benefit to the region 
and the individual countries in it. Indonesia would continue to participate actively in that 
programme which had helped it develop its manpower and technical capabilities, and enabled it 
to apply them to the promotion of industrial growth, health care, protection of the 
environment and agriculture. His delegation was therefore in favour of extending the 
Agreement. 
281. In conclusion, he said that his Government would continue to support the Agency in 
implementing its programmes which promoted international cooperation 
in the peaceful uses 
of nuclear science and technology, in particular for the benefit of developing countries. He 
announced that Indonesia would pay $100 100 into the Technical Cooperation 
Fund 
for 1998, which was its full share of the target. It would continue to make available its 
facilities for the placement of fellowshipholders 
from other developing countries, and to 
organize regional or interregional training courses as additional contributions in kind. 
282. Ms. MOSLEY (New Zealand) said that, for her country, the most important 
aspect of the Agency's activities was its safeguards work pursuant to Article III of the NPT: 
the Agency was a key organization in the field of nonproliferation 
and disarmament. The 
indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995, which New Zealand had strongly supported, had 
confirmed the vital importance of Agency safeguards in underpinning the nonproliferation 
regime. 
283. New Zealand welcomed the development of the Model Protocol additional to Agency 
safeguards agreements and looked forward to its formal adoption by the Conference. The new 
measures it provided for would greatly enhance the Agency's ability to detect undeclared 
nuclear activities. She encouraged all Member States primarily 
those which had concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements, but also the nuclearweapon 
States and those which 
had concluded INFCIRC/66type 
agreements to 
conclude a protocol as soon as possible. 
For its part, New Zealand had embarked on the preliminary domestic consultations required 
for the conclusion of a protocol to the INFCIRC/153type 
agreement it had concluded with 
the Agency. 
284. On the other hand, her Government was deeply concerned over the total lack of 
progress in the implementation of the safeguards agreement between the Agency and 
the DPRK. That agreement remained in force and was binding, and the DPRK was in breach 
of its legal obligations not only to the Agency but also to all its Member States. New Zealand 
strongly supported the Framework Agreement which was making a vital contribution to 
regional stability and security; it was making a financial contribution to KEDO, and the 
New Zealand Government had been represented at the ceremony marking the start of work on 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 57 


the construction of a new light water reactor in the DPRK. That work was progressing 
satisfactorily and it was high time that the DPRK honoured its international obligations. 


285. On a more optimistic note, she pointed out that there had been a positive development 
in the South Pacific. For almost 40 years, New Zealanders and other people in the South 
Pacific had been worried about the environmental effects of nuclear testing in the region. 
Happily, those tests had come to an end. Her country welcomed the independent investigation 
which was being carried out by an International Advisory Committee of eminent scientists, 
under the auspices of the Agency, on the environmental impact of the nuclear testing at the 
Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls. New Zealand scientists were participating actively in that 
study and her country was looking forward to publication of the report in 1998. 
286. Along with other South Pacific countries, New Zealand had welcomed the recent 
ratification by the United Kingdom of the Protocols to the Rarotonga Treaty. It urged the 
United States to ratify those Protocols as soon as possible. 
287. The establishment of the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the Comprehensive 
NuclearTestBan 
Treaty Organization in Vienna in 1997, and the appointment of 
Mr. Hoffmann as Executive Secretary were also welcome developments. The CTBT 
had 47 signatories, had been ratified by seven States, and a start was being made on the setting 
up of the global monitoring system it provided for. Thus, its implementation seemed to be 
well under way. New Zealanders were very pleased that the era of nuclear testing was a thing 
of the past. 
288. The Agency had played an important role over the years in promoting nuclear safety. 
The legal instruments adopted at the diplomatic conferences in September were further steps 
in that direction. However, everyone was aware of the problems both of those instruments 
posed to New Zealand. For example, it had fundamental reservations over several aspects of 
the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. It felt that the 
compensation levels were too low, that damage should not be limited only to accidents where 
there was an emission of ionizing radiation and that, as a point of principle, countries which 
did not produce nuclear power and therefore did not create any risk should not be obliged to 
contribute to the fund. 
289. Her Government thought that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management fell well short of meeting 
the concerns of New Zealand and other coastal States as regards transboundary movements. 
As it had already stated in the Agency and other fora, New Zealand was uneasy about the 
shipping of radioactive waste through the Pacific. The recent South Pacific Forum meeting in 
Rarotonga had declared that shipments of radioactive waste and plutonium through the region 
were cause for continuing concern. New Zealand's disquiet about such shipments was well 
known and it was pressing for strengthening of the relevant international controls. It had a 
direct interest in ensuring not only that transboundary movements of nuclear waste by sea 
complied with international safety standards, but also that such standards reflected the highest 
safety levels and took full account of the concerns of coastal States and their populations. It 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 58 


was therefore seeking significant enhancement of current international standards. At relevant 
international meetings, New Zealand had pressed for prior informed consent procedures for 
transboundary movements of spent fuel or radioactive waste for the coastal States which 
might be affected. Sufficient advance notice, full consultation and the consent of coastal 
States were essential transparency measures which would enable those States to protect their 
environment. 


290. New Zealand understood and shared the concerns expressed by the Republic of Korea 
regarding the planned shipment of nuclear waste from Taiwan to the DPRK. As it had said in 
the Board of Governors in March, international transport of nuclear material demanded the 
greatest possible transparency and prior consultation. It urged those involved to heed the 
concerns of States which might be affected, like the Republic of Korea, and of the 
international community in general. 
291. Of the issues before the General Conference, the review of Article VI of the Statute 
posed special problems. New Zealand felt strongly that all the issues should be resolved to the 
satisfaction of all Member States without exception, so that the Agency could concentrate on 
its core responsibilities. A formula for achieving that goal had in fact been found, namely the 
Canadian proposal. Of course, it required States to compromise on one issue or another about 
which they felt strongly, but it was only through such compromise that agreement could be 
reached. If that solution was not accepted at the current session of the General Conference, 
the only option would be to set those issues aside until the external factors which were beyond 
the control of the Agency and its Member States changed for the better. 
292. For New Zealand, the Agency's main importance lay in its contribution to international 
security through its role in disarmament and nonproliferation. 
In contributing to the 
verification of further nonproliferation 
and disarmament measures and to the eventual 
elimination of nuclear weapons, the Agency would have to face new challenges. New Zealand 
hoped that the strengthened safeguards system would be in place in most countries by the time 
of the NPT Review Conference in the year 2000. It hoped that, by that time, negotiations 
would have begun on a treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for military 
purposes, and that consideration would have been given to further multilateral nuclear 
disarmament measures. In addition, it hoped to see further, more radical reductions in nuclear 
arsenals, including those of the three nuclearweapon 
States not currently involved in the 
START process. All those steps would have significant implications for expansion of the 
safeguards system. 
293. Over the past 40 years, the most impressive characteristic of the Agency had been the 
effective way in which it had responded to new challenges. All those who participated in its 
activities were aware of that unique flexibility and spirit of cooperation 
which, time and again, 
had enabled the Agency to deliver results. The next 40 years would also bring their share of 
challenges, but the Agency could build on its success. In that context, New Zealand paid 
tribute to the Agency's greatest strength, namely its dedicated and competent Secretariat. In 
particular, the international community was greatly indebted to Mr. Blix who had headed the 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 59 


organization for 16 years and, with the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei as his successor, could 
look to the future with confidence. 


294. Ms. PADILLA TERCERO (Nicaragua) thanked Mr. Blix on behalf of her 
Government for his 16 years devoted service to the Agency, paid tribute to the Agency on the 
occasion of its fortieth anniversary, and welcomed its two new members, Malta and 
Burkina Faso. 
295. Nicaragua had made the necessary legal arrangements to ensure that it received the 
greatest possible benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear techniques; it was preparing to 
ratify the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to sign the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
It also intended to accede to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which had been approved at two recent diplomatic 
conferences. Likewise, the Nicaraguan Government was committed to supporting and 
strengthening the ARCAL programme. 
296. It was more difficult to receive than to give. Those who requested assistance had to be 
accountable and remain forever grateful, whereas the donor derived a double advantage: 
firstly the feeling of usefulness, and secondly the opportunity to make use of his technology. 
Nicaragua was one of the countries with the difficult role to play, since it had need of others' 
assistance. The Agency's cooperation 
activities involved the implementation of various 
projects in fields such as medicine, agriculture, stockbreeding, hydrology, geothermal 
science, etc. That assistance had improved the socioeconomic 
situation of the Nicaraguan 
population. Nicaragua therefore attached great importance to the further development of 
technical cooperation 
activities for the Latin American countries and hoped that its planned 
programmes would receive the necessary funding. The living conditions of people in the 
developing countries could only be improved with the cooperation 
of those who had had the 
good fortune to achieve better living standards. 
297. In conclusion, she congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment to the post of 
Director General. She had no doubt that he would resolutely work towards the 
accomplishment of the Agency's mission, with the collaboration of all Member States. 
298. Mr. BULA CAMACHO (Colombia), after welcoming Malta and Burkina Faso 
as new Member States, sincerely congratulated the Agency and its staff on the occasion of the 
fortieth anniversary of its establishment on behalf of the President of Colombia, Mr. Samper, 
the Colombian Foreign Minister, Ms. Mejia, and himself. 
299. During the 40 years it had been in existence, the Agency had fulfilled the purpose for 
which it had been established by the United Nations General Assembly, namely to "... seek to 
accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity 
throughout the world ...", while also ensuring that "... assistance provided by it or at its 
request or under its supervision or control is not used in such a way as to further any military 
purpose." 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 60 


300. The Agency had promoted research and development in the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy by facilitating exchange of scientific and technical information, implementing 
safeguards to prevent the diversion of nuclear material for military purposes, and establishing 
standards to protect health and ensure safety in the utilization of nuclear energy. 
301. Special mention should be made of the application of nuclear techniques in the food 
sector. Although an alarming number of people in the world were experiencing hunger and 
malnutrition, and the world demand for food was set to rise in the near future, the use of 
biotechnologies and nuclear techniques to promote more productive and sustainable 
agriculture in tropical environments was making a positive contribution towards tackling that 
worrying situation. 
302. In the field of water resource management, the Agency's already notable efforts 
would need to be stepped up substantially. Scarcity of renewable water resources could 
become a critical problem in the next century, but nuclear science had developed a set of 
analytical tools isotopic 
techniques which, 
by providing vital information on those 
resources, facilitated their identification, development, protection and use. 
303. Though it would be tedious to list all the activities the Agency carried out in fulfilling 
its mission in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, nevertheless some of the 
achievements of the past year deserved a mention, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, 
the strengthening of the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system through 
Programme 93+2, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
Nuclear Damage. Those successes showed that the Agency was heading in the right direction 
to achieve its objectives. 
304. Turning to technical cooperation 
with Colombia, he drew attention to the upgrading 
of the IANR1 
reactor. That reactor had been in service since 1965 and much of its control 
and safety equipment and its nuclear fuel had reached the end of their useful life. It had 
therefore become necessary to evaluate various possibilities for extending its operation. After 
presenting those possibilities, Colombia had received assistance from the Agency which had 
enabled it to replace and modify the most important parts of the reactor, and arrange for 
theoretical and practical training abroad for Colombian specialists. The upgrading work had 
assured the reactor's safe use for the next 30 years. The instrumentation, peripheral 
equipment and fuel provided had made it one of the safest reactors anywhere. It was being 
operated in accordance with the highest safety standards and did not present any hazard. 
305. With regard to technical cooperation 
activities in Colombia in the field of nuclear 
medicine over the past five years, the project to improve the use of brachytherapy for the 
treatment of cervical cancer deserved special mention. Under that project, the National 
Cancer Institute in Bogota had been provided with new modern equipment, specialists and 
technicians had been trained and coordinated 
research programmes conducted. 

GC(41)/OR6 
page 61 


306. His country reaffirmed its support for the ARCAL programme whose high 
implementation rates demonstrated its worth. His delegation hoped that the implementation of 
an intergovernmental agreement aimed at increasing participation by the Agency and Member 
States would give fresh impetus to the programme. 
307. Lastly on the subject of technical cooperation, 
Colombia was concerned over the 
limitations or restrictions that might be imposed on certain Member States because of their 
debts. Other solutions should be considered which would avoid such measures. It was not 
appropriate in the United Nations to adopt methods of paying contributions which varied 
according to a State's power and influence. At the most recent session of the United Nations 
General Assembly in New York, the President of Colombia had stated that: "We do not want 
a United Nations divided between rich and poor, with Members having firstor 
secondclass 
status according to their economic contributions. The United Nations is not a private 
company, but the forum of solidarity in which all the countries of the world come together." 
308. His Government was troubled by the fact that the amendment of Article VI of the 
Statute had been on the agenda for 20 years without any decision being taken. He urged 
Member States to make efforts to reconcile the various points of view and arrive at an 
equitable solution. 
309. Colombia found it disquieting that the NPT was not being properly complied with, that 
important States had not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention, that there seemed to be 
no interest in proceeding further with negotiations on basic agreements to restrict the market 
in conventional weapons, which was being managed by those who supplied the tools of war, 
and that in recent years the financial resources allocated within the United Nations system to 
military operations had been 17 times greater than those allocated to social programmes. 
310. It was time to tackle the arms buildup 
which needlessly devoured resources that could 
be given over to socioeconomic 
development, and constituted a permanent threat to world 
peace and security. 
311. In the next century, the level of development of nuclear energy and its applications 
would constitute one of the key differences between developed and developing countries. In 
order to prevent that difference from becoming another unacceptable instrument of 
domination, and avoid it ever being used for military ends, a powerful International Atomic 
Energy Agency was required which was capable of making the benefits of technological 
development available to all and preventing the occurrence of a new disaster of global 
proportions. 
312. The successful transfer to Vienna of all the preparatory activities for the 
implementation of the CTBT provided another effective means of achieving that goal. The 
Nonaligned 
Movement, which Colombia currently had the honour to chair, had submitted to 
the United Nations General Assembly a number of topics of interest and concern in that 
regard. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 62 


313. Likewise, the President of Colombia had appealed for a clear and cogent strategy to 
deal with the serious problem of the arms race which would bring results. If multilateral 
organizations became malleable instruments in the hands of one or a number of States, the 
safety of the planet would be seriously threatened. 
314. Finally, he commended the outgoing Chairman of the Agency's Board of Governors, 
Mr. Walker, on his work. He also expressed his delegation's deep appreciation to the 
outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix, and conveyed its best wishes to him for the future. It 
was to Mr. Blix's skill in directing the Agency for 16 years, and his perceptiveness and 
determination that the Agency owed its leading position on the world scene and within the 
United Nations system. In addition, he welcomed the new Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, 
who was taking on a heavy responsibility as a new chapter opened in the Agency's history. 
Colombia offered him its congratulations and unconditional support. 
315. Mr. FEU ALVIM (BrazilianArgentine 
Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials) paid tribute to Mr. Blix who, as Director General of the Agency, had made 
a significant contribution to improving the safeguards system, strengthening nuclear safety and 
raising the acceptance of nuclear energy in the world. Brazil and Argentina's adherence to the 
comprehensive safeguards system through the Quadripartite Agreement to 
which ABACC 
was party was 
one of Mr. Blix's many achievements. He also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei 
on his appointment as Director General and said he felt sure that his qualities and abilities 
would enable him to contribute to the promotion of the exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, which was one of the objectives of the Agency and ABACC. 
316. ABACC had been applying regional safeguards in Brazil and Argentina for five years 
within the framework of the Agreement for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy 
which had been signed by both countries in Guadalajara (Mexico) on 18 July 1991 and had 
been in force since 12 December of the same year. ABACC's bilateral safeguards had been 
applied to all nuclear material in all the nuclear facilities in Argentina and Brazil since 
July 1992, when ABACC had started operations. 
317. In March 1994, ABACC had started applying comprehensive safeguards together with 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, in accordance with the Quadripartite Agreement 
concluded between Argentina, Brazil, the IAEA and ABACC. Since its entry into force, that 
Agreement had been viewed as the safeguards agreement with the Agency foreseen in the 
Tlatelolco Treaty. In that connection, ABACC submitted a declaration to the Brazilian and 
Argentine Governments every six months indicating whether there had been any diversion of 
nuclear material for nonpeaceful 
purposes under the terms of the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
318. Since February 1995, within the framework of the Quadripartite Agreement, ABACC 
had also been participating in the application of comprehensive safeguards in Argentina 
pursuant to the NPT. In fact, the safeguards established by the Quadripartite Agreement were 
the same as those foreseen in INFCIRC/153 for NPT safeguards agreements. Following the 
announcement by the Brazilian Government of its intention to join the NPT, both Argentina 
and Brazil would fully integrate the existing nonproliferation 
agreements, thereby reaffirming 
their traditional position that nuclear energy should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 63 


With regard to the new Protocol additional to the Quadripartite Agreement, ABACC would 
follow the initiatives taken by Brazil and Argentina in that regard. 


319. During the five years it had been applying safeguards, ABACC had consolidated its 
technical and organizational capacity. That had only been possible because of the support it 
had received from the Governments of Brazil and Argentina, despite the serious economic 
difficulties both those countries were facing. Support had been given on many occasions 
during that period. Both countries had made it possible for the ABACC Secretariat to recruit 
a small but well trained technical staff, and to have recourse to a group of inspectors with 
knowledge of the different nuclear facilities. ABACC had also been able to count on the 
support of Brazilian and Argentine experts and laboratories when faced with difficult technical 
problems. 
320. The technical cooperation 
support provided by the Agency had also been important. 
ABACC welcomed the decision of the Board of Governors to submit to the General 
Conference for its approval an agreement which would formalize and strengthen that 
cooperation. 
Technical cooperation 
between ABACC and third countries, such as the 
United States of America (Department of Energy) or France (Commissariat a l'energie 
atomique), had also been significant. Cooperation 
with EURATOM had increased and 
should be formalized through an agreement in the near future. Moreover, ABACC was 
confident of the results of the cooperative 
efforts it had recently initiated with other countries, 
in particular Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
321. The experience gained by ABACC in the application of regional safeguards had been 
used as a reference source for regions of the world where there were tensions which could 
lead to nuclear conflict. ABACC had been invited to talk about its experience at several 
regional and international meetings, including one organized under the auspices of the Agency. 
322. Regional safeguards were an efficient means of increasing trust among neighbouring 
countries. The integration of regional safeguards into the international safeguards system 
could also reinforce international confidence in the peaceful intentions of countries which 
adopted that type of safeguards. Proliferation scenarios varied from region to region and it 
was easier for a regional organization to understand the problem. 
323. The application of regional safeguards, in addition to international safeguards, should 
be seen as a way of enhancing trust among the countries of a region, and of boosting the 
international community's confidence in the countries in question. To be more widely 
adopted, regional safeguards had to be applied with greater efficiency and effectiveness, and 
that had economic ramifications. That issue would be discussed by Argentine and Brazilian 
representatives, as well as by members of the international community and ABACC's technical 
staff, at a seminar organized to celebrate ABACC's fifth anniversary on 10 October 1997 in 
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 

GC(41)/OR.6 
page 64 


324. Although the benefits of peace were not easy to quantify, by avoiding a possible 
nuclear arms race, Brazil and Argentina had made considerable savings in human and 
economic resources compared with which the ABACC operating budget was minuscule. 
However, the financing of ABACC required a considerable effort from Brazil and Argentina 
and it therefore had to produce concrete returns. Those results were already apparent. 
The meeting rose at 9.15 p.m.

REQUEST FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 
(GC(41 )/INF/21, GC(41 )/INF/22) 


1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met that morning and 
had considered two requests for the restoration of voting rights, from Liberia and Kenya. The 
Committee had recommended that the voting rights of Liberia and Kenya be restored in 
accordance with Article XIX. A of the Statute. 
2. The Committee's recommendation was accepted. 
3. Mr. HEATHCOTE (United Kingdom) said that a number of Member States 
considered the criteria governing the restoration of voting rights to be somewhat opaque and 
proposed that the Board be requested to devise criteria which would provide clearer guidance. 
4. The PRESIDENT asked the Conference whether it wished, as proposed by the 
delegate of the United Kingdom, to request the Board to develop some criteria or principles to 
govern the future consideration of requests for the restoration of voting rights, for acceptance 
by the Conference at its next session. 
5. It was so decided. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


6. Mr. SHKOLNIK (Republic of Kazakhstan) congratulated the President of the 
Conference on his election and extended his compliments to the Agency on the occasion of its 
40th anniversary. He thanked the outgoing Director General for the efforts he had made to 
strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime and promote the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, and for the invaluable support he had given to Kazakhstan during the difficult period 
when it was preparing to join the international nonproliferation 
regime. He also 
congratulated the new Director General on his appointment and expressed his full confidence 
in the latter's capacity to pursue in a worthy fashion the efforts of his predecessors. 
7. In addition, he welcomed the two new States which had joined the Agency since the 
preceding session of the General Conference, Malta and Burkina Faso. 
8. Kazakhstan was fully committed to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. 
It was a signatory of the NPT and had voted for its indefinite extension, and it had concluded a 
safeguards agreement with the Agency and signed the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty. The Government of Kazakhstan was taking steps to dismantle the fiftyyearold 
nuclear testing ground at Semipalatinsk, with the cooperation 
of the Agency. Missions had 
been dispatched to study the radiation situation with a view to cleaning up the results of many 
years of nuclear weapons testing at the site. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 6 


9. In September 1997, Kazakhstan had hosted an international conference on the 
problems of nuclear nonproliferation 
which had been attended by experts from many 
countries and international organizations, including the IAEA. The address of the participants 
at the conference to the Agency had been circulated as an official document. 
10. His country supported the Agency's efforts to strengthen the safeguards system and 
had begun to implement the Part 1 measures of Programme 93+2. It also supported the 
efforts of the international community to prevent the spread of military nuclear technology and 
attached great importance to the role played by the Agency in the field of nonproliferation. 
The Model Additional Protocol to comprehensive safeguards agreements would undoubtedly 
promote the more effective detection of undeclared nuclear activities and should generally 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the nonproliferation 
regime. He congratulated 
Australia on being the first State to sign an additional protocol and urged others to follow suit. 
Moreover, he welcomed the initiative of the nuclear powers in 
particular the Russian 
Federation and the United States in 
widening the scope of application of safeguards to their 
nuclear activities and nuclear material under their jurisdiction. 
11. Illicit trafficking in nuclear materials was an issue of growing importance to Member 
States, and Kazakhstan had adopted the Agency's requirements in that field as standards for 
its own nuclear export and import policy. 
12. Like any country with a developing nuclear industry and nuclear power programme, 
Kazakhstan was searching for acceptable solutions to the problem of radioactive waste 
management. It needed to develop uptodate 
legislation and standards in the field of 
radiation safety and waste management, and to create the corresponding infrastructure. The 
Kazakh Government supported the Agency's regional project which aimed at solving such 
problems by the beginning of the next century. His country had also signed the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. Moreover, it endorsed the Swedish Government's request that the possibility be 
investigated of combining into one programme, under the aegis of the Joint IAEA/NEA 
Uranium Group, projects relating to the study of the environmental impact of uranium industry 
waste, discharges into the air and water, working conditions, radiation safety, 
decommissioning, and restoration of the environment. 
13. Kazakhstan actively participated in Agency technical cooperation 
projects on the use 
of nuclear and isotopic techniques in industry, agriculture, medicine, hydrology, and other 
fields, and was eager to expand those cooperative 
efforts. It had acquired extensive 
experience in the use of a fast reactor for sea water desalination which it was willing to share 
with interested States. 
14. In conclusion, he assured the Agency of his country's continued support for its 
activities. 
15. Mr. RYDZKOWSKI (Poland) having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso to the 
Agency, said that Poland, as one of the States associated with the European Union, fully 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 7 


shared the views contained in the statement delivered by the delegate of Luxembourg on 
behalf of the Union. 


16. Poland had participated in the Conference on the Statute of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency in October 1956, had ratified its Statute in July 1957 when it had come into 
force, and had actively participated in the work of the Agency since its inception. Over the 
past 40 years the Agency had faithfully served the international community, reducing fears and 
turning expectations concerning the peaceful use of atomic energy into reality. 
17. The Agency's promotional work, aimed primarily at the needs of developing countries, 
had steadily grown in volume. Though itself a beneficiary of the Agency's technical assistance 
programme, his country did its best to contribute to that programme as well and would 
continue to do so. Poland regularly provided the Agency with specialists in various fields and 
was pleased to see that their work seemed to be highly appreciated. 
18. The rapid expansion of the commercial market in nuclear material and nuclear facilities 
in the Agency's early years had obviated the need for its becoming a broker in that market. 
For various reasons, arrangements for the supply of research reactors and commercial nuclear 
power plants had been almost exclusively bilateral and had not made use of the mechanism of 
Agency projects foreseen by the Statute. Under those circumstances, the IAEA had focused 
its attention on nuclear and radiological safety and safeguarding against the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. 
19. His delegation would especially like to commend the Secretariat for developing the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel and the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management and the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention, as well as for carrying out 
preparatory work on the review process under the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Poland had 
actively participated in the drafting of both the aforementioned international legal instruments 
and his delegation had just received authorization from the President of the Republic of Poland 
to sign them during the current session. 
20. A strengthened safeguards system was vital to maintaining the Agency's credibility, 
and the Secretariat and the Board of Governors deserved to be complimented for elaborating 
the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements which provided for a more rigorous 
regime. 
21. The 40th anniversary of the Agency that year coincided with the completion of 
16 years' service by Mr. Blix as Director General of the Agency. Poland was of the opinion 
that the contribution he had made to enhancing the useful role of the Agency in the world 
nuclear community was of inestimable value. He had dealt skilfully with serious crises during 
that period in the crucial areas of nuclear safety and safeguards and, by drawing lessons from 
those events, had moved the Agency into a position of increasing strength. 
22. The Polish delegation wished to thank Mr. Blix very warmly for his generous and 
untiring service to the nuclear community, and bid him good health and happiness in the 
future. 

GC(41)/OR.7

23. The Polish Government had given its full support to the appointment by the Board of 
Governors of Mr. ELBaradei as Director General of the Agency for the four years 
commencing 1 December 1997. He congratulated him on the unanimous approval by the 
General Conference of that appointment and wished him a very successful tenure of office. If, 
as expected, the second wave of expansion of nuclear power arrived, and if further steps were 
taken on nuclear arms reductions, additional legal instruments would have to be negotiated 
and Mr. ElBaradei, another distinguished international lawyer with extensive experience of 
diplomatic service and a profound knowledge of the United Nations system and the 
international nuclear arena, would have every opportunity to become a worthy successor to 
the three Directors General who had served the Agency for over 40 years with great 
distinction. 
24. The continuous development of the Polish economy was resulting in a growing 
demand for electricity despite increased efficiency in its use. Given the desirability of 
removing the virtual monopoly status of coal as a fuel in the Polish electrical power system, 
and in view of environmental constraints, there was growing interest in the natural gas and 
nuclear options. In the preceding year an international seminar had been held in Warsaw on 
the subject of newgeneration 
nuclear power plants which had generated considerable interest. 
Poland was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it had provided with that seminar. In that 
connection, he urged that the question of new, advanced nuclear power plant designs, and in 
particular their safety and economic aspects, be accorded greater attention in the Agency's 
programme. 
25. Mr. PUCCIO HUIDOBRO (Chile) noted the generally poor attendance at the 
general debate and suggested that, with a view to saving money, and in line with the current 
reforms within the United Nations, delegations should simply hand in their general debate 
statements to the Secretariat at the next session of the Conference and one day should be 
reserved for Member States to comment on those statements. 
26. In the 40 years since the Statute had come into force, years which had seen remarkable 
developments in the world, the Agency had become one of the most widely respected 
international organizations. He paid tribute to the outgoing Director General who had played 
a central role in establishing the Agency in that position of strength. He also congratulated the 
new Director General on his appointment the 
first Director General from a developing 
country and 
applauded the points he had made in his statement, in particular the stress he had 
laid on the importance of technical cooperation. 
27. Chile attached great importance to the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. It 
was the responsibility of all Member States to meet their financial obligations to the Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund as far as they were able and, in that context, he applauded the efforts 
which were being made by several Latin American countries to pay their outstanding 
contributions. He appealed to donor countries not to reduce the level of their contributions at 
the very moment when the measures to strengthen technical cooperation 
were beginning to 
bear fruit. Subcontracting with a view to making greater use of specialized centres in the 
region, and to promoting TCDC, should help improve management of resources and lead to 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 9 


healthy decentralization of technical cooperation 
activities. Traditional funding mechanisms 
were unlikely to be able to meet the growing demand for technical assistance, particularly if 
the level of contributions fell. Therefore it was important to seek new approaches. The 
private sector was playing an increasingly important role in technological and economic 
development throughout the world, and opportunities should be created for it to become 
involved in new technical cooperation 
approaches. Chile applauded the Secretariat's efforts 
to modernize and make more flexible the Agency's technical cooperation 
policy, and 
welcomed in particular the Model Projects, the Partners in Development concept, and the 
establishment of SAGTAC. The developing countries had attempted to adapt their national 
and regional projects to those developments and, with that in mind, the countries of Latin 
America and the Caribbean had taken the decision to convert the ARCAL programme into an 
intergovernmental agreement. 


28. Chile also recognized the importance of the Agency's verification activities and was 
planning to sign an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement in the near future. Equally, 
it was interested in the development of legal instruments regulating civil liability for nuclear 
damage. With regard to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, his delegation felt that a provision should 
have been included concerning prior notification of States of transit. It was therefore 
reviewing its reservations concerning Article 27 of that Convention before signing it. 
29. Like other nonnuclearweapon 
States, Chile had experienced difficulties in its national 
attempts to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology owing to the fears aroused by 
military applications, in particular where nuclear tests were carried out in locations where 
there was a threat of environmental damage. His country supported all initiatives aimed at 
disarmament and was therefore most heartened by the progress which had been made with the 
setting up of the CTBTO. 
30. Mr. PASTORELLI (Monaco) congratulated the President of the Conference 
on his election and paid tribute to the outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix. 
31. For many years, Monaco had followed the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy with interest. Many countries clearly found nuclear power to be an economically 
attractive option. However, like any industrial activity, the development of nuclear power had 
to be accompanied by a high degree of safety in the operation of facilities, management of 
radioactive waste and spent fuel, and final disposal of highlevel 
waste to be acceptable. As 
the Chernobyl accident had shown, the radioactive pollution caused by a major nuclear 
accident knew no boundaries. 
32. Owing to its location, Monaco was particularly concerned over pollution of the marine 
environment, especially by artificial radionuclides. That concern had prompted 
Prince Rainier III to host the first international scientific conference on the disposal of 
radioactive waste on land and at sea in Monaco in 1959. Subsequently in 1961, a tripartite 
agreement had been concluded between the Agency, the Government of Monaco, and the 
Monaco Museum of Oceanography, which had led to the setting up of the International 
Laboratory of Maritime Radioactivity whose main activity had been, initially, the application 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 10 


of nuclear and isotopic techniques to the study of the behaviour of radionuclides in the marine 
environment. 


33. In 1988, the Laboratory, whose work was highly valued by the international scientific 
community, had been moved from its original home in the Museum of Oceanography to a site 
in the district of Fontvieille. Its field of activities had been growing progressively over that 
period and, in 1991, it had been renamed the Marine Environment Laboratory to reflect that 
fact. However, the laboratory was already outgrowing its second home and, in October 1998, 
its new and larger premises in the Port of Monaco would be officially opened. That event had 
been planned to coincide with the International Symposium on Marine Pollution organized by 
the Agency, the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, UNEP, and the 
International Commission for Scientific Exploration of the Mediterranean Sea, which would be 
held in the Monaco Congress Centre. 
34. Monaco fully supported the Agency's nuclear safety and radiation protection activities, 
the safeguards programme, and the advisory role played by the Agency in the combating of 
illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radioactive sources. It also approved of the Agency's 
work on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture, scientific research and 
environmental protection. Through the support it gave to the Marine Environment 
Laboratory, and through the latter's training activities for Agency fellowship holders, it also 
contributed to the Agency's technical assistance programme. His country had signed the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, 
the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance 
in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. It also welcomed the progress 
which had been made towards achieving consensus on a Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and on 
amendment of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
35. In conclusion, he noted that nuclear power would play a major role in electricity 
generation for many years to come, and said he felt sure that the Agency would continue to 
contribute as effectively as it had in the past to the development of the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. It could certainly rely on the support of Monaco for its activities in the field of 
protection of the marine environment. 
36. Mr. CHAUNY de PORTURASHOYLE 
(Peru) associated himself with the 
comments made by the representative of Chile regarding reorganization of the general debate 
in line with United Nations reforms. He also welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta as new 
members of the Agency. 
37. The work done by the Agency over the past year was to be commended, especially in 
the fields of safeguards and nuclear, radiation and waste safety. On behalf of the Peruvian 
Government he paid tribute to Mr. Blix for his able leadership and for the support he had 
given to the developing countries, including Peru, during his sixteen years as Director General. 
Peru was highly appreciative of the Agency's achievements during the first forty years of its 
existence. Given the great importance of nuclear energy in the world of the future, those 
achievements were bound to multiply. His country had been an active supporter of the 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 11 


Agency's objectives, and had decided to mark the Agency's fortieth anniversary by dedicating 
the annual nuclear technology seminar of the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy to the 
Agency and its forty years of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He felt sure that 
under its new Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, the Agency would carry on its successful 
record. 


38. Nuclear technology was an essential factor in promoting sustainable improvement in 
the quality of life of underprivileged sectors of the population and overall development. Peru 
was grateful to be a beneficiary of the Agency's 199798 
technical cooperation 
programme 
and happy to participate in two of its Model Projects on 
child nutrition and the cultivation of 
barley. Both projects were making extremely satisfactory progress: the former had already 
generated improvements in the quality of nutrition of two million children in the most deprived 
areas of Peru; under the latter, work was proceeding on the improvement and delivery to 
farmers of new varieties of barley and other native cereal crops with a high nutritional value. 
Notable amongst the bilateral projects currently being carried out by Peru were the joint 
evaluation with Bolivia of the water resources in the Lake Titicaca basin and the joint activities 
with Chile aimed at combating the fruit fly and other agricultural pests. Another project with 
major social impact involved the establishment of a tissue bank which, with the help of nuclear 
technology, was now providing various sterilized materials for medical use. With respect to 
staff training, a Master's course in medical physics was reaching its conclusion which should 
help improve quality levels in hospitals and health centres in the country. In addition, the 
Peruvian Government had approved new national radiation protection regulations which made 
it compulsory for hospital centres to employ medical physicists. Agency support had been 
provided for the construction of a cell for the production of iridium192 
for medical and 
industrial use. Moreover, nuclear techniques were being used to quantify the environmental 
impact of mining, metallurgical and power engineering effluents, and Peru now had the 
capability to perform realtime 
measurements of probable emissions from the RP10 
reactor 
under both normal operating and accident conditions. 
39. Over the past year Peru had hosted a number of international events organized by the 
Agency, including a regional workshop on radionuclide and radiopharmaceutical production in 
November 1996 and a workshop on harmonization of food irradiation regulations in Latin 
America and the Caribbean in April 1997. 
40. As in previous years, Peru had participated in ARCAL activities which were of vital 
importance to the region. The coordinated 
efforts of various bodies in participating countries 
had helped improve the efficiency of nuclear applications. The new project requests for the 
19992000 
biennium reflected the priority needs of countries in the region. The Peruvian 
Government would like to see the ARCAL programme strengthened through an 
intergovernmental mutual cooperation 
agreement, under the aegis of the Agency, which 
should not only help promote nuclear science and technology and their peaceful use but also 
enhance exploitation of available resources. Finally, concluding his comments on technical 
cooperation, 
he warmly thanked the United States of America for its extrabudgetary 
contributions which had once again made possible the approval of important projects in Peru. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 12 


41. His country attached great importance to the strengthening of the safeguards system 
and, with a view to improving the legal framework governing safeguards activities, was 
considering early signature of an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. 
42. Peru supported efforts to improve the global safety culture and, in July 1997, had 
deposited its instrument of ratification of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Similarly, his 
Government welcomed the recent approval of the texts of the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol 
to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Convention 
on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. It was currently undertaking a careful 
study of those major international instruments. 
43. The recent commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of 
the Tlatelolco Treaty had coincided with significant progress in the negotiations on the 
Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty. Peru had taken an active part in those negotiations 
and had signed the Treaty on the day it had opened for signature. In conclusion, he 
reconfirmed Peru's support for the aims and objectives of the Tlatelolco Treaty, and its 
commitment to peace and disarmament. 
44. Ms. AGGREYORLEANS 
(Ghana) congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his 
appointment as the next Director General of the Agency and paid tribute to his predecessor, 
Mr. Blix. She also welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new members of the Agency. 
45. As the Agency celebrated its fortieth anniversary it deserved to be applauded for 
having helped to ward off the possibility of the extinction of the human race by ensuring that 
nuclear energy was used only for purposes beneficial to mankind. The current global 
landscape made it imperative for all nations to support with total dedication the Agency's 
objectives. Genuine efforts to create prosperity for all could only be sustained and accelerated 
in an environment where there were no deadly weapons and where there was the will and 
capability to use atomic energy to stimulate economic growth for the benefit of people. For 
those reasons Ghana was committed to the objectives of the NPT, the CTBT and the 
Pelindaba Treaty. It also supported the Agency's programmes and activities relating to 
safeguards and verification, nuclear safety and waste management, and the transfer of nuclear 
technology. Her country was particularly interested in the transfer of nuclear and radiation 
technologies for the effective handling of waste, and for improving food supplies and the 
provision of safe drinking water. 
46. With the assistance of the Agency, the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission was training 
its staff in foreign universities and institutions and had itself offered training to personnel from 
other Member States. The first phase of the National Radiotherapy and Nuclear Medicine 
Project in Accra, on which work had started three years previously, would soon be 
commissioned thanks to a US $3 million Agency contribution in terms of equipment, expertise 
and human resource development; work had already started on the project's second phase in 
Kumasi, and the third phase in Tamale would soon be under way. The three centres would 
provide treatment for cancer patients in Ghana and the West African subregion. 
Her country 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 13 


gratefully acknowledged the support given to the project by the United States of America and 
China. The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission was also producing radiopharmaceuticals for 
diagnostic purposes, for the investigation of iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin A deficiency and 
iodine deficiency. The Department of Food Science and Nuclear Agriculture Research of the 
Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute, a unit of the Commission, was 
utilizing irradiation for the preservation of foodstuffs and the sterilization of hospital 
equipment, with the assistance of the Agency. Moreover, the Department of Plant and Soils 
Sciences was producing healthy seedlings and plantlets for important crops. However, the 
Commission's capacity to transform the country's food situation in order to forestall famine 
and hunger needed to be strengthened with appropriate support. The Commission's research 
reactor was being used for work in many areas including environmental monitoring and, under 
AFRA, to teach reactor core calculations. Consultancy and analytical services were also 
provided on environmental issues. 


47. In conclusion, she reconfirmed Ghana's unflagging interest in, and support for the 
Agency's programmes. 
48. Mr. KASTCHIEV (Bulgaria) thanked the outgoing Director General for the 
contribution he had made to the international prestige of the Agency and wished the new 
Director General every success. He also associated himself with the statement which had been 
made by the representative of Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union and associated 
countries, including Bulgaria. 
49. Bulgaria had been pleased with the results of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference. The decisions taken there had farreaching 
consequences for the Agency's work 
in the fields of safeguards and the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that 
context, he noted that no indication of diversion of nuclear material or misuse of nuclear 
facilities, equipment or nonnuclear 
material had been found in 1996. He also applauded the 
approval by the Board of the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements. His 
country had always supported the Agency's efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and 
improve the efficiency of its safeguards system, was already implementing Part 1 of 
Programme 93+2, and was preparing to conclude an additional protocol to its own bilateral 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. National control of nuclear exports was another 
important means of preventing nuclear proliferation. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers 
Group and the Zangger Committee, Bulgaria felt that research into, and production and use 
of, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with Article IV of the NPT should 
conform with the nonproliferation 
objectives set forth in Articles I and II of that Treaty. 
50. The problems of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radioactive substances 
remained on the international community's agenda since they constituted a challenge to the 
nonproliferation 
regime and a hazard to public safety. Although the primary responsibility for 
preventing illicit trafficking lay at the national level, the importance of international 
cooperation 
and the Agency's role in facilitating such cooperation 
was increasing. The 
programme for preventing and combating illicit trafficking in nuclear material agreed upon at 
the Moscow Nuclear Safety and Security Summit was expected to strengthen international 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 14 


cooperation 
in that area. His country was also pleased to note that the Agency's illicit 
trafficking database was already operational and that other measures were being contemplated. 


51. The Agency had contributed greatly to the development and strengthening of the 
international regime on the safe use of nuclear energy in the preceding year. The entry into 
force in October 1996 of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, and the recent adoption of the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage 
were notable achievements in that area. Although Bulgaria had signed the Final Acts of those 
Conventions, its current economic difficulties did pose significant problems as regards their 
implementation. 
52. The Agency had also done much to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in 
Member States through the transfer of nuclear technology, training of specialists and provision 
of assistance and equipment. He congratulated the Secretariat on the results achieved in 
implementing the technical cooperation 
programme and thanked the Agency for the 
assistance it had provided to his country in national and regional projects. 
53. His country supported the proposed budget for 1998, but he appealed to the 
Secretariat to undertake additional measures to ensure that most effective use was being made 
of financial resources. In particular, the recommendations of the External Auditor should be 
implemented. With regard to the financing of technical assistance, Bulgaria would be paying 
the equivalent of $10 000 in national currency into the TCF for 1998. 
54. Nuclear power played an important role in the Bulgarian economy and the Kozloduy 
nuclear power plant had produced approximately 42% of the total amount of electricity 
generated in the country in 1996 . Bulgaria devoted a great deal of attention to nuclear safety 
and radiation protection problems, in particular to the enhancement of safe operation at the 
Kozloduy nuclear plant, strengthening of the effectiveness and independence of the national 
safety inspectorate, and the development of national nuclear legislation and its harmonisation 
with the legislation of the European Union. The Agency had provided considerable assistance 
by training Bulgarian inspectors. Moreover, as part of a technical cooperation 
project, 
an ERRT mission was to be conducted the results of which would be used to enhance the 
effectiveness of the Bulgarian Nuclear Safety Authority. As a country operating WWERtype 
reactors, Bulgaria was also very interested in the Agency's extrabudgetary programme on the 
safety of WWERs which could be extended to coordinate 
the planning and technical 
assistance required for upgrading and modernizing the units. In recent years, a number of 
safety measures had been carried out to improve the safety level at the Kozloduy nuclear 
power plant. A programme to ensure safe operation of the unit 1 reactor pressure vessel 
during the rest of its lifetime had been implemented in 1996 and the results clearly showed that 
the pressure vessel could be operated safely for several years to come without any additional 
technical measures. The elaboration of a comprehensive programme to enhance the safety of 
units 14 
of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant had begun in May 1996. Its aim was to 
eliminate design shortcomings and the first draft was currently being assessed. In addition, an 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 15 


upgrading programme had been developed to ensure safe operation of units 5 and 6 of the 
plant. The proposals and recommendations of the Agency experts invited to review the 
programme had been incorporated, and it was to be implemented by a consortium of German, 
Russian and French companies, as well as by Westinghouse and the plant. 


55. Turning to the issues of radiation protection and the environment, he said that a 
modern system for permanent monitoring of the radiation and meteorological conditions in the 
country had been delivered and installed with the financial support of the European Union's 
PHARE programme. Furthermore, a computer network had been set up in the regulatory 
body to process, analyse and record information on the use of radioactive sources in scientific 
research, medicine, industry and agriculture. 
56. In conclusion, he confirmed his Government's support for the Agency's activities and 
wished the Director General and his staff every success in their work. 
57. Mr. ALGHAIS 
(Kuwait) praised the leadership of Mr. Blix to whom the 
Agency owed much of its reputation for efficiency and good management, and wished 
Mr. ElBaradei every success as the new Director General. The year leading up to the 
Agency's fortieth anniversary had witnessed some notable achievements, such as the 
conclusion of the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards agreements, the Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, and the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear 
Damage; and the Director General and the Secretariat had every reason to be proud. He also 
welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new members of the Agency. 
58. The countries of the Middle East looked forward to the establishment in that region of 
a nuclearweaponfree 
zone but, for that goal to be achieved, Israel had to join the NPT and 
submit its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards, and Iraq had to abandon its irresponsible 
behaviour. Kuwait looked forward to a Middle East free of all kinds of weapons of mass 
destruction. Kuwait's position regarding Article VI of the Agency's Statute was that changes 
should be made to accommodate the least represented regions on the Board of Governors, 
especially the MESA Group and the African Group, but that the responsibility for deciding 
upon the composition of regional groups lay with the groups themselves. 
59. The General Conference had before it four documents on Iraq's implementation of the 
Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait on 2 August 1990. 
Those documents made it clear that Iraq had not fulfilled its obligation under Security Council 
resolution 687(1991) to make a full declaration to the Agency of its nuclear programme within 
15 days. Indeed, six and a half years had elapsed without it doing so, despite the Agency's 
tireless efforts. It had used delay, omission, obstruction and concealment tactics and, as was 
stated in paragraph 6 of document GC(41)/20, its minimalist approach in withholding from the 
Agency all but the minimum necessary information had resulted in the expenditure of 
considerable additional time and effort. 
60. It was astounding that the Government of Iraq had not abandoned its practice of 
obstructing the Agency's inspectors despite repeated warnings both from the Agency and from 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 16 


the Security Council. In February 1997, Iraq had prevented the IAEA and UNSCOM 
inspection teams from using the fixedwing 
aircraft required for the inspection missions. The 
Director General of the Agency had expressed his grave concern over that incident in a 
meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister in March 1997. Moreover, paragraph 28 of the 
Appendix to document GOV/INF/810 stated that, as a result of that instance of obstructive 
behaviour, it was impossible to consider the monitoring and verification plan to be fully 
operational. Iraq had also obstructed joint UNSCOM and IAEA inspection teams on a 
number of occasions in June 1997, prompting yet another Security Council resolution 
condemning its actions and threatening to impose additional measures against Iraqi officials. 
Undeterred, Iraq had delayed and threatened two UNSCOM inspection teams in 
September 1997, forcing another Security Council warning. The latter incident was of 
relevance to the Agency since there was evidence that the Iraqi authorities had moved and 
concealed materials and documents during September, fully justifying Kuwait's suspicion that 
some of those documents were nuclearrelated. 
The incidents placed in doubt the sincerity of 
the Iraqi authorities when they promised to cooperate 
with the Director General of the 
Agency and the new Chairman of UNSCOM. 


61. An example of the way in which Iraqi officials either refused to cooperate 
with the 
Agency, despite attempts to give the opposite impression, or did not reveal the facts, was 
given in paragraphs 4 and 5 of document GC(41)/20 which reported a failure to supply the 
Agency with a requested summary of achievements giving a description of Iraq's capabilities. 
Paragraph 8 of the same document described an attempt to conceal the involvement of the 
Iraqi General Intelligence Service (Mukhabarat) in clandestine procurement. Kuwait urged the 
Agency to take the utmost care in monitoring Iraqi purchases in order to prevent the import of 
dualuse 
equipment which might be used for Iraq's nuclear programme. Countries exporting 
such equipment had a great political and moral responsibility to prevent its acquisition by Iraq, 
and to cooperate 
closely with the Agency in implementing the exportimport 
mechanism 
adopted via Security Council resolution 1051(1996). 
62. Iraq was trying to achieve two goals at the same time: to have the international 
embargo lifted, and to hide the greatest possible amount of materials and information from the 
Agency and UNSCOM. The progress the Agency had made in the past six and a half years 
was due to its own efforts and not to cooperation 
by the Iraqi authorities. Hence, the Agency 
should be extremely vigilant in carrying out its mandate in Iraq, because the Iraqi regime had 
not abandoned its aggressive intentions towards Kuwait and the other countries in the region, 
and should take the utmost care in preparing its semiannual 
reports to the Security Council. 
63. Finally, he paid tribute to the late Professor Zifferero who had led the Agency's Action 
Team, and assured its new leader, Mr. Dillon, of Kuwait's unlimited trust and support. 
64. Mr. MENDONEA E MOURA (Portugal) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso 
as new members of the Agency. 
65. His country had been a member of the Agency since its establishment 40 years ago and 
was proud of the latter's success in the fields of technical cooperation, 
safeguards, nuclear 
safety, the development of guidelines and regulations on such matters as the handling and 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 17 


transport of radioactive material, and the promotion of the development of legal instruments 
such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Vienna Convention on 
Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, and the Model Additional Protocol to safeguards 
agreements. He urged all States to adhere to those instruments as soon as possible which 
were very important for the promotion and general strengthening of a nuclear safety culture. 
The Agency's impressive record was due in large part to the dedication of its successive 
Directors General and their teams. In that context, he commended the outgoing Director 
General, Mr. Blix, and congratulated his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, on his appointment. 


66. He commended the Secretariat's efforts to improve the efficiency of technical 
cooperation 
activities and noted with interest that only 36% of the Agency's expenditure on 
technical cooperation 
went to projects related to electricity production, radiation and nuclear 
safety, the fuel cycle and radioactive waste, whereas 64% went to such sectors as food, 
agriculture, health, earth sciences, industry and the physical and chemical sciences. The 
general public tended to think of nuclear energy only in terms of atomic bombs, nuclear 
accidents and radioactive waste, and should be made more aware of the full range of 
applications. In particular, he stressed the importance of projects connected with the 
production of potable water and water resource management. Significant efforts were also 
being made to improve the effectiveness of safeguards, and the adoption of the Model 
Additional Protocol was a welcome step forward in that regard. 
67. Mr. NGWE (Myanmar) commended the Agency's achievements over the 
past 40 years and congratulated both the outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix, and his 
successor, Mr. ElBaradei. An RCA working group meeting had been held in his country in 
March 1997 which had coincided with the celebration of the twentyfifth 
anniversary of that 
Agreement. As part of the celebrations an exhibition had been held on the subject of nuclear 
science and technology which had emphasized the Agency's role and had been very successful 
in generating public awareness of its work. 
68. Myanmar was committed to actively participating in the United Nations and other 
multilateral and regional fora, as well as to promoting nuclear science and technology. It had 
established a separate Ministry of Science and Technology in October 1996, and a Department 
of Atomic Energy within that Ministry in July 1997. It was also a strong advocate of global 
nuclear disarmament and had signed the Treaty on the Southeast Asia NuclearWeaponFree 
Zone. Moreover, although it was not yet a party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, it was 
giving the matter careful consideration. 
69. The Agency's technical cooperation 
activities in Myanmar were progressing 
satisfactorily though there was much room for expansion. His country was particularly 
appreciative of the Agency's work on the use of isotope hydrology for water resource 
management, and the plan for producing potable water economically which could be 
particularly helpful in the country's central dry region. Myanmar was also planning to launch a 
project on radiation technology development and was grateful to the Agency for providing 

GC(41)/OR.7

assistance in the form of a preproject

become a success. 


ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
(GC(41)/6, GC(41)/30) 


70. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a 
procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a 
particular area, no secret ballot was held; balloting only took place for those areas where no 
candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the efficient use of 
the Conference's time. 
71. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure of the General 
Conference, which provided that elections to the Board should be by secret ballot, be 
suspended in respect of those areas for which there was agreement. 
72. He then drew attention to document GC(41)/6 which contained a list of the Agency 
Member States which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the 
end of the current session of the Conference to the end of the next session. 
73. Under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, the presiding officer had to indicate to the 
General Conference those elective places on the Board which had to be filled. In that 
connection, he drew attention to document GC(41)/30 and noted that agreement had been 
reached among the Member States in all areas except Africa and the Middle East and South 
Asia. In the case of Africa, there were two seats to be filled and more than two candidates 
had been put forward. In the case of the Middle East and South Asia, there was one seat to be 
filled, and more than one candidate had been put forward. A secret ballot would therefore 
have to be held in respect of both those areas. 
74. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Mexico 
and Peru to the two vacant seats for Latin America. 
75. Mexico and Peru were duly elected. 
76. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Italy and 
Sweden to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
77. Italy and Sweden were duly elected. 
78. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Hungary 
and Slovenia to the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
79. Hungary and Slovenia were duly elected. 
80. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect 
Viet Nam to the vacant seat for the Far East. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 19 


81. Viet Nam was duly elected. 
82. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the 
Republic of Korea, from the area of the Far East, to fill the socalled 
"floating" seat. 
83. The Republic of Korea was duly elected. 
84. The PRESIDENT invited the General Conference to proceed with a vote by 
secret ballot for the two vacant seats for Africa and the vacant seat for the Middle East and 
South Asia. 
85. Mr. TIWARI (India), speaking on behalf of the Middle East and South Asia 
Group, said that the election of members from that Group to serve on the Board had been a 
contentious issue in the past and it had not always been in a position to put forward the right 
number of candidates. He was happy to announce that the Group had agreed to put forward 
Pakistan for the vacant seat, on the understanding that when the next vacancy fell due 
Saudi Arabia would be nominated. It would also strive to avoid any need for elections on its 
candidate in the future. 
86. The PRESIDENT, noting the comments of the representative of India, took it 
that the General Conference wished to elect Pakistan to the vacant seat for the Middle East 
and South Asia. 
87. Pakistan was duly elected. 
88. The PRESIDENT then invited the General Conference to proceed with a vote 
by secret ballot for the two vacant seats for Africa. 
89. A secret ballot was held to fill the two seats for Africa. 
90. At the suggestion of the President, a member of the delegation of the Czech Republic, 
a member of the Peruvian delegation and a member of the Finnish delegation were appointed 
as tellers. 
91. The PRESIDENT, noting that the counting of the votes would take some time, 
suggested that the General Conference should resume the general debate until the results could 
be announced. He also thanked the tellers, on behalf of all delegates, for their kind 
cooperation. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


92. Mr. NSIMBI (Zimbabwe) commended Mr. Blix for his tireless efforts during 
his period of office. The conferment on him of the title of Director General Emeritus was a 
fitting tribute to his sterling work at the Agency. He also joined previous speakers in 
welcoming Mr. ElBaradei as the new Director General. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 20 


93. For the past ten years, the Government of Zimbabwe had recognized the role played by 
the peaceful application of nuclear techniques in promoting its economic development in the 
fields of agriculture, human health and water resources. The impact of nuclear techniques in 
those areas had stimulated interest from other national institutions. At the same time, the 
country needed a sound radiation protection infrastructure and welltrained 
staff to maintain 
the momentum achieved, ensure the steady growth of technical cooperation 
activities, and 
improve the effectiveness of project implementation. 
94. Under the 1997 technical cooperation 
programme, Zimbabwe had made progress with 
the implementation of activities under the Model Project on increased crop production for 
smallholders through the use of biofertilizers and the current results were promising. Use of 
that technique should be extended to improve productivity in other cash crops. 
95. With regard to the project on tsetse control programmes employing the sterile insect 
technique, baseline data had been compiled in preparation for the Matusadona Game Reserve 
pilot project. If the tsetse fly were successfully eradicated in the Matusadona Game Park and 
the surrounding areas of the Zambezi Valley, the Zimbabwean Government would be in a 
position to consider plans to increase the level of economic and social activities. 
96. Efforts were continuing to upgrade the national radiation protection infrastructure in 
order to meet the requirements of the Basic Safety Standards. The Government of Zimbabwe 
was committed to increasing the level of support to the country's radiation protection unit 
with a view to achieving effective operations by January 1998. 
97. The establishment of a new isotope hydrology laboratory, as part of the country's 
groundwater development activities, should strengthen analytical capabilities in the water 
sector. Zimbabwe expected to make greater progress in water development as it progressively 
introduced nuclear techniques alongside conventional techniques. 
98. He welcomed the completion of the restructuring exercise in the Agency's Department 
of Technical Cooperation 
and hoped that it would enhance programme delivery to recipient 
Member States. The beneficiaries of the technical cooperation 
programme appreciated the 
concepts and tools which the Department had introduced to improve planning and 
management. The changes would also bring with them new challenges for recipient countries. 
In addition, he noted with interest the proposed funding mechanisms which would assist some 
national projects with partial funding. An arrangement of that kind should result in closer 
interaction between donors and beneficiaries and might also promote TCDC. He also 
announced that Zimbabwe had begun to redress its assessed programme costs arrears and was 
committed to meeting its obligations in that regard. 
99. Turning to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, he said that his delegation had 
followed with interest the work of the Board on that issue and hoped that the General 
Conference would find a satisfactory solution. In that connection, the African proposal 
merited serious consideration. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 21 


100. In conclusion, he announced that Zimbabwe had completed the majority of its internal 
ratification formalities for the Pelindaba Treaty. 
101. Mr. SUAREZ (Ecuador) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new members 
of the Agency and, on behalf of the President and Government of Ecuador, commended the 
outstanding achievements of Mr. Blix over the past 16 years and wished him every success in 
the future. The Agency's prestige, the changes which had taken place within it, and the 
assistance which it had given to the developing countries owed much to his efforts, vision and 
wisdom. He also welcomed Mr. ElBaradei as the new Director General. It was the first time 
someone from a developing country had held the most senior post in the Agency and he could 
count on the full support of Ecuador in his future tasks. 
102. Looking back over its 40year 
history, the Agency's most important achievement had 
undoubtedly been the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its 
safeguards programme and relevant treaties. World peace was mankind's most precious 
possession. Support for the development and application of nuclear technology had been 
universal, and countries throughout the world had benefited from its use in health, agriculture, 
environmental protection, industry and power generation. With the help of the Agency and its 
experts, professionals from developing countries had received training through courses, 
seminars, symposia and workshops. Without that support, and the materials, equipment and 
information which had been provided, the progress made by the LDCs in medicine, agriculture 
and environmental protection would not have been possible. One particular problem in LDCs 
was the lack of adequate, permanent and reliable supplies of potable water, and his country 
therefore welcomed the Agency's work on the production of potable water economically. 
103. Arguably the Agency's greatest success had been the bringing together of the Latin 
American countries under the ARCAL programme to implement projects designed to promote 
the development of the region. The Partners in Development concept had boosted 
cooperation 
between countries in the region which should be further strengthened by the joint 
resolution of common problems. His country was deeply grateful to the Agency for the 
support it had given the ARCAL programme. Ecuador currently held the Presidency of 
ARCAL and hoped that, in the near future, an intergovernmental agreement would be signed 
for the promotion of nuclear science and technology in Latin America and the Caribbean 
which would strengthen assistance between countries and greatly benefit their populations. 
104. The Agency's fortieth anniversary coincided with the thirtieth anniversary of the 
opening for signature of the Tlatelolco Treaty and the fifth anniversary of ABACC. Both 
those organizations and the Treaty had been a major influence in promoting the exclusively 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy at world, regional and subregional 
level. Ecuador supported 
the strengthening of the Agency's safeguards system as the best possible way of promoting 
nuclear nonproliferation, 
but there was still a need to strengthen the Agency's technical 
assistance programme for developing countries. Ecuador had sponsored a resolution on the 
latter subject and hoped that the programme would be strengthened in the near future in view 
of the great benefits it brought to ThirdWorld 
countries. 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 22 


105. Ms. ROMERO de GONZALEZ (Paraguay) welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso 
as new members of the IAEA. 
106. The Agency, which was currently celebrating its fortieth anniversary, was the only 
organization whose principal role was to promote worldwide the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy and prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It worked together with all the main 
United Nations agencies in such fields as human health, food safety, pollution control, fresh 
water resources, climate change, power generation, and other essential areas affecting 
economic development and the environment. Paraguay had joined the Agency in 1957 and 
was confident that, with the assistance of the agencies of the United Nations system and other 
organizations, it would continue to ensure that nuclear energy was used for sustainable 
development and for the benefit of mankind. 
107. The Paraguayan National Atomic Energy Commission had just held a commemorative 
nuclear science day to present the results obtained by various public and private institutions 
which had participated in and benefited from national technical cooperation 
projects, the 
ARCAL programme, regional projects and research contracts. The Nuclear Information 
Centre of the Commission had had its own home page on the Internet since July 1997 through 
which it pursued its publicization activities, with the help of the National Computer Centre of 
the National University of Asuncion. 
108. Paraguay welcomed the progress which had been made in the field of technical 
cooperation 
and transfer of nuclear technology, and fully supported the Model Project and 
Partners in Development concepts which were being employed in its own national project on 
sustainable water resources management. Another valuable project for her country was the 
one on feed supplementation to improve cattle productivity which was providing support to 
smallscale 
milk producers. The National Atomic Energy Commission attached great 
importance to the interregional project on upgrading of radiation protection infrastructure, an 
area in which every country had a role to play in order to ensure the safe use of radiation and 
the safe management of radioactive waste. It was also working together with the Ministry of 
Public Health and Social Welfare on the elaboration of appropriate legislation and regulatory 
controls with a view to preventing accidents and their costly consequences. 
109. Her country continued to participate actively in the ARCAL programme. Several of 
the projects under that programme had fully achieved their objectives, such as the one on 
maintenance of nuclear instrumentation. Under the project on radiopharmacy, an attempt was 
being made to include that subject in the pharmacy curriculum of the National University of 
Asuncion. In addition, as part of the project on improvement of radiotherapy practice, 
physicists were being encouraged to train in medical physics. Analysis services were being 
offered for various types of samples employing Xray 
fluorescence, neutron activation 
analysis, and gamma spectrometry. In the field of radiation protection, efforts were being 
made to double the number of people using TLD dosimeters and to ensure compliance with 
the Basic Safety Standards, in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health and Social 
Welfare. With regard to training, the National Atomic Energy Commission was providing 
courses on radiation protection, nuclear analytical techniques and electronics for industry, with 

GC(41)/OR.7 
page 23 


the assistance of technicians, professionals and students from the National University of 
Asuncion. 


110. In conclusion, she reaffirmed her country's full support for the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and international cooperation 
for development, and its strong opposition to the use of 
nuclear energy for military purposes. Paraguay's commitment to the nonproliferation 
of 
nuclear weapons and the strengthening of the safeguards system remained unwavering. She 
also thanked the Agency for its continuous efforts to respond to the challenges it had been 
faced with in the nuclear field over the 40 years it had been in existence. 
111. Mr. FARIS (Iraq), responding to the comments which had been made by the 
representative of Kuwait, said that he was dismayed to find his brother delegation from 
Kuwait introducing political issues into the discussions which had no place inside the Agency 
since it was a purely technical organization. He therefore appealed to delegations not to raise 
political issues. 
112. Mr. ALGHAIS 
(Kuwait), responding to the comments of the representative of 
Iraq, noted that that representative had referred to Kuwait as a brother delegation. However, 
actions spoke louder than words and brothers did not behave to one another as Iraq had 
behaved towards Kuwait. Moreover, the Conference had just witnessed the behaviour of the 
representative of Iraq who had banged on the table when requesting the right to respond to the 
comments made by bis own delegation. The Iraqi delegation had indulged in similar behaviour 
in other meetings in other organizations, sometimes even resorting to physical assault. He 
requested the Iraqi delegation to refrain from such behaviour in fixture. 
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 


THE AGENCY (resumed) 


(GC(41)/8) 


5. Mr. SHAIKOV (Uzbekistan), after congratulating Malta and Burkina Faso on 
their admission to the Agency, paid tribute to Mr. Blix for his impressive contribution to the 
development of the organization and congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment to the 
post of Director General. 
6. The decision of the States of Central Asia to establish a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in 
the region, and the international conference on the subject held in Tashkent on 15 and 
16 September 1997, bore witness to the efforts being made by Uzbekistan and the other 
countries of Central Asia to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. That conference, 
in which more than 200 representatives of 60 States and 16 international organizations had 
participated, had led to a number of conclusions. 
7. The first was that nuclear security should be considered as an integral part of a 
comprehensive security system and that it was essential to strike a balance between the 
obligations of nuclearweapon 
States and those of nonnuclearweapon 
States in order to 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 6 


ensure the reliable functioning of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone. Secondly, the establishment of 
a nuclearweaponfree 
zone was not sufficient to guarantee security: an effective control 
mechanism, based on international experience, would also have to be set up. Thirdly, in 
establishing a nuclearweaponfree 
zone, the participating States undertook to adhere to the 
comprehensive regime of nonproliferation 
and disarmament. Fourthly, the conference had 
underlined the specific advantages for the population, in terms of sustainable development, 
environment and health, of the creation of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone. Fifthly, the creation of 
such a zone in Central Asia was in line with previous efforts undertaken to safeguard regional 
security. Lastly, the establishment of the zone was not a mere symbolic act, and effective 
physical protection mechanisms would have to be put in place in accordance with international 
law. 


8. The work of the expert groups which had met at the Tashkent conference had led to a 
joint statement by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In that statement, the Ministers had expressed the view that 
the creation of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in Central Asia was an essential step to strengthen 
regional security; had approved the principles and objectives adopted at the NPT Review and 
Extension Conference; had welcomed the adoption of the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty and invited all States to sign it; had expressed their satisfaction at the large number of 
countries which had voluntarily assumed commitments under agreements on nuclearweaponfree 
zones; had indicated their belief that the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in 
Central Asia met the interests of national, regional and global security; had called upon the five 
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and on other States to support the 
establishment of such a zone in Central Asia; had urged other States to provide assistance in 
the rehabilitation of territories, particularly those contaminated by radioactive wastes; and, 
lastly, had requested agencies of the United Nations to set up a group of experts with the 
participation of representatives of the region to elaborate the details of the agreement to 
establish a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in Central Asia. 
9. Mr. MAKKI (Yemen) welcomed the admission of Malta and Burkina Faso to 
membership of the Agency, congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment to the post of 
Director General, and paid tribute to Mr. Blix. He stressed the importance of the indefinite 
extension of the NPT and of the signing of the CTBT, and reiterated his country's support for 
the steps taken by the Agency under Programme 93+2 to strengthen the effectiveness and 
improve the efficiency of the safeguards system, as well as its support for measures designed 
to strengthen international cooperation 
in the fields of nuclear, radiation and waste safety, and 
for measures to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radiation sources. 
10. With regard to the financing of technical cooperation, 
Yemen was in favour of any 
solution which would strengthen the activities carried out in that area, whether through the 
Technical Cooperation 
Fund or under the Regular Budget. The issue had become a matter of 
urgency because the Agency needed to strike a proper balance between its various activities. 
Similarly, although the achievement of zero real growth in the budget for 1998 was to be 
welcomed, it was to be hoped that it was the result of savings achieved through administrative 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 7 


reforms and not the result of a reduction in the Agency's programmes, particularly in activities 
in support of technical cooperation 
projects. 


11. Yemen had undertaken a wideranging 
programme of financial, administrative and 
economic reforms, and was in the process of elaborating a legal framework which would 
enable it to develop further its relations with the Agency in the near future. It intended to sign 
a comprehensive safeguards agreement and to ratify or accede to international conventions 
concluded under the auspices of the Agency. He hoped that the Agency would provide his 
country with support that was urgently needed in view of the shortage of qualified personnel, 
equipment, laboratories and materials. The Agency's support was also crucial in such fields as 
radiation protection, medicine, the environment and hydrology. 
12. Yemen welcomed the results achieved by the Agency in the application of safeguards 
and in the implementation of Security Council resolutions, and hoped that it would make 
progress in the application of safeguards in the Middle East, with the objective of 
denuclearizing the region and eliminating all weapons of mass destruction. It was now clear to 
all that Israel's obstinacy was detrimental to the noble aspirations of the peoples of the region, 
and that its intrigues bore witness to its defiance of international resolutions and conventions 
and threatened the stability and security of the region and beyond. Accordingly, the 
international community was called upon to take the necessary steps to force Israel to conform 
to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly and to implement 
the Madrid and Oslo agreements, as well as the agreements concluded with the Palestinian 
Authority and neighbouring countries. The Agency was likewise urged to take the necessary 
steps to induce Israel to sign the NPT and place its nuclear facilities under safeguards and to 
make sure that it did not develop nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction. In doing 
so, the Agency should show the same resolve and determination as it had in the case of Iraq. 
If that were not done, it would be difficult to speak of trust between countries of the region 
and Israel, to resolve the question of Israel's admission to the Middle East and South Asia 
Group, or to apply safeguards in the Middle East. 
13. Mr. MANNO (Italy), having endorsed the statement made by Luxembourg on 
behalf of the European Union, congratulated the Agency on its fortieth anniversary and 
expressed gratitude for the excellent work it had done and the results it had achieved with 
regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. He 
also congratulated Malta and Burkina Faso on having joined the Agency and addressed his 
warmest appreciation to the Director General, Mr. Hans Blix, who had for 16 years guided the 
Agency with exemplary skill. 
14. Italy had been a member of the Agency ever since its establishment and had manifested 
its commitment to the organization by assuming responsibilities in high positions: as had, for 
example, the late lamented Maurizio Zifferero, formerly Deputy Director General of the 
Department of Research and Isotopes, who had headed the Action Team for the 
implementation of the Security Council resolutions on Iraq. Italy attached great importance to 
the Agency's activities and their future development and hoped to play a leading role in 
steering the Agency's programmes during its coming term on the Board of Governors. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 8 


15. Looking at the horizons opening up for the Agency on the eve of the next millennium, 
Italy believed that a number of issues merited special attention: 
Strengthening safeguards while remaining at zero real growth through better 
use of new inspection technologies and through the vesting by Member States 
of new powers in the Agency; 


Pursuit of maximum synergy with the Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty 
Organization; 


Careful management of the Agency's structures and rationalization of its 
operations in order to make them as efficient as possible; 


Safe management of irradiated nuclear fuel, especially in the light of the feasible 
strategic options; 


Safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, in particular by 
promoting the publication of general technical guides, fostering international 
cooperation 
and encouraging the development of technologies for final 
disposal of longterm 
radioactive waste; 


Development of safety standards for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities; 


Maximum use of spinoffs 
from nuclear technology in the areas of 
environmental conservation, agriculture and human health. In that regard, the 
Agency's efforts in the field of technical cooperation 
should help to steer the 
needs of emerging and developing countries. That steering function was of 
fundamental importance. If that approach was incorporated in appropriate 
budget decisions, Italy would be ready to support it with adequate 
contributions to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund representing a high 
percentage of its share of the target. 


16. Italy agreed that it was necessary for increasing efforts to be made to spread a common 
nuclear safety culture worldwide based on principles and rules accepted by all countries that 
used nuclear energy in research and power generation. 
17. The safety of dangerous or obsolete nuclear power plants operating in Central and 
Eastern Europe and the newly independent States was a problem to which Italy devoted a 
great deal of attention, and it was working to improve the safety culture in that region. On the 
multilateral level, it contributed to the specific efforts of institutions such as the European 
Commission and the Nuclear Safety Account managed by the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development. It also intended to operate on the bilateral level through 
technical assistance projects.

page 9 


18. Another matter that Italy regarded with deep interest was the Chernobyl Shelter 
Implementation Plan, which had a prominent place in the Memorandum of Understanding 
between the G7 
and Ukraine on the closure of the Chernobyl complex by the year 2000. 
Italy supported the decision taken by the G7 
at the Denver Summit in 1997 to contribute 
US $300 million to the budget for the Chernobyl Shelter Implementation Plan, which was 
expected to amount to around $760 million. The decision by the G7 
to shoulder a substantial 
part of the cost was a significant step towards the launching of the project, but the sum would 
not suffice to implement it in its entirety. His delegation hoped that all Member States of the 
Agency understood the need to widen the base of financial participation in the project and 
requested them to make pledges without delay. 
19. With regard to Article VI of the Statute, Italy supported a change that would both 
increase the number of seats in the Board of Governors and make all Member States eligible 
for them. It had taken note of the report by the Board of Governors to the General 
Conference on Article VI and of the report by the Chairman of the Board of Governors on the 
composition of regional groups, which indicated that the Board was unable to make any 
recommendation. Italy believed that the expansion of the Board, the composition of regional 
groups and the criteria for eligibility were interrelated and required a "package" approach. 
Since the issue could not be easily resolved, it might be useful to set up an ad hoc committee 
in the near future with a clear mandate to examine the possible alternative solutions. 
20. Italy attached considerable importance to the Board's decision on 15 May 1997 to 
adopt the Model Additional Protocol to comprehensive safeguards agreements, which would 
strengthen the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities. From the very 
beginning, Italy had acknowledged the importance of the work carried out under 
Programme 93+2 with the aim of giving the Agency more effective instruments for preventing 
nuclear proliferation. During Italy's presidency of the European Union, his country had done 
its utmost to reach an acceptable political compromise on the most controversial matters, such 
as universality and guarantees of national sovereignty. Together with the other countries in 
the European Union, Italy had undertaken an analysis of the new obligations contained in the 
Model Additional Protocol in order to make sure that they were compatible with obligations 
under the EURATOM Treaty. 
21. Italy had undertaken, at both the bilateral and multilateral levels (through the European 
Union's recent participation in KEDO), to contribute in a practical way, including financially, 
to the stabilization process on the Korean Peninsula. It was convinced that those steps would 
enable it to make an important contribution to peace in Asia. Nonetheless, Italy expected the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to comply with the obligations it had assumed under 
its safeguards agreement with the Agency and to allow the Agency to carry out its tasks fully. 
22. Emphasizing the fact that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management adopted in September 1997 
was the first international instrument to deal with radioactive waste disposal, he said that Italy 
was convinced that promoting a nuclear safety culture, which was the main aim of the 
Convention, would help to solve the energy problems of the developing countries. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 10 


23. Turning to the Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, 
he said Italy considered that those two instruments would also improve the nuclear safety 
regime. As a country that posed no risk of nuclear accident, Italy had always advocated an 
international system designed to protect the potential victims of such an accident. 
24. In conclusion, he wished to convey warm greetings to the future Director General of 
the Agency, Mr. ELBaradei, who, he was sure, would ensure that the Agency remained one of 
the bestrun 
international organizations. In carrying out his demanding duties, he would be 
able to count on Italy's full support. 
Mr. AlGhais 
(Kuwait) took the Chair. 


25. Mr. VOSKANIAN (Armenia) said that his delegation fully associated itself 
with the statement made on behalf of the Eastern European Group commending Mr. Blix on 
his outstanding work during his 16 years' leadership of the Agency. It also associated itself 
with the congratulations addressed to Mr. ElBaradei on his appointment as Director General, 
and welcomed Burkina Faso and Malta on their admission to the Agency. 
26. He once again expressed his Government's gratitude for the Agency's considerable 
assistance before and after the reopening of the Medzamor nuclear power plant. The 
enormous work done by experts of various countries who had visited the power plant was 
much appreciated. 
27. The Armenian delegation commended the Secretariat on the efforts which had led to 
the adoption in May of the Model Additional Protocol. Armenia had always supported 
measures aimed at improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system, and 
had been the first country with a nuclear power plant to sign an additional protocol 
on 29 September, which, pending its ratification by Parliament, would be applied provisionally 
in accordance with its Article 17. 
28. Armenia welcomed the adoption of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and hoped that it would 
enter into force in the near future. It also welcomed the establishment of a comprehensive 
international nuclear liability regime through the adoption of the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. However, the present formula for the 
calculation of contributions placed a heavy burden on the economy of a number of countries, 
particularly those of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It was regrettable that the 
proposals put forward several times to set a special ceiling for the contributions of States with 
a relatively high installed nuclear capacity but a low per capita GDP had not been accepted. 
29. The Government of Armenia did its best to fulfil its financial obligations and, in spite of 
its budgetary constraints, had managed to find the resources to pay the amount necessary for 
the restoration of its voting rights. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 11 


30. On 24 September, the Armenian Parliament had ratified the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety with an overwhelming majority of votes. Armenia had thus reaffirmed its commitment 
to continue to improve nuclear safety at its nuclear facilities and to hold discussions with 
neighbouring countries on the necessary exchange of information. 
31. The Armenian Government was also determined to ensure that the Medzamor nuclear 
power plant had the highest levels of safety. It was currently implementing the safety 
measures on the list that had been drawn up before the reopening of the plant. The Nuclear 
Safety Advisory Council, which was directly responsible to the President's Office, met 
regularly to monitor the implementation of those measures. 
32. Various safety measures which received multilateral support (particularly from the 
Agency and TACIS) as well as bilateral support were being implemented. One of the most 
recent was the arrangement between the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission and 
the Nuclear Regulatory Authority of Armenia for the exchange of technical information and 
cooperation 
in the area of nuclear safety, which had been signed by the two countries on 30 
September. 
33. A number of Agency technical cooperation 
projects were being carried out in Armenia 
to improve different aspects of nuclear safety. Those projects covered specifically 
environmental radiation, occupational radiation protection, assessment of the operational 
safety of the Armenian nuclear power plant and monitoring around it, the radioactive waste 
management system, the radiation protection infrastructure and the seismic safety reevaluation 
of the power plant. 
34. The Government of Armenia was extremely interested in improving the training of the 
nuclear specialists who operated the power plant, as well as the personnel of the national 
regulatory bodies, and appreciated the Agency's special efforts to that end. A protocol for a 
joint project (covering training, seismic studies and emergency planning) was about to be 
signed by the heads of the regulatory bodies of Armenia and Turkey. 
35. Armenia highly appreciated the assistance given by the Agency in strengthening its 
national legislation. A law on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which was expected to be 
adopted by the National Assembly by the end of the year, was at present being discussed by 
the Government. 
36. The Armenian Government was working in close cooperation 
with the Agency's 
Department of Technical Cooperation 
on the implementation of approved projects. His 
delegation was holding consultations with the representatives of other countries and with 
various Divisions of the Agency and trusted that those consultations would bring positive 
results. 
37. Mr. BULBULA (Ethiopia) paid tribute to Mr. Blix, whose skilful leadership 
had enabled the Agency to achieve the objectives set out in its Statute. He also congratulated 
Mr. ElBaradei on his election to the post of Director General and assured him of Ethiopia's 
full support. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 12 


38. In the 40 years of its existence, the Agency had achieved one of its main objectives: 
the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Among the achievements of global 
significance was the establishment of a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in Africa and the adoption of 
three legal instruments in 1997. 
39. The United Nations Special Initiative on Africa should enhance the continent's 
development and prevent it from being marginalized in the twentyfirst 
century. Despite its 
resource limitations, the Agency should play a greater role in the continent's development 
efforts. 
40. The Ethiopian Government, through the Ethiopian Science and Technology 
Commission, was embarking on cooperation 
programmes with the Agency which were fully 
consistent with the new directions. Although Ethiopia was categorized as a least developed 
country, it now placed less emphasis on infrastructural capacity building and more on 
programmes and projects of socioeconomic 
relevance. In doing so, it was designing fewer 
programmes, but they were ones that had greater impact and were better directed towards 
endusers. 
41. Stressing the importance of the transfer of management skills, he noted that the 
Agency's most useful activities included its efforts in controlling and eradicating livestock 
diseases, such as trypanosomiasis, through the sterileinsect 
technique, isotope hydrology for 
groundwater development and geothermal resources development and management. Ethiopia 
also received Agency assistance in the area of nutritional improvement and was now able to 
assess micronutrient deficiencies using isotope techniques. It therefore supported the 
strengthening of the Agency's programme in that area for the period 1999 to 2000. Ethiopia 
was an ardent supporter of the regional programmes for Africa, particularly AFRA, and 
participated in various Model Projects. Indeed, the most meaningful relationship between 
Member States and the Agency was in the area of technical cooperation. 
42. Cooperation 
between the Agency and Ethiopia had strengthened markedly in recent 
years and, thanks to the Country Programme Framework approach, took greater account of 
national development plans. The Agency's technical cooperation 
activities over the past 
40 years, particularly in the fields of health, diagnostic techniques, infrastructure development, 
animal health and nutrition, and water resources had been commendable. Ethiopia was doing 
everything possible to meet the Agency's standards in the area of radiation safety and to that 
end had drawn up a radiation protection policy and set up an authority responsible for its 
implementation. 
43. To commemorate the Agency's fortieth anniversary, the Ethiopian Science and 
Technology Commission, which was the focal point for Agencysupported 
programmes, 
would be issuing a special bulletin in April 1998 highlighting the achievements in the area of 
cooperation 
and, during the same month, Ethiopia would be hosting the ninth technical 
working group meeting of AFRA. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 13 


44. Mr, YENNIMATAS (Greece), having endorsed the statement made by 
Luxembourg on behalf of the European Union and the associated countries, congratulated the 
Director General who, after 16 years of successful leadership, would soon be leaving the 
Agency. While emphasizing the Agency's important role as the main international 
organization responsible for promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, he also 
welcomed the new Director General of the Agency, Mr. ElBaradei, whose talents and long 
experience of the Agency's affairs would enable him to lead the Agency successfully up to the 
year 2000 and beyond. Mr. ElBaradei could count on Greece's full support. 
45. Looking back on the past year and particularly the past few months, he noted a number 
of important results, including the conclusion of the Model Additional Protocol to strengthen 
the safeguards system, the implementation of new procedures for the preparation and review 
of safety standards, the Model Project concept for technical cooperation 
projects, the 
negotiation of new legal instruments relating to nuclear safety and the conclusion of a new 
convention on the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste management, as well as the 
Protocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 
46. In May, after long negotiations, the Board had approved the Model Additional 
Protocol, which would facilitate the adoption of new measures to strengthen the effectiveness 
and increase the efficiency of safeguards. Greece had contributed to the drafting of the Model 
Protocol because it considered that universal agreement on the importance of nonproliferation 
and an effective and credible safeguards system were increasingly necessary in the new 
political environment of the postCold 
War era. It wished to support all efforts aimed at 
combating vigorously the risks of proliferation. There was no doubt that nuclear proliferation, 
apart from being a clear danger to the security of the planet, could jeopardize the ability of 
States to benefit from the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
47. The Greek Government supported all efforts being made to prevent illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials. It also supported the establishment of the International Physical Protection 
Advisory Service, which would advise Member States on improving their national nuclear 
security systems. He hoped that the service would be extended to enable Member States to be 
equipped with the proper means for controlling nuclear material and radiation sources. 
48. The Agency played a primary role in the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons. The 
two treaties establishing nuclearweaponfree 
zones in Africa and South East Asia, which had 
been signed in 1996, entrusted the Agency with the task of verifying compliance by the 
signatories. 
49. Agency verification of nuclear material removed from weapon programmes was a 
further disarmament measure. However there was a need to make further progress in that 
field. Additional regional arrangements for nonproliferation 
were necessary to bring stability 
at regional level. The conclusion of a treaty to end the production of fissile material for 
weapons purposes was one of the most important disarmament objectives. The Agency's role 
should be further expanded to ensure that verification measures were also developed and 
applied in nuclearweapon 
States. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 14 


50. The Greek Government believed that intensive negotiations should be held between the 
Agency's Secretariat and the Provisional Secretariat of the CTBTO in order to enable the two 
organizations to cooperate 
fully in their fields of competence. Such cooperation 
would be 
beneficial to the CTBTO and also to nonproliferation 
in general. 
51. Greece had already ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which had entered into 
force for his country a few days previously. It would accordingly be able to participate in 
future peer review meetings. Appropriate laws had also been passed in 1996 and 1997 to 
harmonize national legislation with that of the European Union. Funds had been allocated to 
the Greek Atomic Energy Commission to install a nationwide automatic system for measuring 
environmental radioactivity. 
52. Greece had actively participated in the negotiations for the conclusion of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. However, it regretted that agreement had not been reached on enlarging the 
Convention's scope to include reprocessing facilities. 
53. Greece believed that the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme was important 
for the developing countries. It had therefore made its technical facilities available to the 
Agency for the training of scientists and organization of technical seminars. While 
appreciating the initiatives taken by the Secretariat, it felt that a further effort was needed to 
improve the global effectiveness of technical cooperation 
activities. 
54. Efficient control of exports of nuclear and nonnuclear 
material and nuclearrelated 
dualuse 
items was an additional means of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
of further strengthening the Agency's safeguards system. Greece, which participated fully in 
the control mechanism established for that purpose, required comprehensive safeguards as a 
condition of nuclear supply. In doing so, it believed that such a control mechanism was not 
discriminatory and had not been established in order to dictate trade rules, but mainly to 
prevent proliferation and provide guarantees that exports were intended for purely peaceful 
purposes. It urged those States which exported nuclear and other materials or were involved 
in the transit of such materials to adopt those arrangements in order to assist the international 
efforts to combat nonproliferation 
and strengthen the Agency's safeguards. 
55. As in previous years, his delegation wished to comment on the recruitment of 
Professional staff members. He noted with regret that the number of Professional staff from 
the countries of Western Europe, and in particular from Greece, had been continually falling 
over the past years. The resolutions adopted almost every year by the General Conference 
concerning personnel matters had had no effect as far as Greece was concerned. While 
recognizing the difficulties facing the Director General in the matter of recruitment, he invited 
him to pay more attention to the qualifications of the personnel to be recruited and to the 
justified complaints of some Member States. 
56. In conclusion, Greece approved the Agency's Annual Report for 1996 and the Budget 
for 1998. He hoped that the new Director General would make every effort to enable the 
Agency to carry out its functions as efficiently and effectively as possible, taking into account 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 15 


the financial difficulties of the majority of Member States. Greece would continue to promote 
compliance with the principles of nonproliferation 
and the strengthening of the Agency's 
tasks in the areas of safeguards, disarmament and safety, taking due account of the needs of 
developing countries. 


57. Mr. BOERSNER STEDER (Venezuela), having welcomed the new Member 
States of the Agency, Malta and Burkina Faso, said that the fortyfirst 
session of the General 
Conference had particular importance for all the participants for two reasons. Firstly, it 
marked the fortieth anniversary of the creation of the Agency, an organization which had 
carried out effective work to promote peace, nuclear safety, peaceful uses of atomic energy 
and the spread of nuclear techniques which contributed to progress in developing countries. 
As the outgoing Director General had said in his memorable speech at the opening of the 
session, that work had not been completed and the Agency would continue to play a useful 
role in the future as a force for security and cooperation 
in the field of nuclear energy. The 
Venezuelan Government had sent a message to that effect to the President of the General 
Conference. 
58. Secondly, the current session of the General Conference coincided with the imminent 
end of the current Director General's term of office and the final appointment of his successor. 
For 16 years, Mr. HansBlix had carried out his tasks admirably. Venezuela, like other 
countries in Latin America and the developing world, had always greatly appreciated and 
unreservedly supported his actions, which were both energetic and characterized by a sense of 
human solidarity. He was pleased that the General Conference had decided to confer the title 
of Director General Emeritus upon him and sincerely wished him every happiness and success 
in the years to come. For the first time, the developing world was going to take on 
responsibility for directing the Agency through his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, whose 
experience and exceptional qualities were greatly appreciated. On behalf of Venezuela, he 
offered him his warmest congratulations and best wishes for success, and expressed his 
willingness to cooperate 
with him. 
59. As in previous years, Mr. Blix had skilfully summarized in his introductory statement 
the results achieved by the Agency over the past year. Venezuela supported the ideas he had 
presented and welcomed his report. 
60. Venezuela attached particular importance to the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities and had accordingly followed closely the process of restructuring in the Department 
of Technical Cooperation. 
It hoped that the new system in place since 1 September would 
contribute to greater efficiency in the implementation of programmes. In that connection, he 
wished to mention the useful projects which were being implemented in Venezuela under the 
auspices of the Agency and with its cooperation. 
As the Director General had indicated, the 
Model Project VEN/8/010 entitled "Groundwater Resources in the Caracas Valley" was 
continuing to be implemented successfully and was helping to achieve a longterm 
solution to 
the chronic water supply problem in the capital, which had expanded dramatically over recent 
decades. There was no doubt that that project could serve as a model for other countries in 
Latin America and the Caribbean as well as other developing regions. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 16 


61. Venezuela was participating in 10 regional ARCAL projects and 11 national projects 
relating to nuclear medicine, radiopharmaceutical production, veterinary science, agricultural 
development, the industrial applications of nuclear techniques, environmental protection and 
training in nuclear analytical techniques. Of all the ARCAL projects, the one entitled "Tracer 
Techniques in Dam Leakage" deserved special mention. It had entered the operational phase, 
and the responsibility for its implementation fell mainly upon Venezuelan technicians, who 
greatly appreciated the invaluable contributions made by the Agency's experts. 
62. It should be noted that certain projects which had encountered initial difficulties in 
implementation had been modified jointly by Agency experts and Venezuelan technicians and 
were now producing very promising results, such as project VEN/5/018 entitled "Genetic 
Improvement of Fruits and Pepper". In addition, the Nuclear Affairs Directorate of the 
Ministry of Energy and Mines was modernizing its project management and training system in 
order to make optimum use of the resources supplied by the IAEA. 
63. Venezuela was also paying great attention to the issue of nuclear safety and therefore 
welcomed the drawing up of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management as well as the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. It also welcomed the Nuclear 
Safety Review 1997 (GC(41)/INF/5 and Add. 1). 
64. Radioactive waste processing had become a priority for Venezuela, which had 
undertaken to build a large storage facility for radioactive sources withdrawn from use, which 
would comply with international safety standards and the most recent Agency 
recommendations. All users of substances and equipment that generated ionizing radiation 
were obliged to observe the national radiological safety standards which had been published 
and to have trained staff, radiation detectors and suitable emergency procedures. 
65. With regard to the delicate and complex question of the amendment of Article VI of 
the Statute, he reaffirmed his delegation's support for an expansion of the Board of Governors 
to ensure more democratic representation of all regions and, in particular, equitable 
representation of developing countries. Among the proposals drawn up during the past year, 
it welcomed the one which had been presented by Sudan. It hoped that it would be possible, 
during the current session, to achieve an equitable solution which would be satisfactory for all 
the Member States so that an end could finally be put to a discussion which had continued for 
too long. 
66. With regard to Agency personnel matters, Venezuela welcomed the gradual 
improvement in the representation of developing countries and of women. 
67. His delegation was keen to reaffirm its unreserved support for all the Agency's work. 
To turn that support into positive action, Venezuela had made considerable efforts and had 
made the sacrifices needed internally to settle its arrears to both the Agency and the other 
bodies of the United Nations at the same time. Nevertheless, given that the global economic 
changes of recent years had tended to reduce many developing countries' ability to pay (even 
if only temporarily), the Agency should be lenient towards certain developing countries,

GENERAL 
DEBATE 
AND 
STATEMENTS 
MARKING 
THE 
AGENCY'S 
40TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
(resumed) 
(GC(41)/ 
8) 


71. 
Ms. 
TOLLE 
(Kenya), 
having 
congratulated 
Malta 
and 
Burkina 
Faso 
on 
their 
admission 
to 
the 
Agency, 
noted 
that 
the 
current 
session 
marked 
a 
milestone 
in 
the 
Agency's 
history. 
It 
was 
celebrating 
its 
fortieth 
anniversary 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
succeed 
Mr. 
Blix, 
who 
had 
shown 
exemplary 
dedication 
in 
his 
service 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
16 
years, 
and 
whose 
initiatives 
in 
technical 
co-operation, 
especially 
in 
Kenya, 
and 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
to 
implement 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
to 
minimize 
the 
risks 
which 
nuclear 
energy 
posed 
to 
life, 
health 
and 
the 
environment, 
would 
always 
be 
remembered. 
72. 
After 
the 
discovery 
of 
radioactivity 
nearly 
a 
century 
ago, 
the 
discovery 
of 
nuclear 
fission 
had 
opened 
up 
new 
prospects 
for 
both 
peaceful 
and 
destructive 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
use 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
radioactive 
substances 
had 
spread 
widely 
into 
various 
sectors 
of 
economic 
life. 
However, 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
posed 
a 
very 
grave 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
which 
was 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
large 
stocksof 
fissile 
materialthatwere 
always 
vulnerabletotheftandbythepossibility 
ofaccidents 
at 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
transboundary 
impact 
that 
nuclear 
accidents 
could 
have, 
they 
could 
not 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
purely 
national 
problem. 
73. 
With 
regard 
to 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
other 
radioactive 
sources, 
Kenya 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
Agency 
had 
tackled 
the 
problem 
with 
the 
support 
of 
its 
Member 
States 
and 
reiterated 
its 
support 
for 
the 
programme 
launched 
in 
1997 
to 
create 
a 
database, 
to 
improve 
the 
physical 
protection 
and 
monitoring 
of 
nuclear

74. Her Government considered that, in order to guarantee nuclear safety in the world of 
the future, only the clear, fair and transparent application of safeguards would make it possible 
to detect violations and to take strict measures in cases of failure to adhere to commitments. 
Furthermore, it was convinced that all internationally adopted safeguards measures should be 
implemented in strict compliance with the legal framework set up by the Agency's Statute and 
other relevant instruments. It was of the utmost importance that all States should make all 
their nuclear activities transparent by declaring their nuclear material inventories and by 
allowing the correctness and completeness of their declarations to be verified. In that regard, 
she congratulated the Agency on the progress achieved in enforcing measures to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of safeguards within the context of Programme 93+2, which 
would facilitate the accounting for and control of nuclear material, facilities that had been 
decommissioned and shut down, and fuel cycles. 
75. In order to give collective initiatives on nonproliferation 
and the total elimination of 
nuclear weapons a chance of success, it was vital to put a stop to the fabrication and use of 
fissile material for nuclear weapons production. In that regard, she called for the start of 
negotiations on a convention to prohibit the production of fissile material intended for the 
manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. 
76. As a peaceloving 
country, Kenya supported all international initiatives promoting 
nuclear disarmament. While there was reason to welcome the progress achieved in that 
respect, and particularly the creation of nuclearweaponfree 
zones, the indefinite extension of 
the NPT and the strengthening of the Agency's safeguards system, it was necessary to 
recognize that those developments in themselves were not sufficient to achieve a total 
elimination of nuclear weapons. It was therefore imperative that negotiations on the 
elimination of nuclear weapons be pursued as a matter of highest priority. In that context, her 
Government had welcomed the adoption of the CTBT by the United Nations General 
Assembly in September 1996 and the subsequent establishment of the CTBTO Preparatory 
Commission. It was happy to note that the Commission's Provisional Technical Secretariat, 
set up in spring 1997, had made every effort to achieve progress in its future cooperation 
with 
the Agency. Those were important signs of the international community's commitment to the 
objectives of nuclear nonproliferation. 
Kenya would contribute to those efforts by continuing 
its active participation in the seismic and radionuclide monitoring system established within the 
framework of the CTBT. It reiterated its full support for the implementation scheme for the 
Agency's safeguards system, which provided for increased access to information relating to 
nuclear technology and activities in States, while also taking account of the principle of 
national sovereignty. 
77. The Agency's performance over the past year was as commendable as in previous 
years and had enabled Member States to derive maximum benefits from the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, which the technical cooperation 
programme was helping to promote. Since 
the adoption of the Model Project concept, technical cooperation 
was increasingly being 
focused on endusers, 
which was enhancing the socioeconomic 
impact of nuclear energy 
applications. The success of that new concept had given a fresh impetus to the Agency's 
technical cooperation 
activities and had resulted in new initiatives: new Model Projects, 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 19 


Country Programme Frameworks, thematic planning, technical cooperation 
among 
developing countries, cofunding 
and the use of targets and success criteria. 


78. The Kenyan delegation was convinced that that approach was likely to produce 
tangible socioeconomic 
results. Since the technical cooperation 
programme was increasingly 
focused on national needs and sustainable development priorities, it would be even more 
efficient and cost effective. Kenya urged all its partners to give maximum support to that 
approach in order to achieve one of the Agency's main objectives, to accelerate and enlarge 
the contribution of nuclear energy to development. 
79. The United Nations had repeatedly endorsed the principle of technical cooperation 
among developing countries, which took account of the fact that those countries had differing 
levels of technological development and which could bring benefits for all the partners if it 
were applied comprehensively. Kenya, which considered that that approach was particularly 
well suited to the prevailing climate of budgetary austerity, supported the activities of AFRA 
at regional and subregional levels. The AFRA programme had enabled strong ties of 
friendship and cooperation 
to be established among countries in the region which had similar 
problems and interests. Through the assistance provided by the Agency within that 
framework, a number of countries had been able to become partners in development, which 
had greatly contributed to integration and harmony in that region of the world. Kenya hoped 
that support for the AFRA programme would be maintained, since previous initiatives had 
allowed nuclear energy issues in the region to be tackled while taking into account the specific 
characteristics of individual countries. The AFRA programme promised to be a vital driving 
force for the future implementation of the Agency's technical cooperation 
programme. 
80. The technical cooperation 
activities carried out in Kenya had centred mainly on 
training, technology, agriculture, human and animal health and nuclear safety. For its part, 
Kenya had made a modest contribution by providing experts and lecturers, training facilities 
and financial resources. Those activities had greatly contributed to strengthening nuclear 
technology in Kenya. A unified set of safety standards agreed upon by consensus and 
provisions for radiation safety in Member States was essential. The promotion of radiation 
safety had played a very important role in the implementation of nuclear technology in Kenya, 
ensuring that health and safety conditions for handling, storing and using radiation sources 
were satisfactory. 
81. During the past year, the project on using nondestructive 
testing techniques for 
quality control in industry and establishing acceptable standards for Kenya's industrial 
products had been extended to cover nondestructive 
testing of concrete structures and 
certification of the staff carrying out such tests. To achieve that aim, the Kenya Bureau of 
Standards had drawn up a harmonized national qualification and certification system in 
collaboration with the ISO and other bodies. Kenya thanked the United States warmly for its 
help in implementing that important project through the Agency. 
82. With regard to research and development, the Institute of Nuclear Science at the 
University of Nairobi had given help to other institutions by organizing training in the 
maintenance of scientific instruments and by carrying out analytical work in various fields of 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 20 


research and development. Through such cooperation, 
the Institute had become an important 
centre for training and for disseminating knowledge on nuclear science, analytical techniques 
and instrumentation in the region. Her delegation was convinced that similar continued 
cooperation 
would enhance the Institute's ability to offer advanced training in all the fields of 
nuclear science and technology which were national priorities. 


83. In the area of agriculture, the assistance provided by the Agency within the framework 
of AFRA had led to the development of new varieties of wheat with improved resistance to 
drought through induced mutation breeding techniques. Other projects related to the 
diagnosis and control of animal diseases, the control of the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis in 
the Lambwe valley, and nitrogen fixation by multipurpose 
tree species. With regard to 
medicine, the Agency's technical cooperation 
projects had greatly helped to improve the 
national health care delivery system, especially in the field of diagnostic radiology and 
radiography. The country's main centres using those techniques were now in a position to 
pass on the scientific and technical expertise they had acquired to other centres, which should 
enable the level of care in the country to be significantly improved. 
84. Kenya appreciated the efforts made by the Secretariat over the previous 15 years to 
increase the proportion of women working in Professional posts in the Secretariat, which had 
risen from 11.7% to 18.6%. However, that increase was still too small. She therefore urged 
the Agency to redouble its efforts to train and recruit competent and qualified women from all 
regions of the world. 
85. With regard to the composition of the Board of Governors, she reiterated the need to 
increase the size of the Board in line with the draft resolution submitted by the African Group 
in document GC(41)/COM.5/14. 
86. In conclusion, she said that as the new millennium approached, the international 
community should continue to help the Agency achieve its fundamental objectives, which were 
to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity and 
to ensure that the assistance provided either by the Agency itself or under its supervision and 
control was not used to serve any military purposes. 
87. Mr. NIITENBERG (Estonia), having congratulated the Agency on its 
40th anniversary and welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as new members, said that his 
country recognized the Agency's achievements and wished it success in meeting the challenges 
of the future. 
88. It was essential to support fully Parts 1 and 2 of Programme 93+2 as well as all other 
measures aimed at strengthening the safeguards system, since the proliferation of nuclear 
technology and trafficking in nuclear materials gave rise to the concern that nuclear weapons 
could be used by terrorists or irresponsible regimes in some countries. That danger, and not a 
major nuclear war, was the main threat in the twentyfirst 
century and it was incumbent upon 
the Agency to deal with that threat and eliminate it. His country's nuclear security policy was 
based on that understanding and it would be implementing that policy by acceding to 
international conventions and bilateral agreements and by strengthening the measures against 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 21 


trafficking in nuclear materials through better surveillance of its borders and by strengthening 
its customs controls. 


89. The Agency's 40year 
history had been characterized by various landmarks: the 
nuclear arms race and the subsequent conclusion of treaties limiting stockpiles of nuclear 
weapons and delivery systems, the increase in the number of nuclear power plants and the 
Chernobyl accident. It should not be forgotten that the Agency had contributed to the 
development of nuclear science in the fields of medicine, agriculture and technology. 
90. Although Estonia had only been independent for 7 of the 40 years since the Agency 
had been established, those 7 years had been marked by a number of different events including 
its accession to the NPT in 1992, the transfer of the former Soviet military nuclear facility in 
Paldiski to Estonia in 1995, and the recent adoption of an act establishing the legal framework 
for radiation practice in the country. 
91. Estonia's future tasks would be dictated by the process of integrating the country into 
the European Union. The absence of a nuclear programme could no longer be used as a 
reason to justify shortcomings in nuclear legislation once Estonia had become a member of the 
Union. A safeguards agreement between Estonia and the Agency had been prepared for 
approval by the Government. The recently adopted radiation act was consistent with the 
Agency's Basic Safety Standards. However, the harmonization process should go further. 
92. Technical cooperation 
with the Agency or with other countries through the Agency 
had been very beneficial for Estonia, which recognized the value of the advice given for the 
decommissioning of the Paldiski nuclear facility and for solving the problems of the handling 
and disposal of radioactive waste. The feasibility study for a final repository in Estonia, 
undertaken in cooperation 
with the Agency, was an important assistance project. 
93. While Estonia had no nuclear programme, it was surrounded by countries with nuclear 
power plants. For that reason, it was interested in regional cooperation 
through the Working 
Group on Nuclear and Radiation Safety of the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the 
Paldiski International Expert Reference Group, and he thanked those groups for their 
cooperation 
and assistance. A project on radon charting in Estonia was running smoothly 
thanks to the fruitful cooperation 
of the Swedish Radiation Protection Institute. The recently 
concluded Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management was a solid basis for regional cooperation, 
particularly in the 
Baltic. 
94. The challenges that Estonia would have to face in the future included the radioactive 
waste of military origin inherited from the Soviet Union and the lack of final disposal facilities 
for that waste; uranium mining tailings in the northeast 
of the country; and the radioactive 
remnants of two decommissioned submarines. It also had to harmonize its legislation with 
European Union and EURATOM directives and seek alternatives to its energy policy, without 
excluding the nuclear power option. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 22 


95. In conclusion, he thanked Mr. Blix, the outgoing Director General, and extended his 
congratulations and best wishes to Mr. ElBaradei, the new Director General. He also thanked 
the Agency's extremely competent staff.

the end of the current session of the General Conference to the end of the regular session after 
next in 
other words, to the end of the fortythird 
regular session in 1999. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND STATEMENTS MARKING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE AGENCY (resumed) 
(GC(41)/8) 


100. Mr. DAHMANI (Algeria), having welcomed the Conference's approval of 
Malta and Burkina Faso for Agency membership, paid tribute and expressed his country's 
gratitude to the Director General, Mr. Blix, for the manner in which he had led the Agency 
during his terms of office. He also wished every success to the future Director General, 
Mr. ElBaradei. 
101. The Agency's fortieth anniversary conferred special meaning on the activities currently 
under way and highlighted the extent of the challenges still to be faced. For its part, Algeria 
would continue to abide completely by the principles enshrined in the Statute. During the past 
40 years, the Agency had played an increasingly important role and demonstrated an ability to 
adapt, remaining sensitive to the needs of developing countries and in particular strengthening 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 23 


its technical assistance and cooperation 
activities. In that connection, Algeria was very 
satisfied with the quality of the assistance provided by the Agency under its technical 
cooperation 
programme. His country remained firmly convinced that the Agency's 
promotional activities, like its other statutory activities, constituted an essential pillar 
supporting the Agency's efforts in the interests of nonproliferation 
and the peaceful utilization 
of nuclear energy. 


102. The technical cooperation 
programme should be in keeping with the growing needs in 
the field of the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. It was therefore essential that the Model 
Projects advocated as part of the Agency's new technical assistance approach should respond 
fully to the priority needs of the developing countries. Algeria was in favour of the Agency's 
new strategy for designing, implementing and evaluating projects. In Algeria, numerous users 
of nuclear techniques in sectors as varied as agriculture, water resources management, 
industry, energy, health, biotechnology and the environment were participating in the 
formulation of proposals for national projects to be implemented during the next twoyear 
technical cooperation 
cycle. 
103. Like its promotional activities, the Agency's nonproliferation 
endeavours should be 
supported. Algeria's support for those endeavours reflected its wish to contribute to the 
international community's efforts to strengthen peace and security both regionally and 
globally. Thus, since participating actively in the NPT Review and Extension Conference, his 
country had taken important nonproliferation 
steps, first becoming a party to the NPT, then 
concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency and finally embarking on 
subsidiary arrangement negotiations, which were due to be concluded very soon. Those steps 
demonstrated Algeria's wish to strengthen the climate of trust and transparency which now 
characterized its relations with the Agency. 
104. Algeria, which welcomed the establishment of an African nuclearweaponfree 
zone, 
would like to see that example of regional denuclearization followed in other regions especially 
in the Middle East, where a single country was continuing to block the 
establishment of such a zone. His country continued to be very concerned about the attitude 
of Israel, which was still refusing to become a party to the NPT and to place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency safeguards. 
105. The fact that a consensus solution to the question of enlarging the Board of Governors 
had still not been found was also a matter of concern to his country. Given its technological 
potential, Algeria was in favour of enlarging the Board on the basis of an agreement which 
took into account the aspirations of developing countries, particularly of those in Africa. It 
accordingly supported the African Group's proposal, which had been welcomed by the 
Group of 77. 
106. With regard to nuclear, radiation and waste safety, Algeria, which had become a party 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, would continue to support the other legal instruments 
developed under the auspices of the Agency and measures being taken by the Agency in that 
field. It would like to see the Agency make a real contribution to the international 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 24 


community's efforts to strengthen cooperation 
directed towards the improvement of safety 
standards and mechanisms at all stages in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 


107. Once its recently created atomic energy authority was firmly in place, Algeria would as 
a high priority examine 
the question of how best to implement the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and 
the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. It intended to establish 
the regulatory and safetyrelated 
bodies needed in connection with Agency conventions and in 
particular with the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the ultimate aim being to have a complete 
set of national structures for ensuring the fulfilment by Algeria of its commitments in that area. 
108. Mr. EL FADHEL KHALIL (Tunisia), having welcomed the admission to the 
Agency of Malta and Burkina Faso, congratulated the new Director General and paid tribute 
to his predecessor, said that the adoption of the Additional Protocol to strengthen and 
consolidate the safeguards system, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Protocol to Amend the 
Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage had created a favourable climate for the 
safe development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
109. That new situation brought with it several obligations for the Agency and also for 
those Member States which possessed nuclear weapons. Firstly, it was necessary to assure 
equitable representation of regional groups within the Agency's various organs and, in 
particular, in the Board of Governors. In that connection, Tunisia supported the African 
proposal for an amendment of Article VI of the Agency's Statute. Secondly, technical 
cooperation 
would need to be intensified in order to strengthen activities in developing 
countries. Thirdly, safeguards agreements would have to be applied to all countries, especially 
those which refused to subject their nuclear facilities to conditions of total transparency while 
benefiting from the application of the same conditions to neighbouring countries. Fourthly, 
care would have to be taken to ensure that the strengthening of the safeguards system did not 
place an additional financial burden on countries whose nuclear activities posed no threats. 
110. Tunisia had acceded to all conventions relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
and enjoyed excellent relations with the Agency in the area of technical cooperation, 
which 
had led to the launching of several pilot projects. One such had been the establishment, with 
the help of France and of the Agency, of a semiindustrial 
pilot plant for food irradiation, a 
project which would be completed in the course of 1998. 
111. On the regional level, Tunisia had in 1997 hosted a meeting of AFRA national 
coordinators, 
which had given it an opportunity to strengthen its cooperation 
with other 
African countries. In addition, Tunisia played host to the headquarters of the Arab Atomic 
Energy Agency, a technicallyoriented 
body which worked towards the same objectives as the 
IAEA and with which he urged the Agency to strengthen its cooperative 
links. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 25 


112. Tunisia, which regularly paid its assessed contribution to the Regular Budget, had also 
paid the voluntary contribution which it had pledged the previous year and would pay the 
whole of its share of the target for the TCF for 1998. 
113. In the coming decades, many of the developing countries, including Tunisia, would not 
be able to meet their growing energy needs without recourse to nuclear power. In that regard, 
lowand 
mediumpower 
reactors seemed wellsuited 
to the consumption patterns of small 
countries. Tunisia therefore supported the Agency's efforts in that field and hoped to see 
them pursued and consolidated. The use of such reactors for the production of potable water 
was of great interest to Tunisia, and accordingly it welcomed the establishment by the Agency 
of an expert group on water desalination, which included a Tunisian expert. 
114. He commended the progress achieved by the international community in the field of 
nuclear nonproliferation, 
as witnessed by the strengthening of the safeguards system, the 
indefinite extension of the NPT and the establishment of the CTBTO, and in that context 
urged that all Member States should join the NPT. 
115. A global and innovative approach was needed in tackling the question of eliminating all 
weapons of mass destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, from the Middle East. As an 
African country, Tunisia had been in favour of the denuclearization of that continent. 
However, several African countries were also in the Middle East, and therefore the creation of 
a nuclearweaponfree 
zone in Africa would not really make sense until such weapons were 
eliminated from the Middle East as well. 
116. Mr. YAMEOGO (Burkina Faso), having paid tribute to the outgoing Director 
General, Mr. Blix, and congratulated his successor, Mr. ElBaradei, on his election, thanked the 
Board of Governors and the General Conference for approving Burkina Faso's application for 
Agency membership. As a Member State, his country would abide by the Agency's Statute, 
fulfil its obligations and act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of 
the United Nations. Furthermore, it would endeavour to contribute to peace and sustainable 
development through close cooperation 
with the Agency and with other Member States. 
117. Mr. ASHEEKE (Namibia), associating himself with the statement made by the 
Chairman of the African Group, paid tribute to the outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix, for 
the exemplary manner in which he had guided the work of the Agency over the previous 
16 years. He also welcomed the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei as Director General, assuring 
him of his fullest cooperation, 
and the new members, Burkina Faso and Malta. 
118. On the occasion of the Agency's fortieth anniversary, his country expressed its 
admiration for the professional work done by the Agency in the areas of nonproliferation 
and 
safety, and commended it on its commitment to the utilization of atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes and sustainable development. In that connection, he was pleased to inform the 
General Conference that his country had commemorated the Agency's fortieth anniversary by 
opening the first radiotherapy unit in Namibia, which had been established with considerable 
assistance from the Agency and the Government of the United States of America. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 26 


119. The Agency was playing an important role in the socioeconomic 
development of 
Namibia, which continued to receive technical assistance from the Agency in the areas of 
agriculture, water resource management, public health, uranium mining and radiation safety, in 
particular by providing expert services and equipment and above all by contributing to human 
resources development, an area that was especially important to Namibia in view of the fact 
that, prior to independence, the majority of its people had had no opportunities to gain 
scientific and technical expertise. 
120. The Agency's contribution in those technical fields was regarded by his Government as 
an excellent means of opening up the field of science and technology to young and 
disadvantaged Namibians. He therefore looked forward to a continued association with the 
Agency's technical cooperation 
programme and trusted that the reorganization of the 
technical cooperation 
services would enhance their effectiveness and efficiency for the benefit 
of all. It was, however, a matter of concern that funding for that very successful activity of the 
Agency had been dwindling, with negative effects on the programmes and projects. He 
therefore urged Member States to ensure that technical cooperation 
was funded on a secure 
and predictable basis. 
121. Recalling that his country had committed itself fully to the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and to the total elimination of all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, 
particularly by signing the Pelindaba Treaty in April 1996, he took pleasure in informing the 
General Conference that the Namibian Government had approved the safeguards agreement 
with the Agency, which was currently awaiting ratification by Parliament. 
122. With regard to the expansion of the Board of Governors, Namibia was very concerned 
about Africa's continued underrepresentation 
on the Board. That genuine concern should be 
addressed on its own merit, without being linked to extraneous issues. His delegation 
appealed to all Member States to correct the situation and to ensure that Africa was fairly 
represented. 
123. Mr. SERVIAN (Uruguay) said that the celebration of an anniversary was 
a good opportunity to evaluate what had been achieved and to look to the future. 
When, 40 years previously, the Agency had been established, the international community had 
had two major concerns in the nuclear area. One had been was the need to promote the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The other had been to ensure that nuclear technologies and 
materials were not transferred from peaceful to military uses. The threat of the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons had terrorized the entire world. That had given rise to the three main 
Departments of the Agency: the Department of Research and Isotopes, in which he himself 
had had the honour of working, the Department of Technical Cooperation 
and the 
Department of Safeguards. 
124. The Agency had performed its promotional and control responsibilities with exemplary 
effectiveness while maintaining a remarkable balance, despite strong pressure being exerted in 
one direction or another. In the past years, the Agency had made a decisive contribution to 
the creation of a nuclear capacity in the developing countries, while curbing the horizontal 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Thousands of technologists and scientists had been trained, 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 27 


hundreds of laboratories had been equipped and thousands of projects had been implemented 
with its assistance. He himself had been the first Uruguayan IAEA fellowship holder. 


125. However, times had changed and new lines of action seemed to be required: the quest 
for greater efficiency, measured in terms of impact in the sectors producing goods and 
services, and the effort to achieve quality, measured, in particular, in terms of cost/benefit 
ratios and appropriateness to the real needs of the population of developing countries. The 
main concern of the Agency and of national nuclear bodies involved radiation protection and 
nuclear safety bore witness to that change of emphasis. In future, the Agency, national nuclear 
bodies and nuclear scientists should all endeavour to use the capabilities that had been 
established in order to resolve real national problems. An appropriate strategy to achieve that 
end would be to step up efforts to transfer nuclear technologies to national bodies, both public 
and private, that were capable of using them. 
126. He was pleased to note the Agency's great contribution to the establishment of a safety 
culture through the training of personnel in radiation protection and nuclear safety, the 
establishment of an international nuclear legal regime and the setting up of dosimetry, 
calibration and radioactive waste management laboratories in the developing countries. 
127. In conclusion, he thanked the Agency's Secretariat for the work it had carried out 
under the guidance of Mr. Blix and congratulated Mr. ElBaradei. 
128. Mr. SIRBUBALO (Bosnia and Herzegovina) said that his country had already 
benefited from five technical cooperation 
projects, including two interregional projects, and 
that, in spite of the fact that it had joined the Agency only two years previously, cooperation 
between his Government and the Agency had been very good. His country had participated, 
to the extent that it was able, in the Agency's permanent activities, particularly in the 
development of a global safety culture. 
129. He expressed his gratitude to the Agency for having shown exceptional understanding 
of the problems of his country. Human resources development was one of his Government's 
main goals. Owing to the war, his country's experts had not been able to study the latest 
scientific publications and had been unable to keep up to date with new achievements and new 
technologies. The process of continuous education supported by the Agency had enabled 
Bosnian experts to acquire qualifications which would make them selfsufficient 
in the 
management of various production processes in the future. 
130. Agency experts had supported the efforts made by his country to develop new 
legislation in the field of radiation safety in accordance with the Basic Safety Standards. The 
Agency had also supported his country's work on reviewing and updating the registry of 
radiation sources, as well as its work on dosimetric monitoring of occupational exposure. One 
problem, however, remained unsolved, namely the country's inability to control movements of 
radioactive materials across its frontiers. Such support and cooperation 
was of great 
importance and could make a very valuable contribution to the Agency's efforts in other 
countries with similar problems. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 28 


131. He emphasized his country's dedication to the Agency and its goals and expressed his 
gratitude to it for its efforts to assist his country and involve it in Agency activities. The 
Agency and the Secretariat deserved particular commendation for what they had done over the 
past 40 years to strengthen the Agency as an instrument of international safety. 
132. In conclusion, he conveyed his respect and gratitude to Mr. Blix for the remarkable 
way he had guided the Agency and wished him all the best for the future. The future Director 
General, Mr. ElBaradei, could be assured of his country's full support and cooperation. 
133. Mr. MICHAELIDES (Cyprus), having welcomed Malta and Burkina Faso as 
new members of the Agency, said that the current session of the General Conference was 
marked by two events of particular importance: first, the celebration of the fortieth 
anniversary of the Agency's establishment and secondly the changeover in its leadership. 
134. Over the 40 years of its existence, the Agency had spared no effort to promote and to 
guarantee the safe use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The results it had achieved 
were truly remarkable. Congratulating the Agency on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary, 
he expressed the conviction that it would continue in the future to fulfil its important role with 
equal success, for the benefit of mankind. He also thanked Mr. Blix for the outstanding 
dedication and competence with which he had directed the Agency over the past 16 years, and 
wished him every success for the future. In addition, he extended his congratulations and best 
wishes to the incoming Director General, Mr. ElBaradei, and assured him of his delegation's 
full support and cooperation. 
He also congratulated Mr. Peter Walker on the outstanding 
way in which he had directed the work of the Board of Governors. 
135. Associating himself with the statement made by Luxembourg on behalf of the 
European Union, he said that Cyprus, which regarded the NPT as the most important 
international legal instrument for ensuring global security, the prevention of nuclear 
proliferation and nuclear disarmament, had supported the decision to extend the Treaty for an 
indefinite period, and urged all States to accede to it so that it could become truly universal. 
136. The Comprehensive NuclearTestBan 
Treaty was another decisive step on the road 
towards nonproliferation. 
Cyprus, which was proud to be among those States which had 
signed the Treaty, had already taken steps towards its ratification and strongly urged all States 
to join it in signing that extremely important international legal instrument. 
137. Cyprus welcomed the establishment of the Provisional Technical Secretariat of the 
CTBTO Preparatory Commission in Vienna. It was now important to intensify efforts through 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations with a view to reaching a speedy agreement on a treaty 
to halt the production of fissile materials for military purposes. 
138. Cyprus endorsed the Agency's activities relating to the application of safeguards to 
nuclear materials and supported efforts to strengthen further and improve the safeguards 
system, which was an integral part of the global nonproliferation 
regime. In that connection, 
he recalled that a safeguards agreement pursuant to the NPT had been concluded between 
Cyprus and the IAEA in 1972 and ratified a year later. Cyprus therefore welcomed the 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 29 


adoption in May of that year of the Model Additional Protocol, which was designed to 
strengthen the efficiency of the safeguards system. 


139. The Agency's technical cooperation 
programme was of great importance for Cyprus 
and Cyprus therefore supported the efforts being made to improve its quality. Cyprus had 
participated, and was still participating, in a number of national and regional Agency technical 
cooperation 
projects, and also provided the Agency with the services of its experts. Thus, 
very close cooperation 
had been established with the various Departments of the Agency, 
especially in the areas of radiation protection and the medical applications of nuclear energy. 
Since the Chernobyl accident, that collaboration had been further strengthened, enabling 
Cyprus to develop the infrastructure and expertise needed to deal with such an event in the 
future. 
140. International cooperation 
was needed if the problem of illicit trafficking in nuclear 
materials was to be overcome. To that end, Cyprus had recently started participating in the 
Agency's database on illicit trafficking, was taking steps to sign and ratify the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and was also considering accession to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. Furthermore, it was in the process of setting up a 
multidisciplinary team to combat illicit trafficking and hoped that by the end of 1997 it would 
be in a position to collaborate fully in international efforts to combat the problem. 
141. Mr. NYANDA (United Republic of Tanzania), after congratulating Malta and 
Burkina Faso on their admission to the Agency, said that in the course of the 40 years of its 
existence the Agency had accomplished its missions with remarkable success, largely due to 
the skills of the outgoing Director General, Mr. Blix, under whom a dedicated Secretariat had 
discharged its duties with great ability. He congratulated Mr. Blix on his distinguished service 
to the Agency and wished him happiness, health and prosperity in the future. 
142. His delegation also congratulated Mr. ElBaradei on his well deserved appointment to 
the difficult post of Director General. He would be taking over the leadership of an 
organization which enjoyed an excellent reputation and whose Member States were united in 
their determination to ensure development through the peaceful use of nuclear energy, while 
ensuring safety and security through the application of the requisite safeguards. Judging by 
Mr. ElBaradei's curriculum vitae, there could be no doubt that he would succeed in ensuring 
that the Agency concentrated with even greater determination on its principal areas of activity, 
while responding flexibly to the new challenges it would have to face. His delegation 
therefore wished him every success in his extremely demanding task and also commended the 
Board of Governors on the transparency, impartiality and strictness with which it had 
conducted the selection and appointment process. 
143. His country was extremely satisfied with the significant results achieved in the course 
of the Agency's 40 years of existence, as well as with the fruitful cooperation 
that had existed 
between the Agency and the United Republic of Tanzania since the latter had become a 
member in 1976. As a result of that cooperation, 
his country had not only achieved many 
successes in the field of the use of nuclear techniques, but had also established a sound 
national radiation protection infrastructure and would be in a position that year to announce 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 30 


the complete eradication of tsetsefly 
from the Island of Zanzibar, which should open the way 
to spectacular agricultural development. In addition, Member States, thanks to the Agency 
and other bodies, had managed to halt, at least temporarily, horizontal proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. Prospects for implementation of an effective and verifiable comprehensive 
nucleartestban 
treaty, leading at the very least to talks on total nuclear disarmament, were 
becoming more and more favourable. 


144. The increase in the demand for energy, particularly in the developing countries and 
even in LDCs such as the United Republic of Tanzania, meant that nuclear energy, in the light 
of the increasing concern for the environment, would remain a significant source of power and 
would contribute appreciably to alleviating the greenhouse effect. It was for that reason that 
his delegation wished to emphasize that countries should make a proper review of the role of 
nuclear energy and that the issue should continue to be debated at international level. In that 
regard, the Agency's Secretariat should pursue its efforts to promote a proper appreciation of 
the contribution that nuclear energy could make to sustainable development. The United 
Republic of Tanzania wished the Agency to extend the scope of its activities in the promotion 
of the use of nuclear power and in related safety procedures, particularly in the developing 
countries. The intensification of research and development work on small, lowcost 
units with 
a high intrinsic safety level was a step in the right direction. 
145. His delegation wished again to express its deep gratitude for the technical assistance 
provided to the United Republic of Tanzania. It greatly appreciated the results achieved 
in 1997 in Africa under the technical cooperation 
programme, results which were entirely 
consistent with the objectives of the United Nations Special Initiative on Africa. Those 
achievements confirmed the Agency's commitment to support, on the basis of guidelines set 
by its Member States, the endeavours of developing countries, particularly in Africa, to 
accelerate the process of technology transfer and to achieve sustainable development. His 
delegation emphasized the need to put funding for technical cooperation 
on a sound footing 
in order to enable the Department of Technical Cooperation 
to plan its future programmes. It 
also appreciated the Agency's efforts to increase the effectiveness of its technical cooperation 
activities. The very commendable initiatives taken in that context included the introduction of 
concepts such as Model Projects, Partners in Development, and Country Programme 
Frameworks. Further consultations on the basis of the Country Programme Frameworks 
should be useful in ensuring that technical cooperation 
funds were used in the most 
costeffective 
way possible, and that appropriate projects were selected for developing 
countries. 
146. The support that the Agency was giving to regional initiatives such as ARCAL, the 
RCA and AFRA, as well as to the regional projects under its technical cooperation 
programme, clearly showed its keen interest in encouraging and strengthening regional 
cooperation. 
Such initiatives, which would ultimately make it possible to ensure optimal use 
of the limited available resources and would have a positive impact on science and technology 
in participating countries, should be encouraged. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 31 


147. The United Republic of Tanzania greatly valued the strenuous efforts made by the 
Agency and its Member States to increase the efficiency of safeguards and noted with 
appreciation the endorsement of the Model Protocol, which would give the Agency additional 
powers. However, if the new strengthened safeguards system was to be effective, it would 
have to be applied without discrimination to all parties to the NPT. The new system should 
also be a new incentive to nuclearweapons 
States to accelerate efforts towards total nuclear 
disarmament. 
148. There was an urgent need for the Agency to reorient its longterm 
policy in order to 
respond to the challenges of the twentyfirst 
century and better mechanisms should be 
developed for setting priorities and strengthening activities for achieving those priorities within 
the limits of available resources. He called on Member States to support the Agency in those 
efforts. 
149. The United Republic of Tanzania believed that there was need for a better balance 
between the Agency's regulatory and promotional activities. The majority of Member States, 
particularly those in the course of development, expected tangible results from the peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy in support of their development programmes. However, 
Agency activities to promote the beneficial uses of nuclear energy did not currently seem to be 
accorded the same importance as regulatory activities. It was to be hoped that the Agency 
would soon succeed in striking a balance between the two. After all, no one would wish to 
see a situation in which the developing countries began to question the advantages of 
membership of an organization whose activities were essentially regulatory. 
150. Mr. TWAL (Jordan), after congratulating the new Director General and paying 
tribute to his predecessor, said that the Agency had strengthened international cooperation 
in 
the field of nuclear technology through the drawing up of conventions such as the Convention 
on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a 
Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. Those measures were particularly essential as nuclear activities and tests, 
accidents and the various peaceful applications of nuclear energy had resulted in an 
accumulation of radioactive waste over the years that had become a source of environmental 
pollution. The Agency was also called upon to take advantage of the peace process in the 
Middle East in order to establish its safeguards system in the region, make it a nuclearweaponfree 
zone and eliminate from it all weapons of mass destruction. 
151. With regard to technical cooperation, 
he emphasized the importance of developing 
human resources in the developing countries, particularly in relation to the maintenance and 
repair of nuclear equipment. In that connection, it might be useful to set up regional centres to 
strengthen the relevant national capabilities. In order to preserve the Department of Technical 
Cooperation's 
efficiency and flexibility, the financing of technical cooperation 
should not 
come under the Agency's Regular Budget. It was to be hoped that the technical cooperation 
budget would be increased constantly and consistently. 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 32 


152. Potable water was one of the main problems facing the developing countries: it was a 
rare commodity, and the shortage was aggravated by increasing demand due to population 
growth and economic development. The desalination of sea water was one of the possible 
options and Jordan was in favour of plans to produce potable water economically by nuclear 
methods and considered that it would be even more appropriate to use nuclear reactors to 
produce both electricity and potable water. 
153. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the Statute, the need for equitable 
representation of the regions of Africa and the Middle East and South Asia on the Board of 
Governors was all the more inescapable as the Member States of those regions had made 
significant progress in the nuclear field. He therefore hoped that a definitive decision would be 
taken at the current session of the General Conference. 
154. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency, which had its headquarters in Tunis, was a regional 
body providing scientific and technical services in the field of the peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy. However, the volume and quality of assistance provided were limited by the 
lack of financial resources. Jordan therefore called on the Agency to increase its support to 
that body. 
155. He appealed to all Member States to pay their contributions on time and noted that his 
country had paid its contribution for 1997 and was preparing to fulfil all its financial 
obligations to the Agency by paying its contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF 
for 1998. 
156. Mr. ROMANMOREY 
(Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 
Latin America and the Caribbean), congratulated Mr. Blix, on behalf of the OPANAL Council, 
very warmly on his effective leadership of the Agency over the past 16 years, a period which, 
after the terror of the Cold War in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, had been marked by extremely 
positive results in the nuclear field. International disarmament agreements concluded during 
that period had only been possible because they had gone hand in hand with the promotion of 
the controlled and verifiable use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, which was the 
Agency's main task. He recalled that nuclear energy had become known to the public in the 
most disastrous way possible. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had not only 
produced hundreds of thousands of victims, but had also destroyed the image of a wonderful 
form of energy which should only have been used for the good of humanity. In the 40 years of 
its existence, the Agency had served to rebuild part of that image. 
157. The Tlatelolco Treaty had been the first international instrument to express the 
sovereign will of its parties never to possess nuclear weapons, while emphasizing the need to 
use nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes in their region, and had defined 
mechanisms for collaboration with the Agency in carrying out tasks relating to safeguards and 
nuclear safety. 
158. The Tlatelolco Treaty would not have been complete without the full participation of 
those States in the region which were the most developed in the nuclear field. With the firm 
political will of the States concerned, and thanks to the constant support of the Agency and 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 33 


the personal participation of Mr. Blix, significant amendments had been made to the initial text 
of the Treaty. The personal efforts made by Mr. Blix and his colleagues, together with the 
Secretariat General of OPANAL, had also made it possible for the Tlatelolco Treaty to be the 
first international treaty to express and implement, in all countries of the region with one 
exception, the will of the parties never to possess nuclear weapons. The region could proudly 
declare that it had been the first nuclearweaponfree 
zone in the world and its example had 
been followed by others. The Rarotonga Treaty for the South Pacific, the Bangkok Treaty for 
South East Asia and the Pelindaba Treaty for Africa meant that a total of 110 countries had 
undertaken not to use nuclear energy for military purposes. Furthermore, other regions of the 
world had taken initiatives to set up such zones, and OPANAL and the Agency had an 
important role to play in that respect. 


159. He particularly thanked Mr. Blix for the support he had given to the Secretariat 
General of OPANAL in organizing the regional seminar on nuclear safeguards held in 
Kingston (Jamaica) in 1996 and also for his constant assistance. On the occasion of his 
retirement, the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean offered him their gratitude and 
warmest appreciation, and their best wishes for a long life, success and happiness. 
160. On behalf of OPANAL, he also warmly congratulated the future Director General, 
Mr. ElBaradei, on his election. His great organizational qualities, his recognized diplomatic 
and legal prestige and his considerable experience of the Agency would ensure that his efforts 
were crowned with success. 
161. On 14 February 1997, OPANAL had celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of its 
founding. The main events organized in honour of that anniversary had been a seminar on 
nuclearweaponfree 
zones in the next century, cosponsored 
by OPANAL, the Mexican 
Government and UNIDIR, and a special commemorative session of the OPANAL General 
Conference. For the first time in the history of OPANAL, all the signatory States, associated 
States, and States and international organizations with observer status had been represented. 
162. Reviewing the main measures adopted at the fifteenth ordinary session of the 
OPANAL General Conference held in July 1997 in Mexico, he said that the most important 
had been the decision to continue to seek new activities to be carried out by OPANAL within 
the framework of the mandate given to it by the Tlatelolco Treaty, taking account of current 
world realities and, in particular, the increasing desire of the international community to 
establish nuclearweaponfree 
zones. 
163. A new era was beginning, the world was continuing to change and the action taken by 
the international community through the intermediary of its regional or international 
institutions had to be decisive. As Mr. ElBaradei had said in his statement, the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy contributed effectively to the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons and the 
Agency might one day be able to verify the total elimination of weapons throughout the world. 
164. Mr. BARAKAT (Arab Atomic Energy Agency) said that his organization, 
which had its headquarters in Tunis, focused its activities on improving human resources in the 
field of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Its work was mainly conducted in Arabic 

GC(41)/OR.8 
page 34 


and included the organization of training programmes, symposia, expert meetings and 
seminars, as well as the publication of scientific documents on the various aspects of the 
peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 


165. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency cooperated 
with the IAEA, as shown by the 
organization of a nineweek 
training course on radiation protection in Arabic, which was soon 
to be held in Damascus. In that connection, he emphasized the importance of the use of 
Arabic in training programmes. At present, the Arab Atomic Energy Agency was 
cooperating 
with the IAEA in connection with a programme for developing a standard set of 
regulations in Arabic for radiation protection, which would be the subject of an Arab expert 
meeting in December 1997. 
166. Recalling that representatives of his organization had participated in the work of the 
expert advisory groups on smalland 
mediumpower 
reactors and the nuclear desalination of 
sea water, he noted that the IAEA attended the conferences of the Arab Atomic Energy 
Agency and that the two organizations exchanged publications. He welcomed that 
cooperation 
and hoped to see it further strengthened. 
167. Mr. HEZZAH (League of Arab States) said that the League, which was linked 
to the Agency by a cooperation 
agreement, was working tirelessly to make the Middle East a 
zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction. It called on the international 
community to support its efforts and on Israel to accede to the NPT without delay and to 
place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards, prior to the 
denuclearization of the Middle East, which would help strengthen peace in the region. The 
Agency's Director General was therefore requested to increase his contacts with the countries 
of the region in order to accelerate that process. 
168. He hoped that the Agency would continue to contribute further to international 
security by strengthening the safeguards system and verification activities and through 
international cooperation 
in the area of nuclear safety and radioactive waste disposal. He also 
hoped that the Agency's role in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and in technical 
assistance would be strengthened. 
The meeting rose at 7 p.m.

"The General Conference at its fortieth session took note of the Report by the 
Director General on Composition of Regional Groups under the agenda item 
"Amendment of Article VI of the Statute" as was contained in the Attachment to 
document GC(40)/ll. It reiterated the principle of the sovereign equality of all 
Member States of the Agency, as provided for in Article IV.C of the Statute. It 
affirmed that this principle requires that each Member State of the Agency be within 
one of the areas listed in Article VI. A. 1 of the Statute. 


"Recalling the draft resolution contained in document GC(39)/COM.5/10 dated 
19 September 1995 and resolution GC(39)/RES/22 dated 22 September 1995, the 
Conference requests that the Chairman of the Board of Governors continue to 
consult with Member States not yet listed in a regional area as well as with other 
Member States, including representatives of the regional areas, and that he report 
for consideration of the fortysecond 
session of the General Conference specific 
proposals to include each Member State within the appropriate area at the time of 
the Conference in September 1998." 


30. The President's statement was accepted. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 9 


31. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) stressed that the inclusion of any 
country in a regional group had to be accepted by the other countries in that group. While 
any country had the right to belong to a regional group, geographical proximity was not the 
only criterion governing membership of such a group, since harmonious relations among 
the group's members were essential for fruitful cooperation. 
Such issues should be settled 
by consultations and he did not consider it possible to set a deadline for the completion of 
the process in view of all the factors involved. Finally, he expressed surprise at the 
inclusion in the President's statement of a reference to document GC(39)/COM.5/10, 
which was a draft resolution that had not been adopted when it had been submitted in 1995. 
32. Mr. AYATOLLAHI (Islamic Republic of Iran), having expressed 
appreciation for the work of the Committee of the Whole and the contact group which had 
worked on the issue in great detail, said that his delegation's acceptance as a whole of the 
package relating to the amendment of Article VI, together with the Presidential statement, 
did not indicate its full satisfaction. The Presidential statement had referred to a draft 
resolution in document GC(39)/COM.5/10 which had not been adopted and had therefore 
no legal force. However, in a spirit of cooperation 
and consensus, his delegation accepted 
it as part of the Presidential statement. 
Co-operation agreements with intergovernmental organizations (agenda item 21) 


33. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to approve the draft 
cooperation 
agreement between the IAEA and the BrazilianArgentine 
Agency for 
Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials contained in document GC(41)/26. 
34. It was so decided. 
International Initiative for Chernobyl Sarcophagus (agenda item 22) 


35. The draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/36 was adopted. 

GC(41)/OR.9

APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
(GC(41)/7) 


36. The PRESIDENT said that the current term of office of the External 
Auditor, who was the Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom, would end 
when he had finished auditing the Agency's accounts for 1997; the Conference therefore 
needed to make an appointment at its current session to provide for the auditing of the 
accounts for 1998 and 1999. 
37. He took it that, in line with the recommendation by the Board of Governors 
contained in document GC(41)/7, the General Conference wished to appoint the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom as the External Auditor to audit 
the Agency's accounts for 1998 and 1999. 
38. It was so decided. 
39. The PRESIDENT conveyed to the External Auditor and his staff the 
Agency's appreciation for the work they had done in auditing the Agency's accounts so far 
and for the many useful suggestions made by them over the past two years. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF 
SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE 
NONPROLIFERATION 
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
(GC(41)/17, GC(41)/33 and Add. 13) 


40. The PRESIDENT recalled that the item had been included in the agenda 
pursuant to resolution GC(40)/RES/4, which had been adopted by the General Conference 
in 1996. 
41. Since then, the Director General had periodically reported to the Board on the 
implementation of safeguards in the DPRK and had submitted to the Conference 
document GC(41)/17, which summarized the developments over the past year. The 
Conference also had before it a draft resolution on the subject (GC(41)/33 and Add. 13). 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 11 


42. Mr. MACKINNON (Canada), introducing the draft resolution, said that the 
Director General's report in document GC(41)/17 made it clear that the DPRK was still not 
complying with its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency. That fact 
continued to cause considerable concern to the international community, particularly 
bearing in mind the fundamental difference of view between the Agency and the DPRK 
regarding the current status of the safeguards agreement and taking into account the lack of 
progress in the technical discussions between the Agency and the DPRK. 
43. The draft resolution registered the sponsors' concern and called on the DPRK to 
comply fully with its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
44. Mr. SeungKon 
LEE (Republic of Korea) said that the DPRK nuclear issue 
had been on the Agency's agenda for five years. In 1996, the General Conference had 
adopted, with overwhelming support, a resolution expressing concern over the DPRK's 
continuing noncompliance 
with its safeguards agreement and urging that country to 
cooperate 
fully with the Agency. Since then, the Secretariat had tried to resolve that 
longstanding 
issue. However, as indicated in the Director General's report, no solution 
was yet in sight. His country was very disappointed that no progress had been made on 
most of the fundamental issues, including measures to preserve information about past 
history, in the two rounds of technical discussions with the DPRK held during the past 
year. 
45. The DPRK contended that it was not bound by its safeguards agreement in view of 
its special status and insisted that the nuclear issue could be resolved only through the 
Agreed Framework. However, the Agreed Framework was not a substitute for the 
safeguards agreement, which remained binding and in force. Even under the Agreed 
Framework, key components of light water reactors would be delivered to the DPRK only 
after verification by the Agency of its past history. Considerable efforts were being made 
to implement the Agreed Framework, and the DPRK should make corresponding efforts to 
implement its safeguards agreement. It should stop resorting to delaying tactics. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 12 


46. Given that the DPRK continued to defy the General Conference, he felt that the 
international community should take a firm stance against it. The DPRK's persistent 
noncompliance 
with its safeguards agreement was a serious challenge to the Agency's 
safeguards system as a whole. If the Agency kept silent, its authority as the international 
organization responsible for verifying nonproliferation 
commitments would eventually be 
undermined. At the very least, the General Conference should point out that the DPRK 
was still not complying with its safeguards agreement and should call upon it once again to 
do so. 
47. Mr. SNYDER (United States of America) said that his Government strongly 
supported the efforts of the Director General and of the Secretariat to implement safeguards 
fully in the DPRK and to monitor the freeze on the DPRK's nuclear facilities pursuant to 
the Agreed Framework. For almost three years, the Agreed Framework had proved to be 
an important mechanism for ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. Nuclear 
facilities in the DPRK had been frozen since 1994, and Agency inspectors had maintained a 
continuous presence in the DPRK, monitoring that freeze. Under the Agency's 
supervision, experts from the United States and the DPRK had successfully canned and 
safely stored approximately 90% of the DPRK's spent nuclear fuel. Following the groundbreaking 
ceremony for the LWR project on 19 August 1997, the United States expected the 
DPRK to agree to formal talks with the Agency. For its part, the United States remained 
fully committed to the Agreed Framework and would continue to fulfil its obligations under 
it. It expected the same from the DPRK. 
48. The United States was deeply concerned about Agency reports on the continued lack 
of cooperation 
by the DPRK with freezemonitoring 
activities and the absence of tangible 
steps by the DPRK to preserve information related to its past nuclear activities. It was 
disappointed that the three rounds of technical discussions held in 1996 and the meeting in 
January 1997 on outstanding safeguards issues had all failed to make significant progress. 
Under the terms of the Agreed Framework, before key reactor components were delivered, 
the DPRK had to take all steps deemed necessary by the Agency to verify the accuracy and 
completeness of its initial report on all nuclear materials in the DPRK. Although it would 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 13 


be several years before such components were delivered, that did not mean that nothing 
could or should be done by the two sides now. While considerable progress had been made 
on other aspects of implementing the Agreed Framework, little progress had been made in 
talks between the Agency and the DPRK on the establishment of procedures and 
understandings necessary for preserving history, which was essential to enable the Agency 
to verify DPRK's initial report smoothly and expeditiously when the proper time came. 


49. Mr. IKEDA (Japan), stressing that the safeguards agreement with the DPRK 
remained in force and binding, commended the Agency's continued efforts to implement 
safeguards measures and to monitor the freeze in the DPRK as requested by the Security 
Council. In view of the absence of progress and as outstanding issues still had to be 
resolved, urgent measures needed to be taken to preserve the information required to verify 
the correctness and completeness of the DPRK's initial declaration under the safeguards 
agreement. Japan therefore called upon the DPRK to cooperate 
fully in order to facilitate 
the Agency's efforts and renewed its request for the Agency to continue its efforts to 
resolve all outstanding issues and to keep the Board informed of future developments. 
50. Mr. HUANG Oitao (China) requested a vote by show of hands on the draft 
resolution. 
51. There were 77 votes in favour and none against, with 10 abstentions. The draft 
resolution was adopted. 
52. Mr. HUANG Qitao (China) said his delegation had abstained during the 
voting because it believed in negotiation and cooperation 
and did not think that a draft 
resolution was an appropriate mechanism for seeking a solution to the problem. 
Furthermore, his delegation could not agree to some parts of the draft resolution. 
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITEDRESOLUTIONS RELATING TO IRAQ 
(GC(41)/20 and 35) 
NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL 
53. The PRESIDENT noted that, pursuant to paragraph 8 of resolution 
GC(40)/RES/21, the Director General had submitted a report, contained in 



GC(41)/OR.9 
page 14 


document GC(41)/20, on his efforts to implement Security Council resolutions 687, 707 
and 715 relating to Iraq. The matter had been considered by the Board of Governors in 
June 1997 on the basis of the Director General's report. The Conference had before it, in 
document GC(41)/35, a draft resolution submitted by a number of Member States. 


54. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg), speaking on behalf of the European Union 
and the other sponsors of the draft resolution, said that the preambular paragraphs outlined 
some important developments over the past year. Notwithstanding the unconditional 
reaffirmation by the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq's obligations under the NPT 
and commitment to full compliance with its safeguards agreement with the Agency and the 
progress made with the Action Team's review of Iraq's Full, Final and Complete 
Declaration and with respect to the content and accuracy of Iraq's sixmonthly 
declarations 
under the Ongoing Monitoring and Verification Plan, there were also some worrying 
developments: Iraq had obstructed aircraft used by the Agency and failed to provide the 
Action Team with all the information it had requested. 
55. The operative paragraphs indicated the General Conference's appreciation of and 
support for the efforts of the Director General and his Action Team to fulfil their mandate 
under the relevant Security Council resolutions and indicated in clear terms what was 
required of Iraq: full cooperation 
and the handing over of all currently undisclosed 
nuclearweapons 
related information, materials and equipment. The sponsors believed that 
the draft resolution was a balanced reflection of recent events and a clear indication of the 
world community's expectations and aspirations for the coming months. 
56. Mr. FARIS HUSSAIN (Iraq) said his delegation opposed the draft resolution 
in document GC(41)/35 because it did not reflect the actual course of events since 
September 1996. If one looked carefully at the previous year's resolution 
(GC(40)/RES/21), one could see that Iraq had fully implemented it, even though it had 
rejected the text because it had not reflected the actual circumstances at that time. 
57. Preambular paragraph (h) was not correct, since the requests made by the Action 
Team had in fact been met. Those requests had been submitted to the Iraqi delegation on 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 15 


26 September 1997, and within five days, on 1 October 1997, the details requested had 
been provided. 


58. Referring to paragraph 4 of the draft resolution, he said seven years had elapsed 
since the Agency's teams had begun their verification activities of Iraq's former nuclear 
programme. The Agency was fully acquainted with all aspects of that programme, but had 
now turned its attention to secondary issues of slight importance in an attempt to postpone 
its final decision. 
59. With regard to paragraph 5 of the draft resolution, he stressed that Iraq had fully 
and frankly cooperated 
with the Action Team. There was no reason for Iraq to continue to 
hold back information or decline to cooperate 
with the Action Team. He therefore called 
on the General Conference to ask the Agency's Action Team to clarify the areas in which 
Iraq was not cooperating 
with it and to explain their relevance in the context of the 
relevant Security Council resolution. 
60. With regard to paragraph 6, there was no remaining equipment, material or 
information related to Iraq's former nuclear programme that had not been handed over or 
disclosed to the Agency. The Action Team had asked the Iraqi side to investigate the 
remains of destroyed materials and the Iraqi side had made available the required materials. 
61. The draft resolution was a reflection of the report contained in document GC(41)/20 
and of the Director General's statement to the General Conference. The report had omitted 
certain extremely important facts such as Iraq's constructive cooperation 
with the Agency 
and the lack of any trace of prohibited materials or activities in Iraq. It had also failed to 
mention the extent to which the Agency had fulfilled its mandate with respect to Iraq. He 
could only conclude that the objective was to maintain the status quo despite all efforts, 
progress, openness and cooperation 
on the part of Iraq. He urged the Conference not to 
adopt what was a biased and unfair draft resolution prepared under the influence of 
wellknown 
political pressures and designed to prolong the sanctions regime and the 
starvation of the people of Iraq. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 16 


62. He proposed four amendments to the draft resolution. Firstly, to add the words "in 
February and July 1997" at the end of preambular paragraph (e). Secondly, to amend the 
words "that Iraq has still not provided" in preambular paragraph (h) to read "that Iraq may 
still not have provided". Thirdly, to add the following phrase to operative paragraph 1: 
"with a view to the finalization of activities under resolutions 687 and 707 and after such 
finalization to discharge their responsibility based on the monitoring mechanism under 
resolution 1051". Lastly, he proposed that operative paragraph 5 be deleted. 
63. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) requested a suspension of the meeting to 
consider the amendments proposed by Iraq. 
64. It was so agreed. 
The meeting was suspended at 11.30 a.m. and resumed at 11.55 a.m. 


65. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) said that the amendments proposed by Iraq 
were unacceptable: preambular paragraph (e) dealt with a matter of principle Iraq 
had 
itself admitted to having caused obstruction on two occasions and it was well known that 
obstruction had occurred on other occasions; the current text of preambular paragraph (h) 
reflected the facts of the matter and could not be changed; with regard to operative 
paragraph 1, the extent to which the Agency could be said to have completed the work 
prescribed by the Security Council was a matter for the latter and only the latter to 
determine; lastly, the proposed deletion of paragraph 5 was unacceptable since that 
paragraph was central to the Security Council's requirements. 
66. Mr. TWAL (Jordan) said that, as a matter of principle, Jordan had always 
urged Iraq to implement the Security Council resolutions and to collaborate with the parties 
concerned. He understood that the purpose of the draft resolution before the Conference 
was to compel Iraq to comply fully with those resolutions. It would therefore be helpful if 
details were given of all cases in which Iraq had failed to cooperate. 
For example, if it 
had obstructed flights by the inspection teams, specific details of the circumstances should 
be provided. If more materials and information were necessary, their exact nature should 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 17 


also be specified. He therefore urged the Conference to give sympathetic consideration to 
the amendments proposed by Iraq. 


67. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to Rule 76 of the Rules of Procedures, 
the Conference had to vote on each of the four amendments proposed by Iraq before voting 
on the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/35. He accordingly asked those 
present to vote by a show of hands on Iraq's first proposed amendment concerning the 
wording of preambular paragraph (e). 
68. There was 1 vote in favour and 63 against, with 16 abstentions. The proposal was 
rejected. 
69. The PRESIDENT then asked those present to vote on the second proposed 
amendment concerning the wording of preambular paragraph (h). 
70. There was 1 vote in favour and 64 against, with 16 abstentions. The proposal was 
rejected. 
71. The PRESIDENT next invited those present to vote on the third proposed 
amendment concerning the wording of operative paragraph 1. 
72. There was 1 vote in favour and 65 against, with 15 abstentions. The proposal was 
rejected. 
73. The PRESIDENT lastly invited those present to vote on the fourth proposed 
amendment, namely that operative paragraph 5 be deleted. 
74. There was no vote in favour and 71 against, with 10 abstentions. The proposal was 
rejected. 
75. The PRESIDENT then asked whether the Conference was prepared to adopt 
the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/35 without a vote. 
76. Mr. FARIS HUSSAIN (Iraq), expressing regret that the proposed 
amendments had been rejected, proposed that the whole draft resolution be put to the vote 
by a show of hands. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 18 


77. Mr. SANTER (Luxembourg) requested a rollcall 
vote. 
78. The PRESIDENT invited the General Conference to proceed to a rollcall 
vote on the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/35, as requested by the 
delegation of Luxembourg. 
79. Albania, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
80. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, 
Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, 
France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, 
Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, 
Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, 
Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, 
Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri 
Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, 
Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United 
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay, 
Venezuela, Yemen. 


Abstaining: Algeria, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belarus, China, Cuba, 
Ethiopia, India, Jordan, Malaysia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
Russian Federation, Viet Nam. 


81. The draft resolution was adopted by 75 votes to zero, with 15 abstentions. 
82. Mr. TWAL (Jordan) said that although his country supported a number of 
points contained in the draft resolution, it had abstained in the rollcall 
vote on 
humanitarian grounds as it could not endorse a resolution which extended the application of 
the sanctions and would ultimately lead to greater suffering for the people of Iraq, 
particularly its children. 
83. Mr. FARIS HUSSAIN (Iraq) said that his delegation regretted the adoption 
of the draft resolution, which did not accurately reflect the situation as far as Iraq's 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 19 


cooperation 
with the Agency was concerned, and which would extend the embargo that 
had been imposed on Iraq for seven years. Furthermore, it would lead to the loss of even 
more lives; that humanitarian responsibility was one which the General Conference would 
have to bear. 


APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(GC(41)/16, 34 and 47) 


84. The PRESIDENT said that he understood that extensive consultations were 
still in progress and suggested that consideration of the item be deferred to the afternoon 
meeting. 
85. It was so agreed. 
EXAMINATION OF DELEGATES' CREDENTIALS 
(GC(41)/29 and 41) 


86. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met to examine the 
credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. The 
Committee's report was contained in document GC(41)/41. The Committee recommended 
that the Conference adopt the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of the report. Since 
the Committee's meeting, credentials in proper form had been received by the Director 
General in respect of the delegates of Lebanon, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia and the United 
Arab Emirates. 
87. Mr. KAREM (Egypt) said that Egypt's acceptance of Israel's credentials did 
not imply its acceptance of Israel's illegal annexation of territories, particularly the Golan 
Heights and Jerusalem. In Egypt's view, the State of Israel was limited by the boundaries 
of 5 June 1967 and the frontiers specified in the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. 
88. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), speaking on behalf of the 
delegations of the Arab States participating in the Conference, read out the statement made 
by those delegations concerning their reservations about the credentials submitted by the 
Israeli delegation reproduced in document GC(41)/29. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 20 


89. Mr. AYATOLLAHI (Islamic Republic of Iran), having endorsed the 
statement made by the previous speaker, reiterated the fact that his country's acceptance of 
the General Committee's report in no way implied its recognition of the Israeli regime. 
90. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt 
the draft resolution contained in document GC(41)/41. 
91. It was so decided. 
ELECTIONS TO THE AGENCY'S STAFF PENSION COMMITTEE 


92. The PRESIDENT recalled that the General Conference was represented on 
the Agency's Staff Pension Committee by two members Mr. 
Pecsteen of Belgium and 
Mr. Servigon of the Philippines and 
two alternates Mr. 
Arrouchi of Morocco and 
Mr. Herrera Andrade of Mexico. 
93. Since Mr. Servigon had left Vienna and was no longer available to serve on the 
Committee, he proposed that Mr. Arrouchi of Morocco be elected as a member, and 
Mr. Raja Adnan of Malaysia be elected as an alternate member. He added that those names 
had been the subject of informal consultations. 
94. Mr. Arrouchi was elected as a member and Mr. Raja Adnan was elected as an 
alternate member to represent the General Conference on the Agency's Staff Pension 
Committee. 
REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED TO THE TECHNICAL COOPERATION 
FUND FOR 1998 
(GC(41)/27/Rev.4) 


95. The PRESIDENT, drawing attention to document GC(41)/27/Rev.4, said 
that by 7 p.m. on 2 October 1997, the contributions pledged by Member States to the 
Technical Cooperation 
Fund for 1998 had reached a total of US $9 285 880. Since then, 
$100 000 had been pledged by Greece and $7150 had been pledged by Uganda, bringing 
the total amount pledged to $9 393 030, which represented only 13% of the target. 

GC(41)/OR.9 
page 21 


96. He urged those delegations that had not yet done so to make their 1998 pledges and 
to pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity so that the Secretariat could 
submit the 1998 programme to the forthcoming Technical Assistance and Cooperation 
Committee meeting based upon reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement 
the approved programme without hindrance or uncertainty. 
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.
