Â Opening of the session 
1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the 54th regular session of the General 
Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, she invited the 
delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 
3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that she had tried her best, during her tenure as President 
of the 53rd session of the General Conference, to work constructively with regional groups, national 
delegations and the Secretariat, encouraging dialogue and focusing on the resolutions before the 
Conference. The discussion on many of the issues had been brought to a constructive conclusion and 
exchanges of opinions on the more controversial issues had led in most cases to an acceptable result. 
She regretted, however, that the Conference had been unable to produce a consensual outcome on the 
Middle East issues. 
4. She warmly thanked delegations for their engagement and collaboration and the Secretariat for 
its logistical, policy and moral support. It had often been necessary to compromise on difficult issues 
and she had sometimes stumbled over arcane Conference principles and procedures, but if her 
Presidency had proven successful, Member States and the Secretariat were central to that success. 
5. The international environment had changed dramatically since the preceding session of the 
General Conference. The many positive developments in that time pointed to an increased willingness 
to move forward on disarmament and non-proliferation. The Agency had featured prominently at the 
2010 NPT Review Conference and the resulting agreed action plan highlighted its important role in 
disarmament and non-proliferation. One important outcome of the Review Conference had been the 
reaffirmation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East and the agreement to convene a conference in 
2012 to discuss its implementation. That agreement represented the best opportunity in recent years to 
move forward in the Middle East peace process and to establish a regional zone free of nuclear 
weapons and other WMD. The General Conference should support the initiative and refrain from 
hindering the process or creating roadblocks that would make the dream of such a region more 
difficult to realize. 
1. Election of officers and appointment of the General 
Committee 
6. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President of the 
Conference. 
7. Mr NAKANE (Japan), speaking on behalf of the Far East Group, proposed Mr Enkhsaikhan 
(Mongolia). 
8. Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia) was elected President by acclamation. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 2 
9. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr Enkhsaikhan on his election and wished 
him every success in his task. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia) took the Chair. 
10. The PRESIDENT said that his election was a great honour which he viewed as an expression of 
Member StatesÂ appreciation for his countryÂs constructive policy aimed at contributing to the 
attainment of the AgencyÂs goals. He thanked the Temporary President for her contribution to the 
successful outcome of the 53rd regular session of the General Conference. 
11. With further advances in science and technology, the Agency was becoming one of the most 
important forums for international cooperation aimed at achieving the combined goals of freedom 
from fear and freedom from want. The former goal was reflected in the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure that 
nuclear energy was used for peaceful purposes only. As the renewed interest in nuclear energy placed 
additional responsibility on the Agency, it was unsurprising that the 2010 NPT Review Conference 
had expressed its full support for the AgencyÂs activities in its Final Document. The positive 
momentum of the Review Conference should be maintained by the General Conference, including 
through its promotion of the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. A special effort should be 
made to contribute to the preparations for the 2012 conference on that subject. 
12. The Agency also had enormous potential for contributing to the goal of freedom from want, 
including through cancer prevention. Over 20 million people were living with cancer and almost 
everyone was affected by the disease in some way. However, thanks to nuclear science and 
technology, cancer was becoming increasingly preventable and treatable. He thanked the Director 
General for maintaining the AgencyÂs focus on that issue and dedicating the 2010 Scientific Forum to 
cancer control in developing countries. 
13. The achievement of the MDGs depended to some extent on wider application of nuclear energy 
and technology. The Agency could make an important contribution to food security through mutation 
breeding, crop improvement, livestock production, and soil, water and fertilizer management. He 
welcomed the start of construction of improved facilities at the AgencyÂs Seibersdorf laboratories that 
would enable timely and accurate isotope analysis of particles. It was to be hoped that further 
modernization of the laboratories would allow improved implementation of programmes in the vital 
areas of human health, food and agriculture, industrial applications and the environment so as to better 
serve Member States, especially developing countries. 
14. Having served for two years as MongoliaÂs Resident Representative to the Agency, he had 
become fully aware of the AgencyÂs enormous potential and had forged strong links with his 
diplomatic colleagues and the Secretariat. He knew that he could count on their support in ensuring a 
smooth, efficient and productive session of the General Conference. He would consult closely with 
Member States and regional and other groups to achieve that goal. 
15. He drew attention to the fact that a High-level Plenary Meeting of the UN General Assembly on 
the MDGs was being held from 20 to 22 September 2010 with a view to accelerating progress towards 
achievement of the Goals, including Goal 6 on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. 
Bearing in mind the importance of fighting cancer, he had undertaken consultations with the 
chairpersons of regional groups and some delegates, who had encouraged him to send the following 
message to the High-level Plenary Meeting: 
ÂThere is a growing awareness among the IAEA Member States about the enormous magnitude 
of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) globally and particularly in developing countries, 
which kill more than twice as many people as tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria combined. 
Within the NCDs, the burden posed by cancer needs special attention due to its large incidence, 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 3 
mortality and the often excessive cost and complexity of its treatment, involving surgery, 
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Once known as the disease of the rich, today most new cancer 
cases are diagnosed in the developing world where access to cancer diagnosis and treatment is 
very limited. The IAEA plays an important role in supporting its Member StatesÂ efforts in 
fighting cancer through its radiation medicine programme. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) and the IAEA with their mandates on public health and radiation medicine have 
established a Joint Programme on Cancer Control and are working together through the IAEAÂs 
Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) to place cancer on the global agenda. 
ÂThe IAEA General Conference wishes to express its full support to the discussions of the 
UN-MDG High-level Plenary Meeting, and, in particular, strongly endorses the actions 
proposed by WHO in preparing for the next High-level Meeting planned in September 2011 at 
the UN Headquarters in New York. The Conference firmly believes that the support of the 
world leaders and the UN system is crucial to enhance the focus on the impact of cancer and 
other NCDs across the developing world. This must be followed by sustained action at the 
highest levels in Member States with support from WHO and the IAEA, and other key 
organizations, to develop the necessary infrastructure and capacity in developing countries to 
end the growing disparity in cancer survival between rich and poor countries and help save 
millions of lives.Â 
16. He took it that the Conference accepted the proposal to send the message to the High-level 
Plenary Meeting. 
17. It was so decided.2 
18. The PRESIDENT recalled that, pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the 
Conference had to elect 8 Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and 
5 additional members of the General Committee, resulting in a General Committee of 15 with himself 
as its Chairperson. However, he proposed that in the current session the General Committee should be 
composed of 16 members, consisting of 8 Vice-Presidents and 6 additional members, so that the area 
of the Far East, in addition to providing the President of the Conference, could also have a 
Vice-President. That would involve suspension of Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure of the 
General Conference, as had been done in comparable situations in the past. 
19. It was so agreed. 
20. He proposed that the delegates of Canada, China, Ecuador, France, Indonesia, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Russian Federation and South Africa be elected as Vice-Presidents, that 
Mr GarcÃ­a Revilla (Peru) be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and that the 
delegates of Kenya, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia and Sri Lanka be elected as 
additional members of the General Committee. 
21. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
22. He further proposed that the General Conference deal with items 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of its 
provisional agenda, in that order, pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation on the 
agenda. 
23. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted.

2. Applications for membership of the Agency 
(GC(54)/17) 
24. The PRESIDENT drew attention to document GC(54)/17 containing an application for 
membership by the Kingdom of Swaziland. The application had been endorsed by the Board of 
Governors, which had also submitted, in the same document, a draft resolution for adoption by the 
General Conference. 
25. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution. 
26. It was so decided. 
27. Ms DLAMINI (Swaziland), speaking under Rule 30, conveyed her countryÂs deep gratitude to 
the General Conference for accepting its application for membership of the Agency. She also 
expressed appreciation for the SecretariatÂs dedication and diligence. 
28. Her Government was deeply committed to the AgencyÂs work and ethics. It looked forward to 
contributing to all its activities and to a fruitful partnership with other Member States. 
3. Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
29. Mr DUARTE (United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs) read out the 
following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my greetings to the fifty-fourth session of the General Conference of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. I congratulate Director General Amano on his successful 
first year in office. 
ÂThis has been a year of serious efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, and these included the NPT 
Review Conference in New York, the Washington summit on nuclear security and the 
agreement by Russia and the United States on a new START treaty. For my part, during my 
visits to the nuclear testing site at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan and then to Nagasaki and to 
Hiroshima, I was personally moved by the yearning of many millions of people for a 
nuclear-weapon-free world. 
ÂThe IAEAÂs technical expertise will be of vital importance as we seek practical solutions to 
obstacles on the road to global zero. The Agency has continued the constructive work to 
advance non-proliferation and to enhance nuclear safety and security. It has also undertaken 
fruitful efforts to promote the implementation of the additional protocol. I also welcome our 
close partnership in the Security Council committees on terrorism and on nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
ÂWith respect to nuclear security, the Washington summit endorsed a strong role for the IAEA, 
while underscoring the fundamental responsibility of Governments. I call on all States that have 
not yet signed and ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism to do so immediately. 
ÂThis has also been another year of active IAEA efforts to promote peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Here too the United Nations and the IAEA are pursuing similar goals, as shown by our 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 5 
work in the inter-Agency UN energy mechanism. It was in this spirit of mutual cooperation that 
last January I organized the first ever joint meeting of the heads of the United Nations, the 
IAEA, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Preparatory 
Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. I have also invited 
the IAEA to participate in the forthcoming High-Level Meeting of the United Nations on 
Revitalizing the Work of the Conference on Disarmament and Taking Forward Multilateral 
Disarmament Negotiations. 
ÂLooking ahead, the IAEA is also well placed to help explore the technical, legal and political 
aspects of a nuclear weapons convention. The international community must build on the 
positive momentum that has been generated and I look forward to working with you across this 
agenda. 
ÂPlease accept my best wishes for a successful conference.Â 
4. Statement by the Director General 
30. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that pursuing multiple objectives in regard to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
including technical cooperation, in a balanced manner had been a constant theme of his first ten 
months in office. He was trying to change the widespread perception of the Agency as simply the 
worldÂs Ânuclear watchdogÂ, which did not do justice to its extensive activities in other areas, 
especially in nuclear energy, nuclear applications and technical cooperation. The focus in 2010 was on 
cancer, which was the subject of that yearÂs Scientific Forum. 
31. The growing importance of nuclear energy had had a significant impact on the AgencyÂs work 
in recent years, leading to a stronger focus on the needs of newcomer countries. In March 2010, he had 
addressed the International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy in Paris, where he had 
expressed his conviction that access to nuclear power should not be limited to developed countries but 
should be available to developing countries as well. The Conference had illustrated the growing 
international interest in nuclear power as a clean and stable source of energy that could help mitigate 
the impact of climate change. 
32. The Agency had entered a new era with around 60 countries considering the introduction of 
nuclear energy and between 10 and 25 new countries expected to bring their first nuclear power plants 
on line by 2030. Many of the countries that already had nuclear power were planning or building new 
reactors or extending the operational life of existing reactors. 
33. While it was up to Member States to decide whether or not to opt for nuclear power, the Agency 
had a key role to play in ensuring that the expansion of nuclear power took place in an efficient, 
responsible and sustainable manner. When countries expressed an interest in introducing nuclear 
power, the Agency offered advice on how to put the appropriate legal and regulatory framework in 
place and how to ensure the highest standards of safety and security, without increasing proliferation 
risks. It was able to offer independent know-how on the construction, commissioning, start-up and 
operation of nuclear reactors, with a view to enabling countries to introduce nuclear power 
knowledgeably and profitably. 
34. The Agency should continue to respond to the needs of countries which were considering 
introducing nuclear power. Since he had taken office, new staff posts had been created and cost-free 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 6 
experts taken on in order to strengthen assistance to such countries. In parallel, the Agency would 
continue to assist countries that were expanding existing nuclear power programmes through the 
construction of new reactors and the life extension of existing reactors. 
35. He intended to encourage international lending institutions to be more open to supporting 
nuclear power projects, bearing in mind that a large number of countries recognized nuclear energy as 
a stable and clean source of energy which they might wish to include in their energy mix. 
36. The Agency should further encourage a proper appreciation of the benefits of nuclear power in 
helping to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, which was widely recognized to be one of 
the most important items on the global agenda. Such benefits therefore deserved wider recognition in 
the discussions at relevant international forums such as those related to the Kyoto Protocol. 
37. The AgencyÂs activities in sharing best practices and disseminating information on waste 
management and disposal should be expanded. Waste disposal remained an important challenge that 
needed to be addressed in a safe and sustainable manner by newcomers and established users alike. 
38. The Secretariat would also continue to stress the importance of the AgencyÂs work as a catalyst 
for innovation, for example through INPRO, which brought together technology holders and users so 
that they could consider together the action needed to achieve innovation. He congratulated all 
involved in INPRO as it celebrated its tenth anniversary. 
39. Discussions had been taking place for some time on possible measures to ensure reliable 
supplies of nuclear fuel. In March 2010, with the approval of the Board of Governors, he had signed 
an agreement with the Russian Federation to establish an LEU reserve that would help assure nuclear 
fuel supplies to Member States. While views clearly differed among Member States, all agreed that the 
issue needed to be discussed further. The Agency was the appropriate forum for such consultations 
and he encouraged Member States to find suitable ways of dealing with the issue. The Secretariat 
stood ready to provide any assistance required. 
40. Turning to nuclear applications, he said that he was aware of the importance many Member 
States attached to the AgencyÂs work in areas such as health care and nutrition, food security, the 
environment, and water resource management. He had made the issue of cancer in developing 
countries a high priority for his first year in office. In developing countries, some 665 people died of 
cancer every hour: nearly three times as many as in developed countries. Around 70% of cancers in 
developing countries were diagnosed too late for life-saving treatment and many low-income countries 
did not have a single radiation therapy machine. Treatment that could slow, or even eradicate, cancer 
was often simply not available and millions of people who could be successfully treated died every 
year. Since 1980, the Agency had delivered over US $220 million worth of cancer-related assistance 
to developing countries. He wanted to build on those efforts in subsequent years. 
41. Over the coming year, the Agency also aimed to establish a strong link between its own 
education curricula in radiation medicine and the professional competencies needed for 
capacity-building in Member States. A new human health e-learning website providing resources for 
health professionals who delivered radiation medicine would be launched in October 2010. 
42. The availability of water for sustainable development was a growing concern. As Member 
States made increased efforts to address the challenge, they needed better scientific knowledge of their 
water resources Â an area where nuclear technology could be very useful. The Agency had initiated a 
new Water Availability Enhancement Project aimed at helping Member States to acquire such 
knowledge. 
43. In July 2010, he had visited the AgencyÂs Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco where he 
had met Prince Albert, who had been an outstanding partner for the Agency. The work of the 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 7 
Laboratory was vital to help protect the worldÂs greatest natural resource: its oceans and seas. 
Hundreds of scientists from all over the world had been trained by the Agency in advanced methods 
for assessing marine radioactivity, isotopes and pollution. Demand for those unique Agency services 
would continue to grow. A recent reorganization of the Laboratory would allow it to meet the needs of 
Member States even more effectively in the future. 
44. In all those areas, the Agency was working with others, strengthening existing partnerships Â 
for example with WHO and FAO Â and building new ones. 
45. Turning to nuclear safety and security, he said that the safety performance of the nuclear 
industry had improved significantly since the Chernobyl disaster nearly 25 years previously, including 
through improved design, better operating procedures, a strengthened and more effective regulatory 
environment, and the emergence of a strong safety culture. While it was the responsibility of Member 
States to ensure safety, the Agency would continue to promote an integrated safety approach focusing 
on management systems, effective leadership and safety culture. The Agency would also help 
maintain a high level of nuclear safety by promoting international cooperation, providing review 
services to Member States, and supporting knowledge networks and training. There was already 
widespread international support for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. The adoption 
and implementation of the Code of Conduct by many States in cooperation with the Agency had 
produced significant improvements in regulatory infrastructure and capabilities in relation to 
radioactive sources. 
46. Another important challenge faced by the Agency was the improvement of safety infrastructures 
surrounding the medical use of radiation. As medical technology using ionizing radiation continued to 
evolve and new technology and techniques were introduced globally, including in developing 
countries, it was important that countriesÂ safety and security infrastructures kept pace with 
developments. 
47. Effective national and global response capabilities were essential to minimize the impact of 
nuclear and radiological incidents and emergencies and to build public trust in the safety and security 
of nuclear technology. The AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre was the global focal point for 
international preparedness for and response to nuclear and radiological safety or security related 
incidents. The CentreÂs infrastructure would be further enhanced in the subsequent year. The Agency 
continued to assist Member States in developing sustainable nuclear security capacities, while 
recognizing that nuclear security was the responsibility of Member States. 
48. In April 2010, he had attended the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, which had been 
hosted by the President of the United States of America and attended by leaders from 47 countries. 
The participating Heads of State and Government had reaffirmed the essential role of the Agency in 
the international nuclear security framework and had pledged to ensure that it would have the 
resources required to discharge its functions. 
49. Although adherence to the relevant international legal instruments on nuclear security had 
increased gradually, progress towards entry into force of the amendment to the CPPNM remained 
slow. As it had been five years since its adoption, he called on parties to the Convention to work 
towards accelerating the entry into force of the amendment. 
50. He took great pride in the fact that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were making a 
real difference to the lives of many people in developing countries: the farmer in the Andes in Peru 
who could grow enough crops to feed his family and sell food at the market, thanks to nuclear 
techniques to boost crop yields in harsh environments; the child in Zanzibar who had milk to drink 
because the cows were not getting sick, thanks to the AgencyÂs work to deploy the sterile insect 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 8 
technique which had helped to eliminate the tsetse fly; and the cancer patients in many developing 
countries whose disease had been diagnosed in time for treatment, thanks to the AgencyÂs assistance. 
51. New resources for the technical cooperation programme as a whole had risen to $112.2 million 
in 2009 from $91.5 million in 2008. Human health remained the largest area of activity, followed by 
nuclear safety, and food and agriculture. He welcomed the prospect of increased funding for 
footnote-a/ projects in the subsequent five years through the $50 million contribution announced by 
the United States of America to the AgencyÂs Peaceful Uses Initiative. He invited other Member States 
that were able to contribute to match that commitment. 
52. Capacity-building was at the heart of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation work. The ultimate 
goal was to make countries self-sufficient and to help them establish or maintain a sustainable, highly 
specialized and trained human resource base in all areas of nuclear sciences and applications. The 
Agency helped Member States to build the capacity to plan and introduce nuclear power and provided 
assistance to countries with existing plants to strengthen their capacities for training and management, 
long-term operation, and lifetime planning for more efficient decommissioning. In the human health 
area, the Agency had enabled countries to establish safe and effective radiotherapy capabilities and to 
provide higher quality treatment to cancer patients. Together with its partners at the FAO, it was 
helping countries to build up their expertise in food irradiation so that they could improve both the 
safety and quality of food and increase their exports. 
53. At the start of his term in office, he had expressed the hope that the milestone of 100 additional 
protocols in force would be achieved at an early date. The number at present stood at 102, which was 
an encouraging development. The additional protocol was an essential tool for the Agency to be able 
to provide credible assurance not only that declared nuclear material was not being diverted from 
peaceful uses, but also that there were no undeclared nuclear materials and activities in States with 
comprehensive safeguards agreements. He strongly hoped that all those States that had not done so 
would conclude additional protocols as early as possible. He also asked the 18 States without NPT 
safeguards agreements in force to bring such agreements into force without delay. He called on States 
with small quantities protocols that had not done so to amend Â or rescind Â their protocols. 
54. The Secretariat had realigned the management of the AgencyÂs laboratories, creating a new 
Office of Safeguards Analytical Services within the Department of Safeguards. Construction of the 
clean laboratory extension at Seibersdorf had started in June 2010. The ultra-sensitive mass 
spectrometer had been procured and the first factory tests had been completed successfully. Agency 
staff were currently undergoing training and the new clean laboratory was expected to be fully 
operational in the first half of 2011. The Agency hoped to award a construction contract for the 
nuclear material laboratory in December so work could start in July 2011. Despite extrabudgetary 
contributions by several Member States, for which he was deeply grateful, additional funding was still 
required to complete the project. 
55. In order to enhance understanding of future verification challenges, the Agency would host its 
traditional international safeguards symposium in November 2010. The event would bring together 
technical experts from the Agency, Member States, the nuclear industry and other bodies to share 
information and exchange views on the best technical responses to the changes taking place in the 
field of nuclear verification. 
56. He had continued to report regularly to the Board on implementation of Agency safeguards, 
including in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic. His basic approach had been 
that all safeguards agreements between Member States and the Agency, along with other relevant 
obligations, should be implemented fully. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 9 
57. The nuclear programme of the DPRK remained a matter of serious concern. As Agency 
inspectors had not been in the country since April 2009, he had nothing new to report. The DPRK had 
not permitted the Agency to implement safeguards in the country since December 2002 and it had not 
implemented the relevant measures called for in UN Security Council resolutions 1718 (2006) and 
1874 (2009). He reiterated his call on all parties concerned to make concerted efforts for a resumption 
of the six-party talks at an appropriate time. 
58. Regarding General Conference resolution GC(53)/RES/16 on the application of full-scope 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East, and on the development of model 
safeguards agreements as a necessary step towards establishing a NWFZ in the region, he regretted to 
report that no progress had been achieved. Nor was there any convergence of views among Member 
States on convening a forum on the relevance of the experience of existing NWFZs for establishing 
such a zone in the Middle East. He would continue his consultations with concerned Member States in 
that regard. 
59. Pursuant to the mandate conferred on him by resolution GC(53)/RES/17 on Israeli nuclear 
capabilities, he had sought the views of all Member States, and had received 44 replies from 
governments and from the High Representative of the European Union. He had also held consultations 
with representatives of concerned Member States, especially those in the Middle East. In August 2010, 
he had visited Israel where, at the highest political level, he had conveyed the General ConferenceÂs 
concern about the countryÂs nuclear capabilities and had invited Israel to consider acceding to the NPT 
and placing all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. As requested by the 
General Conference, he had submitted a report on the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities. 
60. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had endorsed the convening of a conference in 2012, to be 
attended by all States of the Middle East, on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and 
all other WMDs in that region. Having been personally involved in the NPT process since 1995, he 
had been pleased that the 2010 Review Conference had produced concrete results. He hoped that the 
proposed 2012 conference would take place with the participation of all relevant States and lead to a 
productive outcome. 
61. Credible verification systems were vital for further nuclear disarmament efforts. Through its 
verification activities, the Agency could make an important contribution to the implementation of 
nuclear disarmament. The Agency had recently received a joint letter from Russia and the United 
States requesting assistance to verify independently the implementation of their agreement on the 
disposition of plutonium no longer required for defence purposes. 
62. He stressed the importance of continuing to enhance the quality of management in the Agency 
and defining clearer priorities so as to make maximum use of available resources. For enhanced 
management efficiency and transparency, the Agency was replacing numerous separate information 
systems with a single integrated system (AIPS) and introducing new accounting standards (IPSAS). 
The new enterprise resource planning system would be implemented in four phases, the first of which 
was well under way and was expected to go live in early 2011. However, the second phase was not 
fully funded in the Regular Budget for 2011. Extrabudgetary contributions were therefore urgently 
required to ensure that the project, which was fundamental to bringing further efficiencies in 
programme support, was not delayed. The implementation of the first phase of AIPS would be a 
significant factor in enabling the Agency to adopt IPSAS, in line with UN accounting practice. The 
AgencyÂs IPSAS project was on track to start on schedule in January 2011. 
63. Securing proper funding for the AgencyÂs needs was not easy and required careful preparation. 
Preparations for the programme and budget for 2012Â2013 would take into account the concerns 
expressed by Member States about the difficulty of funding the AgencyÂs activities at a time of serious 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 10 
financial constraints and the need to address growing demands for new priority activities. As a first 
step, special efforts would be made to identify lower-priority projects and areas to improve efficiency. 
The second step was to identify areas where additional expenditure would be needed to meet new and 
expanding demands for assistance from Member States. Requests for funding for new projects would 
be scrutinized carefully to ensure they were in line with the Medium Term Strategy. The programme 
and budget estimate for 2012Â2013 would reflect the BoardÂs decision in June 2010 that the 
2011 budget level would be the reference for budget discussions for the 2012Â2013 biennium. 
64. Following his appointment of five new Deputy Directors General, an almost completely new 
senior management team would be in place from early 2011. He was grateful to the outgoing 
incumbents for their enormous contribution to the Agency, and looked forward to the fresh input of his 
experienced and capable new team. He had already begun to move towards more frequent, less formal 
and more substantive policy meetings of senior staff. As Director General, he had gained a deep 
appreciation of the quality of the AgencyÂs staff, who were highly trained and dedicated at all levels 
and who had his full support. 
65. He recognized the need to improve communication, both within the Secretariat and between the 
Secretariat and Member States. He had travelled extensively over the preceding year in order to gain a 
better understanding of the views and needs of Member States. He looked forward to a strengthened 
dialogue with Resident Representatives in Vienna on how Agency programmes could better meet their 
various needs. 
66. The question of the amendments to Article VI of the Statute, which dealt with membership of 
the Board of Governors, and Article XIV.A, on the introduction of biennial budgeting, had been 
pending for more than 10 years. He appealed to all Member States that had not yet done so to accept 
those amendments as early as possible. 
67. The current yearÂs Scientific Forum, entitled: ÂCancer in Developing Countries: Facing the 
ChallengeÂ, was the culmination of the AgencyÂs special focus on cancer in 2010, which had already 
started to bear fruit. It had been successful in raising awareness of the problems of cancer in 
developing countries to a higher political level. The AgencyÂs cooperation with WHO was going from 
strength to strength and confirmed pledges and donations to PACT were at record levels. The Agency 
was also seeing a very strong commitment by developing countries to its activities, which had led to 
an improvement in the quality of some cancer-related technical cooperation projects. He appealed to 
all members to participate in the Scientific Forum and to support actively the AgencyÂs work on 
cancer control. 
68. He thanked the Government of Austria for being an exemplary host for the Agency. He was 
deeply grateful for the excellent facilities provided both at the VIC and at Seibersdorf, and for the 
unstinting support Austria gave to the work of the Agency and to him personally. 
69. He would continue to implement all aspects of the AgencyÂs mandate in a balanced manner in 
order to address the varying interests of Member States.

6. Contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2011 
(GC(54)/15) 
70. The PRESIDENT said that on 11 June 2010 the Board of Governors had recommended a figure 
of US $85 million as the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF for 2011. He drew attention to 
the table in document GC(54)/15 showing the contributions each Member State would need to make in 
order to meet its share of that target. 
71. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in 
planning the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes and all delegations that were in a position to 
do so, but had not as yet, were urged to notify the Secretariat during the current session of the 
contributions that their governments would be making for 2011. 
72. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions which 
had been pledged up to that time. He hoped to be able to report favourably on the percentage of the 
2011 target figure already pledged. 
7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 
(GC(54)/4) 
73. Mr MAGNETTE (Belgium), speaking on behalf of the European Union, the candidate countries 
Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Iceland, the countries of the Stabilisation 
and Association Process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, 
the EFTA country Norway, member of the European Economic Area, as well as Ukraine and the 
Republic of Moldova, said that 2010 marked an important milestone for the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and had given it a new impetus. Committed to effective multilateral action against the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the European Union warmly welcomed the consensus 
reached at the 2010 NPT Review Conference in May. The agreements on an action plan and a process 
for the implementation of the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East, including a conference to be 
convened in 2012, demonstrated the common resolve of all parties to uphold and strengthen the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime. It was important to begin implementing the action plan immediately, 
building on the results of the Review Conference and continuing the spirit of consensus and 
cooperation which had characterized the negotiations therein. The European Union was particularly 
keen to ensure that the Agency operated in an effective and efficient manner and had adequate 
resources to implement the action plan, and so would fully support its efforts to that end. 
74. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the AgencyÂs role in verifying StatesÂ 
compliance with their safeguards obligations with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy 
from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons. The European Union was deeply concerned by the protracted 
and serious challenges to the non-proliferation regime posed by Iran, the DPRK and Syria. 
75. It was of great concern that Iran had thus far failed to comply with Security Council and Board 
resolutions, not only continuing but even expanding uranium enrichment activities. In February 2010, 
it had begun enrichment up to a level of 20% and had continued construction activities at the 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 12 
enrichment plant at Qom, as well as activities related to heavy water production. Iran continued to 
refuse to cooperate with Agency investigations, had failed to provide design information as required 
by the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements to its safeguards agreement and had not 
implemented the additional protocol signed in 2003. In resolution 1929 (2010), the Security Council 
had reaffirmed that Iran must suspend enrichment-related activities and cooperate fully with the 
Agency on all outstanding issues, including those which gave rise to concerns about the possible 
military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear programme. The European Union was committed to 
working for a diplomatic solution to the issue and reaffirmed the validity of the June 2008 proposals 
made to Iran, which included cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It urged Iran to 
address the AgencyÂs outstanding concerns and to meet with the High Representative of the European 
Union and representatives of the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany to 
discuss its nuclear programme, with the ultimate goal of establishing a comprehensive relationship 
involving cooperation in all fields Â economic, nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, political and 
security. 
76. The DPRKÂs nuclear weapons and missile programmes remained a grave concern to the 
European Union. It strongly condemned the actions taken by the DPRK, including the testing of 
nuclear explosive devices and the launching of missiles, which undermined stability on the Korean 
Peninsula and in the region and represented a threat to international peace and security. The European 
Union called on the DPRK to abandon and completely dismantle any nuclear weapons-related 
programme in a prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner and to comply with its 
international obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions and its comprehensive 
safeguards agreement. The European Union supported the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula 
and the efforts of the six-party talks and called on the DPRK to resume dialogue and allow an early 
return of Agency inspectors. 
77. It was cause for concern that Syria had not cooperated on matters related to the Dair Alzour site 
for the preceding two years, not allowing the Agency to complete its assessment or determine the 
nature of the site. Some of the information related to the site was deteriorating or at risk of being lost 
entirely, and the European Union therefore urged Syria to cooperate fully and promptly with the 
Agency. It welcomed the agreement reached between Syria and the Agency on a plan of action for 
resolving the remaining questions with respect to the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor and requested 
Syria to cooperate fully in the implementation of the plan of action in order to clarify the issue rapidly. 
Finally, it urged Syria to bring into force an additional protocol at the earliest possible opportunity in 
order to help the Agency verify the correctness and completeness of the countryÂs declarations. 
78. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was a fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and played an indispensable role in the implementation of the NPT. The measures contained in 
the additional protocol formed an integral part of that system, and comprehensive safeguards 
agreements together with additional protocols constituted the current verification standard. The 
European Union called for the universalization of those two essential instruments without delay as a 
means of strengthening the non-proliferation regime, enhancing security worldwide and increasing the 
confidence needed for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to reach its full 
potential. Further measures were required to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of 
the AgencyÂs safeguards system. It was important to resolve all cases of non-compliance with 
safeguards obligations, and States party to the NPT should respond resolutely and effectively to such 
cases. The Security Council was the final arbiter of international peace and security for taking 
appropriate action in the event of non-compliance with NPT obligations, including safeguards 
agreements. 
79. Each country had the right to define its own energy strategy. For countries planning to include 
nuclear power in that strategy, the Agency had a key role to play in assisting them to ensure that the 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 13 
development and operation of nuclear power took place under the most stringent legal, operational, 
safety, security and non-proliferation conditions. Human resource development, including education 
and training, was of vital importance for the safe, secure and peaceful use of atomic energy. The 
International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy in Paris had indicated the need to 
maintain qualified expertise and further develop skills and competence in that regard. 
80. The European Union remained firmly convinced of the benefits of multilateral approaches to the 
nuclear fuel cycle and was ready to continue discussions on the development of such approaches in a 
non-discriminatory and transparent manner. It reconfirmed its commitment to support financially the 
LEU bank proposed by the Secretariat once the conditions and modalities had been defined and 
approved by the Board, and called upon the Director General to update the proposal so that the Board 
would be in a position in the near future to take the necessary steps for implementing that important 
project. 
81. The European Union attached the utmost importance to maintaining a high level of nuclear 
safety worldwide and to promoting the global nuclear safety framework through international 
cooperation. It encouraged all countries, including those envisaging the launch of a civil nuclear 
option for the first time, to cooperate with the Agency and implement its standards and 
recommendations. Bearing in mind that all States with nuclear power programmes were currently 
party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the European Union was particularly concerned about the 
ongoing commissioning of the Bushehr nuclear power plant without Iran acceding to the Convention. 
It called on Iran to become a full member of the international nuclear safety community by doing so 
and by implementing the peer review mechanism. The world faced a new era of threats from 
non-State actors, particularly terrorists, who sought to acquire WMD and related technology and 
materials. The consequences of failing to prevent that from occurring would be severe. The European 
Union therefore actively supported the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) as 
well as a number of international initiatives and Agency activities in that regard. It also supported 
Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) and welcomed the Nuclear Security Summit convened by the 
President of the United States on 13 April 2010. The European Union would actively follow up on 
implementation of the work plan to enhance global nuclear security that had been adopted at the 
Summit. Nuclear security was an essential part of the AgencyÂs work, and the European Union 
commended its activities aimed at preventing and combating nuclear terrorism. The 2010 NPT Review 
Conference and the Nuclear Security Summit had emphasized the AgencyÂs important role in fostering 
international cooperation in nuclear security, establishing a comprehensive set of nuclear security 
guidelines and helping Member States, upon their request, to enhance nuclear security. Effective 
physical protection was of utmost importance in preventing nuclear material from falling into the 
hands of terrorists or from accidental misuse, and in protecting nuclear facilities against unauthorized 
use and malicious acts. The European Union urged all States that had not yet done so to become 
parties to the CPPNM. 
82. The European Union welcomed Agency activities designed to increase the contribution of 
nuclear technology to peace, health and economic development. The Agency should continue to 
implement programmes aimed at improving safety, non-proliferation and waste minimization and 
management, as well as projects allowing interested countries to use nuclear energy applications in 
health and research. It was important to support research on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to 
maintain competence and know-how across the nuclear sector. 
83. The European Union was pleased that in 2010, the Scientific Forum to be held alongside the 
General Conference was taking up the issue of cancer in developing countries. Mindful of the 
importance of medical radioisotopes, it encouraged the Agency to pursue its work, in cooperation with 
other international organizations and stakeholders, to ensure the improved use of radioisotope 
supplies. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 14 
84. The European Union had always been a strong supporter of the technical cooperation 
programme, to which it was one of the main contributors. Addressing the global challenges of hunger, 
disease, poverty and water resource management and creating a cleaner and safer environment was of 
particular significance to developing countries, and the AgencyÂs efforts in those areas were valued. 
While it was important to ensure fair access to technical cooperation funding, there was a great need 
for technical assistance in the least developed countries. The commitment of a beneficiary country was 
a key factor in achieving a successful outcome in technical cooperation projects. The European Union 
underlined the importance of technical cooperation activities that contributed to achieving and 
sustaining solid nuclear and radiation safety and security infrastructures at all levels. Technical 
cooperation management and project implementation needed to become more efficient, effective and 
accountable, for the benefit of all Member States. The European Union supported transparent project 
management based on verifiable performance indicators and believed that regular and transparent 
interaction between the Secretariat, Member State representatives and national institutions would help 
accomplish clear project objectives and achieve sustainable results. In order to maximize the 
socio-economic impact of the technical cooperation programme, it was crucial for the Agency to 
further develop partnerships with other organizations, where appropriate, taking into account the fact 
that it did not have the leading mandate in every field in which it was active. 
85. The Medium Term Strategy for 2012Â2017 should reflect those areas where the Agency had a 
leading mandate and should focus on strategic goals, objectives and activities to provide practical 
guidance for formulating major programmes. It also needed to include specific targets for efficiency, 
effectiveness and transparency with clear performance indicators. 
86. Mr SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that the General Conference provided an 
opportunity to assess the global communityÂs efforts in achieving the peaceful objectives of an 
organization that had been established primarily for humanityÂs well-being and prosperity. It was an 
important gathering of Member States of various beliefs and backgrounds reflecting the international 
communityÂs collective will to share thoughts, exchange opinions and experiences, and attempt to find 
the best possible solutions to outstanding issues. In turn, the Agency should provide all the necessary 
elements and an environment conducive to the realization of that noble objective. His country, in 
accordance with its legal commitments, had always tried to extend its utmost cooperation to the 
Agency and had undertaken sincere efforts to perform its peaceful nuclear activities within the 
framework of the NPT and comprehensive safeguards. 
87. Pursuant to its comprehensive safeguards agreement, all IranÂs nuclear installations were subject 
to the AgencyÂs routine monitoring and inspection. Since 2003 more than 5000 man-days of 
inspections had been conducted, which was unprecedented in the AgencyÂs history. The result of such 
huge efforts had always led to the conclusion that there had been no diversion to non-peaceful 
activities. Unfortunately, however, the Agency appeared to have ignored all the conclusive evidence 
and the cooperation extended by Iran. Certain parts of the Director GeneralÂs latest report on the issue 
did not coincide with the norms and procedures of the AgencyÂs mandate and were not based on 
impartiality and fairness, raising queries as to the political influence exerted by certain powers upon 
the decision-making of what was a unique international technical body. For the sake of credibility, the 
verification process envisaged in the safeguards agreement had to be implemented without any biased 
political interest or double standards. It appeared that the Agency was suffering from a crisis of moral 
authority and credibility. 
88. The notion of political interference had regrettably left its mark in the field of technical 
cooperation as well. That area should clearly not be subjected to any political conditions, as stipulated 
in the Statute and the Revised Guiding Principles and General Operating Rules to Govern the 
Provision of Technical Assistance by the Agency (INFCIRC/267). Yet, owing to pressure exerted by a 
few countries, certain unjustifiable constraints had been imposed by the Secretariat on IranÂs 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 15 
participation in programmes in the nuclear safety domain. Nuclear safety was of global importance, 
and any negligence in rendering services in that field might lead to hazardous nuclear events of 
international dimensions. The inexcusable restrictions imposed on Iran ran counter to the AgencyÂs 
claim to be enforcing global nuclear safety standards and a global nuclear security culture. How could 
Iran enhance safety standards at its nuclear installations while the active participation of its experts in 
related international conferences, workshops and meetings organized by the Agency was being 
hampered? Undoubtedly, such an unjustified and unreasonable attitude and conduct would lead to 
undesired consequences regarding the establishment of mutual confidence among Member States. 
89. Another issue was the provision of fuel needed for the Tehran Research Reactor, which met the 
radiopharmaceutical needs of thousands of patients. Despite repeated efforts by Iran for mutual 
confidence building, no encouraging result had thus far been achieved. The Joint Declaration by Iran, 
Brazil and Turkey concluded on 17 May 2010 had been a positive gesture by Iran to resolve the fuel 
swap issue and sustain the ongoing dialogue. That had also been subject to unjust political pressure by 
a few countries that possessed nuclear weapons, resulting in the issue of the unjustified and illegal 
Security Council resolution 1929. The uncivilized double-track approach of threat and dialogue could 
not be fruitful, as demonstrated by the fact that there was no assurance of nuclear fuel supply. He 
therefore called upon the Vienna Group to resume talks with his country without further delay, based 
on the internationally acknowledged Tehran Declaration of 2003. 
90. Forty years on from the inception of the NPT the world was still witnessing an imbalance 
between disarmament and non-proliferation; and the international community continued to suffer as a 
result of that imbalance. Although there had recently been seemingly positive progress in the field of 
disarmament, essential practical steps had to be taken urgently towards the total elimination of nuclear 
weapons and the achievement of disarmament goals. The achievement of a world free of nuclear 
weapons was one of IranÂs main priorities and would require all three pillars of the NPT to be pursued 
in an unbiased and balanced manner. The importance of that subject had led to the holding in 2010 of 
the Tehran International Conference on Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, based on the principle of 
Ânuclear energy for all, nuclear weapons for noneÂ. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had also shed 
more light on the matter, making it more prominent than ever. At the Tehran International Conference, 
all participants Â who came from 60 countries Â had expressed their deep concern over the 
stockpiling, deployment and expansion of WMD, particularly nuclear weapons. They had also 
reiterated the need to implement comprehensive disarmament as a priority, through the establishment 
of a mandatory convention for the elimination of nuclear weapons. 
91. For many years Iran had been emphasizing the need for the creation of a NWFZ in the Middle 
East region in line with the unanimous resolution of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference 
and with the 2010 NPT Review Conference, as well as relevant UN General Assembly resolutions. 
For the first time a consensus had been reached on demanding that the Zionist regime of Israel 
promptly become a party to the NPT. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had stressed the need for 
Israel to place all its nuclear installations under the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards; however, due 
to the support given by its Western allies, no action had yet been taken in that regard. Iran invited all 
peace-loving countries to intensify their efforts to exert more pressure on the Israeli regime to submit 
unconditionally to that international demand. It was time to move away from political games and 
redirect collective efforts towards a balanced treatment of countries seeking peaceful nuclear 
technology, while putting intense pressure on countries which had defied international demands. 
92. With regard to assurance of nuclear fuel supply, under the NPT, all Member States had the 
inalienable right to research, production, development and use of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. That right included deploying national capabilities for manufacturing fuel for research and 
power reactors. Member States also had the right to choose how to obtain nuclear fuel, whether 
domestically or through foreign trade, without any constraints. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 16 
reaffirmed the right of all States to the peaceful use of nuclear energy without discrimination and 
without jeopardizing their access to the complete nuclear fuel cycle subject to Agency supervision. 
93. It was of the utmost importance to differentiate between the safeguards commitments of 
Member States and confidence building measures taken on a voluntary basis. As the sole international 
verification body, the Agency was responsible for assuring the adherence of Member States to their 
safeguards agreements but should at no time declare the voluntary measures of Member States to be 
mandatory. Moreover, any verification by the Agency had to be performed without discrimination or 
double standards. 
94. The issue of confidentiality was one of the issues that had caused Iran deep concern with regard 
to the AgencyÂs performance. Member States should not find their national security endangered and 
under no circumstances should their classified information be disclosed. The matter required close 
scrutiny, particularly with respect to recent developments at the Agency. 
95. As an active member of the Agency, Iran had been able to make huge advances in nuclear 
technology through its diligent national efforts. It was ready to share its valuable nuclear experience 
with other Member States under the supervision of the Agency. In light of the recent interest shown by 
IranÂs neighbours in having nuclear power plants, his country suggested the formation of a regional 
technical group for the exchange of know-how and expertise, specifically in the area of nuclear safety. 
96. In order to realize its national interests, Iran had incorporated the use of peaceful nuclear 
technology into its development plans; and by deploying state-of-the-art engineering techniques and 
standards had ably enhanced its domestic capability in that respect. The production of radioisotopes 
for medical, industrial and agricultural use, as well as the design and construction of various 
installations for the provision of nuclear fuel and the treatment of nuclear waste, were among the main 
objectives of IranÂs development plans. In that respect, he was pleased to announce that the Bushehr 
nuclear power plant, with a capacity of 1000 MW, would soon be producing electricity and that the 
IRRS mission to Iran in March 2010 had confirmed the activities of his countryÂs nuclear safety 
system for deploying the relevant standards at the plant. That confirmation by the AgencyÂs safety 
regulation monitoring body, as well as by a group comprising the highest-ranking safety authorities of 
some Member States, was another clear indication of IranÂs commitment to international nuclear 
safety regulations. 
97. The protection of nuclear installations from armed attack was essential for the promotion of 
nuclear energy in the world. The 53rd session of the General Conference had unanimously adopted a 
decision prohibiting any attack or threat of attack against nuclear installations under construction or in 
operation (GC(53)/DEC/13). The 2010 NPT Review Conference had called upon all States Parties to 
abide by that commitment. 
98. IranÂs parliament had decreed the construction of nuclear power plants totalling around 
20 000 MW over the next 20 years, and he invited all potential suppliers to seize the opportunity to 
participate in the construction of those new plants. 
99. Iran, while strongly defending its national rights, would continue to maintain its constructive 
efforts through sustained interaction and dialogue with its counterparts. While safeguarding its 
national interests, Iran would continue its sincere cooperation with the Agency, in the hope that the 
power of rationality would overwhelm the logic of power. 
100. He thanked the AgencyÂs staff for their hard work and expressed the hope that their assiduous 
efforts, impartiality and objectivity would be instrumental in upholding the AgencyÂs valuable 
mission. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 17 
101. Mr CHEN Qiufa (China) said that the Agency was increasingly recognized by the international 
community for its promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, non-proliferation and nuclear 
security. The nuclear renaissance had given the Agency the opportunity to play a greater role in those 
areas by providing services to emerging nuclear power countries through technical cooperation 
projects related to nuclear power infrastructure, nuclear safety, human resources and uranium 
exploration. The Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review service had also achieved good results and 
regional centres for technical cooperation had been established successfully. INPRO had made 
enormous progress over the preceding decade, becoming a key forum for international cooperation in 
nuclear technology innovation. 
102. The China Advanced Research Reactor and the China Experimental Fast Reactor had both gone 
critical in 2010, laying a solid foundation for further research and development in advanced nuclear 
technology. ChinaÂs technical cooperation project with the Agency on enhancing the capabilities of 
national institutions supporting nuclear power development was proceeding smoothly. Such projects 
boosted domestic infrastructure development and human resource development, promoted the sound 
development of nuclear energy and provided a model for other developing countries in the region and 
beyond. ChinaÂs CPF for 2010Â2015, signed in June 2010, provided a good blueprint for future 
cooperation with the Agency. 
103. China had put in place a legal and regulatory system for nuclear safety, in line with international 
practice and based on the AgencyÂs safety standards. An IRRS mission had visited China in July 
2010 to review the regulatory framework governing nuclear safety and associated laws, regulations 
and standards and radioactive waste management. Its observations and recommendations had provided 
important guidance for promoting the overall performance of the regulatory system and the 
development of a safety culture. 
104. In the area of nuclear security, China had ratified the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in August 2010. President Hu Jintao had attended the 
Nuclear Security Summit in Washington DC, where he had announced the proposed construction of a 
centre of excellence for nuclear security in collaboration with other countries. A seminar on 
cooperation between China and the Agency had been held in August 2010, attended by the Director 
General and over 200 participants. The seminar had explored ways of using Agency resources to meet 
ChinaÂs practical needs and had provided the setting for the signing of the practical arrangements on 
nuclear security between China and the Agency, which was intended to expand cooperation in nuclear 
security legislation and standards, nuclear security for major public events, capacity building and staff 
training based on the successful cooperation on the Olympic Games in Beijing. China was preparing to 
establish a technology demonstration centre of excellence on nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear 
security, and would welcome the cooperation of the Agency and interested States in that endeavour. 
105. China deeply appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation in nuclear energy development. 
His country had accumulated a great deal of experience in nuclear power design, construction and 
research and development, which could be useful to other countries which were new to nuclear power. 
His country would also contribute to the nuclear energy development of developing countries. 
106. China recommended that the Agency should focus on three main areas in its future work. 
Firstly, it should strengthen technical cooperation for the sustainable development of nuclear energy, 
which had been called for by the majority of developing countries. Secondly, the Agency should 
promote capacity building in nuclear safety and security in Member States and enhance the efficiency 
and effectiveness of nuclear safeguards. It should pursue the development of a global system of 
nuclear safety and security legislation and standards, promote the exchange of knowledge, experience 
and lessons learned, and increase public confidence in nuclear energy development. It should also 
build up its own technical capabilities while cooperating with Member States and using their resources 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 18 
to achieve safeguards goals. Thirdly, the Agency should play an active role in addressing sensitive and 
high-profile nuclear issues. China believed that the nuclear situations on the Korean Peninsula and in 
Iran should be resolved peacefully through dialogue and negotiation and that the Agency should 
continue to promote their diplomatic settlement. 
107. Mr RUTO (Kenya) said that his country attached great importance to the mandate and functions 
of the Agency in the peaceful use and application of nuclear energy and technology for economic and 
social development. Kenya continued to meet its obligations to the Agency in full, including through 
the timely payment of its assessed contributions and NPCs. 
108. The AgencyÂs activities continued to make a remarkable difference in many areas of 
socio-economic development, such as crop and livestock production, energy generation, human health, 
water supplies, industrial development and nuclear security. Its safeguards and verification activities 
also illustrated the importance of its continued vigilance and contributions to international peace and 
security. It was therefore not surprising that the AgencyÂs unique role in that regard had assumed 
greater significance with the alarming scarcity of non-renewable energy sources, the escalating prices 
of fossil fuel and the unprecedented challenges of climate change. As a result, many Member States, 
including Kenya, had shown renewed interest in nuclear energy for meeting national development 
demands. 
109. Balanced, impartial and non-political activities by the Agency would ensure global peace, safety 
and security, as well as sustainable development in all regions. Cooperation by all Member States and 
the universalization of the NPT and its additional protocol were prerequisites to the Agency fulfilling 
its mandate and Kenya therefore called on Member States who had not concluded the necessary 
instruments to do so. 
110. As a result of the AgencyÂs increased technical cooperation support for human resource 
development and radiation detection equipment, KenyaÂs competent authority had enhanced 
regulatory measures and opened additional regional offices. A draft radiation safety bill was also being 
prepared. The process was critical to KenyaÂs future plans to develop a safe nuclear programme to 
help meet its energy needs. 
111. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Kenya provided significant support for the 
GovernmentÂs efforts to develop national nuclear science and technology infrastructure. KenyaÂs CPF 
for 2011Â2016 had been finalized and submitted to the Agency for comments. It covered five thematic 
areas: energy, agriculture and livestock, human health, water and industry. Kenya was participating in 
six national projects and 28 regional and interregional projects in a variety of fields. 
112. He commended the Agency for its ongoing measures to strengthen nuclear safety and security 
in the transport of radioactive sources and waste management. The equipment installed at the 
Mombasa seaport to screen for illicit radioactive and nuclear materials was expected to be operational 
by December 2010. He expressed appreciation for the collaboration of development partners in that 
project, which had also helped establish an ongoing training programme for border personnel. 
113. In recognition of global efforts to ensure the safety of spent fuel and radioactive waste 
management and the need to protect against potential hazards to society and the environment, KenyaÂs 
accession to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management was at an advanced stage, while the construction of a central 
radioactive waste processing facility, fully funded by the Kenyan Government, was due for 
completion in 2012. It would include an interim storage facility for disused conventional radiation 
sources and other radioactive material. He invited development partners to support the full realization 
of the project.

114. The availability of sustainable energy in developing countries was key to creating wealth and 
improving living standards. Kenya was committed to developing nuclear energy to meet its energy 
needs, to which end the Government had established a nuclear electricity committee and allocated 
US $2.5 million to the nuclear energy programme. A flagship project in the 2011Â2016 CPF 
concerned nuclear energy development, and Kenya had hosted both a meeting on energy planning and 
a workshop on nuclear power evaluation. He called on the Agency and international partners to assist 
in achieving the projectÂs objectives. 
115. With regard to PACT, he commended the Agency and in particular the Director General for 
their dedication to combating the looming catastrophe of cancer in developing countries, to which the 
Scientific Forum to be held on the margins of the present session of the General Conference would be 
dedicated. He hoped that the Forum would not only provide hope to the many millions suffering from 
cancer, but also identify concrete intervention measures appropriate to developing countries. Above 
all, it was hoped that the requisite technology would be provided to Member States in need, including 
Kenya. 
116. Concerning activities related to nuclear science and applications, he commended the Agency for 
assigning high priority to agricultural and livestock development in Africa. He welcomed the steps 
taken to formalize the collaborative framework in support of PATTEC. The tsetse and trypanosomosis 
problem still posed a threat to the lives and livelihoods of communities and constrained livestock 
production in Africa. It was therefore important to develop techniques to create tsetse-free zones and 
to apply the mutation breeding technique. The release of test groups of sterile male tsetse flies in 
Lambwe Valley was under way, with the aim of creating the first tsetse-free zone under PATTEC in 
Kenya. 
117. The mutation breeding technique to improve wheat varieties was being extended to other crops, 
such as bananas and cassava. He expressed appreciation to the Agency, other States and other UN 
specialized agencies for their support for the Kenya-led research project on the global threat of Ug99 
stem rust, and encouraged others to support further research and development. 
118. Within the framework of AFRA, and in view of the need to enhance skills development in the 
field of nuclear science and technology, the University of Nairobi was introducing a master of science 
programme in line with the AFRA harmonized syllabus. Kenya welcomed the AgencyÂs technical 
support in that regard. 
119. Partnership between Kenya and the Agency had resulted in the establishment of a secondary 
standards dosimetry laboratory to maintain national standards for ionizing radiation and calibration. 
He appealed for support to equip the laboratory with a cobalt-60 calibration system for traceability. 
120. Kenya was participating in a regional project on radioisotope applications for trouble-shooting 
and optimization of industrial processes in the petrochemical, cement, sugar and geothermal 
industries. Support was required for human capacity building, expert missions and the provision of 
equipment to expand the application of the technology. As part of the project, a non-destructive testing 
centre had been established to provide inspection services in industry. 
121. Underscoring the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and the need to 
ensure adequate resources, he stressed that the development of nuclear technology for peaceful 
applications should be considered a matter of high priority. In the long term, nuclear technology could 
help to improve the socio-economic development of developing countries such as Kenya. His country 
pledged to pay the full share of its assessed contribution plus an additional Â10 000 to the TCF for 
2011. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 20 
122. Mr CHU (United States of America) expressed appreciation to the Director General for his 
exemplary leadership in his first year and welcomed his initiative to help fight cancer in developing 
countries. 
123. He read out the following message from President Obama: 
ÂThe United States stands with the IAEA and its members in the effort both to harness the 
potential of nuclear energy for peace and development and to contain the dangers it poses for 
our collective security. These are inseparable challenges, reflected in the dual role played by this 
Agency as both a promoter of peaceful nuclear uses and an instrument for verification and 
security. 
ÂWe seek a future in which nuclear energy is made available to all nations that comply with 
non-proliferation norms and rules, and we also recognize the international non-proliferation 
system has not always worked as we would have hoped. For this reason, the United States has 
called for added resources and authorities for the IAEA, penalties against those who violate 
their non-proliferation obligations, and new international mechanisms that ensure the safe, 
secure and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
ÂNo nation has a monopoly on nuclear power, and no nation alone can manage its inherent 
risks. This is a challenge we face together. Working cooperatively through international 
institutions and with a shared sense of commitment and obligation, we can succeed in building a 
safer future, one in which the barriers to proliferation are high and the obstacles to nuclear 
energy are low. The United States will continue to do its part, having this year convened the 
first Nuclear Security Summit which highlighted the risk of nuclear security at head of State 
level, revised our nuclear posture and reached agreement with Russia on a new nuclear arms 
accord. We are also developing measures that would ensure safe and secure access to the 
benefits of the peaceful atom. Among these is an IAEA fuel bank, designed to support 
countriesÂ access to peaceful nuclear energy by underpinning the international nuclear fuel 
market. This concept, which has its roots in the vision of Bernard Baruch, was proposed in 
2006 and has been extensively analysed and debated. The time to act is now, and we will work 
pragmatically toward a decision this year. 
ÂThese are important first steps, but much more remains to be done if we are to prevent nuclear 
weapons from spreading or falling into the hands of terrorists. While we may not agree on every 
priority or remedy, it is essential we be defined not by our differences, but by the interests we 
hold in common. We can start here, at this General Conference, by taking action to strengthen 
the consensus against proliferation and encourage the fullest possible exchange of peaceful 
nuclear technology. 
ÂI hope you will join with my delegation in committing to these goals, and I wish you all the 
best for a successful conference.Â 
124. The Agency was at the nexus of two great challenges: helping a rapidly developing world 
unlock the promise of low-carbon electricity, and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons while 
working to realize the peace and security of a world without them. 
125. In his April 2009 speech in Prague, President Obama had called for building a new framework 
for civil nuclear cooperation, including an international fuel bank, so that countries could access 
peaceful power without increasing the risks of proliferation. He had emphasized that such cooperation 
had to be the right of every nation that renounced nuclear weapons, especially developing countries 
embarking on peaceful programmes, and that no approach would succeed if it was based on the denial 
of rights to nations that played by the rules. 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 21 
126. A strong and efficient market for nuclear fuel was vital to securing carbon-free energy on a 
global basis. The United States continued to support expanded and reliable commercial access to fuel 
supplies for peaceful nuclear programmes. Providing nuclear fuel assurances allowed countries to 
have more confidence in the international fuel markets. Specifically, an assurance of the availability of 
fuel through Agency mechanisms would empower governments to exercise their right to the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy under Article IV of the NPT. A number of initiatives had already been 
undertaken, and his country applauded the AgencyÂs positive decision on the fuel bank at Angarsk. 
The United States had downblended 17.4 metric tons of HEU into LEU, to be held in reserve for a fuel 
assurance mechanism. It had also contributed US $50 million to support an Agency-administered 
international fuel bank. Taken together with commitments from the Nuclear Threat Initiative and other 
Member States, $150 million had been pledged for that purpose. The offer to contribute had been 
extended several times and presented Member States with an excellent opportunity to realize one of 
the AgencyÂs founding objectives, but those resources would be at risk if a decision was not taken 
soon. It was time to move beyond general discussion and debate on fuel bank principles. The United 
States intended to work with other Member States to develop a common approach and seek adoption 
of a resolution approving an Agency-administered fuel bank at the December meeting of the Board of 
Governors. 
127. Domestically, the United States had secured loan guarantees for new nuclear power and fuel 
facility construction, had established a Blue Ribbon Commission to make recommendations for the 
long-term management and disposal of used fuel and high-level waste and had committed itself to a 
robust, science-based nuclear research and development effort. Internationally, it was expanding its 
bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and outreach to States pursuing nuclear power for the 
first time. 
128. In June 2010, the Steering Group of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership had met in Accra, 
Ghana, and had unanimously agreed on a new name Â the International Framework for Nuclear 
Energy Cooperation Â and a new Statement of Mission that would provide a broader scope and 
engender wider international participation. Working closely with the Agency, the International 
Framework would provide advice on infrastructure development for nations expanding and developing 
nuclear power programmes, and help to create international mechanisms to assure reliable access to 
nuclear fuel services. 
129. As part of the United StatesÂ commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, the Secretary of 
State had announced a new Peaceful Uses Initiative at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The 
Initiative would raise $100 million for new and underfunded Agency projects in developing countries 
in order to advance medical technology for human health, food security and water resource 
management, as well as infrastructure for the safe and secure use of nuclear power. 
130. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was facing a growing imbalance between workload and 
resources. New facilities required safeguards, and technologies needed updating, yet the safeguards 
budget had remained relatively static. The United States therefore supported a significant increase in 
the Regular Budget. 
131. The United States Department of Energy had launched the Next Generation Safeguards 
Initiative to identify technology gaps and solutions, train new experts and develop new concepts and 
approaches to improve international safeguards. 
132. The Agency had made it clear that the measures of the additional protocol were needed to 
ensure compliance with a safeguards agreement. The United States therefore urged all countries that 
had not yet done so to conclude an additional protocol with the Agency without delay. There had to be 
real and timely consequences for countries that did not adhere to their safeguards commitments. The 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 22 
United States supported the Agency in its efforts to resolve outstanding concerns related to the nuclear 
programmes in Iran and Syria, and encouraged the Agency to make full use of existing authorities. 
The DPRK also continued to present a challenge to non-proliferation efforts and needed to comply 
with international obligations. The United States hoped that all States would focus on meeting their 
essential international nuclear verification obligations rather than criticizing the AgencyÂs efforts to 
implement its legal mandate under safeguards agreements. 
133. As outlined in the Director GeneralÂs report earlier in the month, Iran refused to cooperate fully 
with the Agency and had defied the resolutions of the Board and the Security Council. IranÂs 
intransigence represented a challenge to the rules to which countries must adhere. In recognition of 
that fact, the Security Council had adopted resolution 1929, the strongest and most comprehensive set 
of sanctions thus far in that regard. While the United States acknowledged IranÂs right to pursue 
peaceful civilian nuclear power and remained committed to pursuing a diplomatic solution, Iran must 
do what it had thus far failed to do Â meet its obligations and provide assurances of the peaceful 
nature of its intentions. Otherwise, there was a broad and growing international consensus to hold Iran 
accountable if it continued its defiance. The United States had already levied sanctions against those 
trading with Iran, including the European-Iranian Trade Bank, effectively preventing the bank from 
operating in the United States financial system. Canada, Australia, the Republic of Korea and the 
United Arab Emirates were also to be applauded for taking similar steps to prevent foreign capital 
from funding enrichment efforts. The United States would continue to place pressure on the 
Government of Iran to fulfil its international commitments. 
134. In his April 2009 speech in Prague, President Obama had declared that the United States would 
seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. His country was reducing the role and 
numbers of nuclear weapons, extending a security assurance to nations that were in compliance with 
the NPT and their nuclear non-proliferation obligations. In April 2010, the United States and Russia 
had signed a landmark new START treaty that reduced the number of deployed nuclear warheads by a 
third and strategic delivery vehicles by half, while establishing a comprehensive monitoring regime 
and a pathway to further reductions in the future. His Government was working to ensure its 
ratification. 
135. The United States was also pursuing the ratification and entry into force of the CTBT, and was 
seeking to negotiate a new treaty that verifiably ended the production of fissile material for use in 
nuclear weapons. Also, in cooperation with Russia, the United States had requested the Agency to 
verify the disposition of enough weapons-grade plutonium for approximately 17 000 nuclear weapons, 
with a view to preparing the necessary verification agreement for consideration by the Board before 
the end of 2011. 
136. It was important to work together to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists. 
President Obama had called for securing all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four 
years. The United States was cooperating with the Agency and other international institutions and 
countries to secure vulnerable nuclear and radiological materials. As a result, all HEU had been 
successfully removed from 18 countries. His country had also worked with international partners to 
convert research reactors and isotope production facilities from HEU to LEU fuel and targets. To 
ensure that the production of medical isotopes did not create new dangers, it was important for all new 
or expanded long-term molybdenum-99 production to be undertaken without HEU. The United States 
was developing medical isotope production processes that did not require the use of HEU. 
137. In April 2010, 47 world leaders and representatives from the Agency, the European Union and 
the United Nations had met in Washington for an unprecedented Nuclear Security Summit. The 
participants had pledged to pursue the highest levels of nuclear security and had concluded that strong 
nuclear security measures were the most effective means to prevent terrorists, criminals, or other 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 23 
unauthorized actors from acquiring nuclear materials. They had also reaffirmed the AgencyÂs essential 
role. 
138. Although it was ultimately the responsibility of each country to improve its own security, 
material accounting and physical protection measures, his country welcomed Agency activities in 
support of such national efforts. It was particularly pleased with the AgencyÂs work in facilitating the 
Member State revision of the AgencyÂs guidance on the physical protection of nuclear material and 
facilities, which would assist countries in implementing physical protection measures for nuclear 
material at facilities and in transport. 
139. The United States welcomed the announcement by the Republic of Korea that it would host the 
second Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul in 2012. It called on all Agency Member States to work to 
achieve universal adherence to the amended CPPNM and the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism by the 2011 General Conference. 
140. Thanks to the joint actions taken over the preceding year, significant progress was being made 
towards the goal of a world that was safer, more secure and more prosperous. Nuclear power would 
play a growing role in meeting the worldÂs energy needs, and nuclear dangers would remain, thus 
increasing the AgencyÂs importance in the subsequent years. The relevant systems and safeguards had 
to be up to the task of ensuring that nuclear power was both peaceful and plentiful. 
141. Mr KAIEDA (Japan) said that the international community had embarked on a new stage of the 
journey towards a world without nuclear weapons. In May 2010, the NPT Review Conference had 
agreed on an action plan incorporated into its Final Document, which presented all States with an 
opportunity to restart nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts. His country encouraged all 
Member States to work together to implement the action plan in concert with the Agency. 
142. Japan remained committed to its three non-nuclear principles Â not possessing or producing 
nuclear weapons or permitting their introduction into Japan Â and, as the only country to have 
suffered atomic bombing, was at the forefront of efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons. In that 
connection, Japan and Australia were currently using the opportunity of the General Assembly in New 
York to co-host a meeting of foreign ministers on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, with a 
view to forming a new group of like-minded countries which would take a lead in those fields. His 
country welcomed the Director GeneralÂs attendance at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony and 
the Nagasaki Peace Ceremony in August 2010 and regarded it as an important contribution towards a 
world without nuclear weapons. Japan looked forward to his follow-up efforts, as the Director General 
had indicated that the Agency would be able to contribute to the implementing stages of nuclear 
disarmament. 
143. The Agency played a key role not only in nuclear non-proliferation but also in promoting the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy by enhancing nuclear safety and security as well as technical 
cooperation, making it one of the most important international organizations for ensuring the peace 
and prosperity of humanity. Japan had been working with the Agency to promote peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy as a Board member since the AgencyÂs foundation. It would make further use of the 
knowledge and experience it had acquired in the civilian use of nuclear energy and in improving the 
safeguards system to assist developing countries through technical cooperation. The Agency was 
becoming increasingly important to the international community, and Japan would continue to support 
its further development so it might fully discharge its responsibilities. 
144. Japan greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs role in the worldÂs social and economic development 
through the application of nuclear science and technology. It welcomed the achievements of the 
Nuclear Security Summit held in April 2010, and was now preparing to establish an integrated 
comprehensive support centre for nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear security in Asia, as announced 
GC(54)/OR.1 
20 September 2010, Page 24 
at the Summit. The centreÂs activities, including human resource development, would help to 
strengthen nuclear security, mainly in Asian countries. 
145. Japan would share its experience on seismic safety for nuclear power facilities and contribute to 
developing Agency safety standards in that regard. In the areas of emergency preparedness and 
response, including disaster prevention, and radioactive waste management, Japan would support the 
AgencyÂs work through its ongoing extrabudgetary contributions to the Asian Nuclear Safety 
Network. Japan had decided to join the AgencyÂs Response Assistance Network and would share its 
own expert knowledge in the event of nuclear accidents. 
146. Based on the principle of freedom of navigation, Japan would continue to transport nuclear 
material, while employing the most stringent safety measures in accordance with international 
standards. It would also continue to take part in confidence-building dialogues between shipping and 
coastal States. 
147. Japan firmly believed that technical cooperation should continue to be one of the AgencyÂs core 
missions. With its long history and numerous achievements in fields such as the application of 
radiation for cancer therapy, his country would continue to attach importance to technical cooperation 
activities and to make technical and personnel contributions relating to the use of radiation in 
medicine, industry and many other areas. Experts from Japan would attend and lead discussions at the 
Scientific Forum held during the General Conference. 
148. Japan supported the ongoing promotion of the nuclear fuel cycle, radioactive waste management 
and the development of fast breeder reactor technology. It particularly welcomed the progress made in 
the work of the Generation IV International Forum and INPRO. 
149. The shortage of human resources to support the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, whether in 
developed or developing countries, continued to be of great concern. Japan attached importance to the 
AgencyÂs human resource development efforts and would contribute to them by providing the services 
of experts to the Agency. 
150. Japan would continue to engage in discussions on the development of a framework for 
assurance of nuclear fuel supply and the treatment of spent fuel. In 2006, Japan had proposed the 
establishment of an Agency standby arrangements system for the assurance of nuclear fuel supply 
intended to dispel uncertainties over fuel supply and to prevent market disturbances by registering 
each Member StateÂs supply capacity. He stressed the importance of groundwork to overcome the 
differences among the views of Member States on the issue and enable substantive progress. 
151. The strengthening of Agency safeguards was especially vital for the enhancement of the 
non-proliferation regime. The most realistic and effective way to strengthen safeguards was through 
universalization of the additional protocol, which Japan would continue to promote by hosting the 
Asian Senior-level Talks on Non-Proliferation (ASTOP) meetings and by contributing to relevant 
Agency seminars. 
152. Japan attached importance to improving the AgencyÂs independent analytical capabilities 
through modernization of the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory. 
153. Japan would continue to support the implementation in good faith of safeguards obligations 
with a view to ensuring international confidence in the further promotion of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. His country intended to take a leading role in improving Agency safeguards, without 
compromising their effectiveness, by making efforts to move to a State-level integrated safeguards 
approach.

20 September 2010, Page 25 
154. The DPRK nuclear issue continued to pose a grave threat to the peace and security of East Asia 
and the international community as a whole, and to the NPT regime. With regard to Iran, that country 
needed to dispel all concerns without delay and gain the confidence of the international community. 
Japan would continue to work towards settlement of those nuclear issues, including through 
implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions.

(GC(54)/4) 
5. Mr KIRIENKO (Russian Federation) read out the following message from the President of the 
Russian Federation, Dimitry Medvedev: 
ÂMy greetings to Conference participants as they mark the tenth anniversary of the launch of the 
International Project on Innovative Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO). 
ÂPut forward in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit, this Russian initiative aims to 
provide energy for humanityÂs sustainable development and to address effectively the problems 
of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and restoring the environmental health of the 
planet. I would like to express my appreciation to IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano and 
the AgencyÂs Secretariat for their constant and active support of INPRO. 
ÂDuring the past ten years a great number of innovative approaches and methods in the field of 
nuclear power technology have been proposed under the project at both the national and 
international level. Important solutions have been arrived at on issues concerning legal support 
for nuclear power infrastructure, including small and medium power reactors. All this makes it 
possible for States to meet national nuclear power requirements for economy, safety, 
environment, radioactive waste reduction and compliance with the non-proliferation regime. 
ÂRussia intends to continue contributing substantially to the development of INPRO. The 
projectÂs implementation is now entering a new stage, and we suggest that IAEA Member States 
take maximum advantage of INPROÂs potential in order to develop advanced technologies and 
strengthen international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 2 
ÂI wish General Conference participants every success in their work and all the very best.Â 
6. The success of the INPRO project had been achieved through the joint efforts of interested 
countries under the aegis of the Agency. Russia, for its part, was using the INPRO methodology for 
the evaluation of modern innovative technologies, including fast neutron reactors. Russia invited 
States to work together to develop international multilateral cooperation programmes in the area of 
fast reactors, including safety, and would consider using the multifunctional fast-breeder research 
reactor being built in Russia for broad cooperation on a multilateral and bilateral basis. 
7. In March, an international agreement had been signed by the Government of the Russian 
Federation and the Agency providing for the establishment on the territory of the Russian Federation 
of a reserve of LEU that could be supplied, through the Agency, to any Member State that met its 
non-proliferation commitments and safeguards obligations. Use of the fuel bank was voluntary for 
Member States of the Agency; nothing was being imposed on them. All expenses associated with the 
establishment of the bank and storing the LEU would be borne by the Russian Federation, nothing 
would come from the budget of the Agency. The establishment of the fuel bank was the first practical 
example of the implementation of one of the basic provisions of the AgencyÂs Statute. The guaranteed 
reserve would be moved to the International Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk by the end of 
2010, whereupon the agreement would enter into force. In the interests of transparency, Russia had 
voluntarily placed the Angarsk site under Agency safeguards as from 1 July 2010, and welcomed the 
cooperation from the Secretariat in preparing the agreement. The fuel bank was the first, but not the 
last initiative of that kind, and Russia welcomed the proposals in that regard made by the United States 
and other countries. 
8. Over the previous year, the geographical reach of RussiaÂs cooperation with respect to nuclear 
power plants had increased significantly. In China, two of the first units of the Tianwan nuclear power 
plant built with Russian assistance had been commissioned, construction of the first two units of the 
Kundankulam power plant in India had been completed, and the loading of the Russian-constructed 
Bushehr power plant in Iran had begun in August. An intergovernmental agreement covering the 
concept of build-own-operate had been signed with Turkey in connection with four units at the 
Akkuyu site. Intergovernmental agreements had also been signed with Ukraine and Armenia, and 
preparations for the signature of such agreements with Belarus and Vietnam were in progress. Work 
was also being undertaken with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Venezuela, which were launching national 
programmes for the development of nuclear power. 
9. Countries with advanced nuclear power technologies had a particular responsibility to ensure 
that the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy were accessible to all countries that met safety 
and non-proliferation commitments. Russia stood ready to offer the broadest possible cooperation in 
that regard, including through the training of staff, construction of research reactors, assurances of 
supply over the reactor lifetime, and the construction and operation of nuclear power plants. 
10. Against that background, nuclear power plants were continuing to be built in Russia, and 
10 units were currently under construction, including a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Of particular note 
was the project to construct the Baltic nuclear power plant in Kaliningrad, and his country invited the 
involvement of foreign investors interested in investing in a nuclear power plant on the territory of the 
Russian Federation. 
11. The nuclear energy market was a global open market and, in RussiaÂs view, a platform for a 
strategic open partnership and cooperation with companies in all interested countries. Russia was 
taking steps to broaden cooperation in scientific and technical areas and had now joined the Facility 
for Antiproton and Ion Research. In April, Russia had signed a memorandum with Italy for the joint 
construction of a new class of tokamak reactor called Ignitor. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 3 
12. The work to return HEU from research reactors to the Russian Federation was continuing. As of 
1 September 2010, Russia had brought back more than 482 kg of fresh HEU from 12 countries, as well 
as 894 kg of irradiated HEU from Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine, Bulgaria, the Czech 
Republic, Uzbekistan, Hungary and Kazakhstan, equivalent to the destruction of more than 30 nuclear 
warheads. 
13. A number of important events concerning nuclear non-proliferation had taken place over the 
previous year. At the Nuclear Security Summit in April, Russia had signed a protocol to amend the 
Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement concluded between Russia and the United States 
in September 2000, under which 34 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium would be converted into fuel 
for reactors used for peaceful purposes Â equivalent to the destruction of more than 4000 nuclear 
warheads. At that meeting, the President had also announced plans to shut down the last 
weapons-grade plutonium facility in Zheleznogorsk, which would help to prevent the accumulation of 
surplus plutonium stocks. Russia welcomed the results of the Summit and noted with satisfaction that 
the communiquÃ© of the Summit had reaffirmed the essential role of the Agency. 
14. Russia fully supported the AgencyÂs work to implement the Nuclear Security Plan and would be 
making a contribution to the NSF. 
15. His country welcomed the work undertaken by the Agency to promote cooperation among 
States in the many uses of nuclear energy. It supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to make the fight 
against cancer a priority area. Plans were being made to establish in Moscow a regional centre for the 
training of medical physicists and radiation specialists from the Commonwealth of Independent States, 
for which it hoped to receive assistance under the technical cooperation programme for 2012Â2013. 
16. Drawing attention to the shortage of medical isotopes, in particular molybdenum-99, he said 
that by the end of the year, the Scientific Research Institute for Nuclear Reactors would be able to 
produce 900 curies of molybdenum a week, rising to more than 2500 curies a week in 2012. The 
isotopes would be placed on the market and should go some way towards alleviating the current 
shortage. 
17. Collaboration with companies such as Toshiba, Siemens, General Electric and Uranium One 
attested to the choice that his country, like others, was making for an open partnership and open 
strategic cooperation. 
18. Cooperation with the Agency, including technical cooperation activities, served to address not 
only todayÂs problems but also those of the future. A key area was the development of young, 
qualified and motivated staff, and Russia had, in collaboration with the Agency, drawn up a draft 
agreement concerning internships for young specialists in the Secretariat, which it planned to sign 
before the end of the year. 
19. Further development of nuclear power would not be possible without close international 
collaboration and the full participation of all States, both large and small. Russia looked forward to 
open and constructive cooperation to that end. 
20. Mr GARGASH (United Arab Emirates) said that his country had decided to develop its nuclear 
energy programme in order to meet the growing domestic demand for electricity. It had taken the 
decision after assessing the available options in the light of economic and environmental factors, 
sustainability and the achievement of economic diversity. It had also attached the utmost importance 
to safety and security considerations and non-proliferation, in line with its regional and international 
obligations. 
21. His countryÂs awareness of its responsibilities had prompted it to issue in April 2008 a policy 
document on the evaluation and potential development of a peaceful nuclear energy programme, 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 4 
which set out a series of Government strategies and commitments. The core principles included full 
operational transparency and a commitment to the highest standards of nuclear safety, security and 
non-proliferation. The United Arab Emirates intended to work closely with the Agency and with 
States possessing expertise in those areas in order to develop a successful and sustainable programme. 
With a view to ensuring operational transparency, the authorities had established an international 
advisory board comprising prominent international experts. The board would continuously assess 
progress in the programmeÂs implementation and make its reports available to the local and 
international community. 
22. In December 2009, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation had awarded a contract to a 
Korean consortium to design, construct and jointly operate his countryÂs first four nuclear power 
reactors. Operation of the first reactor was scheduled to begin in 2017. 
23. The commitment of the United Arab Emirates to the highest standards of nuclear safety was 
reflected in its legal, regulatory and institutional framework. In September 2009, the Government had 
promulgated Federal Law No. 6 concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which enshrined the 
countryÂs policy obligations in respect of nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation under relevant 
international instruments, and established an independent regulatory authority. 
24. At the international level, the United Arab Emirates had acceded to a number of international 
instruments concerning nuclear safety in 2009, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety, which 
established a framework for the sharing of operational experience among Member States of the 
Agency and for the review of nuclear safety measures. The United Arab Emirates had submitted its 
first report concerning implementation of the Convention in 2010. He encouraged States that 
possessed or were planning to construct nuclear facilities to accede to the Convention. 
25. The United Arab Emirates had taken major steps to develop the requisite legislative and 
institutional infrastructure for nuclear security and was seeking to improve its export and import 
control regime. In pursuit of its policy of supporting international cooperation in the area of nuclear 
security, the country had hosted the annual Plenary Meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism in Abu Dhabi in June 2010. 
26. His countryÂs resolve to work directly with the Agency and to abide by its standards was 
reflected in the ongoing technical cooperation programme covering a variety of fields. The United 
Arab Emirates consulted the Agency on every step taken to develop its nuclear energy programme and 
greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance. It also intended to take advantage of the INIR mechanism 
and had submitted a self-evaluation report to the Agency in preparation for an INIR mission. 
27. The United Arab Emirates was committed to ensuring the long-term sustainability of its 
domestic nuclear energy programme by adopting plans and strategies that ensured the availability of 
resources and the efficient future operation of the nuclear sector. To that end, it promoted the training 
of specialized human resources and had hosted the AgencyÂs International Conference on Human 
Resource Development for Introducing and Expanding Nuclear Power Programmes in March 2010. 
28. International partnerships and cooperation were the cornerstone of a successful nuclear energy 
programme and technologically advanced countries should therefore facilitate access by less advanced 
countries to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that connection, the United Arab Emirates also 
supported the development of multilateral nuclear fuel assurance mechanisms. By adopting and 
implementing such policies and strategies, the Government hoped to create a model that could be 
studied by countries wishing to develop a nuclear energy programme with the support of the 
international community. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 5 
29. Mr LEE Ju-Ho (Republic of Korea) said that nuclear energy was not simply an energy option 
but part of the solution to the challenges of climate change and energy security. Many countries were 
now embarking on the construction of new nuclear facilities or the expansion of existing ones, and the 
previous year had seen the beginning of the construction of 12 new reactors Â the largest number of 
new constructions per annum since 1987. Such expansion had to be accompanied with the 
development of an appropriate safety infrastructure covering the legal framework, safety standards, 
human resources and security. Countries needed to assume their responsibilities: countries embarking 
on nuclear programmes should join the Agency and take measures to build an appropriate safety 
infrastructure; nuclear exporting countries should ensure the safety of reactors throughout their 
lifetimes and work closely with importing countries in developing the safety infrastructure. 
30. The preceding year, his country had begun to export nuclear reactors in earnest. As part of that 
endeavour it had developed the Integrated Regulatory Infrastructure Supporting System, which 
covered all requirements for safety and regulatory compliance, and provided support to countries in 
need in the areas of regulatory standards, safety reviews, inspections, professional training and 
capacity building. From 2010, the Republic of Korea would also increase significantly its 
extrabudgetary contributions to the Agency, with a view to assisting those countries introducing 
nuclear energy. 
31. Nuclear technology had unlimited potential to improve human lives and an essential role to play 
in achieving the MDGs, so it was deeply regrettable that its benefits were not enjoyed by all countries 
equally. His country had benefited greatly from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme since 
1961, and would change its status from a recipient to a net donor country in 2010, sharing its 
experience and knowledge. The Republic of Korea expressed its profound appreciation to the many 
Member States that had generously assisted developing countries in the areas of cancer treatment, 
diagnostics and radiology. It supported PACT through private donations and would continue to extend 
its support to Member States through PACT and other programmes by providing radiologists to work 
as instructors, and offering education and training to healthcare professionals from developing 
countries. It also planned to promote the use of radiation in developing countries through a special 
contribution to the technical cooperation programme. 
32. In view of the serious challenges posed by nuclear proliferation, illicit trafficking of sensitive 
nuclear material, and nuclear terrorism by non-State actors, it was crucial to work towards universal 
adherence to and full compliance with the comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional 
protocol in order to strengthen further the safeguards regime. His country would continue to be a 
strong supporter of the international non-proliferation regime and had acceded to all relevant 
international conventions. 
33. In the light of the nuclear renaissance, nuclear security was assuming increasing importance. 
The Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington D.C. in April 2010 had provided an opportunity for 
the international community to reaffirm its collective will to strengthen nuclear security. The Republic 
of Korea would be hosting the subsequent Nuclear Security Summit in 2012 and the Plenary Meeting 
of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism in 2011, and would continue to enhance nuclear 
security through active participation in the work of the Agency and other global partnership 
programmes. It planned to open an international nuclear security training centre in 2014 to provide 
high-quality training in the prevention of, and countermeasures against, nuclear terrorism. 
34. The DPRKÂs development of nuclear programmes was an unacceptable act of provocation that 
threatened peace and stability in north-east Asia and undermined the foundation of the international 
non-proliferation regime. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had declared that the DPRK could not 
have the status of a nuclear-weapon State and had urged it to abandon all nuclear weapons and 
existing nuclear programmes. The Republic of Korea noted with appreciation the international 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 6 
communityÂs faithful implementation of the extensive sanctions provided for in UN Security Council 
resolution 1874 (2009) that had been adopted following the DRPKÂs second nuclear test. It urged the 
DRPK to heed the calls of the international community and change its stance towards 
denuclearization, including by fulfilling its commitments under the September 2005 Joint Statement. 
His country remained committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and to a 
comprehensive resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue through diplomatic endeavours. The Agency had 
an important role to play in the denuclearization process, and his country hoped that the Agency would 
be able to resume its important monitoring and verification activities before too long. 
35. Ms BENKHADRA (Morocco) said that, in the context of increased interest in nuclear power, 
there was an even greater need for a strong non-proliferation regime. In that connection, Morocco 
supported the recommendations of the 2010 NPT Review Conference regarding the establishment of a 
NWFZ in the Middle East, which renewed calls for Israel to ratify the NPT and proposed the 
organization of an international conference in 2012 on the establishment of such a zone. The 
international community should step up efforts to address concerns over the deployment of nuclear 
weapons in the Middle East and the threat they posed to global peace and security. She emphasized the 
key role of the CTBT in building trust in the Middle East and beyond, and called on all States that had 
not yet done so to ratify that instrument. Morocco had welcomed the opportunity to co-chair, with 
France, the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty in New York on 24 and 25 September 2009, and called for the rapid entry into force of the 
CTBT. 
36. Nuclear energy was increasingly considered a viable and cost-effective way to meet growing 
energy demands, strengthen assurance of supply, reduce fossil fuel usage and combat climate change. 
Several Member States had requested Agency assistance in developing their nuclear programmes, thus 
magnifying its role in nuclear technology transfer, human resource training and the establishment of 
infrastructures. The Agency required adequate human and financial recourses to meet such demands. 
It would therefore be worth examining the possibility of securing funding from international financial 
institutions. Morocco also urged the Agency to assist developing countries wishing to establish a 
nuclear power programme, through training activities and the promotion of nuclear technologies. 
37. Her country welcomed the contribution made by Agency activities to achieving the MDGs and 
supported the various projects launched in Member States to that end. The Agency needed to 
consolidate its cooperation with other international organizations such as the FAO to enhance food 
security, and WHO to combat AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and cancer. 
38. Morocco welcomed the support it received through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme which had enabled it to build major infrastructures, including the MaÃ¢mora Nuclear 
Research Centre, and build capacities in nuclear science and technology. Such advances would play an 
important role in introducing nuclear power, which was planned for 2020Â2030. Morocco had also 
continued to develop a nuclear and radiation safety and security culture. Technical cooperation 
projects had allowed the country to use nuclear applications in sectors such as health, agriculture, 
water and the environment. Nuclear and isotopic techniques had been used to gain otherwise 
inaccessible information about the water cycle and, as a result, Morocco now had an isotopic 
hydrology atlas that would be used to manage water resources sustainably. 
39. Morocco remained committed to strengthening its national legislative and regulatory framework 
in order to ensure safety, security, non-proliferation and environmental protection in the use of nuclear 
power. The Agency had provided valuable assistance in drafting a nuclear and radiation safety and 
security law that was currently being approved by the Government, along with a decree to apply the 
provisions of that law related to the establishment of an independent nuclear and radiation safety and 
security agency. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 7 
40. Given the huge numbers of people affected by cancer worldwide, Morocco welcomed the 
Director GeneralÂs decision to prioritize efforts to combat cancer, particularly the scientific forum 
being held alongside the General Conference. Morocco would be hosting a round table discussion on 
its role in developing radiotherapy in Africa at that forum. Considerable progress in combating cancer 
had been made since the creation of the Lalla Salma Association Against Cancer in 2005. Morocco 
had a national cancer prevention and control plan for 2010Â2019 and an infrastructure for the early 
diagnosis and treatment of cancer, comprising about 15 centres distributed throughout the country. 
41. With a view to enhancing South-South and regional cooperation, Morocco worked with the 
Agency to provide training and fellowships to African radiotherapists at its institutions. It also had the 
necessary expertise to help set up radiotherapy centres and monitor their work. Morocco was also an 
active partner in AFRA. 
42. Morocco called upon those Member States that had not yet done so to deposit their instruments 
of acceptance so that the amendment to Article VI of the Statute, which dealt with representation on 
the Board of Governors, could enter into force as soon as possible. 
43. Mr SURAPRANATA (Indonesia) said that the greater emphasis being placed by the Director 
General on the promotion of nuclear technology for development, in particular cancer control, which 
his country welcomed, would help to counter the misperception that the Agency was only a nuclear 
watchdog. 
44. Indonesia continued to attach the utmost importance to the technical cooperation programme 
which was vital to the transfer of nuclear science and technology, in particular to developing countries, 
and stressed that technical cooperation activities should not be politicized in any way. Although his 
country had pledged to pay its full target share to the TCF, it shared the concerns regarding the current 
funding mechanism which relied on voluntary contributions. Efforts should be made to ensure that the 
resources for technical cooperation were sufficient, assured and predictable, and Indonesia welcomed 
the support in that regard expressed in the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
45. Indonesia commended all countries that had pledged to contribute to the Peaceful Uses 
Initiative, and suggested that a significant portion of the funds might be used to finance country-driven 
technical cooperation projects. 
46. While the Agency should be further strengthened to ensure that it was equipped with the 
necessary means, resources and authority, efforts should be made to ensure that any additional 
responsibilities it was given would not prevent it from carrying out its mandated tasks in the area of 
verification, safety and the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
47. Indonesia appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to mitigate the effects of the world food crisis 
through the use of its scientific and technological resources to help improve agricultural productivity 
and quality. It was committed to developing an integrated and comprehensive approach to cancer, and 
welcomed the imPACT mission to be sent to Indonesia the following October to assess the 
infrastructure facilities, human resource capacities and other technical expertise required for cancer 
control there. His country had used the WHO core self-assessment tools as the basis for developing a 
country project design for resource mobilization, and would be hosting the 33rd meeting of RCA 
national representatives in 2011 in support of regional activities to promote the application of nuclear 
science and technology. 
48. Despite having sufficient human resources and the necessary basic infrastructure, Indonesia had 
been unable to establish a nuclear power programme, primarily because of a lack of public acceptance. 
However, in view of the countryÂs growth rate, it was not realistic for Indonesia to leave the nuclear 
power option out of its future energy mix. It would therefore continue its efforts in that regard. The 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 8 
report of the INIR carried out by the Agency in Indonesia in 2009 indicated that sufficient preparatory 
work had been conducted on most infrastructure issues to enable the country to give further 
consideration to nuclear power. 
49. INPRO was an important vehicle for the exchange of information among participating 
countries, and Indonesia would endeavour to continue supporting the project. 
50. Indonesia commended the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear safety, and had almost 
completed ratification of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. It continued to support the role of the Asian Nuclear Safety 
Network and had hosted the NetworkÂs Third Nuclear Safety Strategy Dialogue Meeting where 
participating countries had reached a common understanding of the importance of the human and IT 
network in facilitating and improving nuclear safety in the region. 
51. Indonesia attached importance to nuclear security and had ratified the 2005 amendment to the 
CPPNM. The Agency had an important role to play in that area, including through the implementation 
of the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013. His country was pleased to note that the Nuclear Security 
Report 2010 had indicated that responsibility for nuclear security rested entirely with each State, and 
stressed that efforts to strengthen nuclear security should not hamper international cooperation in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
52. With regard to import and export controls of nuclear material and radioactive sources, he said 
that the Indonesian Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency (BAPETEN) collaborated with the customs 
authority and provided a licensing process through a licensing and inspection system website and text 
messaging system. Indonesia welcomed the AgencyÂs assistance in enhancing security measures 
through the development of an Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan, as well as joint efforts with 
the European Union to help strengthen physical protection measures and capabilities for detection of 
and response to illicit trafficking. 
53. His country had never wavered in its commitment to the strengthening of safeguards and had 
been among the first to ratify and implement the additional protocol. In June 2010, it had successfully 
co-chaired the first meeting of the Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network in Bali, which had provided a 
forum for discussions on how to enhance the effective implementation of the comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and additional protocol in the region. It was essential to maintain the credibility 
of Agency safeguards, including by strengthening the system for protecting the confidentiality of 
safeguards information. 
54. Indonesia welcomed the successful outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and 
commended all parties to the NPT on the spirit of compromise that they had demonstrated during the 
negotiations. Compliance with the Final Document was the only viable option for moving forward 
with respect to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
55. His country continued to support a comprehensive solution of the DPRK nuclear issue through 
the six-party talks. Allowing the AgencyÂs inspectors to resume their verification activities would 
constitute an important confidence-building measure in that regard. 
56. The nuclear issue in the Middle East could not be solved without the active and constructive 
participation of all countries of the region. Indonesia remained deeply concerned about one countryÂs 
nuclear capabilities and its defiant attitude towards placing its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards. 
57. Indonesia reaffirmed the inalienable right of any country, including Iran, to develop nuclear 
technology for peaceful purposes, provided that the activities were undertaken in accordance with 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 9 
safeguards obligations. It therefore fully supported continued cooperation between the Agency and 
Iran in order to resolve outstanding issues. 
58. Mr YOUNIS (Egypt) said that his country had been cooperating closely with the Agency for 
more than half a century in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy by developing scientific and 
operational capacities and human resources and by actively participating in all the AgencyÂs activities. 
It had benefited from many technical cooperation projects, including assistance in ensuring the 
optimum use of research reactors through the development of qualified human resources. 
59. Egypt believed that priority should be given to cancer therapy and, in particular, to the 
production of the requisite radioisotopes. It hoped shortly to complete the construction of a new 
facility for the production of medical and industrial radioisotopes, including molybdenum-99, in order 
to offset the shortage of such products due to the closure of numerous research reactors in various 
parts of the world. 
60. Egypt was continuing its efforts to promote food security with the AgencyÂs assistance through 
the use of gamma radiation to produce crops with the requisite characteristics, application of nuclear 
techniques in the farming of desert areas, development of plant species that thrived in desert 
conditions and production of agricultural hydrogel from polymerized material to increase the water 
retention of sandy soil. 
61. Following President MubarakÂs decision to launch a public dialogue in December 2006 on the 
use of nuclear energy as a strategic option for electricity generation and the GovernmentÂs 
development of an integrated national strategy to that end, Egypt had cooperated closely with the 
Agency to perform relevant studies. Agreement had been reached on the development of an integrated 
plan for cooperation in a variety of areas in order to establish the necessary nuclear facilities and 
infrastructure, for instance a basic nuclear programme and site studies, development of a legislative 
framework and the drafting of a law to serve as the basis for the establishment of an independent 
nuclear safety authority. In the light of the outcome of the GovernmentÂs studies and the public 
dialogue, President Mubarak had announced on 29 October 2007 EgyptÂs strategic decision to launch 
a programme to construct a number of nuclear power plants for electricity generation in cooperation 
with its international partners and to begin construction of the first plant in cooperation with the 
Agency. A law concerning the organization of nuclear and radiation activities had been promulgated 
in March 2010, providing for, inter alia, the establishment of a nuclear and radiation safety authority. 
El-Dabaa had been selected as the site of the first nuclear power plant, for which the specifications 
would be submitted by the end of 2010. A total of four power plants were to be constructed by 2025. 
Egypt hoped to continue cooperating with the Agency in implementing the programme, selecting new 
sites, and training human resources. 
62. Calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons had intensified since the previous year and the 
States parties to the NPT had agreed on a work plan to achieve nuclear disarmament. That trend had 
not, however, been accompanied by action to boost the AgencyÂs activities in support of nuclear 
disarmament, even though one of the objectives under the Medium Term Strategy for 2006Â2011 was 
to contribute, as appropriate, to effective verification of nuclear arms control and reduction 
agreements, including nuclear disarmament, in accordance with Article II of the Statute. Egypt urged 
all Member States to take serious steps to achieve that goal. 
63. The Middle East remained a special case in efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons, as 
demonstrated by the consensus achieved at the 2010 NPT Review Conference on the convening of a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in that region. The AgencyÂs credibility depended to a large extent on the seriousness with 
which its Member States addressed the issue of nuclear disarmament in the Middle East and the 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 10 
application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region. Although 18 years had 
elapsed since the adoption by the General Conference of a resolution calling on all States in the 
Middle East to apply comprehensive safeguards, Israel had taken no steps to achieve that objective. 
The Agency should fulfil the mandate assigned to it under the resolutions adopted at the 53rd session 
of the General Conference and disclose whatever information it possessed concerning Israeli nuclear 
facilities that should be placed under Agency safeguards. 
64. The General Conference needed to reaffirm the responsibility of the Agency, as the executive 
arm of the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, to take serious action to address the 
nuclear threat in the Middle East region by dealing with the resolutions under the relevant agenda 
items in a manner that guaranteed respect for the NPT regime and promoted regional and international 
peace and security. To that end, Egypt was again submitting to the current session a draft resolution 
concerning the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. 
65. Egypt suggested that the Agency should prepare reference documents for the planned 
2012 conference on the Middle East, including a document concerning the scope and options for the 
application of measures to verify the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the region and a draft model 
agreement on an NWFZ, based on its previous work in the Middle East and its experience with other 
NWFZs. Politicization, selectivity and the application of double standards should be avoided, and the 
principle of non-interference in countriesÂ internal affairs should be respected. 
66. He commended the AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear information and nuclear knowledge 
management and in addressing the risk of loss of such information at industrial nuclear facilities. He 
also emphasized the important role of INIS in the gathering and storage of nuclear data. 
67. Egypt greatly appreciated the continuous development and improvement of the technical 
cooperation programme based on a partnership among all Member States. It supported the technical 
cooperation strategy and, in particular, the focus on projects with a tangible impact and those with an 
end user. His country also supported the policy of holding early consultations with Member States 
concerning the details of technical cooperation projects, the preparation of CPFs, and the drafting of 
guidelines concerning the role and responsibilities of national focal points with a view to improving 
the quality of communication among project coordinators, end users and the AgencyÂs Secretariat. 
68. Egypt had opened its plants and facilities to other Arab and African States and shared its 
expertise with them in the area of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It supported AFRA and its projects, 
which made a tangible contribution to the socio-economic development and alleviated the suffering of 
the people of Africa. 
69. Mr RANAWAKA (Sri Lanka) said that the NPT was the cornerstone of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and fundamental to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy. Nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation could not be pursued 
independently of one another. Also, the obligations and commitments undertaken by countries should 
not jeopardize their sovereign and inalienable right to develop, research, produce and use nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
70. His country noted with satisfaction the actions recommended by the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference and called on the Agency and its Member States to work together to implement those 
actions. 
71. The Agency played a crucial role in enhancing the peaceful use of nuclear energy and 
technology through the expertise it had acquired over the preceding five decades. Sri Lanka was 
confident that the Agency would continue to maintain its independence, balance and impartiality. It 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 11 
required the support of Member States in successfully carrying out its tasks and all avenues of 
diplomacy and dialogue should be followed to deal with contentious issues. 
72. The world faced the growing challenges of climate change and the depletion of fossil fuel 
sources. There was renewed interest in nuclear energy in the context of renewable energy and 
sustainable development. Under the Mahinda Chintana Vision for the Future programme, the President 
of Sri Lanka had formulated an energy development strategy based on energy, economy and 
efficiency, and the country was reviewing its energy policy. 
73. The Government of Sri Lanka had begun to develop a national infrastructure for enhanced 
productivity. The new Hambantota port in the south of the country had been opened in 2010 and the 
development of a second international airport, bunkering facilities and other large infrastructure 
projects were under way. 
74. Energy demands in the country had increased in conjunction with an 8.5% increase in GDP in 
the second quarter of 2010. To meet future energy demands, energy production would have to be 
increased and non-conventional renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and mini-hydro power 
incorporated. Sri Lanka had therefore decided to consider incorporating nuclear power into its energy 
mix. The Government had authorized the Atomic Energy Authority to conduct a pre-feasibility study 
on using nuclear power from 2020, with the technical assistance of the Agency. Additionally, a 
programme on enhancing human resource development in the area of nuclear energy had been 
initiated in collaboration with the engineering universities in Sri Lanka. The Atomic Energy Authority 
Act No. 19 was being updated to meet present and future requirements in the fields of nuclear power 
generation, nuclear terrorism, environmental protection and nuclear safety and security, and the new 
version would be forwarded to the Agency. It was hoped that the updated Act would be finalized and 
approved by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 2010. 
75. Sri Lanka was embarking on a new era of economic development after overcoming the threat of 
terrorism it faced for nearly 30 years. The country fully supported global measures to combat terrorism 
and had become a signatory to a number of international conventions, including the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. As the acquisition of nuclear weapons 
or material by terrorist and extremist groups posed a real global threat, the physical protection of 
nuclear material was essential. 
76. Sri Lanka had joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism as well as the 
Megaports Initiative led by the United States of America to improve the safety and security of 
radioactive sources and monitor the international movement of nuclear material through its ports. 
Sri Lanka had also provided security upgrades at radiotherapy facilities and gamma irradiation centres 
under the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. An agreement with the United States Government on the 
provision of technical assistance for radioactive waste disposal in Sri Lanka was currently being 
finalized. In June 2009, Sri Lanka had hosted a South Asia workshop on the implementation of UN 
Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) concerning non-State actors and WMD. 
77. Since nuclear science and technology for development was an important pillar of the AgencyÂs 
work, Sri Lanka attached great importance to the technical assistance provided to developing 
countries. Activities should be strengthened further, and sufficient, adequate and predictable resources 
allocated to the TCF. The delivery of technical cooperation should also take the needs of recipient 
countries into consideration to enhance the impact of such assistance. 
78. Sri Lanka had greatly benefited from the technical cooperation programme in such areas as 
human health, agriculture, industry, nutrition and radiation protection. It had signed its CPF for 2009Â 
2013, under which Agency cooperation would be provided for energy planning, nuclear medicine, 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 12 
industrial applications, control of vector-borne infectious diseases and capacity-building in national 
nuclear research institutes. 
79. His country had strengthened its radiological emergency preparedness by setting up sites to 
detect background radiation, establishing a radiological warning system and developing national 
training programmes with the collaboration of the Agency on dealing with radiological emergencies 
and similar situations. 
80. Sri Lanka had been receiving technical assistance in nuclear imaging over the preceding 
20 years. Four nuclear imaging centres had been provided with equipment and expert services, and a 
source recommended for the supply of radioisotopes. In view of the importance of nuclear imaging in 
the early detection of cancer, especially in developing countries, he expressed his countryÂs hope that 
the supply of technetium-99m could become more reliable. 
81. Sri Lanka appreciated the AgencyÂs contribution to the establishment of a biodosimetry 
laboratory and noted that the Atomic Energy Authority could now offer biodosimetry services to 
individuals on request. Advanced nuclear analytical services such as total reflection X-ray 
fluorescence and improved capabilities in nuclear analytical methods had aided research into the 
causes of chronic kidney disease, a major health concern in parts of Sri Lanka. 
82. PACT was a notable example of the peaceful uses of the atom. As the host of a PACT Model 
Demonstration Site, Sri Lanka hoped that the success of such Sites would help to provide models for 
comprehensive cancer care in the developing world. He thanked India for its donation under PACT of 
a Bhabhatron-II radiotherapy machine, which was urgently needed. 
83. Under an RCA programme, Sri Lanka had recognized the importance of non-destructive testing 
to enhance safety and productivity in industry and was planning to establish a national centre for 
non-destructive testing that would perform such work on a large scale. 
84. Mr TEKKARI (Tunisia) said that his country accorded priority to universal access to education, 
support for scientific research and technological innovation. As a result, expenditure on scientific 
research had increased from 0.2% of GDP in 1991 to 1.25% in 2009, with a further increase to 
1.5% planned by 2014. Research centres and laboratories had been established in the countryÂs 
universities, and the number of researchers, engineers and doctorate-level students had increased many 
times over. Special attention had been given to the various uses of nuclear energy and technology, 
given their important role in industrial development, health, agriculture and assurance of energy and 
drinking water supplies. 
85. Renewable energy sources, particularly nuclear energy, were recognized as the best options for 
reducing the costs of electricity generation and seawater desalination. The President of Tunisia had 
therefore commissioned a study on the feasibility of using nuclear power for electricity generation by 
2020. Work towards its introduction had already begun, for instance through the training of human 
resources in various branches of nuclear science. 
86. Since 2008, Tunisia had been assembling a team of specialists to draft appropriate legislation on 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Such work had to be accompanied by the establishment of a 
technical and administrative infrastructure in order to ensure the security and safety of facilities, the 
general public and the environment. 
87. Tunisia considered the adoption and implementation of international instruments pertaining to 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy to be a prerequisite to developing nuclear facilities, as they ensured 
the success and transparency of such programmes. In 2010, Tunisia had completed the requisite 
constitutional procedures for ratification of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the amendment to the 
CPPNM, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and the 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 13 
amendment to Article XIV.A of the Statute. It also hoped to ratify the additional protocol as soon as it 
had completed the necessary legislative and regulatory procedures, and to adopt the Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the 
Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. 
88. Since becoming a member in 1957, Tunisia had continuously striven to develop its cooperative 
relationship with the Agency and to support common interests. During 2010 it had received 21 trainees 
from friendly countries on fellowships and scientific visits funded by the Agency. 
89. An electronic accelerator had been installed in the National Centre for Nuclear Science and 
Technology with a view to developing new methods of radiation processing. The Centre was also 
setting up a unit in cooperation with the Agency to ensure the safety of low- and medium-activity 
radioactive sources. Work was also continuing on a neutron activation laboratory for measuring 
low-concentration elements to monitor environmental pollution and product quality, and for 
archaeological applications. Tunisian investors were funding the establishment of a cyclotron to be 
used for medical purposes, especially in combating cancer, and an anti-cancer association had been set 
up. 
90. Tunisia was committed to honouring its financial obligations to the Agency. It intended to pay 
its full TCF target share for 2011, and had paid its 2010 contributions in full and on time. Tunisia 
hoped that consensus would be reached on a substantial increase in the AgencyÂs budget that would 
enable it to continue playing its basic role of promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy, or that 
mechanisms would be created to meet the growing financial burden arising from other activities so 
that the requisite balance could be maintained. 
91. Tunisia was eager to develop cooperation with fellow Member States in peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy and technology. As the host country of the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, it welcomed the joint 
convening by that Agency and the IAEA of the First Arab Conference on the Prospects of Nuclear 
Power for Electricity Generation and Seawater Desalination in Tunis in June 2010 and called for 
further development of the partnership between the two. 
92. Tunisia commended the steps taken by the Agency to strengthen the safeguards regime. It hoped 
that they would lead to effective progress towards nuclear disarmament and encourage all Member 
States to accede to the NPT in order to build international confidence and reassure the public, 
especially in the Middle East. Tunisia supported the creation of a zone free of all weapons of mass 
destruction in the Middle East, and the placement of all nuclear facilities, including those of Israel, 
under Agency safeguards. 
93. Mr DJELIC (Serbia) said that his country, which sought to achieve the central strategic goal of 
European Union membership, was dedicated to meeting all its obligations under the Stabilisation and 
Association Agreement it had signed in April 2007, including those related to nuclear safety and 
safeguards. 
94. During a visit by the former Director General to Belgrade in July 2009, Serbia had signed an 
additional protocol, which would be ratified and implemented shortly. In addition, the Serbian 
Parliament had enacted a law on ionizing radiation protection and nuclear safety that was in line with 
international requirements and European standards, and the fully independent Agency for Ionizing 
Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety of Serbia had been established. A US $25 million programme 
had been negotiated to repatriate spent fuel from the Vinca research reactor to the Russian Federation. 
The Agency was working with the Serbian Government and a newly established public company to 
implement the programme, which would be completed before the 55th session of the General 
Conference. Serbia was grateful to the Agency, the European Union, the United States, Russia, the 
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Hungary for their assistance in that regard. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 14 
95. Serbia fully supported efforts to combat nuclear terrorism. In order to prevent the misuse of 
nuclear and other radioactive material, knowledge and technologies, his country was constantly 
improving its physical protection of nuclear and radioactive material and its illicit trafficking 
prevention capabilities. 
96. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were indispensable in assisting developing 
countries, particularly in achieving goals in such areas as safeguards, safety and security, regulatory 
infrastructure, and radiation medicine and diagnostics. Serbia was a major beneficiary of technical 
assistance and was particularly grateful to the staff of the Division for Europe and the Office of 
Nuclear Security for their efforts. The projects submitted for the 2012Â2013 cycle were based on the 
CPF signed in September, and covered areas of importance for his country including nuclear safety 
and security, radiotherapy and human health, and agriculture. His country was grateful to the Agency 
for its support in procuring some Â400 million from the European Investment Bank and other sources 
that would be invested over the subsequent four years in SerbiaÂs scientific and technological 
infrastructure. 
97. Finally, he noted that Serbia had met all its financial obligations to the Agency and would 
continue to do so in the future. 
98. Ms TCHUENTE (Cameroon) welcomed the remarkable progress and encouraging results 
achieved by the Agency over the preceding year in tackling the global challenges of famine, endemic 
and emergent diseases, water and energy shortages, environmental degradation and nuclear 
proliferation and terrorism. 
99. The international ministerial conference on nuclear energy organized by the Agency and China 
in 2009 had provided an opportunity for high-level exchanges on prospects in that field. Cameroon 
agreed with the views expressed that there was a need to develop nuclear reactors of a size better 
adapted to the needs of developing countries, and to promote access for all to nuclear power 
technology with a view to facilitating sustainable development. 
100. Given the additional safety and security constraints and need for more specialized human 
resources stemming from the growing demand for nuclear technology, Cameroon welcomed the 
AgencyÂs assistance to Member States in developing appropriate training programmes. Assistance in 
areas related to uranium mining, particular to developing countries with uranium reserves, needed to 
be strengthened. Her country welcomed the initiatives aimed at creating an LEU reserve to assure the 
supply of nuclear fuel to Member States. In view of the growing global demand for nuclear fuel, such 
strategies had to be constantly reviewed and adapted equitably to the needs of all parts of the world. 
101. One of the barriers to the expansion of nuclear power was the issue of radioactive waste and 
spent fuel management. Solutions had to be found urgently, as nuclear power was becoming an 
essential option for most countries. Cameroon urged the Agency to continue its work through INPRO, 
which could calm fears over radioactive waste and the safety risks associated with nuclear power in 
countries with limited technical capabilities. 
102. Nuclear technology continued to make vital contributions to human development in fields 
including health care, food, water resource management and environmental protection. Cameroon 
encouraged the Agency to devote particular attention to problems related to climate change which 
could cause food shortages and humanitarian disasters. Programmes to develop drought-tolerant, 
fast-growing mutant crop strains deserved the AgencyÂs ongoing support. 
103. Endemic diseases, such as malaria, continued to pose a grave threat in African countries, while 
HIV/AIDS continued to spread rapidly. The Agency should continue its activities in that regard until 
such diseases were fully eradicated. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 15 
104. Cameroon noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs regular organization of international 
conferences to raise awareness and share experiences in order to improve nuclear safety and security 
throughout the world. The conference held in December 2009 in Cape Town had been particularly 
important for the promotion of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa. Such meetings 
helped to avoid overconfidence and maintain vigilance in applying regulations. 
105. Nuclear safety and security were cross-border issues. Her country encouraged the Agency to use 
regional and international networks to build capacities, disseminate best practices and improve 
radiological emergency response. 
106. At the heart of the AgencyÂs statutory mission was the technical cooperation programme, 
through which it provided needy Member States with support in acquiring advanced technology to aid 
development. Since most Member States were developing countries, Cameroon supported increasing 
the technical cooperation budget to meet their growing needs, which resulted from a greater number of 
nuclear applications in their development strategies. 
107. Cameroon benefited from the AgencyÂs technical assistance in support of its socio-economic 
development strategy. In 2009, national and regional projects had been implemented in the areas of 
food, human health and nutrition, animal production and health, plant production, water resource 
management, industrial applications of radiation, and nuclear safety and radiation protection. Through 
such projects, scientists and technicians from Cameroon had benefited from training fellowships and 
scientific visits, and various organizations had been supplied with scientific equipment to strengthen 
their institutional capacities. The National Radiation Protection Agency had received quality control 
and X-ray equipment, along with an expert mission to set up a national training course for technical 
staff. With the AgencyÂs assistance, her country hoped it would soon have a fully operational national 
regulatory authority. Cameroon also hoped the Agency would support it in its plan to introduce 
nuclear power into its energy mix. 
108. Thanks to the AgencyÂs technical assistance, Cameroon had two radiotherapy services and a 
nuclear medicine service. However, those capacities were still insufficient to serve CameroonÂs 
population of 19 million people. His country would rely on the AgencyÂs support to further expand its 
national cancer treatment system. 
109. Cameroon believed that international technical cooperation was vital to the development of 
nuclear applications and therefore supported the work of AFRA. The meeting of AFRAÂs Technical 
Working Group that had taken place in YaoundÃ© in July 2009 had marked the twentieth anniversary of 
AFRA. The event had been covered by national and international media, giving the general public an 
insight into the major contribution made by AFRA to regional cooperation and development. In 2009, 
Cameroon had also hosted a coordination meeting for the regional project on improving crop 
production through mutation and biotechnology techniques, and national institutions had hosted 
short-term training fellowships and scientific visits. 
110. She expressed her countryÂs gratitude for the AgencyÂs support for its national cattle artificial 
insemination laboratories, livestock vaccination projects and malaria immunology studies. In the 
2012Â2013 technical cooperation cycle, CameroonÂs needs would focus on water resource 
management, mineral resource evaluation, energy planning, industrial uses of radiation and radiation 
protection. 
111. Cameroon recognized the unique role played by the Agency in providing assurances that 
safeguarded nuclear material was used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Cameroon supported the 
implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and hoped that NWFZs would be extended 
to all the regions of the world in support of the international nuclear safety and security regime and 
total disarmament. The Agency could use its verification expertise to help in establishing such zones. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 16 
112. Cameroon called on the Agency to increase its support to AFRA, which was recognized under 
the Pelindaba Treaty as the reference framework for promoting peaceful nuclear applications in 
Africa. 
113. Mr SWARTZ (Botswana) said that atomic energy provided hope for a clean and reliable 
alternative energy source for the future. His country supported all efforts by the Agency to uphold the 
principles of the NPT safeguards agreement and additional protocol and to prevent the diversion of 
atomic energy to military uses, whether directly or indirectly. 
114. Botswana was determined to meet its obligations as a Member State of the Agency, for example 
by strengthening the functions of its Radiation Protection Board and establishing a waste management 
facility. 
115. BotswanaÂs National Development Plan reflected its commitment to nuclear security and 
regulatory independence, which would enhance the effectiveness of the legislative framework and the 
efficiency of the regulatory infrastructure. 
116. Through its technical cooperation programme, the Agency had provided generous support and 
assistance to Botswana in the form of expert advice, monitoring, equipment, and staff training, thus 
benefiting the population. 
117. Botswana would soon accede to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident 
and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency and 
intended to continue to review other conventions and agreements with a view to acceding to them as 
appropriate. 
118. Like other African Member States, Botswana needed support and assistance in the acquisition, 
adoption, adaptation and use of appropriate nuclear technologies to catalyse economic development 
and contribute to poverty reduction and fulfilment of the MDGs. AFRA offered an environment 
conducive to achieving those goals. 
119. Botswana continued to make progress towards alleviating the impact of HIV/AIDS. The 
increasing incidence of other diseases, such as cancer, placed a growing the burden on the countryÂs 
already overstretched medical facilities. The AgencyÂs recent focus on cancer treatment and its 
research support on food and nutrition intervention techniques using stable isotopes were welcome 
developments in which Botswana was keen to participate. 
120. Botswana had just finalized its CPF for 2011Â2015 which coincided with and was based on the 
National Development Plan for 2010Â2016. It would therefore be an opportune period for the country 
to tackle health issues, especially cancer, which was on the increase in Africa. It would also focus on 
climate-change related issues such as drought and livestock diseases, which were major threats to food 
security in Botswana. Other development priorities included energy planning, water resource 
management and strengthening of regulatory structures. 
121. Mr HENDRY (United Kingdom) said that his countryÂs policy document Road to 2010, setting 
out a vision of how the country and the international community could best address core 
nuclear-related issues, had received positive feedback. It had helped to maintain focus in preparing for 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which had reached consensus on a pragmatic and valuable 
outcome document. That achievement should not be underestimated: parties to the NPT had shown 
determination and cooperation in reaffirming their commitment to non-proliferation and the ways in 
which that commitment would be pursued. At the heart of the outcome document was the complete 
understanding that the Agency would continue to play the central role in ensuring a safe, secure and 
proliferation-free nuclear future. His country welcomed the constructive discussions taking place to 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 17 
ensure that the Agency would continue to have the resources and tools necessary to do its job in an 
efficient and effective manner. 
122. Growing interest in nuclear power was inevitable if the objective of energy security was to be 
pursued with minimal effects on climate change. With the global population expected to rise to 
8.2 billion by 2030 and global electricity demand growing by 2.5% per year Â more in developing 
countries Â the place of nuclear power in providing a greater share of reliable low-carbon energy was 
assured. The United Kingdom expected that nuclear power provided without government subsidy 
would continue to play a significant role in domestic electricity generation, and a number of 
commercial enterprises had shown interest in investing in a Ânuclear new-buildÂ programme in the 
United Kingdom. The Government would work with them to ensure that their plans could be carried 
out as part of an overall low-carbon energy strategy. To that end, unnecessary obstacles to such 
investment would be removed, inter alia, by streamlining planning and making a decision about 
regulatory justification of new nuclear reactor designs. The Government also wanted to provide the 
long-term certainty needed for clean energy projects by putting a price on carbon, and was taking steps 
to secure the necessary investment in nuclear power, thus enabling the first new station to be in 
operation by 2018. 
123. In the face of a potential worldwide nuclear renaissance, action should be taken to reduce 
proliferation risks that could arise as a result. The challenge was to minimize the risks while taking full 
advantage of the opportunities, and the stakes were considerable. 
124. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had noted the enduring commitment to safeguards, along 
with security and safety, that would need to accompany the development of nuclear energy. 
Strengthening and enhancing the AgencyÂs safeguards capabilities was of the utmost priority. He 
urged those non-nuclear-weapon States that had still to do so to conclude and bring into force 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols and, whenever relevant, to amend their 
small quantities protocols. The technical challenges that the implementation of safeguards might entail 
for some countries were considerable, and the United Kingdom remained open to sharing knowledge, 
know-how and best practice in that field with requesting countries. The United Kingdom was proud of 
its long record of assisting Agency safeguards work through its national safeguards support 
programme, particularly the training of existing and new safeguards inspectors, which would continue 
to be a priority as the number of facilities and activities worldwide increased in number, size and 
complexity. The safeguards regime, in particular the AgencyÂs powers of inspection, needed to 
continue evolving in order to meet concerns about non-compliant and uncooperative states. 
125. The threat posed by those who sought to acquire and use nuclear devices for terrorist and other 
non-peaceful purposes was real and of growing concern. Addressing that threat was a vital aspect of 
the international non-proliferation regime and the AgencyÂs work. His country looked forward to the 
imminent completion of INFCIRC/225/Rev.5. Noting that only 41 States had ratified the important 
amendment to the CPPNM, he expressed his countryÂs readiness to work with the Agency and other 
States Parties to help ensure its early entry into force. As part of its ongoing commitment to nuclear 
security, his Government would contribute a further Â£4 million to the NSF in 2010. 
126. The United Kingdom urged all Member States seeking to introduce nuclear activities to accede 
to the relevant nuclear safety conventions, in particular the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. His country particularly welcomed the adoption in June 2009 of the Nuclear Safety 
Directive of the European Union, which was based on the AgencyÂs Safety Fundamentals. It was also 
important to foster a culture of vigilance and willingness to share best practice and improve safety 
procedures and regimes. There was a greater need than ever for all stakeholders to work together to 
further improve health and safety standards at new and existing nuclear facilities. 
GC(54)/OR.2 
20 September 2010, Page 18 
127. In line with the international commitment made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, it was 
important to explore further the development of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. The 
approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a fuel reserve in Russia was an important 
step, and the United Kingdom looked forward to further, full and transparent discussion on other 
potential mechanisms. Following discussions with potential stakeholders, the United Kingdom 
intended to present to the Board its concept for a virtual nuclear fuel assurance mechanism to help 
facilitate access to nuclear energy, enabling countries to avoid the huge costs and technological 
challenges involved in establishing their own nuclear fuel cycle. None of the proposed measures 
would affect a StateÂs rights under the NPT; on the other hand, not all States would find fuel assurance 
mechanisms useful. The aim was to ensure that the potential for such mechanisms to assist with the 
economic and safe expansion of nuclear energy was not ignored, and that full and open discussions 
took place to examine the possibilities available. 
128. The Director GeneralÂs latest report on Iran reinforced the message that the country was 
continuing to defy UN resolutions and failing to cooperate fully with the Agency. Iran had not notified 
the Agency in a timely manner of its decision to construct, or authorize construction of, two facilities, 
which was inconsistent with its obligation under the Subsidiary Arrangements to its safeguards 
agreement. The UN Security Council had sent a strong signal in June 2010 that IranÂs continued 
failure to comply with its international obligations could not be ignored. The United Kingdom did not 
question or challenge IranÂs right to peaceful nuclear energy, but with that right came important 
responsibilities that Iran had continually failed to accept. The Director General had indicated that Iran 
had not provided the necessary cooperation to permit the Agency to confirm that all nuclear material 
there was in peaceful activities. Iran needed to cooperate fully with the Agency and comply with 
Security Council resolutions so as to restore international confidence in its nuclear enrichment 
programme. 
129. He expressed his countryÂs deep concern at the DPRKÂs continued lack of cooperation with the 
Agency, and called on that country to resume cooperation with the Agency, comply immediately with 
all relevant Security Council resolutions, and refrain from any further provocative actions. The 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was vital for peace and stability in that region and beyond.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 (continued) 
(GC(54)/4) 
1. Mr KYRLE (Austria) commended the professionalism, impartiality and independence with 
which the AgencyÂs mandate was being carried out, particularly at a time of major changes in the 
management team. The issues before the General Conference reflected the AgencyÂs wide-ranging 
technical responsibilities, as well as a number of issues whose solutions depended on political 
discussions in other forums. He called upon participants to work for constructive solutions to the 
fundamental challenges which faced all countries in the areas of promoting peace and development 
and protecting health and the environment. 
2. Cancer, the subject of the 2010 Scientific Forum, had once been thought to be a problem mainly 
affecting industrialized countries. Now, however, it had been recognized as a threat to everyone in the 
world. Nuclear science and technology, together with other preventative and curative measures, could 
substantially increase cancer patientsÂ chances of survival so that they could provide for their families 
and remain productive members of society. Other non-power applications of nuclear science and 
technology could be used to address such global threats as climate change, food insecurity, shortages 
of drinking water and environmental deterioration. 
3. Austria would do its utmost to make its full contribution to the TCF but, owing to delays in 
national budget negotiations and planning, his Government would be unable to make its formal pledge 
until later in the year. 
4. Nuclear power was often cited as one way of helping to counter the threat of climate change. 
Although Austria valued the work of the Agency in assisting countries which chose to use nuclear 
power to do so safely, his Government believed that the risks of nuclear power far outweighed the 
advantages, given the high initial capital costs, the environmental and financial costs over time and the 
lack of a sustainable solution to the problem of nuclear waste. Opting for nuclear power was a 
long-term commitment which would be binding on future generations and divert resources from more 
cost-effective and urgent measures to combat climate change. Also, expanding the use of nuclear 
power increased the risk of proliferation, particularly since the international community had still not 
agreed on a multilateral framework for the nuclear fuel cycle. 
5. The AgencyÂs verification and technical expertise were crucial for the implementation of the 
NPT and the AgencyÂs work had been frequently referred to at the NPT Review Conference in 
May 2010. In particular, the Conference had adopted an action plan which included implementation of 
the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and the Agency had been requested to be part of that. In that 
context, his Government urged all States to refrain from action which might jeopardize the success of 
that nascent process, particularly while discussing the General Conference resolution on Israeli nuclear 
capabilities. Austria welcomed the fact that the Review Conference had reaffirmed the unequivocal 
commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals. 
6. It was essential for the international community to be sure that nuclear power was being used 
for exclusively peaceful purposes. That was, however, not the case at present. Austria therefore urged 
the Islamic Republic of Iran to address the international communityÂs outstanding concerns and 
engage in a constructive dialogue. Also, his country looked forward to full cooperation by the Syrian 
Arab Republic with the Agency, including the application of an additional protocol to its safeguards 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 2 
agreement. Furthermore, Austria joined other countries in urging the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear 
weapons and missile programmes and comply with its international obligations. 
7. The Agency safeguards system was an indispensable part of the international nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. The current verification standard was a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement plus an additional protocol. The effective application of that standard would go a long way 
to rebuild international confidence in countries which had given cause for concern. Austria recognized 
the need to foster the AgencyÂs capacity to perform credible and timely analyses of safeguards 
samples. As the host country, it fully supported plans for the modernization of the Safeguards 
Analytical Laboratory in Seibersdorf, Austria, under the full control of the Agency, using land 
adjacent to the AgencyÂs existing laboratories. Austria likewise supported the construction of the 
Clean Laboratory Extension (CLE) and the related project on Enhancing Capabilities of the 
Safeguards Analytical Services (ECAS). 
8. Austria, a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs safety standards programme, looked forward to 
publication of the remaining general safety requirements. The AgencyÂs safety services could provide 
additional confirmation of national compliance with safety standards. Austria hoped that European 
Union Member States would make use of the AgencyÂs Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) 
missions when implementing the relevant provisions of the recent European Union nuclear safety 
directive. 
9. His country had followed with interest the discussions on the possible creation of a global 
nuclear liability regime. However, the conventions under discussion provided less protection for 
potential victims than his own countryÂs nuclear liability system, which provided for unlimited 
liability and awarded jurisdiction to the court in whose territory damage was caused. Austria was 
concerned that the maximum liability amounts laid down in the Paris and Vienna Conventions were 
inadequate and that the principle of channelling liability claims was unsatisfactory. 
10. The security of nuclear material and facilities was a legitimate concern of all States. Countries 
must continue to demonstrate to their populations, to neighbouring countries and the entire world that 
they had strong security systems. He called upon all States Parties to the CPPNM to ratify the 
amendment to the Convention, which substantially strengthened it. 
11. Austria further supported the Agency by facilitating links with the United Nations, for example 
through the planned establishment of a liaison office of the United Nations Office for Disarmament 
Affairs (UNODA) in Vienna. Austria also supported the establishment of a competence centre for civil 
society in the area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation in Vienna. 
12. Mr BA (Senegal) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation with his 
country, covering such essential areas as training, technology transfer, the provision of up-to-date 
medical and nuclear safety equipment, expert exchanges and the organization of scientific meetings, 
and support for research into water resource management, improving agricultural practices, radiation 
protection and malnutrition. The successes achieved had strengthened his countryÂs determination to 
continue developing technical cooperation in order to promote socio-economic development. Senegal 
fulfilled its financial commitments to the TCF and the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and contributed its 
national participation costs. Since joining the Agency, Senegal had consistently affirmed its support 
for the global objectives of non-proliferation and had ratified the NPT and other relevant international 
instruments. 
13. He highlighted the challenge presented by the global energy crisis, which was particularly acute 
for oil-importing developing countries such as Senegal. Energy security, while not a new issue, had 
become a major concern in light of increasing fluctuations in oil prices and contradictory opinions on 
the use of nuclear energy. Given the need to optimize the use of all conventional energy sources in 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 3 
order to meet population needs, the potential of nuclear energy could not be ignored. For many 
developing countries it was important for energy self-sufficiency, even if its use was not free from 
challenges, such as managing waste and ensuring safety and security. 
14. Senegal currently obtained around 90% of its energy from bio- and fossil fuels, but a 
government strategy adopted in 2003 also focused on new and renewable energy and nuclear power. 
At the fifty-third session of the General Conference, Senegal had declared its intention of pursuing 
nuclear power in order to meet its energy needs. A working group bringing together all relevant 
national bodies had been established for that purpose and was following the recommendations of 
IAEA Nuclear Energy Series No. NG-G-3.1, entitled ÂMilestones in the Development of a National 
Infrastructure for Nuclear PowerÂ. 
15. To demonstrate its commitment to nuclear power, Senegal had ratified the principal legal 
instruments that served to strengthen the global security and safety regime for the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, including the Vienna Convention, the Assistance Convention, the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention and the Early Notification Convention. Also, it intended to 
adhere to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and to conclude a 
safeguards agreement and additional protocol with the Agency under the NPT. An act on radiation 
protection and nuclear safety had recently been adopted and the President had issued a decree creating 
the Senegalese Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority, an independent body, to regulate 
the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Senegal was also participating in an AFRA project to 
put in place national regulatory structures, in accordance with international nuclear safety and security 
standards, and create a network of regulators in Africa. 
16. His country was fully committed to the AgencyÂs ideals of peace, security and development, 
and would spare no effort in promoting the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
strengthening the AgencyÂs non-proliferation and verification regime. Senegal would work with the 
international community to build peace and stability worldwide. He reiterated his countryÂs 
appreciation for the technical support it received from the Agency, which he hoped would continue as 
new nuclear applications were developed locally and globally with the aim of achieving peace and 
sustainable development. 
17. Mr HOMANN (Germany) said that two key events had taken place in the area of nuclear power 
in 2010, namely the Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the President of the United States of America 
in April in Washington, which had raised international awareness in that crucial and urgent field, and 
the NPT Review Conference in May. 
18. The expected global expansion of nuclear power and research needed to go hand in hand with 
further progress regarding the security of nuclear material and radiological sources. While that 
responsibility fell first and foremost to States, it nonetheless required effective international 
coordination and expertise as nuclear security was a transboundary issue. Preparations had begun for 
the second Nuclear Security Summit to be held in Seoul in 2012 and Germany would again play an 
active role and contribute to a successful outcome, as it had done for the Washington Summit. 
19. The final document of the recent NPT Review Conference could serve as a basis for further 
achievements, especially in the areas of nuclear verification and disarmament. Germany fully 
supported the Âglobal zeroÂ concept as a practical necessity. 
20. In June 2010, the Board of Governors had taken a decision, after long and difficult negotiations, 
to increase the AgencyÂs Regular Budget for 2011 by 4.1%. Given GermanyÂs well-known position, 
lending support to that increase had been painful, but his delegation had done so in the Vienna spirit of 
consensus. In the light of the global financial crisis, GermanyÂs position needed to remain realistic. A 
zero-growth policy was required in all international organizations, including the Agency. One example 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 4 
of how costs could be streamlined was implementation of the integrated safeguards system in the 
framework of the additional protocol. Also, Germany welcomed such future-oriented initiatives as the 
safeguards by design process. 
21. He emphasized GermanyÂs willingness to support the Agency where specific needs arose. In 
2009, his country had pledged Â10 million in support of the AgencyÂs work in the field of nuclear 
security and had made good progress in delivering on its pledge. 
22. Germany remained gravely concerned over the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. 
Consecutive Agency reports, including the most recent one, stated that Iran was continuing to develop 
its uranium enrichment activities and was not extending the necessary cooperation in relation to the 
alleged military dimension of its nuclear programme, thus violating the binding resolutions of the 
Security Council and the requests of the Board of Governors. In so doing, Iran regrettably would not 
convince the international community of the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. His 
delegation reaffirmed the willingness of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United 
Kingdom and the United States of America to engage in immediate talks with Iran. That group of 
countries had presented a comprehensive offer of cooperation and Iran should follow up its words by 
deeds and return to the negotiating table promptly. 
23. Germany was also gravely concerned over the DPRK nuclear weapons programme. The 
complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remained the ultimate goal. He 
called on the DPRK to return to the six-party talks without delay and allow the Agency to resume its 
work in the country. Preventing nuclear proliferation to and from the DPRK was a matter of great 
concern. He called on all States to comply strictly with their obligations under Security Council 
resolution 1874 (2009). 
24. Germany shared the AgencyÂs concern over possible undeclared nuclear activities in the Syrian 
Arab Republic in breach of its commitments under the safeguards agreement concluded with the 
Agency. He called on Syria to improve its thus far insufficient cooperation with the Agency. It should 
respond to the AgencyÂs questions, which had remained unanswered to date, and provide full 
cooperation, including access to related sites. 
25. The above-mentioned developments underlined the essential need for an effective and efficient 
safeguards regime. Comprehensive safeguards agreements in combination with an additional protocol 
should be considered the relevant standard for verification. 
26. Together with its European partners, Germany had affirmed on various occasions its 
commitment to full implementation of the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 NPT 
Review and Extension Conference. The time had now come to move ahead as agreed upon at the 
2010 NPT Review Conference. Singling out Israel in a resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities would 
be detrimental in that respect. The resolution would not strengthen consensus within the Agency on 
the matter and, for that reason, should not be put to a vote. The draft resolution submitted by Egypt 
entitled ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ seemed far more balanced and more 
likely to attract consensus. 
27. Over the past year, the issue of multilateral nuclear approaches had been high on Member 
StatesÂ agendas. Germany had introduced its own proposal on a Multilateral Enrichment Sanctuary 
Project and had been following the debate closely. It was regrettable that no consensus had been 
reached and that positions diverged considerably. Germany had engaged in bilateral consultations with 
several partners in order to enhance understanding of individual interests and would continue to do so. 
28. Germany greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs activities in the field of nuclear safety, which were 
of growing importance in the light of the number of emerging nuclear power States. Strengthening the 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 5 
global nuclear safety framework was a precondition for achieving a higher level of nuclear safety 
worldwide. Germany fully supported the AgencyÂs crucial role in that process and, in that connection, 
he was pleased to announce that Germany would host the International Conference on Radiation 
Protection in Medicine scheduled for 2012. 
29. Germany also greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation work, which had led to 
noticeable improvements in such important areas as health, especially cancer treatment, water 
management, agriculture and environmental protection. 
30. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the International Project on Innovative Nuclear 
Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), Germany, as a founding member, commended the INPRO team 
for its achievements. Germany had endorsed the statement of mission of the new International 
Framework for Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC) and intended to participate as a full member in 
that important initiative. 
31. Turning to the nuclear energy situation in Germany he said that, in the framework of a new 
energy plan, his Government would extend the life of its nuclear reactors by 12 years on average. That 
meant that nuclear power would remain a substantial part of GermanyÂs electricity mix for some time 
to come. That energy plan affirmed ongoing efforts to ensure nuclear safety and provided for a 
resumption of exploration at the Gorleben site for a final depository for highly radioactive waste. The 
German Atomic Energy Act would be amended accordingly. 
32. His delegation fully supported the topic of the 2010 Scientific Forum; cancer treatment was 
truly a global challenge and endeavour. The current bottleneck in radioisotope production for medical 
applications, especially molybdenum-99, was a major concern and he said that the German research 
reactor in Munich was prepared to shoulder part of the burden. 
33. The continuing expansion of nuclear energy and related technologies required intensive 
international collaboration. The Agency played a central role in that regard and Germany attached the 
utmost importance to maintaining the AgencyÂs ability to fulfil that function. 
34. Mr BASHARI (Sudan) thanked the Agency for its support for the promotion of peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy in developing countries and emphasized the importance of ensuring balance between 
verification and safeguards activities and the technical cooperation programme. Sudan fully complied 
with all its obligations under the relevant international instruments that it had ratified, and urged all 
States that had not yet ratified them to do so at the earliest opportunity in the interests of peace and 
sustainable development. 
35. A national commission was drafting the nuclear legislation required to establish an independent 
regulatory authority in Sudan, thereby enhancing the countryÂs compliance with the international 
safety and security standards applicable to radioactive sources and nuclear installations. Another 
national commission was working on a recommendation concerning relevant international treaties. 
36. Sudan had benefited greatly from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme in vital areas 
such as human health. Support had been provided for cancer prevention and treatment in the form of 
equipment for diagnosis and treatment of the disease and the training of human resources. In the area 
of malaria prevention, the Agency had supported Sudan in the preparation of laboratory studies and in 
obtaining the human resources required to use radiation technology to sterilize male mosquitoes. 
Sudan hoped to receive support from the Islamic Development Bank for the field implementation 
stage. 
37. In the agricultural field Sudan had received Agency support in using nuclear techniques to 
increase the productivity of selected crops. It was also seeking to use radiation techniques to increase 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 6 
fruit exports, to prevent tuber germination and to sterilize single-use medical devices by obtaining a 
gamma irradiator. 
38. The Agency had supported Sudan in establishing a network of laboratories to investigate 
diseases affecting animal stocks, which accounted for a large proportion of the countryÂs gross 
domestic product. 
39. Sudan had also received assistance under the technical cooperation programme in devising a 
national strategy for the establishment of infrastructure for electricity generation. It attached great 
importance to the project and looking forward to receiving Agency support for the next stage 
involving implementation of the national strategy for the use of a nuclear reactor to generate 
electricity. Sudan trusted that the Agency would approve the continuation of the project in 2011 so 
that the long-term work plan could be successfully implemented. 
40. In addition, his country had greatly benefited from the AgencyÂs support for the conduct of a 
feasibility study concerning its first research reactor. Sudan hoped to build a 5 MW reactor within the 
next five years. It would be used to train the human resources required to operate power reactors and 
to produce radioisotopes for the medical field and industry. 
41. Sudan had participated in the conduct of studies concerning the use of the waters of the Nubian 
sandstone basin. 
42. Sudan highly appreciated the support of the Agency and AFRA for its programmes to develop 
human resources for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It had benefited from higher studies programmes 
leading to masterÂs degrees in radiation protection, medical physics and nuclear science and 
technology at the Sudan Academy of Sciences. More than 100 Agency experts had participated in the 
projects and a large number of Sudanese had attended the training courses. 
43. AFRA had recorded successful results in the areas of food security, health and the training of 
human resources. It had implemented important regional projects with Agency support, coordinating 
various applications of nuclear technology. Sudan had hosted three AFRA events during the current 
year and hoped to host even more in 2011. Congratulating the Agency and African countries on the 
20th anniversary of that Agreement, he urged the countries concerned to increase their budgetary 
allocations to national science and technology programmes, to set up an AFRA fund to support 
scientific and technological development in Africa, and to establish national infrastructure for 
radiation safety and nuclear waste management in compliance with international rules. 
44. The Ministry of Science and Technology had been assigned responsibility under Republican 
Decree No. 22 of 2010 for regulating the use of new and renewable forms of energy with a view to 
protecting the environment, human beings and animals from the associated risks. It had also been 
mandated to elaborate policies aimed at increasing the contribution of such forms of energy in view of 
their effective role in preventing climate change and reducing the impact of greenhouse gases. 
45. Everyone was aware of the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. All States in the 
region had acceded to the NPT and demonstrated their resolve to take practical steps towards the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Israel, however, continued to 
challenge the international community by its refusal to accede to the Treaty and to place all its nuclear 
installations under comprehensive Agency safeguards and its rejection of all international initiatives in 
that connection. Its conduct in that regard impeded the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
Sudan called for immediate action to compel Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear 
installations under Agency control. It also urged all Member States to support the Arab draft resolution 
entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ. Sudan was seriously concerned about IsraelÂs disregard for 
Agency resolutions calling for such action, and urged the Director General and Member States to step 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 7 
up their efforts to have IsraelÂs installations placed under comprehensive Agency safeguards, a step 
that would facilitate the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), President, took the Chair. 
46. Mr BIGOT (France) said that nuclear proliferation threatened international peace and security. 
To guarantee that peaceful nuclear activities were not diverted to harmful ends, the international 
community should respond resolutely to proliferation crises, particularly with regard to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the DPRK. 
47. IranÂs pursuit of sensitive activities, particularly enrichment, and its failure to cooperate with the 
Agency continued to give the entire international community serious cause for concern. Since the 
previous session of the General Conference, clear messages had been sent to Iran in resolutions of the 
Board of Governors and the Security Council urging it to fulfil its international obligations. IranÂs 
behaviour had left the international community with no choice but to impose new sanctions, 
demonstrating to Iran the high and mounting cost of its actions and reminding it that there was an 
alternative available through negotiation. A negotiated solution was still possible, and he called on 
Iran to choose cooperation. 
48. The two nuclear tests conducted by the DPRK, in violation of its international commitments, 
had drawn international condemnation. The DPRK should comply with Security Council 
resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and abandon all its nuclear weapons and programmes in a 
verifiable and irreversible manner. It was essential for the DPRK to comply strictly with its obligations 
under the NPT and its safeguards agreement, and he expressed support for the AgencyÂs actions in that 
regard. Also, the DPRK should permit the return of Agency inspectors, cease all proliferation 
activities and abstain from export activities prohibited under the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
He called on the DPRK to return unconditionally to the six-party talks and to refrain from taking any 
action likely to increase tension in the region. 
49. In the same vein, he called on the Syrian Arab Republic to show the necessary transparency and 
cooperation in applying its safeguards agreement. 
50. France welcomed the ambitious and balanced final document of the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference, which would give new impetus to the NPT as the cornerstone of the non-proliferation 
regime. He expressed support for actions agreed upon to strengthen and universalize the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system, the credible and effective application of which gave assurances to Member States 
that provided technical cooperation that the activities they supported were exclusively peaceful. The 
expansion of nuclear energy could thus be viewed with confidence. In FranceÂs view, nuclear 
cooperation with States that did not respect their obligations should be suspended. Under Article III of 
the NPT, the verification standard was now the implementation of a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and an additional protocol. Universalization of those instruments remained a priority, and 
France invited all States that had yet to do so to implement them as soon as possible. With a view to 
strengthening safeguards, France would continue to assist the Agency by making its knowledge and 
expertise available through its Member State Support Programme. 
51. Rigorous and universal export controls for the most sensitive nuclear technologies, equipment 
and material were a necessary condition for developing nuclear trade. To that end, France participated 
in the Nuclear Suppliers Group in order to promote credible and balanced export controls and provide 
the necessary framework for responsible nuclear development. Transfer of the most sensitive 
technologies, particularly in the areas of enrichment and reprocessing, should be evaluated based on a 
set of criteria; first and foremost of those criteria should be the credibility of the recipient countryÂs 
need in view of its nuclear power capacity. Appropriate measures should be taken to guarantee that, as 
a result of such transfers, there was no diversion from peaceful purposes. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 8 
52. The current potential for developing nuclear power existed alongside the threat of nuclear and 
radiological terrorism. As had been reaffirmed at the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington in 
April 2010 and at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, the Agency had a central role to play in 
coordinating international efforts to strengthen nuclear security and protection against nuclear 
terrorism. France would continue to provide financial and technical support for the AgencyÂs Nuclear 
Security Plan 2010Â2013. 
53. A growing number of Member States were expressing interest in introducing or reintroducing 
nuclear power. France was ready to cooperate with any country that demonstrated its scrupulous 
respect for all non-proliferation commitments, particularly those arising from the NPT, and pursued its 
peaceful nuclear activities in good faith and full transparency. The International Conference on Access 
to Civil Nuclear Energy, held in Paris in March 2010 and attended by 63 States with an interest in 
nuclear energy, had provided an opportunity to share expertise and experience and engage in dialogue 
on the challenges of developing civil nuclear energy programmes. To respond to those challenges, new 
nuclear governance was needed, based on common principles and supported by a strengthened 
Agency, so as to create the necessary conditions and framework for responsible nuclear energy 
development. 
54. Financing nuclear power programmes was a major challenge. Significant financial commitment 
was needed for the building, operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities, and he called on 
international financial institutions to provide appropriate funding for that low-carbon energy source. 
Another key challenge was training of human resources. Nuclear training in France was open to 
people from other countries and included an international masterÂs degree programme in nuclear 
energy. Efforts were being made to make such programmes more accessible to overseas partners. 
Also, France had recently established an International Institute for Nuclear Energy and the number of 
grants available to foreign students for nuclear science training was set to increase. 
55. France would pursue its bilateral cooperation arrangements in the nuclear field in close 
collaboration with the Agency which, in accordance with its Statute, had a central role to play in 
promoting cooperation among Member States. France had always supported the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme and remained convinced that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy could make 
a significant contribution to meeting basic human needs. It demonstrated its commitment to fighting 
cancer, which the Director General had made a priority area during his first year of office, by 
mobilizing its expertise to benefit PACT. 
56. Nuclear safety was not only a national challenge but a collective concern that went hand in hand 
with global public acceptance of nuclear energy. Under the aegis of the Agency, a common 
understanding of which reactors were the safest to build should be sought, based on agreed safety 
objectives that would ensure that nuclear safety was a high priority in developing national civil nuclear 
programmes. He drew the attention of all States, with or without nuclear power programmes, to the 
importance of universalizing a civil nuclear liability regime. All must demonstrate that that dimension 
of nuclear power was fully taken into account, particularly through adherence to current regimes, such 
as the Paris or Vienna Conventions, and by adopting supplementary legislation, as appropriate 
57. France, having opted for large-scale nuclear power, currently had 58 reactors in operation 
producing 80% of its electricity, and two European pressurized water reactors (EPRs) were under 
construction. Responsible nuclear energy development required long-term solutions for spent fuel and 
waste management. France used a closed fuel cycle and recycled its spent fuel, thus enabling uranium 
resources to be used to their full potential and waste stockpiling to be reduced to a minimum. It would 
continue to make its processing and recycling facilities available to a number of countries. France 
would soon be allocating major funding to research into fourth-generation systems and work was 
under way to build a fast reactor prototype by 2020. In the area of fusion, he welcomed the adoption 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 9 
with respect to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) of a road map for the 
next three decades. ITER had now entered a decisive phase: the construction of a reactor at its 
European site in Cadarache, France. 
58. He reaffirmed the importance his country attached to the place of nuclear energy in managing 
the worldÂs energy sources, facilitating progress and promoting responsible development. The Agency 
made a vital contribution through its activities to promote international peace and security and to allow 
a growing number of countries to benefit from the peaceful uses of the atom. France would continue to 
support the Agency and its Director General in fulfilling their mission. 
59. Mr ABBA (Niger) expressed his countryÂs full support for the AgencyÂs objectives of 
preventing the use of nuclear energy for military purposes and establishing a peaceful and secure 
world without the threat of nuclear arms. Niger, a major uranium producer, was working actively to 
promote the peaceful use of nuclear techniques and to strengthen the relevant international legal 
framework. 
60. Throughout its long history of cooperation with the Agency, Niger had acquired practical 
experience which had enabled it to achieve significant progress towards national and international 
goals in relation to non-proliferation, the regulatory framework for nuclear safety and security, and 
radiation protection of workers, the public and the environment. Niger welcomed the establishment of 
various technical cooperation programmes with Agency support, particularly in the fields of human 
health, agriculture, stockbreeding, water resource management, environment and energy. 
61. In collaboration with PACT, the Agency and other development partners, Niger was 
implementing a national cancer control programme to provide for the prevention, detection, diagnosis 
and treatment of cancer in the country and the West African subregion. NigerÂs Government had made 
great efforts to facilitate the construction of a radiotherapy centre enabling the treatment of cancer 
patients. 
62. The use of nuclear techniques in such fields as improving crop varieties and animal nutrition 
could make a significant contribution to meeting development challenges. Niger was also using 
radioisotopic techniques to study the silting-up of the Niger river. 
63. At the regional level, Niger was actively involved in the work of AFRA and appreciated the 
AgencyÂs assistance through subregional and regional programmes. NigerÂs CPF, which was currently 
in the process of being finalized, would be helpful in identifying, formulating and implementing 
projects aimed at benefiting the people of the country and relieving poverty. 
64. In connection with the revision of Article VI of the Statute relating to the composition of the 
Board of Governors, Niger encouraged Member States very seriously to consider the status that should 
be accorded to uranium-producing countries. 
65. NigerÂs uranium exploration and production capacities had expanded rapidly, 130 exploration 
permits having been issued for a total area covering 20% of the country. The development of uranium 
production activities was based on diversified partnership and respect for international standards. 
Thus, together with the start-up of the Imouraren mine in 2013, expected to produce 11 000 tonnes for 
40 years, Niger intended to make a major contribution to satisfying the growing global demand for 
uranium. 
66. NigerÂs electricity production was insufficient for the needs of its population and its industry. It 
suffered regular blackouts which were not only unpopular but also harmful to economic growth. To 
address that problem, Niger hoped to achieve self-sufficiency and meet the energy needs of the 
subregion by introducing nuclear power, which it intended to do in conformity with all relevant 
Agency norms. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 10 
67. As the third largest producer of uranium in the world and having opted for nuclear power, Niger 
took a permanent interest in the work of the Agency and had put itself forward as a candidate at the 
present General Conference for a seat on the Board of Governors, on which it had not been 
represented for 22 years. His country would be honoured to receive the invaluable support of other 
Member States for its candidacy. 
68. Mr FAHMI (Iraq) said that the Iraqi Government was heavily dependent on the AgencyÂs 
assistance to developing countries in taking advantage of nuclear technology in such areas as health, 
the environment, agriculture, water resources and industry, and in ensuring the safe use of such 
technology. Following the establishment of the Iraqi National Atomic Energy Commission in 2009, a 
number of effective measures aimed at the enactment of nuclear legislation had been taken in 
cooperation with Agency experts. 
69. Iraq was now seeking to implement rules, guidelines and regulatory legislation with a view to 
controlling radioactive material and sources and their movement in accordance with international 
standards aimed at preventing radioactive contamination or environmental pollution in Iraq. An 
integrated plan to decontaminate destroyed Iraqi nuclear installations had been developed in 
cooperation with the Agency. Action to implement it had begun in 2008 notwithstanding major 
difficulties associated with the state of the installations in question. Decontamination work on a 
facility belonging to the Ministry of Industry and Mines in central Baghdad had recently been 
completed. 
70. Iraq appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the development of a solid scientific base in the area 
of nuclear technology. However, it needed even greater assistance in ridding the Iraqi environment of 
all radioactive contaminants and in using nuclear technology to detect landmines, which prevented the 
cultivation of a large proportion of the countryÂs agricultural land and took a heavy human toll. There 
were more than 25 million mines in various parts of the country. Their clearance called for 
cooperation with international bodies such as the Agency. 
71. Iraq was currently seeking to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, such as electron 
and ion accelerators for use in scientific research and for medical, environmental and agricultural 
applications. In the area of agriculture, Iraq was seeking to use nuclear technology to develop strains 
of salt-resistant crops. In 2009 the Government had trained some of its officials in those areas in 
cooperation with the Agency, the Arab Atomic Energy Agency and friendly countries. It looked 
forward to increased support from the Agency in the areas in question. 
72. A memorandum of understanding had recently been signed between the European Union and 
the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology concerning an initiative aimed at training Iraqi experts 
in the decontamination of nuclear installations and the safe disposal of the resulting radioactive waste. 
73. The Iraqi Government appreciated the AgencyÂs humanitarian role in implementing PACT and 
applying advanced nuclear techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Iraq required 
additional support and cooperation in that area to reduce the mortality rate among cancer patients, 
especially children. The rate was increasing for many reasons, particularly the lack of specialized 
facilities and of qualified medical staff. 
74. The Iraqi Government supported international efforts to ensure that atomic energy was used 
exclusively for peaceful purposes and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It reaffirmed the 
need to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. To that end, the nuclear installations of 
all States in the region should be subject to verification. It followed that Israel should accede to the 
NPT and place its nuclear installations under comprehensive Agency safeguards.

21 September 2010, Page 11 
75. Iraq also supported international efforts to combat nuclear terrorism and to prevent the 
proliferation and unlawful acquisition of nuclear material and radioactive sources. It had taken a 
variety of measures to that end, including the tightening of control over border crossings and the 
strengthening of the accounting system for nuclear material. 
76. In 2009 the Iraqi Government had adopted a package of legislative measures aimed at 
implementing its obligations under international instruments concerning the non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. The Cabinet had approved the Law on the Iraqi National Atomic Energy 
Commission and had submitted it to the Parliament for enactment. The Law would guarantee 
compliance with IraqÂs obligations under international treaties concerning nuclear, chemical and 
biological weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery as well as dual-use materials and 
equipment. The Government had also decided on 17 January 2010 to apply an additional protocol on a 
voluntary basis and had submitted its initial declarations ahead of schedule. 
77. The Government had agreed in 2010 to sign the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material, the Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and the Hague 
Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. The competent authorities were currently 
studying the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention with a view to submitting them 
to the Government for approval. 
78. He commended the Director GeneralÂs letter dated 11 March 2010 to the Security Council 
reporting the Iraqi authoritiesÂ excellent cooperation in implementing IraqÂs obligations. He trusted 
that such action would lead to the lifting of international resolutions concerning Iraq under 
Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. 
79. Mr STEINMANN (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, said that over the 
past year the encouraging signs glimpsed in the field of nuclear disarmament had taken on a firmer 
shape. In particular, he noted the commitment made in 2009 by the Presidents of the United States of 
America and the Russian Federation to achieving a nuclear-free world that had led to the 
New START, which he hoped would be ratified as soon as possible. Also, the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference had culminated in the adoption of a final document, which represented a significant 
development even if the recommendations for follow-on actions were rather modest in substance. 
80. Progress on other disarmament matters had been less satisfactory, however. The CTBT had still 
not entered into force and the Conference on Disarmament remained deadlocked. Despite various 
developments, regional proliferation issues had not been fully resolved, which was particularly 
worrying because some were questioning the ability of the Agency fully to play its verification role. 
81. Switzerland and Liechtenstein saw no way out of the crises in question other than a diplomatic 
approach that fully involved the Agency, reaffirming the unique role it should play in verification. The 
countries called on all parties concerned to seize the opportunities offered to them, even if they did not 
immediately meet all their expectations. 
82. In the context of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Switzerland had brought up the idea of 
looking into reducing the efforts and costs involved in safeguards in States with an additional protocol 
in force. In that way, the States that were the most transparent about their nuclear activities would gain 
tangible benefits from applying the additional protocol. That, in turn, made the additional protocol 
more attractive to other States. 
83. Regarding the AgencyÂs budget, he said that it was essential to avoid spreading resources too 
thinly and to avoid disproportionate budgetary increases that were unrealistic in the context of the 
economic difficulties of most Member States. He expressed regret that Rule 67 of the Rules of 
Procedure of the General Conference calling for a report by the Director General on the administrative 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 12 
and financial implications of any new proposal was only followed perfunctorily at best. Not only was 
that rule generally implemented in the United Nations organizations and agencies, but it would help 
the Secretariat to discharge its duties better and would help Member States to make more effective 
decisions. 
84. He expressed appreciation to the Chairperson of the Working Group on Financing the AgencyÂs 
Activities, charged with holding consultations on the budget for 2011. Unfortunately, the agreement 
reached was not satisfactory. On a number of occasions, Switzerland had asked that efforts be made to 
ensure that all expenditures be included in the Regular Budget and, after various exceptions, it 
expected future budget increases to be limited to offsetting inflation both as regards the Regular 
Budget and the technical cooperation budget. His country had proposed resorting to loans to finance 
some investments to demonstrate the real cost of the Agency and had requested a cap on 
extrabudgetary contributions, which were detrimental to good management. While some progress had 
been made, such as the introduction of two currencies for technical cooperation programmes and the 
creation of a fund for major investments, the Regular Budget still failed to cover all investments. 
85. During the discussions on the future of the Agency, hopes and fears had been aired regarding 
current initiatives in the nuclear field. However, it had become clear that divisions within the Agency 
were proving an obstacle to reforming the main activities or introducing new projects, such that no 
reforms or large-scale projects could get off the ground without changes in the context in which the 
Agency found itself. That echoed the finding of the Commission of Eminent Persons that significant 
progress on nuclear disarmament and the availability of the benefits of nuclear energy were 
prerequisites to agreement on the measures needed to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
86. The issue of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and the role of the Agency in that 
context had provoked a lot of discussion. While a first fuel bank project had been approved by the 
Board of Governors in November 2009, the debate on the technical, legal, economic and political 
aspects that most Member States had expected had not yet taken place. Switzerland remained willing 
to participate in all discussions on the conceptual framework for any project on the assurance of 
nuclear fuel supplies. 
87. Switzerland and Liechtenstein attached great importance to the AgencyÂs promotional activities, 
which should be conducted using the standard management principles and tools in the United Nations 
system. Since technical cooperation was the primary and fundamental task of the Agency, it should be 
funded under the Regular Budget. Such a step could help bridge the widening gap between the 
developed and developing Member States. 
88. Turning to nuclear developments in Switzerland, he said that under the plan for the creation of 
deep geological repositories, disposal sites would be selected for low, medium and high level 
radioactive waste following consultations with all interested parties. In view of the fact that 
SwitzerlandÂs oldest nuclear power plants were now 40 years old, three companies had requested 
authorization to build new plants on the existing sites. The Government would probably make a 
decision in that regard at the beginning of 2012. 
89. Finally, with reference to recent television programmes giving contradictory information about 
the international transport of nuclear material, he said that comprehensive information must be 
provided on that subject, with a transparent explanation of the purpose of the transport in the context 
of the fuel cycle. 
90. He concluded by thanking the Secretariat and the Director General for the high quality of their 
work and their dedication to the AgencyÂs fundamental objectives. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 13 
91. Ms DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that the events of the 2010 Ânuclear springÂ had further 
reinforced Âthe spirit of Prague 2009Â and the commitment of the international community to seek the 
peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons. The Washington Nuclear Security Summit 
had confirmed the ever-increasing importance of international cooperation to avert the risk of nuclear 
terrorism, which was one of the most challenging threats to international security. Stressing the need 
for strong nuclear security measures, it had also reaffirmed the key role of the Agency in providing 
guidance in that area, together with a commitment to ensure continued appropriate resources to enable 
the Agency to carry out its nuclear security mandate. 
92. The AgencyÂs crucial role in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy had also been widely recognized by the successful 2010 NPT Review Conference. The 
adoption of concrete measures relating to all three pillars of the NPT by the Conference was a 
significant achievement. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement, together with an 
additional protocol, constituted the current verification standard. When identifying possible 
cost-savings within the Agency, it was important to ensure sufficient financial resources for full and 
equal implementation of those key verification instruments in all countries concerned. At the same 
time, only stringent export controls could effectively prevent the uncontrolled dissemination of 
sensitive materials, equipment and technologies. Thus, relevant control policies, practices and regimes 
must be further strengthened. The Czech Republic had always supported the AgencyÂs and other 
non-proliferation initiatives, both through its active engagement in all corresponding activities and by 
providing voluntary financial contributions whenever possible. In that context, she recalled that her 
country had hosted the New START signing ceremony in 2010, which provided for further reductions 
and limitations of nuclear arsenals. 
93. The Czech Republic has always placed emphasis on the area of human health as one of the 
AgencyÂs top priorities. It continued to support relevant Agency activities and provided assistance to 
Agency Member States in need. One example was the project through which the Czech Republic was 
helping Moldova to strengthen its radiotherapy services and associated regulatory practices by 
providing both expertise and financial resources amounting to over US $600 000. 
94. In response to the severe global shortage in the supply of medical radioisotopes, the Czech 
Nuclear Research Institute at ReÂ, together with the Belgian Institute for Radioisotopes at Fleurus, had 
initiated cooperation on alternative molybdenum-99 production in April 2010. The partnership aimed 
to address the ever-increasing demand for reactor-produced radioisotopes, in particular the critical gap 
in the production of metastable technetium-99. In so doing, the Czech Republic was backing up the 
few countries in the world producing reactor-based radioisotopes for medical purposes. 
95. Turning to the issue of the nuclear energy renaissance, she thanked the Agency for the 
assistance it provided to Member States that were introducing nuclear power for the first time or 
expanding their present capacities. In particular, her country valued the AgencyÂs assistance in 
building and sustaining the necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework, as well as the 
comprehensive set of safety standards it had created and continued to review and update. Also, her 
country welcomed the independent safety assessments, expert advice and invaluable technical support 
offered by the Agency, and its involvement in establishing topical networks and facilitating experience 
and best practice sharing. 
96. In the light of the expansion of the nuclear power, relevant safety conventions and renewed 
momentum for their implementation were essential. Looking ahead to the fifth review meeting under 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety scheduled for April 2011, she underlined the pivotal role played by 
the Convention in the establishment of a global nuclear safety regime. The Contracting Parties to the 
Convention would help further to improve the effectiveness of the review process. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 14 
97. The Czech Republic, as a country that had decided to expand its nuclear power programmes, 
was conducting an ongoing environmental impact assessment of two additional units at the existing 
nuclear power plant at Temelin, which was expected to be completed in 2011. The operators and 
relevant Czech authorities continued to demonstrate their strong commitment to maintaining and 
further strengthening a high level of nuclear safety at operating nuclear power plants and as regards 
the new units to be built. 
98. The Czech Republic used AgencyÂs mechanisms not only as a beneficiary, but also as tools to 
assist other countries. Her countryÂs long-standing assistance to Ukraine and Armenia in enhancing the 
safety of their nuclear power plants testified to the priority her country attached to nuclear safety 
worldwide. 
99. Among the new challenges the nuclear revival brought with it was the need for sufficient and 
qualified human resources in the States concerned. That was a problem currently faced by a number of 
countries, including her own. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was a vital instrument 
for addressing those issues. The programme continued to serve as a unique platform for sharing 
information, experience and know-how among countries at different levels of development in all 
regions. Her countryÂs involvement in the technical cooperation programme had evolved from being a 
recipient to becoming a net contributor whose contributions to the TCF now substantially exceeded the 
assistance it received from the Agency. 
100. To shift attention to other priority countries, regional programmes and new partnerships and to 
highlight the invaluable role of the technical cooperation programme, European Member States 
participating in the programme, including the Czech Republic, had formulated a strategy for the 
technical cooperation programme in the Europe region. The relevant document, adopted on 
19 February 2010, offered a basic vision of the technical cooperation programme in the region and set 
forth the main strategic objectives and mechanisms for their implementation. It was an essential step in 
further increasing the transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of the technical cooperation 
programme and reconfirmed the principle of shared responsibility. It could also serve as a reference 
when revisiting the overall technical cooperation strategy. 
101. She was pleased to announce that the Czech Republic had completed payment of its three-year 
contribution to help ensure the safe repatriation of spent nuclear fuel from the Serbian research reactor 
at Vinca to the Russian Federation. In so doing, it had provided almost one million dollars to facilitate 
the implementation of the largest technical cooperation project ever. 
102. As regards the latest developments at the Temelin nuclear power plant, she said that on 
9 September 2010 a newly built spent fuel storage facility had started trial operation. It had been 
designed to accommodate the spent fuel generated over 30 years of plant operation. A similar facility 
had been operating at the Dukovany site, which had sufficient capacity to store all the spent fuel 
generated during the remaining lifetime of the plant. 
103. A large-scale emergency exercise was about to take place at Temelin with the participation of 
the relevant local and central State administration and crisis management authorities and interested 
partners from neighbouring States. While such an exercise was conducted in Czech nuclear power 
plants every three years, nuclear power plants themselves were required to verify their emergency 
preparedness annually. Spent fuel management and emergency preparedness and response were other 
areas where the Agency was an indispensable partner and in which international cooperation was 
fundamental. 
Mr Barrett (Canada), Vice-President, took the Chair. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 15 
104. Mr GRIMA (Malta) said that the Agency provided valuable assistance to Member States 
through its technical cooperation programme by matching specific technologies to StatesÂ individual 
requirements. 
105. Since its accession to the Agency in 1997, Malta had benefited from technical cooperation in 
several areas, particularly human health and the environment. It had also participated in several 
regional programmes and, in early September 2010, had hosted a meeting of the AgencyÂs RER/8/015 
project on using nuclear techniques for the characterization and preservation of cultural heritage 
artefacts in the European region. 
106. Recent years had seen an expansion of existing civilian nuclear programmes or interest in the 
development of new nuclear capabilities. The inalienable right of every State to develop nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes came nevertheless with onerous international safety and security 
obligations. New or expanded nuclear energy programmes must be developed only when the strictest 
safety standards could be assured. The Agency played an important role in assisting Member States to 
enhance the safety of their nuclear infrastructures and to improve emergency preparedness and 
response capabilities. 
107. Illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material continued to present an enormous 
non-proliferation challenge. The potential of malicious acts involving nuclear material remained an 
ongoing threat and required constant vigilance. Malta welcomed the increase in the number of States 
participating in the Illicit Trafficking Database programme and supported measures that enhanced the 
capabilities of States to prevent and respond to illegal acts involving nuclear and other radioactive 
material. The AgencyÂs efforts in implementing activities under the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013, 
including to control nuclear material and radiological sources, protect nuclear facilities and strengthen 
border controls, were particularly relevant in that regard. 
108. Over the past 12 months, the international community had demonstrated a renewed willingness 
to move forward on disarmament and non-proliferation issues. The NPT remained the cornerstone of 
the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and the consensus outcome of the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference was commendable. Malta was particularly encouraged by the agreement reached 
on a process for the implementation of the 1995 NPT resolution on the Middle East and looked 
forward to the planned 2012 conference producing a positive result. 
109. The AgencyÂs role in ensuring that States complied fully with their safeguards obligations under 
the NPT was an integral and indispensable part of the international nuclear-non proliferation regime. 
Its verification programme remained at the centre of multilateral efforts to curb the proliferation of 
nuclear material. Through its verification activities, the Agency also had an important role to play in 
nuclear disarmament. Comprehensive safeguards agreements, together with an additional protocol, 
constituted the current verification standard. All Member States had an obligation to preserve and 
strengthen the verification regime and to refrain from actions that could hamper its application. He 
urged Member States that had not done so to conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement without 
delay, as required under the NPT, and to sign and ratify an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
110. The nature and scope of the Islamic Republic of IranÂs nuclear programme continued to be a 
matter of serious concern, in particular its recent decision to enrich uranium to up to 20% and its 
heavy water production activities. Malta called on Iran to refrain from further enrichment activities 
and to comply with the requirements of the Security Council and the Agency. The implementation by 
Iran of an additional protocol would be an important step towards rebuilding trust with the 
international community. His delegation thanked the Director General and the Secretariat for their 
continued impartial efforts to resolve all outstanding issues in that regard. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 16 
111. Similarly, his delegation remained concerned by developments in the DPRK and shared the 
international communityÂs concern that the Agency had been prevented from implementing safeguards 
for more than eight years. Malta urged the DPRK to resume cooperation with the Agency without 
delay and to restart dialogue towards the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
112. He commended the Director General for his able leadership of the Agency over the past 
12 months, enabling it to continue contributing to sustainable strategies that addressed the challenges 
of hunger, disease and poverty and that furthered the cause of peace in the twenty-first century. 
113. Mr CHOREV (Israel) said that in his address he would have wished to dwell on the many 
important issues such as the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, nuclear safeguards, security and safety, 
as befitted the spirit and mission of the Agency. Regrettably, the General ConferenceÂs agenda 
contained anti-Israeli items submitted with the clear purpose of avoiding discussion of serious 
violations of the NPT and safeguards obligations by States in the Middle East. Having listened to 
statements by Arab countries, especially that of Egypt, it was clear that that observation was an 
accurate one. 
114. Recently the General Conference had witnessed continuous ill-motivated efforts to single out 
and condemn the State of Israel. Not surprisingly there was much similarity between those countries 
that were at the forefront attacking Israel and the Middle East violators of the NPT and Agency 
safeguards agreements. Such a tactic was intended to divert the attention of the General Conference 
from the real challenges and cases of dangerous proliferation and non-compliance. 
115. The Director GeneralÂs recent reports to the Board of Governors on Iran and Syria had been 
extremely disturbing. It should be recalled that just a few days after the closure of the 2009 General 
Conference, the international community had been stunned by the incriminating revelations about of 
IranÂs Qom enrichment plant, which had been constructed in secrecy for years in violation of IranÂs 
international obligations. In response, the Board of Governors had urged Iran to suspend construction 
at Qom immediately. However, Iran continued its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons in complete 
disregard of all relevant resolutions taken by the international community. SyriaÂs non-cooperation 
with the Agency had also been the subject of Agency reports. 
116. Israel was gravely concerned by those and other negative developments in the Middle East, 
which had brought the region further away from attaining peace and security. It was therefore highly 
regrettable that the 2010 NPT Review Conference had also failed to address the greatest threat of 
proliferation in the Middle East today, namely IranÂs nuclear programme. Any approach that instead 
singled out Israel not only weakened the ability of the international community to confront 
proliferators and violators but also impacted negatively on the prospects for the advancement of arms 
control measures in the Middle East region. 
117. The resolution sponsored by the Arab League entitled ÂIsraeli Nuclear CapabilitiesÂ was a 
major tool in the service of a continuous political campaign to defame Israel. As the General 
Conference was being forced to deal once again with what had become an annual detracting element 
in its discussions, he wished to state loudly and clearly the position of Israel that the proposed 
resolution was incompatible with the basic principles and norms of international law, and did not fall 
within the mandate of the Agency as defined in its Statute. Moreover, the resolution, which called 
upon Israel to accede to the NPT, ignored adverse reality in the Middle East region. He reminded 
delegates that four Middle Eastern Member States party to the NPT, namely, Iran, Syria, Libya and 
Iraq under Saddam Hussein, had grossly violated their Treaty obligations. Those four cases made it 
absolutely clear that the NPT was unable adequately to address the security challenges of the Middle 
East. A serious threat to the NPT and the non-proliferation regime was being posed from within by 
States that pursued nuclear weapons under the cover of their NPT membership. NPT accession could 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 17 
not therefore be a goal in itself, separated from the broad agenda of regional peace and security in all 
its aspects. Genuine regional arms control arrangements in the Middle East could be advanced only as 
a consequence of a comprehensive and durable peace in the region and full compliance by all States of 
the region with their arms control and non-proliferation obligations. That had also been the proven 
experience of other regions. Majority votes at international forums could not serve as a substitute for a 
wide regional consent and cooperation. 
118. A leading Member State in the Middle East, with the support of others in the region, was 
constantly disrupting the conduct of the General Conference by introducing anti-Israeli agenda items. 
Instead, those States that were truly interested in regional security should demonstrate the much 
needed regional goodwill and trust by admitting Israel to the Middle East and South Asia (MESA) 
regional group where it belonged geographically and to which it had so far been denied membership. 
How could one realistically expect to move forward towards establishing a zone free of weapons of 
mass destruction in the Middle East when IsraelÂs basic rights were denied? Was it not an imperative 
to advance reconciliation, mutual recognition and peace prior to embarking on ambitious arms control 
plans? 
119. The preamble to the NPT clarified that the Treaty was designed for a political environment 
where ÂStates must refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the 
territorial integrity or political independence of any StateÂ. It also clarified that States should share the 
overall objective of attaining Âpeace and securityÂ. The Middle East had yet to make progress towards 
such a desirable environment. Moreover, it was the sovereign right of any State to decide whether it 
consented to be bound by any treaty. The Agency itself was required to carry out its activities Âwith 
due observance of the sovereign rights of StatesÂ, as was clearly stipulated in Article III.D of its 
Statute. The advancement of StatesÂ accession to international treaties did not fall within the AgencyÂs 
mandate. Israel was not the only Member State in the MESA region to have exercised its sovereign 
right not to accede to the NPT, yet Israel was the only State that had been singled out and was called 
upon to take a decision which was against its best national interests. He emphasized that Israel valued 
the non-proliferation regime, acknowledged its importance and had always demonstrated a responsible 
policy of restraint in the nuclear domain. 
120. Agenda item 19 entitled ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ had enjoyed 
consensus by the General Conference for 14 consecutive years until 2005. That consensus 
demonstrated a regional common understanding about the vision of the Middle East as a zone free of 
weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Regrettably, consensus had become 
unattainable ever since, as the sponsor of the resolution, Egypt, must have lost its interest in the 
conversion of the Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Instead, the singling out of Israel had 
been set as a principal goal, given priority over meaningful discussion of regional security in the 
Middle East. No less troubling was the apparent evidence in the Safeguards Implementation Report for 
2009 that Egypt, the sponsor of the resolution, was not itself in full compliance with its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. Furthermore, Egypt had not ratified the Pelindaba Treaty, which had 
recently entered into force. Israel rejected that double standard. Had IsraelÂs neighbours truly wished 
to move forward in the Middle East region, they would have turned to dialogue instead of embarking 
in the General Conference on a harmful political campaign. 
121. The threat of proliferation in the Middle East was closely associated with the threat of nuclear 
terrorism supported by rogue States. That recognition had brought Israel to join the Megaports 
Initiative led by the United States Department of Energy to prevent possible illicit trafficking of 
radioactive and nuclear materials, and to combat nuclear terrorism. Living up to its responsibilities as 
an active member state of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT), Israel had in 
June 2010 hosted a successful GICNT workshop on nuclear forensics and legal aspects of fighting 
radiological and nuclear terrorism attracting more than 100 participants from over 20 countries. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 18 
Nevertheless, IsraelÂs participation in the subsequent GICNT meeting which took place in the Middle 
East region had regrettably been denied by the host country, the United Arab Emirates. Such political 
discrimination harmed the prospect of improved regional trust. 
122. His Government was appreciative of the recent visit by the Director General, during which he 
had been shown various projects carried out under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. He 
had visited the Sharett Institute of Oncology and Radiotherapy at the Hadassah hospital and had been 
introduced to the activities of scientists and physicians in the field of cancer treatment and nuclear 
medicine. Israel, a founding member of the Agency, recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs 
education and training programme for the safe, secure and efficient development of the nuclear field. 
Accordingly, it participated in a significant number of Agency activities and strove to increase such 
contributions. Israel made the results of its extensive scientific researches available to developing 
countries. The Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem was constantly providing training and assistance 
to IsraelÂs Palestinian neighbours, as well as to many developing countries. 
123. Israel rejected the transparent policy of violators of the NPT and safeguards agreements in the 
Middle East of blaming Israel for all their ills instead of addressing and correcting their gross 
violations of international norms and obligations. The international community was at a critical 
crossroads in confronting fundamental threats posed by a small number of States, which were 
challenging the worldÂs order and putting regional and global peace and security at risk. It was 
incumbent upon the General Conference to prevent those Member States from inflicting irreparable 
damage on the non-proliferation regime and on the Agency itself. 
124. Mr OSMAN (Bangladesh) said that his Government was firmly committed to nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament and to acceleration of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy 
for the benefit of mankind. It deeply appreciated the cooperation with the Agency in the countryÂs 
research and development efforts. 
125. The leader of Bangladesh independence 38 years ago, Bangabandu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
had dreamt of a prosperous and bountiful Bangladesh, but the country had been struggling since then 
to break out of the vicious circle of poverty. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, his daughter, had 
announced ÂVision 2021 Â Digital BangladeshÂ, a commitment to end the state of crisis and build a 
modern, technologically advanced and prosperous country to realize her fatherÂs dream. Science and 
technology and an expanded role for nuclear energy in various sectors of the economy such as energy, 
agriculture, industry, medicine, health and the environment, were identified among the key tools for 
meeting the goals of Vision 2021. 
126. BangladeshÂs nuclear programmes and activities were firmly based on the principles of 
non-proliferation, safety and security. BangladeshÂs commitment to non-proliferation and 
disarmament was impeccable, having signed the NPT, a bilateral safeguards agreement, an additional 
protocol and the CTBT, and it had pledged to continue its policy of consistent transparency and 
support of the international verification regime. Bangladesh was also strongly committed to 
strengthening the nuclear safety and security infrastructure necessary to implement its nuclear power 
programme. 
127. Sustainable development was closely linked with adequate availability of energy in general and 
electricity in particular. Demand for electricity was expected to experience strong growth in the future 
as Bangladesh strove to achieve its socio-economic development targets. Meanwhile, indigenous 
primary energy resources were inadequate to meet that demand, and nuclear power was therefore a 
viable option for the countryÂs long-term energy mix. 
128. The current Government had taken a decision to expedite implementation of the Rooppur 
nuclear power project initiated more than 40 years earlier and a Cabinet committee had been formed to 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 19 
set policy guidelines for implementation of the project. Bangladesh was grateful to the Secretariat for 
the support being provided to its nuclear power programme and hoped to continue such cooperation. 
129. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had always been very important for 
Bangladesh. Recent technical cooperation projects had addressed establishing nuclear power, 
improving livestock production, improving agriculture in drought areas, medical isotope production, 
non-destructive testing in industry, isotope hydrology for water management and, above all, the 
development of human resources. In all those areas, the GovernmentÂs commitment had been 
supported by technical cooperation with the Agency and Bangladesh hoped that such support would 
continue. 
130. Cancer accounted for about 13% of all deaths worldwide, which was more than those caused by 
HIV/Tuberculosis and malaria combined. By 2020, there would be 15 million new cases of cancer 
every year, 70% of which would be in developing countries. Currently in Bangladesh, 200 000 new 
cases were detected each year, but there was very limited access to services for diagnosis and 
treatment, in particular for breast and cervical cancer in women, which could be treated successfully if 
detected early. PACT was one way the Agency could significantly contribute to combating cancer in 
developing countries, and that programme deserved Member StatesÂ support and participation. The 
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission had taken the initiative to develop human resources and 
strengthen facilities to fight cancer, and Agency technical assistance and cooperation were being 
sought in that connection. 
131. The Regional Co-operative Agreement for Research, Development and Training Related to 
Nuclear Science and Technology (RCA) was a powerful tool for addressing the problems of individual 
Member States through use of the experience, expertise and resources available in the Asia-Pacific 
region. Bangladesh had been an active member of the RCA since its inception, participating in almost 
all of its programmes. Growing over the years, RCA programmes had come to address a range of 
issues in sustainable development. That had been made possible through the adoption of innovative 
approaches such as participatory actions in project formulation, implementation and management, the 
concept of lead countries and regional resource units. Such strategies had helped increase the 
exchange of expertise and sharing of facilities in the region. Bangladesh was confident that the RCA 
would continue to promote regional capabilities and expertise in thematic areas including health, 
agriculture, industry and environment, research reactors, radioactive waste management and radiation 
protection. 
132. Bangladesh reaffirmed its commitment to support the AgencyÂs efforts in reinforcing world 
peace and prosperity. There was a common understanding that the most important issue for Member 
States was the peaceful use of nuclear energy for power. All must come together to protect the planet 
and civilization. While much had been done, there was still much to do. In the words of the poet 
Robert Frost, ÂThe woods are lovely, dark and deep. But I have promises to keep, and miles to go 
before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleepÂ. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), President, resumed the Chair. 
133. Mr ENKHBAT (Mongolia) expressed appreciation for the commendable efforts and 
achievements of the Agency in the fields of technical cooperation, nuclear safety and security, and 
verification. 
134. Mongolia recognized the importance of effective and efficient implementation of the technical 
cooperation programme. During the 2009Â2011 cycle, Mongolia had been implementing 11 technical 
cooperation projects with cooperation set to continue addressing some of the countryÂs development 
goals in 2012Â2013. Mongolia was also participating in 14 regional projects and in the RCA, which 
had contributed to the development of nuclear research and technology transfer, as well as expanding 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 20 
cooperation on the development of human resources and training. Cooperation between the Agency 
and Mongolia had been fruitful and effective in terms of human resources development, public health 
and livestock production, contributing to achieving the countryÂs socio-economic goals. That was 
clearly reflected in MongoliaÂs CPF for 2009Â2014, which also addressed uranium mining regulations 
and radiation protection and nuclear safety. 
135. In the agriculture sector, a major area for development, the Government was pursuing its efforts 
to improve animal heath and animal productivity, including through an Agency technical cooperation 
project on using nuclear technology to increase animal productivity. A specialized radioimmunology 
laboratory to monitor reproductive efficiency and the nutritional value of feed had been established at 
the Mongolian State University of Agriculture and the Research Institute of Animal Husbandry. 
Improved nutritional management had reduced input costs for farmers by almost 67% and raised the 
resistance of livestock to the harsh winter. 
136. There had also been improvement of the national capacity for the utilization of the artificial 
insemination of yaks and cattle, the assessment of the nutritional value of feeds and the identification 
of toxic plants and plants containing bioactive compounds from industrial products. 
137. The ongoing project ÂSupporting the sustainable production and supply of vaccines and 
diagnostic kits for transboundary animal diseasesÂ played an important role in identifying Mongolian 
livestock free from rinderpest disease; Mongolia hoped that cooperation in that area would continue. 
138. Mongolia attached great importance to PACT. Cooperation with the Agency focused on the 
prevention and early detection of cancer and on the provision of radiotherapy. After the PACT mission 
to Mongolia in 2009, the country has been designated the eighth PACT Model Demonstration Site 
country. That would enable Mongolia to combine its resources and expertise with PACT, the World 
Health Organization and other partners and stakeholders. In accordance with the recommendations of 
the PACT mission, MongoliaÂs Ministry of Health had established the National Cancer Control 
Steering Committee on 13 May 2010 to implement the national subprogramme. The Steering 
Committee was headed by the Deputy Minister of Health and included representatives of various 
stakeholders, such as relevant departments of the Ministry of Health, the Nuclear Energy Agency, the 
Health Sciences University and the Cancer-Free Mongolia National Foundation. 
139. Despite its financial difficulties, Mongolia had met its commitments to the TCF including its 
national participation costs. 
140. Mongolia was one of the countries that had expressed an interest in expanding their nuclear 
programmes and constructing nuclear power plants to meet growing electricity demands. The Agency 
had already provided recommendations on the first steps towards the development of the countryÂs 
nuclear programme and uranium production. To ensure public acceptance and the active participation 
of all stakeholders, the Government was preparing a long-term programme for the research, 
development and utilization of nuclear energy. It was important that the Agency continue to provide 
technical assistance and support to developing Member States on all aspects of uranium mining. 
Currently, Mongolia was exploring its uranium reserves and aimed to start uranium production in 
2012. It would work closely with the AgencyÂs Uranium Production Site Appraisal Team to promote 
best practices and safety in the uranium production cycle. 
141. Protecting workers, the public and the environment from ionizing radiation was one of the most 
important priorities of the Government of Mongolia. It would also continue to give priority to the 
controlled and secure management of radiation sources as described in the AgencyÂs Code of Conduct 
on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 21 
142. Under the Second Line of Defense Program initiated by the United States of America, 10 State 
border points had been equipped with radiation detection equipment. Execution of the project would 
help to improve the efficiency of inspections and implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1540 (2004). 
143. Strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime was one of the pillars of MongoliaÂs foreign 
policy. The countryÂs nuclear-weapon-free status made an important contribution not only to the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime but also to strengthening confidence in the region. 
144. Finally, Mongolia welcomed the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The Agency 
must play a greater role in the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. 
145. Mr TÃTH (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization) said that, together, the Commission and the Agency constituted a formidable 
multilateral advocate for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The current session of the 
General Conference was taking place a few months after the successful conclusion of the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference, which had overcome the failure of 2005 and re-confirmed the NPT as the 
foundation of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The Conference had reassured the international 
community of its own capacity to act, and of the merits of multilateralism and collective action in the 
face of common challenges. 
146. The Review Conference had also reaffirmed the essential role of the CTBT in nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation. The participants had agreed on the vital importance of prompt 
entry into force of the CTBT as a core element of the non-proliferation regime and in the current 
security environment. It was essential for the international community to implement the 
recommendations of the Review Conference. 
147. A strong and verifiable final barrier to a nuclear weapons capability was vital to any 
comprehensive approach to assessing common security challenges. States which already possessed 
nuclear weapons needed to test in order to develop new and more sophisticated weapons, and 
would-be nuclear-weapon States needed to test the technical and scientific aspects of their proposed 
nuclear programmes. The entry into force of the CTBT making the de facto international norm against 
nuclear testing legally binding would close that door once and for all. 
148. Considerable progress had been made in development of the CTBT verification regime. Once 
the CTBT was fully operational, issues of non-compliance would be addressed in a pre-determined 
and pre-agreed manner. In view of the concerns over non-compliance in other areas of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, the compliance mechanisms built into the CTBT were very important for 
pursuing the overall objectives of the NPT. 
149. Furthermore, the CTBT could promote nuclear disarmament. Providing a strong legal barrier 
against nuclear testing, it would curb the development of new designs of nuclear weapons. As a strong 
confidence- and security-building measure, it was an essential element of the process of deeper arms 
cuts currently being discussed by the nuclear-weapon States. A CTBT in force would help to bring 
about multilateral disarmament involving all States in possession of nuclear weapons. It could also 
serve as a confidence- and security-building measure in regions such as the Middle East and Asia. 
150. The NPT-based non-proliferation and disarmament regime was facing many challenges and the 
common enemy was the very real prospect of nuclear terrorism. With much more fissile material in 
circulation, it was essential to create a comprehensive set of barriers against misuse. Existing standards 
should be strengthened, and new standards established and enforced. The CTBT offered such a 
systematic approach to address those challenges. 
GC(54)/OR.3 
21 September 2010, Page 22 
151. The Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT had been held in 
September 2009 in New York, attended by over 110 countries including 40 ministerial-level 
participants. The Conference had been an unequivocal expression of the international communityÂs 
continued faith in the CTBT and the Commission. In its strongly worded final declaration, adopted by 
consensus, States which had not yet done so were urged to sign and ratify the CTBT so that it could 
enter into force. The final declaration had been supported by the non-ratifying States China, Egypt, 
Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel and the United States of America. The United Nations 
Security Council, in its turn, had called for the entry into force of the CTBT at an early date. 
152. On 23 September 2010, a Commission ministerial meeting was due to be held in the margins of 
the General Assembly session in New York. To date, 182 countries had signed the CTBT and 153 of 
them had ratified it. Nine of the 44 States with the relevant nuclear technology capability still had to 
ratify the Treaty before it could enter into force. The Commission believed that the prospects for entry 
into force were more positive than they had been many years in light of the renewed impetus for 
nuclear disarmament and the elimination of nuclear weapons. The political will of the international 
community was evident, but it must be translated into concrete action. The CTBTÂs verification 
regime was almost complete and it had been tried and tested following the two nuclear test explosions 
conducted by the DPRK. While not the answer to all non-proliferation concerns, the CTBT was an 
integral part of a comprehensive nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and its entry into 
force could help to solve many of the current and future challenges facing that regime.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 (continued) 
(GC(54)/4) 
1. Mr AL HARTHI (Oman) said that his country had been progressively assuming its 
responsibilities as an active member of the Agency and it hoped to benefit from the services and 
possibilities which the Agency offered. It also did not shirk paying its contributions to the Regular 
Budget and the TCF. 
2. 2010 had witnessed important developments in the nuclear sphere. Three particularly 
noteworthy events had been the International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy held in 
Paris from 8 to 9 March 2010, the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington from 12 to 13 April 
2010, and the NPT Review Conference organized by the United Nations in New York from 3 to 
28 May 2010. Those three events would doubtless have a profound impact on international 
cooperation in the nuclear sphere for a number of years to come. Implementation of the resulting 
action plans would require exhaustive and serious efforts by all States without exception. The 
Sultanate of Oman, for its part, would do its utmost to meet its international, regional and bilateral 
obligations regarding development, growth and welfare, and international security and stability. 
3. The Sultanate of Oman was continuing its cooperation with the Agency and friendly States with 
a view to using nuclear energy and technologies that were proven to be effective and superior to 
others, in order to find suitable solutions to the questions and challenges it was facing in its 
endeavours to achieve sustainable development. 
4. The four technical cooperation projects it had submitted to the Agency, and which had been 
approved by the Board of Governors in November 2009, testified to the high importance Oman 
attached to all peaceful uses of nuclear energy for its socio-economic development and for meeting its 
energy and water needs. 
5. The Sultanate was determined to benefit from both national and regional technical cooperation 
projects with the Agency in the areas of human health, agriculture, food, management of water 
resources and protection of the environment. It welcomed the initiative to set up a regional cooperation 
framework between the Agency and States in Asia and the Pacific. Such a framework would certainly 
lead to projects that were better aligned and more relevant to the interests and needs of the States in 
the region. 
6. In the area of nuclear and radiation safety, the Sultanate of Oman had taken note with great 
satisfaction of the information contained in the AgencyÂs Annual Report, which highlighted the 
improvement in nuclear and radiation safety worldwide over the preceding two decades. Oman urged 
all States to redouble their efforts to avoid the risk of nuclear and radiological incidents and abide by 
the AgencyÂs nuclear and radiation safety standards. The various global and regional networks 
established recently in the area of nuclear and radiation safety had started to bring rewards in terms of 
building human resources and exchange of information, as a result of the assistance provided by 
participating States. 
7. Oman was confident that the project to set up an Arab network for regulatory and supervisory 
bodies with the support of the Agency and other regional organizations would contribute to 
establishing a safety culture and strengthening safety infrastructure as a preliminary step towards 
various peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 2 
8. His country welcomed the outcomes of the recent NPT Review Conference and the consensus 
reached on the action plans related to the TreatyÂs three main axes, namely: nuclear disarmament, 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. He reaffirmed the 
importance of each of those three axes. The consensus agreement on holding a conference in 2012 on 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East gave grounds for optimism as 
regards finding a solution to the current impasse and enabling the region to enjoy security and stability 
like other regions of the world. Transparency and clarity were required from all States in order to 
achieve the desired objective. 
9. His country also welcomed the outcomes of the Washington Nuclear Security Summit, which 
had placed emphasis on the fundamental responsibility of States to ensure the security of nuclear 
material and installations, and on the prevention of all criminal acts in that sphere. Implementing the 
commitments made by certain States during the Summit, and ensuring an effective nuclear security 
regime, would require ongoing efforts on the part of all States as well as solid international 
cooperation in training professional staff, establishing legislation, and providing equipment and the 
necessary materials. In that regard, Oman commended the positive work that had been done by the 
International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. 
10. The Sultanate of Oman would be following closely the efforts of the working group on 
financing of the AgencyÂs activities, for which a meeting had been convened by the Board of 
Governors immediately following the General Conference to examine the real benefits to be gained 
from administrative reform and improved working practices, and the question of resources for the 
TCF. 
11. In conclusion, he reiterated his countryÂs confidence in the effective role played by the Agency 
in ensuring the best and secure use of nuclear energy in peaceful applications in various aspects of 
daily life. 
12. Monsignor BALESTRERO (Holy See) conveyed the best wishes and cordial greetings of 
Pope Benedict XVI, who encouraged the efforts of the international community to ensure progressive 
disarmament and a world free of nuclear weapons, the presence of which threatened the life of the 
planet and the integral development of present and future generations. 
13. The Agency could look back with satisfaction on what had been achieved under the three pillars 
of its mandate since its establishment. However, many challenges remained, a number of which had 
been highlighted by the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The Holy See regarded the NPT as the 
cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the basis for pursuing nuclear 
disarmament, and an important element for further development of nuclear energy applications for 
peaceful purposes. As the NPT was the only multilateral legal instrument in force that was intended to 
bring about a world free of nuclear weapons, it must never be allowed to be weakened. Other priorities 
were the entry into force of the CTBT and the ratification by all States Â particularly nuclear-weapon 
States Â of protocols to nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. The Holy See strongly supported efforts to 
establish such a zone in the Middle East, as a sign of trust and an affirmation that peace and security 
were possible without possessing nuclear weapons. Humanity deserved the full cooperation of all 
States on such an important matter. Every step along the non-proliferation and disarmament path had 
to be based on the principles of the pre-eminent and inherent value of human dignity and the centrality 
of the human person, which constituted the basis of international humanitarian law. In his message to 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Pope Benedict XVI had stated that: ÂThe process towards a 
coordinated and secure nuclear disarmament is strictly connected to the full and rapid fulfilment of the 
relevant international commitments. Peace, in fact, rests on trust and on respect for promises made, not 
merely on the equilibrium of forces. In this spirit, I encourage the initiatives that seek progressive 
disarmament and the creation of zones free of nuclear weapons, with a view to their complete 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 3 
elimination from the planet. I exhort all those participating in the New York meeting to overcome the 
burdens of history and to weave patiently a political and economic web of peace in order to foster 
integral human development and the authentic aspirations of peoplesÂ. 
14. Since its establishment, the Agency had been an irreplaceable point of reference for 
international cooperation on the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and for integral human 
development. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was one of the principal instruments for 
transferring nuclear science and technology to Member States in order to promote socio-economic 
development. When tailored to the needs of the recipient States, it helped combat poverty and could 
thus contribute to a more peaceful solution to the serious problems facing humanity. Nuclear and 
isotopic techniques had proven increasingly helpful in meeting basic human needs and addressing 
major challenges, especially in the developing world. The research activities and technical cooperation 
projects that had been completed in recent years, or were under way, continued to yield encouraging 
results and provided innovative ways of tackling problems that affected many people in their daily 
lives. The AgencyÂs efforts in that regard were highly appreciated and should be continued through 
fruitful cooperation and partnership with recipient countries. 
15. The peaceful applications of nuclear techniques could make a contribution to responding to the 
most pressing needs, such as management of drinking water supplies, production of crops with 
improved yields or greater salt tolerance in arid climates, and the eradication of disease-transmitting 
and otherwise harmful pests in an environmentally friendly manner. They could also be used 
effectively in the study of child malnutrition and in disease diagnosis and treatment. 
16. More than 50% of patients diagnosed with cancer would benefit from radiotherapy applied 
either alone or in conjunction with surgery and chemotherapy, but in the developing world more than 
50% of cancer sufferers would not have access to radiotherapy owing to a lack of appropriate 
equipment and sufficiently trained staff with expertise in clinical and medical physics. The topic of the 
current yearÂs scientific forum was thus most relevant. The Holy See appreciated the efforts of the 
Agency and its partners to develop and expand cancer control programmes, including the provision 
and upgrade of essential equipment, appropriate training of doctors, physicists and technicians, and 
international exchange of relevant information. One of the AgencyÂs main tasks had been to develop 
and refine the standards and codes of practice in medical radiation dosimetry. The worldwide network 
of standard dosimetry laboratories provided calibration services to hospitals Â especially in 
developing countries Â in order to assist their quality assurance programmes. The Holy See 
encouraged the Agency to continue and strengthen all such activities, particularly PACT, which 
assisted Member States in the tremendous task of combating cancer and creating regional centres of 
excellence for radiotherapy. 
17. The late Pope John Paul II had stated that: ÂAlthough people are rightly worried [...] about 
preserving the natural habitats of the various animal species threatened with extinction, [...] too little 
effort is made to safeguard the moral conditions for an authentic Âhuman ecologyÂ.Â In his message for 
the 2010 World Day of Peace, Pope Benedict XVI had stated that: Âwhen human ecology is respected 
within society, environmental ecology also benefits. [...] The book of nature is one and indivisible; it 
includes not only the environment but also individual, family and social ethics. Our duties towards the 
environment flow from our duties towards the person, considered both individually and in relation to 
others.Â It was in that way that the Holy See viewed, and invited others to view, the AgencyÂs 
contribution to peace, health and prosperity. 
18. Mr TZOTCHEV (Bulgaria) said that the Agency must continue to play its crucial role in the 
implementation of the NPT. Its safeguards mechanism was a key instrument to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. As one of its first countries to sign and ratify an additional protocol, 
Bulgaria called for the swift universalization of that instrument. The international community should 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 4 
facilitate the peaceful use of nuclear technology while addressing proactively related safety, security 
and proliferation risks. To do that, it needed viable multilateral mechanisms under the auspices of the 
Agency. 
19. In view of the current security challenges and, in particular, the danger of nuclear proliferation 
to terrorist organizations, strengthened NPT provisions and Agency safeguards were valuable tools. 
The peaceful use of nuclear energy should be based on full compliance with the NPT and transparency 
of nuclear programmes. Forty years after its adoption and entry into force, the NPT remained the 
cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and was as relevant as ever. 
Non-proliferation objectives could be best achieved through full and comprehensive implementation 
of the provisions of the NPT by all State Parties. In that regard, his country welcomed the adoption of 
the final document at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which reconfirmed the consensus on the 
significance of the Treaty. The document also outlined several concrete measures for strengthening 
nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
20. As a country that was convinced that the NPT continued to be one of building blocks of the 
international security architecture and crucial to controlling nuclear proliferation, and having signed 
and ratified the CTBT, Bulgaria was deeply concerned at the DPRKÂs decision in 2003 to withdraw 
from the NPT and resume work on its nuclear programmes. The nuclear tests carried out by the DPRK 
in 2006 and 2009 were also deeply disturbing. All States party to the NPT, including the DPRK, were 
bound by their obligations under the Treaty. The DPRK should comply with its international 
obligations under the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and Agency standards, and 
should return to the six-party talks with a view to achieving the full, internationally verifiable and 
irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
21. Bulgaria was following the developments in the Iranian nuclear issue closely. IranÂs nuclear 
activities gave cause for grave concern and he called on that country to comply fully with all relevant 
Security Council resolutions and Agency standards and safeguards unconditionally, unequivocally and 
without delay. His country recognized every StateÂs inalienable right to develop a nuclear programme 
for peaceful purposes. Iran should restore international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear 
activities. A major step in that direction was the ratification and implementation of the additional 
protocol, which Iran had already signed. 
22. Given the important contribution of nuclear-weapon-free zones to strengthening the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and regional peace and security, his country supported the establishment of 
such a zone in the Middle East. 
23. The Annual Report offered a clear and analytical picture of the AgencyÂs important 
achievements in a range of areas in 2009. His country welcomed the fact that the safety performance 
of the nuclear industry had remained at a high level, showing a steady improvement over the previous 
decades. The good performance and safety record of nuclear power, continuing concerns about climate 
change and energy security, the high price of fossil fuels and the growing energy demand were leading 
to rising expectations of nuclear power. In that context, the Agency must continue to play an important 
role in strengthening the global nuclear safety framework. He commended the organization for 
supporting national and international efforts aimed at the safe and secure use of nuclear technology. 
24. Technical cooperation had always been and would remain an important activity of the Agency. 
Human health, nuclear power, nuclear safety and security, industrial applications of radiation, 
management of radioactive waste and decommissioning were areas where the AgencyÂs assistance was 
of a great significance. Cooperation on those issues within regions and between regions under the 
AgencyÂs auspices was most welcome. The main task for the European region was to promote sharing 
of knowledge and best practices. His country was ready to support efforts in that regard by providing 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 5 
experts and training facilities. Recognizing the need for assured, sufficient and predictable financing 
of technical cooperation activities, Bulgaria paid its annual contribution to the TCF in full and on time. 
25. In June 2009, the European Union had adopted a nuclear safety directive which gave binding 
force to major nuclear safety standards in all 27 Member States. The entry into force of the directive 
had been preceded by discussions and Bulgaria, through its experts, had participated actively in the 
development of the directive within a series of forums held at the initiative of European Community 
institutions and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. Following the harmonization of 
respective domestic legislation with the directive, Community law would be in line with the basic 
safety principles stipulated in the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards 
and Council Directive 96/29/EURATOM. The European Union was currently in the process of 
developing a similar directive on the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste and his 
country welcomed the constructive approach applied to that process. 
26. The Kozloduy nuclear power plant had conducted a periodic safety review of Units 5 and 6 in 
connection with the licence renewal and in fulfilment of operating license conditions. It was the first 
time such a review had been performed in the country and its scope complied with Agency standards, 
while the methodology used had been developed based on national legislation and following extensive 
consultations between the regulator and the licensee. Pursuant to the review, a report on the 
reassessment of unit safety, and programmes to enhance nuclear safety and radiation protection had 
been submitted to the Bulgarian Nuclear Regulatory Agency. After a thorough review of the 
documents, in November 2009 the Nuclear Regulatory Agency had issued a new operating licence for 
the two units expiring in 2017 and 2019 respectively. Inter alia, the licences specified the approaches, 
measures and timescales for further licence renewal with a view to long-term operation. Specific steps 
in that direction had already been taken by both the Kozloduy nuclear power plant and the Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency. 
27. The application for approval of the technical design of the proposed Belene nuclear power plant 
was currently being reviewed. The expert reviews and assessments of the initial versions of the 
technical design, interim safety analysis report and the probabilistic safety analysis had been 
completed in September 2009. The main objectives of the regulatory review carried out by Nuclear 
Regulatory Agency and its consultants, including Agency experts, were to ensure that the design was 
in compliance with Bulgarian legislation, Agency safety requirements and best international practices, 
and in step with the latest scientific and technological developments. The applicant had been sent the 
results of the assessments and the Nuclear Regulatory Agency had received the revised documents in 
May 2010. A follow-up expert review of the Belene design was being carried out with active 
international involvement, including the Agency. An IPSART follow-up mission would be conducted 
in October 2010. 
28. Safety should not be taken for granted. It was a continuous process which required open 
exchange of knowledge and experience and sharing of good practices among Member States and with 
international organizations. Bulgaria had invited the Agency to conduct two expert missions in 2012: 
an IRRS mission to review the activities of the regulator and an OSART mission to review operational 
safety at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant. 
Mr Mabhongo (South Africa) took the Chair. 
29. Mr YAMANI (Saudi Arabia) commended the Agency on its dedicated action to promote 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to establish a global safety and security regime that protected 
humankind from the spectre of a nuclear catastrophe. 
30. On 17 April 2010, the Government of Saudi Arabia had taken the wise decision to establish 
King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy, which would seek to diversify energy sources 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 6 
and establish national priorities and policies designed to meet the growing demand for energy and 
water. The City would identify national requirements and draw up detailed and well crafted plans to 
meet them, achieving an increase in the average rate of sustainable development in the Kingdom, 
raising living standards and improving the quality of life. It would also enable the Kingdom to 
increase its expertise in accordance with international treaties governing peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. The City was mandated to represent the Kingdom at the Agency, to ensure compliance with 
international obligations pertaining to nuclear energy, to develop national scientific expertise and to 
obtain the requisite technology to take advantage of diverse applications of nuclear and renewable 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
31. There had recently been a dramatic increase in the demand for nuclear energy owing to wider 
recognition of its benefits for electricity generation. He welcomed the AgencyÂs undertaking at the 
International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy, held in Paris in March 2010, to assist 
States, especially developing countries, in establishing the necessary nuclear infrastructure. 
32. He commended the AgencyÂs activities to combat cancer and, in particular, the organization of 
the scientific forum on cancer in developing countries as a side event to the General Conference. He 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to give priority to a matter of such vital importance. 
33. Saudi Arabia attached great importance to nuclear safety and security. Although the prime 
responsibility in that regard lay with the States concerned, his country supported the AgencyÂs efforts 
to promote a global safety culture, to establish effective and sustainable regulatory structures, to 
develop binding legal instruments and guidelines concerning peaceful uses of nuclear energy, ionizing 
radiation and radioactive material, and to promote international cooperation and exchange of 
experience in that regard. Saudi Arabia also supported measures to enhance the security of nuclear and 
radioactive material, and action to combat illicit trafficking in such material as well as nuclear and 
radiological terrorism. The Nuclear Security Summit convened in Washington in April 2010 had 
reaffirmed the determination of the participating States to support the Agency in its fight against 
nuclear terrorism and its action to promote nuclear security. The Agency had in turn committed itself 
to supporting States in their efforts to improve nuclear security structures. 
34. He emphasized the importance of serious and ongoing action to achieve universality of the NPT 
in order to bolster international and regional security and stability, especially in the Middle East, given 
that Israel remained outside the non-proliferation regime. In that context, he welcomed the outcome of 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference, especially the decision to implement the 1995 resolution 
concerning the Middle East. He also welcomed the decision in the final document of the NPT Review 
Conference to convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons 
and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East region, and expressed the hope that the 
Agency would play an effective role in preparing for that important event. 
35. Ms ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia) said that her country welcomed the results of the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference and the reaffirmation by the State Parties of their commitment to the non-proliferation 
regime. 
36. Nuclear energy covered nearly 50% of SlovakiaÂs electricity needs. The objective of SlovakiaÂs 
energy security strategy up to 2030, which had been approved by the Government two years 
previously, was to achieve a competitive energy sector which provided a safe, reliable and efficient 
supply of all forms of energy at acceptable prices, taking into account consumer and environmental 
protection, sustainable development, supply and technical security. Under the strategy, nuclear power 
plants would continue to play a major role in meeting the countryÂs electricity needs. 
37. Important steps had been taken to offset the shortfall in electricity production caused by the 
shutdown of two units of the Bohunice nuclear power plant. The completion of the third and fourth 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 7 
units of the Mochovce nuclear power plant was progressing well. On 4 September, the reactor pressure 
vessel of the third unit had been installed. The new units should begin operating in 2012 and 
2013 respectively and would make a major contribution to ensuring the countryÂs energy security. Her 
Government would also be supporting a private investment project to build a new nuclear power 
source at the Bohunice site without State participation. 
38. An essential aspect of the European UnionÂs Europe 2020 strategy was a gradual transition 
towards a low-carbon economy. Nuclear energy would continue to contribute to that objective, 
together with increasing use of renewable energy sources. In that connection, her Government had 
hosted the fifth plenary meeting of the European Nuclear Energy Forum in Bratislava in May. 
Founded in 2007 through the joint efforts of the Slovak and Czech Prime Ministers and the initiative 
of the European Commission, the Forum served as a platform for discussions on nuclear energy in the 
context of energy security and provided an opportunity to address topics related to research and 
science in that field. Three working groups dealt with nuclear energy opportunities, nuclear energy 
safety, and information and transparency. The Forum had welcomed the results of the Brussels 
conference organized in 2009 by the European Economic and Social Committee, and of the 
Luxembourg round table organized earlier in 2010 by the European Commission and the French 
National Association of Local Information Commissions on the possible application in the nuclear 
field of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and 
Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. 
39. Slovakia attached great importance to nuclear safety and security. According to its independent 
nuclear regulatory authority, all nuclear installations in the country were operating safely and reliably, 
and in accordance with national regulations and SlovakiaÂs international commitments. 
40. The AgencyÂs expert services were an essential part of international cooperation and a 
confidence-building measure which supported the national regulatory decision-making process. Her 
country appreciated in particular the participation of Agency experts in the mission to the railway 
vehicle inspection system in eastern Slovakia in October 2009. The missionÂs conclusions had helped 
settle a technical cross-border issue which had arisen after the introduction of new scanning equipment 
at the European Union Schengen border. 
41. Turning to the field of human health, she drew attention to a new Slovak-Russian project 
relating to proton therapy in oncology whose aim was to provide better and more efficient treatment 
for cancer patients through range-intensity-modulated proton therapy, to decrease side-effects and 
improve the quality of life of patients. The proton therapy complex at the Central Military Hospital in 
RuÂomberok had third-generation equipment. The technology had been under development for 
25 years and three units were being put into operation in the Russian Federation, the United States and 
Slovakia. Her country believed that the future of proton therapy lay in third-generation single-room 
treatment units, which were suitable for small hospitals and were much more affordable for 
developing countries. 
42. Slovakia had been working with the Agency on national, regional and interregional technical 
cooperation projects. Preparations for the new technical cooperation biennium had begun. SlovakiaÂs 
national projects would focus on nuclear regulation, decommissioning, human health and nuclear 
science applications. 
43. In the field of nuclear science applications, Slovak universities and research institutions were 
establishing a joint centre for nuclear technologies and education and training with the aim of 
improving applications of nuclear techniques in science and industry. The basic instrument at the 
centre was a tandem accelerator with the necessary infrastructure for ion beam analyses in 
nanotechnologies and accelerator mass spectrometry in environmental and medical sciences. The 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 8 
centre was expected to operate as a regional European facility and could also provide training and 
analytical services to Member States through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects. It would 
make modern nuclear technologies available to countries which could not afford such research. 
Slovakia also intended to contribute to regional projects, in particular in the areas of nuclear safety and 
technical assistance to Member States. As in the past, it would continue to provide experts and training 
facilities and would pursue a general policy of hosting fellows and scientists sponsored by the Agency. 
44. Mr GALSTYAN (Armenia) said that the recent resurgence of interest in nuclear power could 
disrupt the sensitive balance of international security. Thus, more emphasis should be placed on the 
NPT safeguards regime to ensure non-proliferation and the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
Armenia was improving its national legislation and complying fully with its international 
commitments in that regard, including those under its additional protocol. 
45. Each year Armenia accepted up to 10 missions to verify the safety and security of its nuclear 
power plant. An OSART mission was scheduled for May 2011. International experts had helped to 
assess the seismic safety of the Armenian nuclear power plant. Modelling of various kinds of 
unforeseen incidents and emergencies had shown that the plant was within the design limits as regards 
seismic safety. 
46. Since the recommissioning of Unit No. 2 of the Armenian nuclear power plant, over 
US $90 million had been spent on safety upgrading, which remained a high priority for his 
Government. He thanked the many donors who had contributed to that work, and the Agency for its 
coordination efforts. Also, work on expanding the existing dry storage facility for spent fuel at the 
plant was ongoing with construction about to enter the third phase. 
47. The Armenian-Russian Mining Company had been set up in 2008 to prospect for possible 
uranium mining sites and exploration work was under way. His country was hoping to receive Agency 
assistance with the elaboration of normative documents in that field. 
48. In October 2008, Armenia had joined the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. 
49. In addition, Armenia was now a fully-fledged member of the International Uranium Enrichment 
Centre in Angarsk, established by the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. 
50. His country was preparing to accede to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
51. On 20 August 2010, the Governments of Armenia and the Russian Federation had signed a 
cooperation agreement on the construction of a new nuclear power unit in Armenia, and a joint 
Armenian-Russian company had been set up by Government decree. The Russian NPP-92 design had 
been approved for the nuclear island of the new plant. The other components were the subject of 
negotiations and competitive bidding. 
52. He noted the significance of INPRO for the further development of nuclear energy. INPRO was 
currently celebrating its 10th anniversary. Armenia was a major partner in INPRO projects, especially 
those relating to countries with a small energy grids and territories. 
53. In closing, he expressed appreciation for the efficient cooperation between his country and the 
Agency. The Department of Technical Cooperation, in particular, had helped implement a range of 
national and regional projects in the country. He likewise thanked all donors and other partners for 
their support. 
54. Mr TURGANOV (Kazakhstan) said that his country spared no effort to strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime. In closing down the nuclear test site at Semipalatinsk and voluntary 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 9 
relinquishing nuclear weapons it had demonstrated its commitment to the principles of the NPT. At the 
initiative of the President of Kazakhstan, the United Nations had declared 29 August 2010 Â the 20th 
anniversary of the closure of the Semipalatinsk test site Â the first International Day against Nuclear 
Tests. Kazakhstan shared the view that the NPT and the global non-proliferation system as a whole 
could not function effectively without the entry into force of the CTBT. 
55. His country had played a major role in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
Central Asia and it hoped that that example could be useful to other regions of the world. In particular, 
it supported the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East. Kazakhstan would continue to work 
steadily towards the goal of a peaceful and secure world. 
56. Kazakhstan was implementing the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism and encouraged those countries that had not yet done so to accede to that 
convention. 
57. His country was implementing fully the provisions of United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1540 (2004) by taking steps to improve further its system for preventing illicit trafficking in 
nuclear and other radioactive material. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger 
Committee, it made very effort to maintain tight control over nuclear exports, including equipment 
used for uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. 
58. Kazakhstan appreciated the AgencyÂs work to ensure that nuclear energy was used safely and 
securely, and only for peaceful purposes, and in particular its activities to strengthen the nuclear safety 
regime, which were of global importance as any large-scale nuclear accident could have serious 
cross-border consequences. In 2010, Kazakhstan had ratified and acceded to four conventions relating 
to nuclear safety, and its parliament was currently reviewing a draft law on accession to the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
59. The Washington Nuclear Security Summit had reconfirmed the commitment of a majority of 
States to strengthening the nuclear security regime and Kazakhstan hoped that the principles agreed 
upon at that Summit would be fully supported by Agency Member States. Kazakhstan itself was 
taking steps to implement the SummitÂs work plan. 
60. Work was under way in Kazakhstan on the decommissioning of the BN-350 reactor. The 
transfer of spent fuel to a long-term storage facility had begun and should be completed in 2010. With 
the support of the United States Department of Energy, a project was being implemented to convert 
the WWR-K research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics to low-enriched fuel. Kazakhstan was 
also developing radioisotope production technology that used LEU. 
61. He called on all States to work towards the universalization of safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols, and on those countries that had not yet concluded such agreements with the 
Agency to do so without delay. 
62. As the Agency was the leading global forum in the area of scientific and technical cooperation 
on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, it was important that States support its activities to transfer 
and develop technologies and knowledge related to nuclear applications, including nuclear power and 
the nuclear fuel cycle. The AgencyÂs efforts relating to human resources development in the field of 
nuclear science and technology were particularly important to Kazakhstan. 
63. He drew attention to his countryÂs work in collaboration with the Agency in the field of nuclear 
medicine, and also in assessing the contamination of part of the Semipalatinsk test site with a view to 
its economic use. Kazakhstan intended to develop its technical cooperation with the Agency further. It 
paid its contribution to the AgencyÂs budget regularly and its voluntary contributions to the TCF, and 
it intended to meet its financial obligations in the future in full and without conditions. 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 10 
64. Kazakhstan was a leading producer of uranium ore, had the capacity to produce nuclear fuel and 
intended to expand its involvement in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy within the framework of the 
NPT and the Agency. Kazatomprom, the national atomic energy company was in the process of 
establishing a vertically integrated company with a full nuclear fuel cycle. Uranium isotope separation 
would be conducted at facilities in the Russian Federation with the involvement of Kazakh partners. 
65. His country supported the initiative to create an international nuclear fuel bank under Agency 
auspices and the discussion of that issue at the December meetings of the Board of Governors. It 
hoped a consensus could be reached on the matter. The establishment of international mechanisms for 
assurance of supply should not infringe the rights of Member States to develop their own nuclear fuel 
cycle capacities. Any such mechanism should also not be politicized or discriminatory but should be 
accessible to all States that were in compliance with their safeguards agreements. Any transfer of 
nuclear material should take place in accordance with non-political criteria in an objective and 
consistent manner. In January 2010, Kazakhstan had informed the Agency that it was prepared to host 
any future international nuclear fuel bank. 
66. Though it was an active and responsible member of the Agency, his country was deeply 
concerned that it was denied the opportunity to participate fully in the work of the AgencyÂs 
policy-making organs. It thus called for the early entry into force of the amendment to Article VI of 
the Statute. 
67. Ms MYKOLAICHUK (Ukraine) welcomed the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. The action plan that had been agreed upon demonstrated the resolve of all States not only 
to uphold but also to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Ukraine had always been committed to 
effective multilateral action against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and had 
contributed to the success of the Conference by chairing the committee on non-proliferation issues. In 
2010, agreement had been secured on further steps to implement the 1995 NPT Review Conference 
resolution on the Middle East, including a conference to be held in 2012. It was important that the 
AgencyÂs General Conference build on the results of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and avoid 
trends that might undermine the success achieved. 
68. Ukraine reaffirmed the AgencyÂs verification role under the NPT. The AgencyÂs safeguards 
system was a fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol constituted the current highest verification 
standard. She noted the increased number of countries that had brought an additional protocol into 
force and, while the milestone of 100 countries had been reached, her country continued to call on 
those States which had not yet done so to follow suit as soon as possible. 
69. Her country strictly fulfilled its non-proliferation obligations and had had a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in force since January 2006. It appreciated the tireless 
efforts of the AgencyÂs inspectors and welcomed the move towards integrated safeguards, and in 
particular the AgencyÂs emphasis on an information-driven safeguards system. Work was ongoing to 
establish the necessary conditions for applying integrated safeguards in Ukraine. 
70. Each country had the right to define its own energy strategy. The Agency had a key role to play 
in helping countries ensure that nuclear power was used under the most stringent legal, operational, 
safety, security and non-proliferation conditions. Human resources development, including education 
and training, was of vital importance for the safe, secure and peaceful use of atomic energy. Emerging 
and expanding nuclear power programmes, and the more sophisticated and wider use of radiation 
sources, would be short-lived without proper attention to safety and security. Ukraine strongly 
supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at improving nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, as 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 11 
well as security, worldwide. International cooperation was crucial to promoting the global nuclear 
safety and security framework. 
71. Both the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had been developed, inter alia, on 
the basis of the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident. Both conventions provided governments 
with valuable instruments for streamlining national activities to achieve the highest safety levels. It 
was in the best interests of any State embarking on a nuclear power programme to become a 
contracting party to those conventions without delay. The AgencyÂs comprehensive set of safety 
standards was also of fundamental importance in any nuclear power programme and nuclear 
technology application. She noted with appreciation the recent establishment of the International 
Nuclear Safety Centre and the International Seismic Safety Centre and stressed the value of both the 
technical cooperation projects and the safety review services conducted by the Agency. 
72. Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs efforts aimed at strengthening regulatory cooperation between 
nuclear safety authorities to bridge the experience gap, as well as efforts in the capacity-building area, 
particularly for regulatory authorities. It also strongly supported the launch of the Regulatory 
Cooperation Forum. 
73. In May 2010, the Agency had presented the final report of the European 
Commission-IAEA-Ukraine joint project on the safety evaluation of all operating Ukrainian nuclear 
power plants. During the preceding two years, Agency missions conducted at all 15 power reactors 
had addressed issues of design, operational and waste safety. The legal and governmental 
infrastructure had also been assessed by a full-scope IRRS mission. Ukraine was pleased to note the 
positive conclusions of that review and encouraged other countries with both mature and emerging 
nuclear power programmes to consider such missions and assessments. 
74. Ukraine encouraged States to continue discussions within the Agency on the development of 
multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle in a non-discriminatory and transparent manner. A 
first important step had been taken in 2009 with the approval of the agreement between the Agency 
and the Russian Federation on the establishment of an LEU reserve. Her country had supported that 
agreement and believed the time was now ripe to make further progress by considering the conditions 
and modalities of the functioning of that reserve. Ukraine participated in the work of the International 
Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk, the first such joint enterprise, that could serve as an example 
for future activities in the field. 
75. Turning to nuclear security, she commended the Agency on its activities aimed at assisting 
States to prevent and combat nuclear terrorism, emphasizing the important role of the Agency in 
fostering international cooperation on nuclear security, establishing a comprehensive set of guidelines 
and assisting Member States on request. Both the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington 
and the 2010 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the AgencyÂs role in strengthening nuclear 
security worldwide. 
76. In April 2010, the Presidents of Ukraine and the United States had reaffirmed in a joint 
statement their shared vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and had pledged to work together to 
prevent nuclear proliferation and secure all vulnerable nuclear material. Ukraine had resolved to get 
rid of all HEU stocks by the next summit, with financial and technical support from its partners. Work 
on transporting HEU from Ukrainian research reactors had already begun and a substantial part of the 
stocks should have been removed by the end of 2010. That voluntary step sent a clear message that 
Ukraine took non-proliferation seriously, and it hoped that others would follow its example. Its 
decision also demonstrated its commitment to the implementation of United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1887 (2009). 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 12 
77. Ukraine would continue to cooperate closely with partners to reduce the threat of nuclear 
terrorism through the implementation of special security measures and through effective control over 
sensitive materials. In that connection and in the light of the increasing threat of nuclear proliferation, 
Ukraine supported calls for an early start to negotiations on an agreement to prohibit the production of 
fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
78. With regard to the physical protection of nuclear material, Ukraine noted with concern that, five 
years after the amendment to the CPPNM had been adopted by consensus, only 41 of the 143 parties 
to the Convention had adhered to it. The amendment constituted an important benchmark in 
international efforts to improve the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities, was vitally 
important for nuclear security and would have a major impact on reducing the vulnerability of States 
to nuclear terrorism. Ukraine had deposited its instrument of ratification of the amendment in 
December 2008 and had incorporated all its provisions in national legislation. It called upon all States 
that had not yet done so to adhere to the Convention and the amendment and to act in accordance with 
the object and purpose of the amendment pending its entry into force. 
79. With regard to nuclear security competence development, Ukraine was grateful to the Agency 
for its assistance with the development of training and education facilities at the Sevastopol National 
University of Nuclear Energy and Industry, where a milestone had been reached with the graduation of 
48 nuclear security engineers in 2010. Ukraine stood ready to contribute to the implementation of the 
AgencyÂs nuclear security education programme. 
80. Her country also appreciated the considerable activities of the Agency related to strengthening 
of nuclear security measures at major public events, in particular the support that it was providing to 
Ukraine and Poland in preparation for the 2012 European football championship. 
81. Ukraine welcomed the AgencyÂs activities aimed at increasing the contribution of nuclear 
technology to health and economic development, and at promoting the dissemination of knowledge on 
the peaceful application of nuclear technology. It encouraged the Agency to pursue its work, in 
cooperation with other international organizations and stakeholders, to ensure better use of medical 
radioisotope supplies, and commended the Director General for his work on improving cancer control 
in developing countries. 
82. Technical cooperation was an important statutory function of the Agency. Regional and national 
technical cooperation projects had significantly contributed to the safety and effectiveness of the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy in Ukraine. Benefits had included safety improvements at the countryÂs 
nuclear power plants and improvements in the quality and effectiveness of nuclear medicine, 
radiotherapy and medical physics. 
83. Finally, Ukraine, with support from Belarus and the Russian Federation, planned to host an 
international conference to mark the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident in April 2011. Her 
country was grateful to the Director General, who had already indicated that the Agency was prepared 
to assist with the preparations for that event, and it looked forward to broad participation by interested 
States and international institutions. UkraineÂs strategy focused on fostering the regionÂs long-term 
development and providing people with the support they needed to lead safe and healthy lives. With 
the support of the international community, Ukraine was still restoring the Chernobyl site. As the 
major projects were entering the construction phase, substantial sums would be required to complete 
them. Her country counted on the support of donors and States at the conference to raise the funds 
required to bring the projects to a successful conclusion. 
84. Mr BOKOLE OMPOKA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) recalled that his country had 
joined the Agency in 1961, after becoming in 1959 the first country in Africa to construct and operate 
a research reactor for the production of isotopes and for training. It had signed and ratified several 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 13 
international legal instruments in the nuclear field, including the NPT, a safeguards agreement and 
additional protocol, and the Pelindaba Treaty. 
85. Thanks to the support of the Agency and some friendly countries, his countryÂs nuclear 
programme had continued for more than half a century with no major incident. His country had 
decided to refurbish its research reactor and it was aware of the challenges it would have to face as 
regards the application of safety and security standards. In opting to pursue its nuclear programme, it 
wished to reassure the Agency that that programme would be entirely peaceful in nature, focusing 
notably on training, research and the production of radioisotopes for medicine, agriculture and 
industry, without precluding the use or introduction of other technologies to achieve a diversified and 
up-to-date R&D programme. 
86. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was grateful for the assistance provided by the Agency 
and other countries to help it address the numerous challenges associated with the use of nuclear 
energy in areas ranging from training of human resources to building modern infrastructure. It would 
continue to work on implementing the recommendations of the AgencyÂs INSARR mission to improve 
the safety of the TRIGA Mark II research reactor and, in the nuclear security field, had successfully 
taken part in a technical cooperation project to improve the physical protection of nuclear and 
radiological facilities. It was eager to continue developing its civil nuclear programme, together with 
bilateral and multilateral partners, in strict compliance with its international commitments. 
87. It was no secret that uranium from the Democratic Republic of the Congo had been used by 
other nations for their nuclear weapons programmes. His country was now considering the possibility 
of reactivating uranium mining to increase its national income and promote its socio-economic 
development. A regulatory infrastructure for nuclear and radiation safety had been established in his 
country five years previously and qualified human resources had been developed through the technical 
cooperation programme. An evaluation of national uranium resources would need to be undertaken to 
give the Government a clear idea of their availability, and his country was officially requesting the 
AgencyÂs assistance in that connection. 
88. Stories had circulated in the specialized international press concerning illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, trafficking in radioactive minerals exported 
by the country and illegal mining of uranium by companies only licensed to mine copper and/or 
cobalt. His country hoped that such unfounded reports could be stopped once and for all and noted 
with satisfaction that various international missions investigating the so-called illicit trafficking had 
never proved any link between the presence of such materials in the country and illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material. 
89. Uranium mining at the Shinkolobwe mine had ceased in 1937. However, there was uranium at 
other mining sites in the country, and the copper and cobalt ores that were mined in the Katanga 
province and exported often contained traces of uranium. During the 1990s Â a time of political 
instability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Â the majority of mines had been abandoned and 
gradually taken over by the unemployed. Some accidents had taken place, including the collapse of the 
Shinkolobwe mine, which had raised questions regarding protection and security at that site. The 
President had issued a decree banning small-scale mining of copper and cobalt at the site and 
Shinkolobwe had been officially closed for all mining activity by Presidential Decree No. 007-002 of 
11 July 2007. 
90. His country made every effort to carry out regular controls of national borders with a team 
consisting of national nuclear experts and members of security forces. Large portals were currently 
being installed at border crossings, and strengthened administrative monitoring procedures would be 
implemented at some parts of the border. With borders as extensive as those in his country, the 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 14 
implementation of such a programme required the collaboration of all. His country was therefore 
planning to request technical assistance from the Agency and friendly countries in order to ensure 
appropriate and global response to all nuclear threats. 
91. The Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomed the consensus reached by the participants at 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference and called upon the Agency to implement fully its verification 
activities to achieve a world free from nuclear weapons. Multilateral and bilateral cooperation, and 
greater assistance to technologically deprived countries, would help promote peace in a world free 
from any nuclear threat. 
92. Mr ABUBAKAR (Nigeria) offered his countryÂs condolences to the Government and people of 
Pakistan for the devastation and loss of life caused by the unprecedented flooding. 
93. His country wished to place on record its appreciation for the new Director GeneralÂs support 
for NigeriaÂs key nuclear programmes. 
94. He commended the AgencyÂs excellent work in fostering and deepening international 
cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology. Nigeria agreed with the widely 
acknowledged view that all countries had the right to develop and harness nuclear energy, but that that 
right came with responsibilities. It welcomed the AgencyÂs continued support for programmes to 
expand the use of nuclear power for electricity generation around the world. A recent Agency 
publication indicated that more than sixty new countries were considering introducing nuclear power, 
and twenty of them, including many developing countries, were likely to bring their first nuclear 
power plants on line within two decades. He thanked the Agency for the support it had been providing 
to newcomer countries in that respect, but drew attention to the need for effective adherence to the 
global nuclear safety framework as those countries began harnessing nuclear energy. 
95. His country viewed the commencement of implementation of the Nuclear Security Plan 
2010Â2013 as an important milestone on the path towards enhancing physical protection of nuclear 
material and facilities. It was an opportunity for increased education and training in nuclear security 
for all regions of the world. Agency document INCIRC/225/Rev.4 (Corrected) on the physical 
protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities was of immense value in the collective pursuit of 
nuclear security and his country hoped that Member States would incorporate that important text in 
their national legislation and inter-State agreements. 
96. He welcomed the fact that the Scientific Forum during the current General Conference was 
devoted to the theme of cancer in developing countries. He also expressed appreciation to the Agency 
for the support given to Nigeria in the implementation of its national nuclear medicine and 
radiotherapy programmes, particularly in the area of human capacity development, to ensure 
effectiveness and sustainability in service delivery for the early detection and management of cancer. 
With a population of over 150 million people, Nigeria had an estimated 100 000 new cases of cancer 
annually. The three national facilities were grossly inadequate to cope with demand, hence NigeriaÂs 
continued partnership with the Agency through its technical cooperation programme with a view to 
constructing more modern facilities and expanding infrastructure, and building the requisite human 
capacity to deploy nuclear medicine and radiotherapy effectively as an important component of the 
national cancer control programme. 
97. In employing those techniques, Nigeria was committed to ensuring that the facilities were 
operated in a safe manner in conformity with the highest international standards, as prescribed by its 
national nuclear regulatory body. He expressed appreciation to the Agency for working with the 
Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to develop national capacity and install a therapy-level 
secondary standards dosimetry laboratory. That should help further enhance the use of radiotherapy 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 15 
and nuclear medicine for cancer management in Nigeria. His country hoped that its national 
programme would continue to benefit from PACT. 
98. With a large and fast-growing population, Nigeria was hard-pressed to adjust its development 
strategies to meet the timelines and expectations of the Millennium Development Goals and its 
national economic empowerment development strategy. Thus, there was a need for enhanced human 
capacity as the bedrock for provision of adequate infrastructure within targeted deadlines. Key areas of 
concern included electricity supplies, human health, agriculture and food security, water resources 
development and management, and education, with a specific focus on science and technology. 
99. Nigeria shared the concerns of the Agency and the international community regarding nuclear 
security and it noted with satisfaction the various Agency missions to the country in that connection. 
The country was committed to ensuring effective nuclear safety and security through prevention of 
access to nuclear material for malicious purposes and legislation to enhance bilateral, regional and 
multilateral cooperation among Member States, a position which had been reaffirmed at the Nuclear 
Security Summit in April 2010 which Nigeria had attended. The enthusiasm shown by the 
participating countries at the Nuclear Security Summit was very encouraging. 
100. In line with its national commitment to limiting access to radioactive sources and facilities, the 
Government of Nigeria had upgraded its monitoring facilities and major ports to track the import of 
radioactive material. He expressed appreciation to the Agency for donating the radiation portal 
monitor currently installed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos, and for 
developing NigeriaÂs capacity to secure legacy radioactive sources. 
101. His country had embarked on a nuclear power programme as part of its long-term strategy to 
achieve energy self-sufficiency and security. In addition to increasing power output, the programme 
aimed to diversify NigeriaÂs electricity generation base beyond the traditional sources of oil, gas and 
hydroelectric power to include nuclear energy and renewables. In 2007, his Government had approved 
a national nuclear power road map and had mandated the Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission to 
coordinate and manage its sustainable implementation, with a full commitment to nuclear safety, 
security and safeguards. With Agency support, his country had achieved the first milestone in the plan 
to bring nuclear energy for electricity generation on line in the next ten years. It was committed to the 
timely and successful implementation of that important project. 
102. NigeriaÂs national nuclear regulator had developed a set of regulations and guidelines to ensure 
nuclear safety and radiation protection. The country had acceded to and ratified the relevant treaties 
and conventions preparatory to the commencement of operation of nuclear power plants, thereby 
demonstrating its commitment to complying with international legal and regulatory requirements for 
nuclear safety, security and safeguards. It was grateful to the Agency for the advisory mission in 
2009 in relation to the regulatory requirements for licensing of sites for nuclear power plants, and for 
the support for the national workshop on safety requirements for the selection of nuclear power plant 
sites, both of which had greatly enhanced the regulatory regime for the national nuclear power 
programme. 
103. Nigeria remained committed to the NPT and the Pelindaba Treaty. Its nascent national nuclear 
power programme would be implemented within the framework of the NPT, thereby ensuring that its 
nuclear science and technology programmes were purely for peaceful purposes and were aimed at 
enhancing the living standards of the Nigerian people. 
104. The successful implementation of the national nuclear power programme hinged on the 
availability of adequate and qualified manpower. Consequently, Nigeria was committed to building 
the requisite human capacity and, to that end, it had established two additional nuclear energy training 
centres to provide professional training in nuclear science and engineering. It had also committed 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 16 
resources to expanding and upgrading facilities to ensure the critical mass of personnel needed to 
sustain national programmes was available. 
105. NigeriaÂs strategy for cooperation with the Agency through its technical cooperation programme 
had been fine-tuned to ensure that national development objectives were synchronized with Agency 
programming, thus ensuring sustainability. He expressed appreciation to the Agency for its regional 
and interregional programmes in support of NigeriaÂs nuclear power programme. Agency backing was 
still needed in other key areas of the countryÂs socio-economic development. 
106. One important element in any national nuclear power programme was the establishment of 
effective waste management facilities. Nigeria had started work on the development of a national 
programme and facility for the management of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste at the 
Nuclear Technology Centre in Sheda, near Abuja. Once successfully completed, the project would lay 
the foundation for the planning and implementation of a comprehensive nuclear waste management 
programme. 
107. His Government, working in concert with the Agency, had established an isotope hydrology 
laboratory which was expected to provide the technical basis for mapping groundwater aquifers, so as 
to ensure sustainability of water supply aquifers in the face of population growth and climate change. 
His country would continue to count on Agency support for the full realization of its objectives. 
108. In the field of radiation processing, the Nuclear Technology Centre in Abuja had one of the 
largest gamma irradiation facilities in the region and had benefited enormously from Agency support. 
Nigeria would appreciate continued Agency assistance to strengthen the facility and position it as a 
regional centre for radiation processing with enhanced capacity in quality control and quality 
assurance procedures for certification. 
109. Nigeria was a candidate for membership of the Board of Governors to fill the seat vacated by 
Burkina Faso. Its strong interest in the work of the Board was fuelled by the need to advance further 
the primary objective of using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, which had become more 
critical than ever for developing countries. 
110. His country deeply appreciated the assistance it continued to receive from the Agency. It 
remained committed to the ideals of the organization and thanked the Director General for his efforts 
to prevent the diversion of nuclear material for military purposes. 
111. Mr KEBEDE (Ethiopia) said that his country had begun work on its second five-year 
development plan, for 2010Â2013, which prioritized such areas as agriculture, industry, infrastructure, 
rural and social development and good governance, education and health. Extensive technology, 
human resources and institutional capacity would be required to implement it successfully. Although 
the Government planned to mobilize as many resources as possible locally, the support of the 
international community, at both the bilateral and multilateral levels, would remain important. The 
primary aim was to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and the countryÂs socio-economic 
development vision. 
112. Cooperation with the Agency on the transfer of knowledge and skills for the safe and peaceful 
application of nuclear technologies, and concerted efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, were areas of 
success. Thanks to Agency assistance, including training, provision of equipment and expert missions, 
Ethiopia had managed to develop core institutional capabilities and modest capabilities in tsetse 
control, cancer treatment, diagnostic nuclear medicine, isotope hydrology and non-destructive testing. 
However, it had not yet been able to achieve optimal utilization of the transferred technologies, nor to 
sustain the services introduced through technical cooperation projects. It was trying to make its 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 17 
technical cooperation more effective, efficient and sustainable, but still needed support from the 
Agency and other partners. 
113. The project with the highest priority was one on eliminating tsetse flies from the Southern Rift 
Valley. The tsetse population had been suppressed using integrated conventional techniques, with the 
active involvement of local communities, so farmers had experienced some relief from 
trypanosomosis and had benefited from improved milk and meat production. On the strength of that 
encouraging outcome, efforts were being made to expand suppression activities. His Government was 
grateful to the African Development Bank and other donors for their support for the field work. 
Unfortunately, the required fly colony size had not been reached at the required pace, a challenge that 
was inevitable when dealing with biological material. Nevertheless, Ethiopia remained committed to 
using SIT technology to eradicate tsetse flies and encouraged the Agency and other development 
partners to redouble their efforts. Success in that project could set a precedent for overcoming the 
same problem in other African countries. 
114. Through national and regional projects, Ethiopia had established a radiotherapy centre with two 
cobalt-60 machines and a nuclear medicine unit with a single SPECT gamma camera. However, those 
facilities were inadequate for a population of over 80 million with an estimated 150 000 new cancer 
cases per year. The countryÂs five-year development plan and health sector development programme 
gave priority to cancer treatment and it was planned to set up more facilities in those fields. He 
appealed to all development partners to step up their efforts to ensure that the technology could be 
made available to save lives. Current programmes and plans must be fully implemented and more 
effective cooperation frameworks established to mobilize the required resources. Ethiopia welcomed 
the fact that the current yearÂs scientific forum was dedicated to cancer in developing countries and 
hoped it would come up with initiatives to enhance the efforts of the Agency and Member States under 
the technical cooperation programme and PACT. 
115. An isotope hydrology laboratory that had been set up through technical cooperation was to be 
used to map groundwater resources in an attempt to address the countryÂs water resource problems. 
116. Efforts to establish a non-destructive testing service to support the metals industry were also 
ongoing. The Agency was also providing technical support for the launching of other applications of 
isotope and nuclear technologies in industrial processes, as well as for the construction of a new 
radioactive waste management facility as part of efforts to ensure that a strong radiation protection 
capability was in place, which was essential for the safe and peaceful application of radiation and 
isotopic techniques. Organizational, infrastructure and legal capabilities had been established and the 
Ethiopian radiation protection authority was now able to undertake the required regulatory activities. 
117. Ethiopia remained committed to cooperating with the Agency in ensuring the safe and peaceful 
application of nuclear technologies throughout the world. He called on all Member States to engage in 
transparent and constructive cooperation with the Agency and to support and become a party to the 
relevant international and regional initiatives aimed at ensuring global peace and security. In that 
regard, the recent entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty was encouraging and Ethiopia called upon 
all signatory States that had not yet ratified that instrument to do so without delay. 
118. In conclusion, he thanked the Secretariat for its dedication and hard work to make the 
cooperation with his country more relevant, successful and effective. 
119. Mr BARRETT (Canada) said that the Agency had been founded on three principles: that nuclear 
power should be used peacefully; that it should be safe and secure; and that it should be available to all 
who could demonstrate their capability to use it safely, securely and peacefully. Those principles made 
nuclear cooperation among nations possible. The Agency had grown considerably in membership 
since its founding and its mandate remained as relevant as when the Statute had first entered into 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 18 
force. However, today the Agency was in danger of being pulled away from the technical and 
consensus-driven perspective that had served the organization so well. Divisive resolutions that fell 
outside its mandate threatened to disrupt the good work being done. He urged all Member States to 
focus on the core technical competencies of the AgencyÂs work, rather than on complex and highly 
political issues of regional security that the Agency lacked the mandate to solve. 
120. Canada encouraged all States to adopt the new enhanced verification standard of a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement plus an additional protocol. The State-level approach to 
safeguards was also a significant development. For Member States where integrated safeguards were 
being applied, the State-level approach used information and risk assessment to establish confidence in 
a countryÂs declarations that it was using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Canada looked 
forward to working with the Secretariat on further developing that approach. 
121. In the preceding year, there had been disturbing news on the safeguards front in the form of the 
revelation of the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Canada saw IranÂs 
actions as symptomatic of its attitude towards safeguards and its disregard for its international 
obligations and the decisions of the Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council. He 
called on Iran to take the steps needed to build confidence in the international community that its 
nuclear programme was entirely peaceful in intention. The right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
came with responsibilities, in particular the responsibility to provide verifiable assurances of peaceful 
intentions. 
122. His country also urged the Syrian Arab Republic to provide Agency inspectors with all the 
information and access requested, including access to the Dair Alzour site. It encouraged the Agency 
to use all the tools at its disposal to advance its investigation. 
123. The DPRK continued to demonstrate its complete disregard for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament. Canada strongly urged the DPRK to resume cooperation with the Agency, to accept and 
implement comprehensive Agency safeguards, and to come into full compliance with the NPT. 
124. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs work in the vital areas of nuclear safety and security. 
Canada contributed to the development of Agency safety and security standards. Its long experience 
showed that nuclear energy could be made safe and secure. It therefore encouraged the Secretariat to 
take a more active role in rebutting inaccurate information about the safety of nuclear energy. 
125. Nuclear security was essential for the responsible and sustainable development of the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, and for the prevention of nuclear terrorism which was one of the most serious 
threats to international peace and security. His country therefore welcomed the success of the Nuclear 
Security Summit held in Washington in 2010. 
126. CanadaÂs world-class nuclear industry had 50 years of experience which gave it a full 
understanding of the advantages that the peaceful use of nuclear energy had to offer and of nuclear 
energyÂs vital role in the worldÂs future. Canada continued to invest in clean energy technologies, 
including nuclear power, and in its proliferation-resistant CANDU reactors. Its nuclear industry was 
well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of the global nuclear renaissance, including through 
the restructuring of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. In August 2010, it had also delivered on its 
commitment to return its National Research Universal reactor to service. 
127. He applauded the Director GeneralÂs work to broaden understanding of the AgencyÂs work 
outside the area of non-proliferation. Canada remained a strongly supporter of the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation activities, which made a positive contribution to global peace, security and prosperity, and 
it was a major contributor to the TCF. He commended the efforts of the Department of Technical 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 19 
Cooperation to improve transparency, accountability and results-based management and encouraged it 
to continue those efforts. 
128. Finally, he reaffirmed CanadaÂs strong commitment to the vision of the future of the Agency 
voiced by the Director General in his opening statement, and to the AgencyÂs mission. 
129. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia) said that technical cooperation should be based on Member StatesÂ 
needs and requests, be formulated in accordance with established guidelines and, given that countriesÂ 
capabilities, needs and priorities varied, should be in line with their respective legitimate national 
development requirements. In addition, regional and interregional projects should be formulated with a 
high level of transparency in consultation with Member States. 
130. Resources for technical cooperation must be sufficient, assured and predictable and his country 
looked forward to a genuine dialogue in the context of the working group on financing of the 
AgencyÂs activities on the nature and level of the TCF and its relationship to the Regular Budget 
131. Malaysia looked forward the revised Medium Term Strategy for 2012Â2017. Its six guiding 
principles should ensure the necessary balance in the AgencyÂs future activities and their consistency 
with the Statute. 
132. MalaysiaÂs technical cooperation projects were formulated through active engagement with the 
Programme Management Officer in accordance with national development needs and priorities. To 
formulate effective projects, a dynamic process was needed based on evolving needs instead of a static 
CPF. 
133. His country had welcomed the AgencyÂs evaluation of its technical cooperation projects in 
2009, which process was an essential part of effective programme implementation. To capitalize on 
evaluation activities, the Agency must share its findings with Member States, which would then be 
able to address any issues and correct misinterpretations before the final report was published. 
134. Malaysia appreciated the extrabudgetary contributions of Member States, including the Peaceful 
Uses Initiative of the United States, which would be highly beneficial in view of the increasing 
demands on the Agency resulting from the resurgence of interest in nuclear power. 
135. His country had launched the tenth Malaysia Plan for the period 2011Â2015, which included a 
new national energy policy which aimed at increasing and diversifying electricity generation capacity 
by developing alternative energy sources, in particular hydroelectric power, by importing coal and 
liquefied natural gas as of 2015, exploring the use of supercritical coal technology to reduce carbon 
emissions and by using nuclear energy as a longer-term option. The Agency had provided valuable 
support with planning and preparatory activities for nuclear power and the development of a national 
radioactive waste management infrastructure. Malaysia had also welcomed the opportunity to 
participate in a number of INPRO activities and it agreed with the four priority areas outlined by the 
Director General on which Agency assistance for nuclear power development would focus. 
136. Action 58 in the final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which his country 
welcomed, expressed support for further discussions on the development of multilateral approaches to 
the nuclear fuel cycle, including assurance of supply mechanisms and schemes for dealing with the 
back end of the fuel cycle, without prejudice to StatesÂ rights under the Treaty or their national fuel 
cycle policies, and addressing the technical, legal and economic complexity of those issues and 
safeguards requirements. 
137. Malaysia continued to accord high priority to peaceful nuclear applications in areas such as food 
and water security, natural resources and environmental management, industrial development and 
nuclear medicine. Such applications were supported through the development of national nuclear 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 20 
technology research, development, application and commercialization capabilities, a comprehensive 
legislative and regulatory framework, institutional and technological infrastructure, and human 
resources, and by ensuring compliance with the international system of nuclear governance. 
138. An area of concern was the effect of maintenance work and outages on major producers of 
molybdenum-99, which had disrupted supplies for medical applications in recent years. The Agency 
had an important role to play in addressing that issue. 
139. He thanked the Agency for its extensive review of MalaysiaÂs draft nuclear law and the 
suggested improvements to strengthen it. Malaysia had also adopted a Strategic Trade Act covering 
export control measures for all single- and dual-use strategic goods, including nuclear, chemical, 
biological and missile-related items. 
140. At the Nuclear Security Summit held in 2010, his countryÂs Prime Minister had proposed the 
development of a legally binding instrument for global nuclear security. 
141. His country welcomed the recent moves towards greater transparency with regard to the 
arsenals of the nuclear-weapon States. Such developments should contribute to achieving a world free 
of nuclear weapons and help create an environment conducive to addressing the issues of nuclear 
disarmament, non-proliferation and nuclear security. 
142. Malaysia called for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution of the issues relating to the nuclear 
programmes of the DPRK, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic. With respect to 
the DPRK issue, it called for the six-party talks to be resumed at an appropriate time. 
143. Finally, his country firmly supported the resolution adopted by the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference on the convening of a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear 
weapons and weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
144. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that the increasing interest in nuclear energy, in particular in 
developing countries, and the international consensus that had prevailed at the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference concerning the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, disarmament and 
non-proliferation, had a positive impact on the AgencyÂs mandate, which was based on three pillars of 
equal importance, namely promotion of nuclear energy for socio-economic development, safety and 
security, and safeguards. 
145. As a developing country, Algeria paid its contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF 
consistently and on time, demonstrating the importance her country attached to the cooperation the 
Agency provided to Member States in response to their national priorities without discrimination or 
selectivity. In that context, she called upon those countries that had not yet done so to take the 
necessary steps to ratify the amendment to Article VI of the Statute in order to achieve balance in the 
geographical composition of the Board. 
146. Her country welcomed the fact that the scientific forum during the current General Conference 
was devoted to the topic of cancer in developing countries, and noted the importance of strengthening 
national capacities in the human health field in the majority of developing countries. PACT, which had 
been launched in 2005, and the imPACT missions had prompted Member States to evaluate and 
develop national programmes and plans for cancer control in the long term. She expressed the hope 
that the scientific forum would serve as a catalyst for the AgencyÂs efforts and for the mobilization of 
additional human and financial resources in order to respond to the needs and priorities of Member 
States in the area of cancer prevention, treatment and control. Algeria, for its part, would continue to 
provide assistance to African countries and host a regional cancer treatment centre with the 
collaboration of the Agency. 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 21 
147. There was renewed interest in nuclear energy given the fact that world energy demand was 
expected to double by 2050, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by half. Nuclear power 
offered a credible and clean alternative to fossil fuels and a number of countries, including her own, 
had requested Agency assistance with a view to introducing nuclear power into their energy mix. The 
Agency needed to have the required human and financial resources to face the challenges of the 
nuclear renaissance and, in particular, to assist the newcomers, primarily developing countries. 
148. Algeria attached great importance to safety and security, which were an integral part of any 
nuclear programme. Nuclear security was primarily the responsibility of the State concerned. Her 
country supported the efforts aimed at preventing non-State actors from acquiring, gaining access to, 
or using nuclear material or weapons. 
149. Her country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in such areas as R&D in support of nuclear 
security, training of human resources, strengthening infrastructure for regulation and control of 
radioactive sources, and prevention of nuclear accidents and incidents. She also drew attention to the 
usefulness of the legal documents published in the AgencyÂs Safety Standards Series, as well as the 
safety standards both binding and non-binding. The progress made in the area of safety, and the steps 
taken by the nuclear industry to develop ever safer reactors were welcome. 
150. As had been reaffirmed at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, State Parties to the NPT that 
complied with their international obligations could not accept any limitation on their inalienable right 
to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy or their fuel cycle options as a result of proliferation risks. The 
lack of consensus regarding assurances of supply could erode the NPT by bringing about a new 
division between those who possessed nuclear technology and those who did not. 
151. As an institution duly mandated to verify compliance with non-proliferation commitments, the 
Agency had a unique role to play in maintaining peace and security, as had been reaffirmed in the final 
document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The impartiality and professionalism with which the 
Secretariat carried out its verification mission must be shielded from undue interference or pressure. 
152. Algeria had been one of the first countries to ratify the Pelindaba Treaty. The entry into force of 
that Treaty was a significant confidence-building measure and a concrete contribution to 
non-proliferation and disarmament efforts. 
153. The Middle East region continued to pose serious security and development problems. Algeria 
encouraged the Director General to continue his efforts to implement the General Conference 
resolutions on safeguards in the Middle East and Israeli nuclear capabilities in order to respond to the 
serious concerns of countries in the region caused by the lack of verification of the Israeli nuclear 
programme. Her country supported the convening of an international conference on the Middle East in 
2012, and the achievement of common objectives such as universalization of the NPT and 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
region, as called for in the resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review Conference. 
154. Her countryÂs cooperation activities with the Agency were focused on strengthening national 
capacities in non-power applications, including in health, agriculture, water resources and industry, 
and on preparations for the introduction of nuclear power. Algerian experts and professionals had 
benefited from Agency fellowships, workshops, seminars and conferences. 
155. Reaffirming AlgeriaÂs commitment to the AFRA programme, she said that support was needed 
from the Agency and from African partners to improve the ability of African countries to benefit fully 
from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
156. Along with many other African countries, Algeria was interested in efforts to combat the desert 
locust and called upon the Agency to continue its collaboration with the FAO to develop further use of 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 22 
nuclear techniques to combat that pest, as requested in General Conference resolutions. The 
establishment of a locust control centre would be particularly useful. 
157. Ms NEE-WHANG (Ghana) commended the Agency for the emphasis placed on human health, 
nuclear safety, and food and agriculture in its activities in 2009. 
158. Developments in nuclear technology which had brought benefits to society had also given rise 
to security and safety concerns which had to be addressed through collective efforts. 
159. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Member States had agreed on an outcome document, 
which, although it did not fully meet all aspirations, was a step forward towards the common goal of 
nuclear disarmament. Her country had been encouraged by the atmosphere of respect and the goodwill 
that had prevailed at the conference, which had resulted in the adoption of the final document by 
consensus. It was to be hoped that the coming years would witness significant progress in 
implementation of the NPT. Ghana was firmly committed to the Treaty and would continue to support 
efforts to advance the implementation of its three pillars Â nuclear non-proliferation, the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy and nuclear disarmament Â and to make it universal. 
160. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme covered a wide range of activities of vital 
importance to developing countries, particularly in the areas of human health, food and agriculture, 
nuclear and radiation safety, the development of nuclear techniques to treat diseases, enhance crop 
resistance to diseases, increase yields, control food insects and pests and improve livestock, and in 
capacity building. 
161. Ghana continued to be a beneficiary of programmes on the application of nuclear technology 
and techniques for enhancing the health, agricultural and industrial sectors. Its CPF with the Agency 
had included activities on crop improvement, pest management, food preservation, medical 
sterilization, radioisotope technology applications in industry, and nuclear medicine. Following the 
refurbishment of the gamma irradiation facility with Government assistance, Ghana could now 
improve food preservation to reduce post-harvest losses. The facility would also enhance quarantine 
treatment of agricultural produce to promote food exports, and the sterilization of medical supplies. 
The facility would play a critical role in the activities of the Radiation Entomology Centre in 
connection with the use of sterile insects for tsetse fly and mosquito control. Her country appreciated 
the AgencyÂs assistance with the refurbishment of the facility and the training of staff to operate the 
irradiator. 
162. Given the upsurge of cancer in developing countries, her country was committed to PACT, and 
it was grateful to the Agency for selecting Ghana as a PACT demonstration site. Ghana would 
continue to cooperate with the Agency to elaborate effective strategies for cancer management and 
control within the country and the West Africa subregion. A recent impact assessment mission by a 
PACT mission to Ghana had revealed that, in addition to the two existing radiotherapy centres, three 
further radiotherapy centres were needed, as well as a nuclear and medical imaging centre for the 
diagnosis and early detection of various forms of cancer, in order to expand access to treatment. Her 
country was confident that it could count on continued Agency assistance in that regard. 
163. As part of the cancer control programme in Africa, the Virtual University for Cancer Control 
and Regional Training Network in Africa (VUCCnet) had been successfully launched in Ghana. That 
event had brought together cancer control specialists and educators from cancer centres and relevant 
educational institutions in selected African countries, the Agency and the WHO, and other 
international cancer control experts to plan the implementation of the pilot phase. Ghana was prepared 
to serve as host country in the subregion for the education and training of radiation oncologists, 
nuclear medicine specialists and physicists.

164. Physical protection upgrades had been provided for national nuclear facilities with the help of 
the Agency and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Ghana was grateful to the latter for funding the 
construction of the additional source storage vault and associated protection upgrades, as well as to the 
European Union for funding the expert services and human resources development programmes 
organized at the National Nuclear Support Centre. 
165. Ghana remained committed to the implementation of international instruments governing 
nuclear safeguards, safety and security, and it was working to ratify all relevant texts. To that end, a 
bill to establish an independent nuclear regulatory authority would soon be submitted to parliament for 
approval, in order to pave the way for the establishment of effective institutional and human capacities 
to address proposals for the utilization of nuclear energy as an additional source of energy. 
166. Ghana joined other African Member States in expressing gratitude to the Agency, and in 
particular to the staff of the Division for Africa, for its support for AFRA. It urged Member States to 
assist national and regional initiatives of AFRA countries. 
Mr Soltanieh (Islamic Republic of Iran) took the Chair. 
167. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) reiterated his countryÂs support 
for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the AgencyÂs Statute. The 
principles of sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and self-determination were of 
fundamental importance to preserving international peace and security, to which his country was 
committed. The commitment to nuclear disarmament was enshrined in the countryÂs Constitution, 
Article 129 of which prohibited the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons in Venezuela. In 
addition, the country belonged to the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone via its adherence to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty. 
168. Venezuela accorded high priority to strengthening integration with other Latin American and 
Caribbean countries and South-South relations, and to promoting solidarity among all peoples. Both 
ARCAL and the Agency facilitated the achievement of those objectives, and ensuring that projects and 
initiatives contributed to development should remain the principal focus of those forums. 
169. ARCAL had expanded in scope and membership over the 25 years it had been in existence. 
With a view to contributing to the strengthening of regional training in isotope hydrology, Venezuela 
had made the Inter-American Centre for Environmental and Territorial Development and Research 
(CIDIAT) available to the Latin American and Caribbean region. The Centre offered training for 
between 30 and 40 people annually, funded by the Agency. He underlined the importance of transfer 
of technology and knowledge to developing countries in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
through training geared towards national priorities and objectives, with a view to the assimilation and 
application of that knowledge in areas which affected peopleÂs lives, thus contributing effectively to 
socio-economic development. 
170. The General Conference should be cautious in dealing with possible mechanisms for supply of 
nuclear fuel. Any attempt to apply commercial practices or other mechanisms aimed at monopolizing 
or preventing access to nuclear technology and knowledge would run counter to the principles 
enshrined in the Statute of the Agency, whose main objective was to accelerate and enlarge the 
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. Thus, his country 
rejected any initiative which sought to hamper access to nuclear energy for any developing country 
through discriminatory practices. It was even less desirable that the Agency become a commercial 
cartel that sought to monopolize nuclear technology, including the fuel cycle. The proposals for 
assurance of supply mechanisms had, inter alia, economic, financial and security implications, and the 
imposition of politically motivated discriminatory practices could not be discounted. The countries 
putting forward the proposals had not addressed those concerns and further discussion was needed. 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 24 
171. Venezuela had made major efforts in the preceding decade to improve standards of living. Its 
human development index had risen from 0.793 to 0.844 between 1995 and 2007. Between 2003 and 
2009, extreme poverty had decreased from 30% to only 7.2%. Non-extreme poverty had dropped from 
32.3% to 21.3% in the same period. In 2003, unemployment had stood at 16.8% and it was currently 
around 6%. Furthermore, in October 2005 the country had declared itself free of illiteracy. Those 
achievements were the fruit of a sustained increase in social investment which had doubled over the 
preceding 12 years. 
172. His country had important progress to report at the United Nations Summit on the Millennium 
Development Goals which had opened the preceding day. It had continued to work on alternative 
energy sources that would allow it to diversify its energy mix and achieve sustainable energy 
development, and it was thus interested in developing its capabilities in the area of nuclear power. It 
had also enjoyed fruitful cooperation with the Agency in the fields of health and water resources, inter 
alia. At domestic level, it had established a high-level commission to develop cooperation on the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
173. The Venezuelan National Assembly had recently approved the Convention on Early 
Notification of a Nuclear Accident, which would lead to much closer cooperation between the 
Venezuelan authorities and the Agency and was an important step in strengthening the countryÂs 
regulatory infrastructure in order to ensure early response in the event of an emergency. 
174. His country had consistently defended a multipolar world. The global situation had changed 
significantly since the founding of the Agency and, over the preceding 10 years, a new balance of 
power had emerged. Multilateral organizations had to keep abreast of new political realities and thus 
needed to establish more democratic structures in their policy-making organs. 
175. It was a matter for concern that some countries had developed military doctrines that 
contemplated the use, or threat of use of force employing nuclear weapons, and that expanded the 
possible reasons for using such weapons or justified the development of more sophisticated nuclear 
weapons, even though it was clear that the existence and proliferation of nuclear weapons, instead of 
enhancing security, reduced the scope for achieving lasting and sustainable peace. Thus, it was 
essential to intensify disarmament and non-proliferation efforts in order to free the world of such 
destructive weapons. Venezuela had consistently advocated disarmament and non-proliferation in the 
relevant forums. 
176. The NPT, which was recognized by all as the cornerstone of the disarmament regime, 
non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, was still under great pressure. Agreements 
were being signed with countries that were not party to the Treaty. The existence of military nuclear 
programmes that were not under Agency supervision was being ignored, while other countries were 
being cynically hounded for exercising their right to have access to nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. Furthermore, using the terrorist threat as a pretext, work had been resumed on the 
production of new and more powerful nuclear weapons. The greatest responsibility lay with the 
nuclear-weapon States to work towards reducing and eliminating their nuclear arsenals, in accordance 
with the letter and spirit of the NPT. Negotiations in good faith to that end were essential to strengthen 
peace. 
177. Another measure that could strengthen non-proliferation and deserved special mention was the 
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. His country had always supported the initiatives to 
establish such a zone in the Middle East, as an effective way of contributing to peace and stability. A 
nuclear-weapon-free zone should be established in that region as soon as possible, in line with the 
relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. Israel, the only 
country in the region that had not adhered to the NPT or declared its intention to do so, should 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 25 
renounce the possession of nuclear weapons, join the Treaty without delay and place its nuclear 
facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards in line with Security Council resolution 487 (1981). 
His country was concerned at the statements made by the Prime Minister of Israel admitting 
possession of nuclear weapons, which had a negative impact on peace and stability in the region. 
178. The CTBT was an important instrument in the disarmament and non-proliferation field and 
support for its early entry into force was fully in line with the objective of achieving greater security 
and was, indeed, a moral imperative since it would impede the development of new nuclear weapons. 
179. Efforts in support of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation must be multilateral, 
simultaneous and non-discriminatory. Venezuela rejected the notion that some countriesÂ nuclear 
weapons posed no threat while those possessed by other States put the world in mortal peril. He 
recalled that any attack or threat of attack on nuclear facilities, including those under construction, 
violated the climate of peace and confidence that must prevail in international relations and posed a 
serious threat to the survival of the human race and the environment. His country rejected the classic 
imperialist notion of a preventive war, where attacks on sovereign States were justified on the basis of 
alleged and unproven threats. 
180. It was unacceptable that discriminatory practices and double standards were applied in dealing 
with such matters, violating the principle of the legal equality of States by forcing some countries to 
comply with obligations while others were exempted. In that context, he noted that the Agency had 
found no evidence that the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran was anything but 
peaceful in nature. His country called for an end to the threats and persecution by a group of countries 
which seemed not to be committed to resolving that issue and which, to justify their imperialist 
geopolitical and commercial ambitions in the region, had fuelled a media slur campaign against Iran. 
That privileged group of countries had brought numerous resolutions to the Security Council, 
assuming de facto, though not de jure, competencies which belonged exclusively to the Agency, and 
jeopardizing the organizationÂs credibility and the independence that was essential to its functioning. 
While the Board of Governors had been considering aspects of IranÂs nuclear programme, the Security 
Council had at the same time been considering a series of resolutions which undermined the AgencyÂs 
authority. His country stressed that the only appropriate forum for finding a peaceful negotiated 
solution to that issue was the Agency. 
181. In conclusion, his country agreed with the Director General that the Agency should no longer 
continue to be seen in the eyes of the public as a nuclear watchdog. It was important that an authentic 
picture of the organizationÂs activities and its objectivity and professionalism be put across to the 
world at large. Venezuela looked forward to more focus on activities aimed at helping Member States 
benefit from nuclear energy and less on politicization of the AgencyÂs work and pressurization of 
some States by others. 
182. Ms TROJANOWSKA (Poland) welcomed the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference, the final document of which addressed areas closely connected with the AgencyÂs 
activities: non-proliferation and compliance, the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and nuclear 
security. The universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols were prerequisites for a credible and effective safeguards system. Having fulfilled 
all its obligations as a European Union member State with regard to safeguards legal instruments, her 
country called upon those which had not yet done so to join the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards 
system as soon as possible. States with SQPs should also conclude an exchange of letters with the 
Agency to reinforce the safeguards system. 
183. The Agency played a crucial role in planning and coordinating efforts to protect the world 
against nuclear terrorism. Poland had ratified both the amended CPPNM and the International 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 26 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and it invited other States to follow suit 
in order to make those instruments as effective as possible. Her country strongly supported the 
AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan and welcomed all initiatives worldwide to counteract global security 
hazards. In particular, the Nuclear Security Summit convened by the United States in April 2010, in 
which Poland had participated, had been an unprecedented event, raising awareness of the risks of 
nuclear terrorism and reinforcing the commitment to improving nuclear security standards, as well as 
underlining the essential role of the Agency in that area. Given the success of the Summit, the 
participating countries had decided to continue the process. In response to the call contained in the 
communiquÃ© issued after the Summit to promote further strengthening of global nuclear security 
through dialogue and international cooperation, Poland had hosted a regional seminar for Central and 
Eastern European countries in August 2010 that had been attended by participants from 14 States and 
Agency experts. Not only had that event provided an opportunity to summarize discussions and ideas 
presented at the Nuclear Security Summit, it had also been a useful platform for information exchange 
on efforts to strengthen nuclear security at national and international levels. Her country looked 
forward to further meetings to continue that initiative. 
184. Poland had been involved in the Global Threat Reduction Initiative since its inception and, 
under it, had undertaken the conversion of its nuclear research reactor to LEU fuel, which was 
expected to be completed in 2012. Her country also participated in the international radiological threat 
reduction programme under that Initiative. It had transferred unirradiated HEU fuel to the Russian 
Federation, which operation had been completed in 2006. Currently, spent nuclear fuel of Russian 
origin was being repatriated to the Russian Federation. She thanked all parties involved in that 
complex process, in particular the United States institutions which had covered most of the costs. 
185. Poland was concerned to maintain the highest levels of nuclear safety worldwide. Although 
safety was a national responsibility, it could have implications beyond national boundaries and 
international cooperation was essential. The Agency, through its statutory programme, was a globally 
recognized forum for such cooperation and Poland, which was party to all international legal 
instruments developed in that field under the auspices of the Agency, was fully convinced of their 
importance and their essential role in keeping nuclear facilities and material safe and secure 
worldwide. 
186. Representatives of her country had always participated in the review meetings under the 
relevant safety conventions and would be participating in the upcoming review meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety to be held in 2011. Poland had ratified the 
Protocol to Amend the 1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and had 
deposited its instrument of ratification with the Agency that very day. 
187. The main objective of PolandÂs newly launched nuclear power programme was to define the 
optimum scope of nuclear power and to prepare lists and schedules of activities for the government 
administration, the regulator and the investor. Poland was also developing the legal and institutional 
infrastructure required to achieve coherence and stability in the development of the nuclear power 
sector. The final approval of the programme would require consultations and a public debate. It was 
planned that the first power reactors would begin operation at the beginning of the third decade of the 
21st century. 
188. Following the guidance provided in Agency publications, her country had organized a national 
seminar in April 2010 in preparation for an INIR mission, which would be initiated following the 
self-evaluation process. 
189. In order to ensure that the country was prepared for the nuclear power programme, PolandÂs 
regulatory body had requested an IRRS mission, which was planned to take place in 2012 following 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 27 
self-assessment. With a view to enhancing the capabilities of the regulatory body through bilateral 
cooperation, it was planned that an agreement would be signed that very week between the regulatory 
bodies of Poland and the United States. All preparatory work on the nuclear power programme was 
being conducted in strict compliance with international law and European Union regulations, and in 
accordance with Agency guidelines and recommendations. She expressed appreciation for the 
assistance provided by the Agency and the OECD/NEA, which Poland hoped to join soon. 
Cooperation with those organizations would optimize the introduction of nuclear power in Poland and 
reduce costs. 
190. Technical cooperation had always been and remained an important activity in relations between 
the Agency and its Member States. In Europe, the technical cooperation programme had been greatly 
enhanced by regular consultations and meetings aimed at developing new managerial tools to help 
make programmes more effective and efficient. Poland was a good example of a country that had 
moved from being just a recipient to being an important donor. The Institute of Nuclear Chemistry and 
Technology in Warsaw had recently been designated an Agency Collaborating Centre. Together with 
other new European Union members, Poland played an important double role in Agency technical 
cooperation, contributing to TCDC. Apart from national projects with a high rate of Government cost 
sharing, it actively participated in regional projects, offering its knowledge and competence to other 
Member States. It also welcomed the strategy for the technical cooperation programme in Europe that 
had been approved in February 2010. 
191. Financing of technical cooperation activities should be assured, sufficient and predictable, and 
all Member States should demonstrate their commitment to the programme by pledging and paying in 
full and on time their shares of the TCF target and their NPCs. Thus, her country strongly supported 
application of the due account principle. As in the past, it had pledged and paid its share of the TCF 
target. 
192. Mr SVEDAS (Lithuania) said that the dynamic change taking place in the global nuclear 
community, in particular with respect to nuclear power programmes, highlighted the need for strong 
international cooperation on safety, security and safeguards issues. His country strongly supported the 
AgencyÂs efforts to improve the safeguards system. An additional protocol and a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement represented the current verification standard, which needed to be further 
strengthened, universalized and applied as a condition for the supply of nuclear material and 
technology. Lithuania encouraged all States to bring into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol, and to adhere to and implement fully such international instruments such as 
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, the CPPNM and the 
Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
193. The Ignalina nuclear power plant had been shut down on 31 December 2009. During its 
26 years of operation, no incident had occurred which had been classified at higher than 0 on the INES 
scale. Every effort was being made to ensure that the decommissioning process was safe. Lithuania 
would continue to cooperate closely with the Agency on the management of radioactive waste and was 
doing pioneering work on the management of radioactive graphite from RBMK reactors. In the future, 
it would be happy to share its accumulated knowledge and experience with other countries. 
194. Site preparation for construction of the new Visaginas nuclear power plant was due to be 
complete by the end of 2010. That new facility would replace the Ignalina plant and enable the Baltic 
region to reduce its reliance fossil fuels, and strengthen security of supply. In 2009, in accordance with 
the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact in a Transboundary Context, his country had 
successfully completed the transboundary environmental impact assessment process, and the Agency 
had carried out an in-depth and independent review of the Visaginas environmental impact assessment 
procedures. LithuaniaÂs nuclear regulatory legislation was currently being revised in order to increase 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 28 
the efficiency of the nuclear safety regulatory authority, and particular attention was being given to 
Agency recommendations and international best practices. Discussions with potential investors in the 
nuclear power plant project were ongoing. 
195. In view of the rapid expansion of nuclear power in the Baltic region, it was important to stress 
the need for full compliance with international obligations in the areas of nuclear safety, security and 
transboundary environmental impact assessment. Transparency was also crucial for building 
confidence among countries in the region. In that context, a round table on regional nuclear energy 
projects had been organized in Lithuania in June, providing an opportunity for the Baltic and Nordic 
States, Poland, Belarus and the Russian Federation to discuss nuclear power developments in the 
Baltic region. His country was grateful to the Director General and his staff for their active 
participation in that event. 
196. The Agency played a key role in assessing the safety and security of new nuclear sites and 
assessing the readiness of national nuclear infrastructure and the maturity of the national regulatory 
system and safety culture. Lithuania encouraged other States to make use of the AgencyÂs services in 
those areas. 
197. Human health was and would always be a top priority. His country was implementing a national 
cancer prevention and control programme and considerable progress had been made in early detection 
and treatment, and in the prevention of breast, cervix, and prostate cancer. Moreover, additional 
accelerators for radiotherapy had been installed in recent years. Lithuania supported PACT and would 
do everything possible to contribute to its implementation. 
198. Finally, he expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs continuing support in strengthening 
capabilities for managing, preserving and transferring nuclear knowledge, and in developing new 
skills and competencies in nuclear-related areas. 
199. Mr HAKIMI (Afghanistan) said that his Government regarded the work of the Agency as 
playing a key role in helping to enhance global scientific and technical cooperation and ensure nuclear 
safety and security. It appreciated the fact that the Agency carried out its mandate with independence, 
objectivity and transparency. Securing energy supplies while counteracting climate change would 
remain high on the organizationÂs agenda, as would joint efforts on nutrition, potable water and health 
care. He thanked the Secretariat for publishing the Programme Performance Report for 2008Â2009 
(GOV/2010/40) and congratulated the staff of the Agency on the favourable results that had been 
accomplished in that biennium. It was important to ensure that sufficient resources continued to be 
allocated for Member States Â and especially for developing countries Â interested in introducing 
nuclear technology. His country continued to support the AgencyÂs work and was interested in 
increasing further its level of cooperation with it. 
200. In February 2010, a national consultants meeting had been held in Vienna to review 
AfghanistanÂs technical cooperation programme at which operational difficulties in implementing 
technical cooperation and new ideas and proposals had been openly discussed. One vital issue was the 
need for additional fellowships for candidates from Afghanistan, identifying potential host countries 
and institutions willing to accept those candidates. It had also been stressed that the Afghanistan High 
Commission of Atomic Energy should play an even more active role in coordinating all institutions 
receiving technical assistance from the Agency. In addition, the participants from Afghanistan had 
pledged to enhance cooperation between the High Commission of Atomic Energy, the National 
Liaison Officer and officials from relevant ministries. 
201. The PCMF IT platform established the CPF as the basis for the programming process. In that 
connection, his country would like to emphasize the importance of national development plans and 
UNDAF. In June 2010, a draft CPF had been prepared which was currently under review in Kabul. A 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 29 
final draft would be sent to the Agency shortly for consideration. Once the content of the CPF had 
been agreed upon, a detailed plan of action could be established, leading to project concepts for the 
upcoming technical cooperation cycles. Previous projects had been closely reviewed and new projects 
proposed. The National Liaison Officer would be entering AfghanistanÂs Country Programme Note in 
the PCMF shortly. 
202. He stressed the importance of Agency technical cooperation for Afghanistan. It was important 
that adequate financial resources be allocated for technical cooperation, and continuously adjusted to 
match altered requirements. His country, which contributed itself to the TCF, appreciated the 
contributions of all Member States to the Fund, which enabled the Agency to make an important 
contribution to international efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. However, the 
Agency was not a development aid agency and the technical cooperation programme should not be 
based on a donor-recipient relationship but on the conviction that technical cooperation was a mutually 
beneficial partnership that was indispensable for accomplishing the organizationÂs main statutory 
objective of promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology. In that connection, 
he noted that non-power nuclear applications were growing in relevance. Radiation and isotopic 
techniques were essential tools in such areas as potable water, nutrition and medicine. Hence peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy provided a powerful stimulus to socio-economic development in 
developing countries. 
203. With regard to the 2009 technical cooperation programme in Asia and the Pacific, his country 
supported the emphasis on strengthening institutional capacity for applications in health, agriculture 
and energy, with a particular focus on newcomers to nuclear power. Afghanistan was particularly 
interested in benefiting from better crop yields, food, soils and water resources. In that connection, he 
expressed support for the work of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and 
Agriculture and noted with appreciation the ongoing efforts to build capacity and transfer know-how 
with a view to developing the infrastructure of underdeveloped Member States. 
204. He welcomed the fact that new resources for the TCF had reached a total of $112 million in 
2009, an increase of $20 million over the preceding year. He also highlighted the encouraging findings 
of two internal studies which had shown that a third of the technical cooperation programme 
contributed directly to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and had confirmed the close 
connection between Agency technical cooperation and the Millennium Development Goals. The 
Agency should continue to strive to establish mechanisms to ensure that resources for technical 
cooperation were sufficient, assured and predictable, and to develop new forms of partnership that 
would help streamline the organizationÂs operations in line with the SMART concept. 
205. The Government of Afghanistan supported all efforts to strengthen the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme by increasing efficiency, effectiveness and the long-term impact of 
programmes, and it encouraged regional programming with an eye, inter alia, to the promotion of 
horizontal cooperation aimed at higher levels of national ownership, improved delivery of services and 
regional self-reliance. He noted the December 2009 agreement regarding the development of a 
Regional Cooperative Framework for Asia and the Pacific. In addition, he expressed the hope that, in 
future, a greater share of funds would be disbursed in the Asia and the Pacific region in the areas of 
human capacity development and programme support, as well as human health, which were currently 
underfunded by comparison with other world regions. At present, Afghanistan was participating in 
21 regional Agency programmes and his Government aimed to increase that number and increase 
participation by women. 
206. As a result of his countryÂs recent history and geopolitical situation, the Afghan Government 
approached the issues of international nuclear safety and security with particular diligence. It was 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 30 
firmly convinced that the international community should establish a more robust protection system, 
supported by laws and regulations. 
207. He noted with appreciation that global nuclear safety efforts remained at a high level and 
commended the AgencyÂs efforts to support international cooperation in that area, in particular its 
activities on capacity building, the adoption of a regional approach to best practices and exchange of 
information, and continued assistance to developing countries with improving emergency response 
capabilities. 
208. Afghanistan appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States to establish sustainable 
nuclear security capacity through evaluation missions, training, education and legal assistance, with a 
view to enhancing levels of physical protection of nuclear facilities and preventing illicit trafficking. It 
strongly advocated regional cooperation in that area and greater involvement of Member States in 
programme implementation. The Government of Afghanistan called upon all Member States to 
contribute to the effective implementation of the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013 and it welcomed 
the outcome of the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington in April 2010. It looked 
forward to further progress at the next such summit to be held in 2012 in the Republic of Korea. 
209. Agency safeguards were a crucial component of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and 
his Government commended the AgencyÂs contribution in verifying nuclear arms control and arms 
reduction agreements. In its verification role, the Agency depended on the support of its members, and 
enhanced sharing of information and unreserved cooperation with and support for Agency inspectors 
were essential for its work in that area. Afghanistan supported all Agency activities aimed at resolving 
outstanding issues relating to the nature and scope of Member StatesÂ nuclear programmes. 
210. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime. Recent disarmament 
efforts should help reduce the perceived security value of nuclear weapons and have an impact on the 
ambitions of those countries interested in acquiring such weapons. The Government of Afghanistan 
was a committed opponent of nuclear weapons. 
211. His country welcomed the promising outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. Among 
other important issues, the Conference had stressed the importance of full implementation of the 
1995 resolution on the Middle East. Afghanistan looked forward to the convening in 2012, as 
proposed at the NPT Review Conference, of a conference of all States in the Middle East on the 
establishment in that region of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all weapons of mass destruction. 
212. In conclusion, he reaffirmed AfghanistanÂs unwavering commitment to the Agency. The 
increasing global need for nuclear applications would make the AgencyÂs role even more important in 
the future. Though promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, and especially 
technical assistance, remained the AgencyÂs statutory objective, its activities in the fields of nuclear 
safety and security were increasing in significance. 
213. Mr MINTY (South Africa) said that the General Conference was taking place at a time when the 
world situation was more conducive to disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, helping pave 
the way for the New START agreement and the successful 2010 NPT Review Conference. Optimal 
use should be made of that positive development to add impetus to the AgencyÂs work. The outcomes 
of the 2010 NPT Review Conference had the potential to strengthen global peace and security and 
could play a meaningful role in outlining the future approach towards the eventual achievement of a 
world free of nuclear weapons. 
214. Nuclear-weapon-free zones were an integral part of the NPT and continued to be an important 
aspect of the nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation process. South Africa welcomed the 
entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty and looked forward to more countries ratifying it. 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 31 
215. He emphasized the importance of energy security in promoting sustainable development and the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, a number 
of States had supported the view that the Agency had an important role to play in assisting developing 
States in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed 
at improving their scientific, technological and regulatory capabilities. South Africa strongly 
supported the AgencyÂs continued contribution towards the Millennium Development Goals and its 
interaction with NEPAD. 
216. The acute need to secure reliable energy supplies and reduce carbon emissions had put nuclear 
energy firmly on the agenda as a viable choice to be pursued in order to achieve a balanced energy 
mix. Nuclear energy was increasingly becoming a preferred solution for energy security and in efforts 
to mitigate the challenges of climate change. As many more countries decided to introduce nuclear 
power to address their energy needs, it was imperative that the AgencyÂs safeguards system be 
strengthened. The additional protocol was an important tool for providing credible assurances of the 
absence of undeclared nuclear material. 
217. In 1998, South Africa had presented a new energy policy that had made nuclear energy an 
integral part of its energy mix. In June 2008, it had approved a nuclear energy policy. Earlier in the 
current year, his Government had set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee on Energy to pursue an 
integrated resource plan to ensure a balance between available energy sources, the cost of deployment 
of the different technologies, and the benefits for the South African people and economy in the short 
and long term. The Department of Energy was also leading the elaboration of a nuclear energy 
implementation strategy that would look at how the Government could develop and/or enhance the 
infrastructure required for new builds. Through that endeavour, more jobs would be created and South 
Africa would work with international partners with cost-effective plans that addressed that issue with 
minimum impact on cost and the delivery schedule. 
218. The Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa continued to carry out feasibility studies into 
the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle to ensure security of fuel supply for nuclear new builds. The 
studies would feed into the nuclear energy implementation strategy, which in turn would feed into the 
integrated resource plan process. 
219. With regard to new nuclear power plants, the South African electricity utility, Eskom, had been 
pursuing its environmental impact assessment of three potential sites for nuclear power plants. Since 
2007, there had been extensive public participation in that process, which had culminated in the 
release in March 2010 of a draft environmental impact report for public comment. It was anticipated 
that a final report would be completed before the end of 2010 and submitted to the Government for 
evaluation and a decision on environmental authorization in the first half of 2011 To assist 
communities, organizations and individuals in participating in the process in a meaningful manner, 
Eskom had been conducting nuclear awareness workshops in the vicinity of the proposed nuclear sites 
and had hosted representatives from communities around one of the sites on a visit to the Koeberg 
nuclear power plant. 
220. The management of radioactive waste, especially high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel, 
continued to pose challenges. South Africa had made some progress through the establishment of a 
legal framework to manage radioactive waste. The National Radioactive Waste Disposal Institute Act 
had come into force, and steps were being taken to set up the Institute and address matters such as 
funding and human resources. 
221. The role of nuclear technologies in African development could not be overlooked. The solutions 
implemented through Agency technical cooperation and AFRA programmes had contributed to 
AfricaÂs development in many ways, but a great deal of work still needed to be done. The African 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 32 
region would look at how to optimize the use of nuclear technologies on the continent. As part of its 
contribution to that endeavour, in the preceding year the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa 
had participated in the safe packaging of disused high-activity sealed radioactive sources in Sudan, 
Tanzania, Vietnam and Uruguay, with other countries to follow in the near future. It also continued to 
host several training workshops as part of its contribution to human resources development within 
South Africa. 
222. Following the successful conversion of the SAFARI-1 research reactor core to LEU fuel in 
2009, the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa and its subsidiary, NTP Radioisotopes, had 
accelerated their programme to convert the production processes for molybdenum-99 and 
iodine-131 to use LEU target plates. As of July 2010, South Africa had begun delivering LEU-based 
isotopes to the world market, thus becoming the first large-scale supplier of molybdenum-99 based 
entirely on LEU. In 2009Â2010, during the serious shortages in the supply of isotopes of critical 
importance to the global nuclear medicine community, production levels had been increased and every 
effort made to reduce the impact of that situation, without compromising safety or quality. 
223. South Africa continued to pay due attention to strengthening the safety of its nuclear facilities. 
Following the first 10-year safety review, important safety enhancements had been implemented at 
one of its nuclear facilities. As a result, the PSA estimated frequency of core damage was now similar 
to the reference nuclear power plants operated by ÃlectricitÃ© de France, and better than the Agency 
recommendations for new nuclear power plants. The second 10-year safety review had commenced 
and would contribute to a further strengthening of safety. 
224. South Africa had also made considerable strides in the area of nuclear security, which was 
rightfully a national responsibility. It would, however, be counting on the help of the Agency in that 
regard, if and when necessary. Nuclear security needed to be considered in all its aspects and must not 
focus only on nuclear terrorism. South AfricaÂs national nuclear regulator was finalizing a nuclear 
security framework which would be integrated into the safety culture of operators. 
225. It was cause for concern that no progress had been made with regard to the decision that had 
been taken collectively to expand the AgencyÂs Board of Governors. Continuing failure to achieve that 
objective was not only an impediment to the democratization of the Agency but also meant that the 
organization continued to fall short of being a truly inclusive multilateral body. South Africa was of 
the view that there should be an increase in the number of African countries on the Board, reflecting 
the increase in African Member States to 42. 
226. He underscored the importance which South Africa attached to the TCF, which should form an 
integral part of the AgencyÂs budget. A step in that direction would constitute a long overdue 
correction of the fundamental mistake of funding technical cooperation through voluntary 
contributions, when it was in fact a core Agency activity. There was also a continuing need to ensure 
that resources for technical cooperation were adequate and predictable. His country endorsed the view 
expressed by the External Auditor that Member States should ensure that extrabudgetary funds did not 
replace regular and predictable funds for core activities. 
227. Through the INES Advisory Committee, chaired jointly by representatives from South Africa 
and Spain, his country had been closely involved in updating and extending INES procedures. South 
AfricaÂs nuclear facilities would implement the new INES UserÂs Manual (2008) with effect from 
1 October 2010. The national nuclear regulator had also initiated a process to broaden the application 
of INES to other institutions and facilities in the country. 
228. Finally, he expressed appreciation to the Agency and those countries that had provided 
assistance with the nuclear security arrangements for the 2010 World Cup held in South Africa, and 
looked forward to continued cooperation in the future. South Africa encouraged the Agency to 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 33 
continue its support for improving nuclear security, accounting and control of nuclear material and the 
prevention of illicit trafficking. 
229. Mr KARIMOV (Azerbaijan) welcomed the successes achieved by the Agency in ensuring 
nuclear and radiation safety through the development of guidelines for the management of nuclear 
material, strengthening of physical protection and the implementation of measures to prevent nuclear 
terrorism. 
230. His country highly valued the AgencyÂs role in maintaining a balance between the development 
of nuclear power and the application of a strict non-proliferation regime. In cooperation with the 
Agency and the international community, Azerbaijan was taking the measures needed to strengthen its 
nuclear security and prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. 
231. His country advocated strengthening the AgencyÂs role and authority, was eager to develop its 
cooperation with the Agency, and had established a State commission for cooperation with the Agency 
to that end. 
232. The Agency continued to help his country develop its national safety infrastructure for the safe 
management of radioactive material. In 2008, Azerbaijan had established a regulatory body 
responsible for improving its national system of accounting for, and control, storage, use and disposal 
of radiation sources. Agency staff had prepared over ten regulatory and legal documents regulating the 
activities of various bodies. A great deal of work had gone into producing a national register of all 
organizations working in the nuclear field, and of the ionizing radiation sources and nuclear material 
they possessed. 
233. With Agency support, Azerbaijan had undertaken a thorough analysis of existing national 
legislation relating to nuclear and radiological activities and had developed proposals to improve it. 
Work had also been conducted with the AgencyÂs Department of Safeguards to improve the State 
system of accounting for and control of nuclear material. A recent Agency expert mission to assess the 
countryÂs state of readiness to respond to nuclear or radiological accidents had been particularly 
beneficial for the development of a national response plan. 
234. The range of the AgencyÂs activities would continue to grow in the coming decades as the role 
of nuclear power in securing energy supplies to ensure sustainable development increased, driven by 
dwindling fossil fuel reserves and the impact of the use of such fuels on the climate and environment. 
However, the occupation of foreign territory posed an even greater threat to security and political 
stability than the issue of reliable energy supplies. In that connection, he called on the Agency to take 
decisive measures against attempts to use temporarily occupied Azerbaijani territory for illicit 
activities such as trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material and dual-use technologies and 
equipment. Armenia continued to ignore four United Nations Security Council resolutions requiring it 
to cease its occupation of 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan. Such a situation threatened regional 
stability, peace and security. His country understood ArmeniaÂs desire to develop nuclear power for 
the purposes of economic development and improving the welfare of its people. However, any 
safeguards commitments Armenia might have made would remain unfulfilled until such time as it 
complied with international law by abandoning expansionist plans and liberating the territory it had 
occupied. 
235. Technical cooperation was the main means by which the Agency responded to the needs of its 
Member States. Azerbaijan was implementing both national and regional technical cooperation 
projects. In particular, it was implementing four national projects in such important socio-economic 
areas as improving cancer treatment infrastructure, setting up a secondary standards dosimetry 
laboratory, planning the establishment of a research reactor, and developing radiation processing 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 34 
capacities. For the latter two projects, Azerbaijan had set aside 15 hectares of land, begun geological 
exploration work and started planning work for the establishment of the necessary infrastructure. 
236. His country was also conducting a project to develop its radionuclide monitoring capacities, in 
compliance with the initiative of the United States of America, the Russian Federation and the Agency 
on improving control of disused radioactive sources. It devoted particular attention to improving its 
regulatory infrastructure, radiation safety and physical protection of radioactive material, and radiation 
protection of persons working with ionizing radiation sources, and was involved in a number of related 
regional and interregional projects. AzerbaijanÂs involvement in such projects, particularly those 
related to nuclear science, technology and applications, served to support and develop its scientific 
potential. More than 30 specialists from the country had benefited from various forms of training in 
those fields over the preceding year. His country appreciated the work of the Agency in organizing 
education systems for training specialists in nuclear science and technology, taking due account of 
nuclear safety and security. He encouraged the Agency to offer interested Member States broader 
access to information on innovative nuclear technologies. 
237. Ms THOLE (Zambia) said that her country, as a committed advocate of general and complete 
disarmament, welcomed the significant progress that had been made by the United States and Russia 
towards concluding a legally binding treaty to reduce further their nuclear arsenals, and encouraged all 
other nuclear-weapon States to follow that good example. The steps by the United Kingdom and 
France to cease production of fissile material for nuclear weapons were encouraging and would help 
build confidence, but the total elimination of nuclear weapons should be the ultimate goal of nuclear 
disarmament. The delay of the entry into force of the CTBT remained a source of worry and Zambia 
urged those States on which its entry into force was dependent to sign and ratify the Treaty. 
238. Zambia had ratified the Pelindaba Treaty in June 2010. It welcomed efforts by other regions to 
establish nuclear-weapon-free zones and looked forward to seeing such a zone become a reality in the 
Middle East, as it would enhance peace and security in that region and beyond. 
239. The threat of nuclear terrorism was real and all States needed to cooperate to ensure that 
terrorists did not have access to nuclear weapons. With the AgencyÂs assistance, a radiation portal 
monitor had been installed on a railway line linking Zambia to the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, 
and a second monitor would be installed at a suitable site on the southern border of the country. Her 
country supported the strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. It had signed an additional 
protocol in May 2009 and was actively working towards its national implementation. 
240. Zambia supported the right of States to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. With 
steadily increasing energy demands, nuclear power could offer a supplementary and alternative source 
of energy. Zambia was considering exploiting its potential uranium reserves as a possible means of 
meeting its energy needs. Nuclear power could mitigate the negative environmental impact of the 
countryÂs current energy sources and address the problems of climate change. As uranium mining and 
milling posed a number of challenges, including security and waste disposal, Zambia would be 
looking for regional and international partners to assist in its exploitation of that resource. It had 
already begun to develop capacities for the establishment of a strong radiation protection authority to 
ensure the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material. 
241. Her country welcomed the extensive support it had received through the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme. Many successful projects had been implemented, including on the 
establishment of a cancer hospital where the second phase of activities, involving the construction of 
wards, radioactive iodine treatment rooms and a radiotherapy training centre, was almost complete. 
The Government had also worked with PACT, the Agency and the WHO to establish a cancer control 
plan which would enhance the sustainability of operations at the hospital. Through such efforts, it was 
GC(54)/OR.4 
21 September 2010, Page 35 
hoped that the impact of cancer in the country could be reduced. Technical cooperation had also facilitated 
the introduction of several mutant varieties of bean and cassava with higher yields and greater resistance to 
the effects of climate change. The consultations on ZambiaÂs CPF for 2010Â2015 were complete. 
242. Zambia had continued to invest in the development of infrastructure at the Central Veterinary 
Research Institute, with a view to building capacities to curb livestock diseases that had negatively 
impacted livestock productivity, depriving most rural farmers of their livelihood. However, there was 
still a need for further human resources development and the acquisition of modern equipment. The 
country sought the AgencyÂs support in increasing livestock productivity to create wealth for a 
sizeable proportion of the rural population. 
243. She congratulated AFRA on continuing to provide expertise on nuclear applications in 
medicine, food and agriculture, and other areas pertinent to human development, and she confirmed 
that Zambia would be paying its assessed voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2011.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 (continued) 
(GC(54)/4) 
1. Mr GARCÃA REVILLA (Peru) said that the AgencyÂs importance to global development and 
security was increasing year by year. Its activities in the fields of non-proliferation, disarmament and 
the peaceful application of nuclear techniques were multiplying and becoming more evident to States 
and the public. 
2. Peru was experiencing a period of sustained economic growth and social development, which 
meant that not only had its nuclear cooperation requirements increased substantially, but also that it 
was now in a position to contribute to the AgencyÂs work in the field of peaceful nuclear applications 
and the international promotion of nuclear security. 
3. He stressed the importance of prompt universalization of the non-proliferation regime, concrete 
steps towards nuclear disarmament, the extension of NWFZs, and the need for dialogue and mutual 
confidence to address areas of global concern in those fields. The AgencyÂs reliable and professional 
safeguards work, for which it had received renewed support at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, 
made an ongoing contribution to international security. His country particularly appreciated the 
AgencyÂs progressive application of the State level integrated safeguards approach, strengthening of 
the remote monitoring data centre and the progress achieved on the Enhancing Capabilities of the 
Safeguards Analytical Services (ECAS) project. 
4. Peru valued highly the activities implemented to improve international standards and practices 
in the field of nuclear safety. Worldwide and regional information networks were useful platforms in 
that regard, and his country therefore supported the AgencyÂs collaboration with the Ibero-American 
Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies. 
5. Peru shared international concerns over the growing risk posed by nuclear and radiological 
terrorism. It therefore supported the Nuclear Security Plan for 2010Â2013 and encouraged the Agency 
to promote its application, as adapted to the requirements of each region. Peru would contribute 
actively to that process through international summits aimed at strengthening international cooperation 
on nuclear security. 
6. Peru was convinced of the growing importance of nuclear technology applications for human 
development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Techniques for 
diversifying and adapting crops for domestic consumption and for export helped improve food 
security in a sustainable manner and could contribute directly to Goal 1 Â reducing poverty. Peru 
therefore supported the work of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and 
Agriculture on the improvement of crops and products, soil conservation and the use of water 
resources. Also, it welcomed the priority that the Director General had given to PACT and 
development of the WHO/IAEA Joint Programme on Cancer Control. The disease had a high 
mortality rate in developing countries, mainly owing to a lack of adequate diagnosis and treatment. 
Medical applications of nuclear energy, channelled through technical cooperation programmes, would 
help to remedy that situation. 
7. Nuclear energy applications were now easily accessible and could therefore be incorporated into 
medium- and long-term national development plans. For the first time, Peru had included plans for a 
nuclear power plant in its proposed national energy policy (2010Â2013), with a view to diversifying its 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 2 
energy mix and greater emphasis on renewable sources. That would involve close cooperation with the 
Agency for decades, particularly in the field of training. 
8. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to address the deficit of radioisotopes for medical 
and industrial applications, particularly molybdenum-99, and stood ready to assist through 
collaboration with other countries in the region. 
9. Peru was implementing a project to install a cyclotron for the treatment of cancer and cardiac 
diseases. It had also acquired positron emission tomography equipment for detection and diagnosis 
and, with the AgencyÂs assistance, had set up a national calibration laboratory that was very useful to 
the countryÂs medical and industrial sectors. Thanks to the AgencyÂs support, crop improvement 
projects were being implemented successfully in extreme climate zones. Yields of kiwicha grain, 
which formed part of the basic diet in the high Andes region, had increased from 1500 to 5000 kg per 
hectare owing to the development of a variety resistant to salinity and drought. To ensure 
sustainability of those activities, PeruÂs cooperation with the Agency over the preceding year had 
included expert missions, the participation of 85 national specialists in courses and workshops 
organized by the Agency, and equipment and material purchases totalling US $289 255. 
10. PeruÂs goals in the nuclear field included improving the countryÂs uranium potential, improving 
industrial irradiation techniques with a focus on agro-industrial applications, ensuring sustainable use 
of the water resources of coastal aquifers, strengthening radiation safety and introducing nuclear 
power generation. Peru, in collaboration with the Agency, had recently concluded a national 
programmatic plan on the application of nuclear energy that covered such areas as health, hydrology, 
food and agriculture, nuclear safety and radiation protection. Also, the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear 
Energy (IPEN) had adopted a strategic plan for 2010Â2016 with the main focus on the development of 
a nuclear power plant, the operation of a particle accelerator or cyclotron, the production of fission 
molybdenum-99 and the use of four cobalt irradiators. 
11. In an attempt to expand its international cooperation, his country had continued to host 
numerous regional training courses for nuclear energy professionals. In November 2010, two such 
courses would be held in Lima: one on methodologies for the design of technical cooperation projects 
and the other on radiation protection. 
12. As ARCAL celebrated its 25th anniversary, he noted the importance that Peru attached to that 
regional initiative, which had made a significant contribution to training, research and development in 
the field of nuclear science and technology in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
13. Ms KALA (Estonia), recalling the consensus reached at the recent NPT Review Conference, 
expressed the hope that the same spirit would prevail at the General Conference. Her country believed 
it was necessary to build on that momentum and fully implement the commitments made in the final 
document and the action plan. 
14. Estonia acknowledged that promoting nuclear non-proliferation and ensuring the non-diversion 
of nuclear technologies while advancing the use of nuclear science was a challenging task. It shared 
the view that Agency safeguards were an essential part of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
Believing that a comprehensive safeguards agreement with an additional protocol was the universal 
standard for nuclear verification, Estonia had implemented those instruments and supported 
universalization of the additional protocol. 
15. It was important to ensure that the development of nuclear energy took place under the best 
possible conditions with respect to safety, security and non-proliferation. Estonia remained committed 
to the AgencyÂs safety standards and called on Member States with nuclear activities to become 
contracting parties to the relevant safety conventions without delay. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 3 
16. The AgencyÂs Âatoms for peaceÂ mandate was in keeping with EstoniaÂs belief that nuclear 
technology should be developed only for peaceful purposes and in a manner that was safe and secure. 
Estonia supported further development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the right of each 
country to define its own energy strategy. It believed in responsible, sustainable, environmentally 
friendly, safe and secure nuclear energy production and was seriously considering introducing nuclear 
power, either through participation in regional nuclear projects or by establishing its own nuclear 
power plant, in order to help meet its energy needs while honouring its climate related commitments. 
Estonia understood that such a technically challenging project had to be undertaken carefully, 
responsibly and in full compliance with the AgencyÂs safety standards and the EUÂs nuclear safety 
directive. 
17. Estonia was grateful for Agency technical cooperation and TCF support for its national projects 
on radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. The knowledge and experience gained meant that the country 
was in a position, in close cooperation with the Agency, to provide training for medical experts from a 
number of countries. 
18. EstoniaÂs CPF for 2010Â2015 would be signed during the 54th General Conference and its 
contents would be available to all Member States. Estonia hoped that others would follow its example 
in order to promote transparency in that area. 
19. Fair access to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme would be an effective 
contribution toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals, which represented collective 
commitments and responsibilities shared by all. Estonia had fulfilled its obligations to the AgencyÂs 
Regular Budget in a timely manner and had made voluntary pledges to the TCF, and encouraged 
others to do likewise. 
20. It was a simple truth that, in the pursuit of a more peaceful, more stable, and less weaponized 
world, every single human being must act responsibly. As Albert Schweitzer had said in his 
1954 Nobel lecture: ÂOnly when an ideal of peace is born in the minds of the peoples will the 
institutions set up to maintain this peace effectively fulfil the function expected of themÂ. 
21. Mr RAMIREZ (Dominican Republic) expressed his GovernmentÂs support for the Agency, 
whose mandate to promote the safe and peaceful use of atomic energy helped the international 
community defend its fundamental values. He congratulated the Agency on its success in ensuring that 
nuclear science and technology were used to the benefit, rather than the detriment, of humanity. 
22. The technical cooperation programme was a fundamental tool that allowed developing countries 
to acquire the necessary knowledge to use nuclear techniques. The AgencyÂs activities in that regard 
contributed substantially to meeting energy needs, improving health, combating poverty, protecting 
the environment, developing agriculture, managing water resources and optimizing industrial 
processes. Thus, they helped to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goals to 
end hunger and malnutrition, reduce child mortality, improve maternal health, combat HIV/AIDS, 
malaria and other diseases, and ensure environmental sustainability. 
23. The Dominican RepublicÂs CPF identified specific contributions that nuclear technology could 
make to meeting national priorities. National and regional projects being implemented in the country 
by the Agency contributed significantly to developing infrastructure, promoting productivity and 
competitiveness, meeting basic needs, reducing poverty, building capacities and ensuring 
environmental sustainability. He thanked the Agency for its ongoing support for such activities. 
24. He underlined that Agency projects in his country had strengthened the radiotherapy services of 
national cancer hospitals. The Director General deserved special recognition for his initiative to attach 
priority to combating cancer in 2010. The Dominican Republic hoped that the initiative would result in 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 4 
an increase in resources for tackling the problem, which had taken on worrying dimensions in recent 
years, and that the Scientific Forum held alongside the General Conference would promote the further 
contribution of nuclear technology to cancer diagnosis and treatment. In particular, his country 
appreciated the AgencyÂs support, through PACT, for the adoption of national cancer control plans. 
25. Technical cooperation had enabled his country to improve its logistical and human capacities 
for sustainable aquifer management, to secure drinking water supplies in rural communities and to 
develop optimal strategies for soil conservation and the life extension of dams. The Agency had also 
provided support for the creation of a centre for nuclear research and applications, which would offer 
nuclear analytical services to public and private institutions. 
26. The Agency provided essential assistance to developing Member States in their consideration of 
the feasibility of the nuclear power option with a view to meeting the pressing need to diversify their 
energy mix, to reduce their dependence on oil and to release fewer contaminating gases into the 
atmosphere. The AgencyÂs planning tools had been very useful to the Dominican Republic in studying 
energy supply and demand models in the context of development of its national energy plan. 
27. The National Energy Commission and the Government of the Dominican Republic were very 
pleased to celebrate the 25th anniversary of ARCAL. The Agreement had brought multiple benefits to 
Latin American countries and set a good example of successful regional cooperation. Since ratifying 
the Agreement in 2008, the Dominican RepublicÂs participation in ARCAL had increased 
considerably and it was now participating in around 20 projects in such diverse areas as: development 
of a drought-resistant variety of rice, evaluation of groundwater potential, evaluation of the toxicity of 
marine algae, and energy planning, as well as human resource training in electronic instrumentation, 
non-destructive assay and food irradiation. The 11th meeting of the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination 
Board, held in the Dominican Republic in June 2010, had identified the regionÂs priorities for the next 
project cycle and addressed other topics of interest, such as how ARCAL and nuclear technology 
could help Haiti to overcome the devastating effects of the earthquake that had occurred there. 
28. Preventing the use of nuclear material for weapons of mass destruction, malicious acts or 
terrorist purposes and protecting the public and the environment from radiation risks were matters of 
prime importance. The AgencyÂs safety, security and safeguards activities to reduce the risks 
associated with the use of atomic energy would help to provide an appropriate framework for nuclear 
energy development. 
29. The AgencyÂs strengthened verification system provided assurances of the peaceful use of 
nuclear material. As indicated at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Agency safeguards were a 
fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. At that Conference, the National 
Energy Commission had announced the entry into force of the Dominican RepublicÂs additional 
protocol, which was an important tool for the Agency to provide credible guarantees that nuclear 
material was not being used for weapons purposes. 
30. His Government took note of the AgencyÂs activities to strengthen cooperation on nuclear, 
radiation, transport and waste safety and welcomed, in particular, the measures adopted to promote the 
safe transport of nuclear material and the consultations held between shipping and coastal States. As a 
coastal State on the transit route for such shipments, the Dominican Republic was keen to ensure that 
they were conducted as safely as possible. 
31. The Dominican Republic had made efforts to strengthen its radiation protection and safety 
infrastructure from an institutional and regulatory point of view, thus allowing the country to benefit 
safely from nuclear applications, to contribute effectively to the international communityÂs efforts to 
ensure radiation safety and security, and to address the threats posed by nuclear terrorism and illicit 
trafficking in nuclear material. His Government thanked the Agency for the support it had provided in 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 5 
that regard, especially through staff training on radioactive source management, on final disposal of 
disused sources, including the construction of a nuclear bunker donated by the United States of 
America, on response to radiological incidents and emergencies, and control of illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material. In addition, the Dominican Republic was drawing up a national plan focusing on the 
various aspects of nuclear security, for which it hoped to receive the AgencyÂs assistance. 
32. In the preceding three years, the Dominican Republic had accelerated its process of adhering to 
international instruments related to the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. It had acceded, inter 
alia, to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the Convention on Early 
Notification of a Nuclear Accident, the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism and was implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources. 
33. Nuclear energy had been one of the most transcendental discoveries in history. The AgencyÂs 
work to ensure that nuclear technology was a source of progress, rather than destruction, was highly 
valued by the international community and he reiterated his countryÂs support for its three pillars of 
activity, namely science, safety and safeguards. 
34. Mr BANERJEE (India) noted that limited fossil fuel reserves, environmental concerns and 
economic considerations had led to a resurgence of global interest in nuclear energy, with a number of 
countries setting up their first nuclear power plants and others expanding existing nuclear power 
programmes or extending the life of ageing plants. 
35. According to conservative projections, global nuclear power generation was expected to reach 
about 500 GW(e) by 2030. Large scale nuclear power generation required both technological and 
institutional solutions for economics, safety, environment, waste management, infrastructure, 
proliferation resistance and sustainability, and the AgencyÂs activities were contributing significantly 
to addressing those issues. 
36. One such high impact programme was the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors 
and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), which India believed strongly should become an integral part of the 
AgencyÂs regular programme and be fully supported through the Regular Budget. India would 
continue to support INPRO. 
37. The global nuclear renaissance had largely been the result of major investments made by 
industry over the decades to enhance the safety of nuclear energy. The Indian parliament had recently 
passed the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, which would go a long way towards increasing 
public confidence and creating a predictable environment in which vendors could participate in IndiaÂs 
nuclear programme. 
38. The International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES), which was celebrating its 20th 
anniversary, was very useful for communicating the safety significance of nuclear and radiological 
events to the general public in a consistent and simple manner. India had adopted INES from its 
inception and had participated actively in its evolution. 
39. Nuclear power was particularly important in India, since the availability of electricity would act 
as an instrument of economic growth. A recent study had estimated that nuclear power would need to 
provide about half of IndiaÂs electricity generation capacity in order to go most of the way to 
eliminating the countryÂs dependence on imported energy resources while achieving developed status. 
40. India remained committed to the three-stage nuclear programme formulated by 
Dr Homi Bhabha, founder of IndiaÂs nuclear programme. India attached high priority to the adoption 
of a closed fuel cycle and the use of thorium, given its relatively limited uranium reserves and large 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 6 
thorium deposits. Water cooled reactors, fast breeder reactors and thorium-based power generation 
remained the key elements of IndiaÂs sustainable nuclear programme. 
41. The countryÂs nuclear power programme placed emphasis on safe and reliable power plant 
operation, reducing the gestation period for new projects and adding capacity. The nuclear power 
sector had accumulated more than 322 reactor years of safe operation. The total installed nuclear 
power capacity was currently 4560 MW(e) with a total of 19 operating reactors, including two new 
220 MW(e) units in Rajasthan. The replacement of all the coolant channels and feeders in the PHWRs 
at Kakrapar and Narora had been completed and construction of the Kaiga Unit 4 PHWR had been 
completed and it was ready for fuel loading. Three reactors in India had had uninterrupted runs of 
more than 400 days. 
42. Construction in cooperation with the Russian Federation of two 1000 MW(e) light water 
reactors at Kudankulam was nearing completion and work on two indigenous 700 MW(e) units in 
Rawatbhata (Rajasthan) and Kakrapar (Gujarat) had started. 
43. The 500 MW(e) Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) was at an advanced stage of 
construction. The spent mixed carbide fuel from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), with a burnup 
of 155 GWd/t, had been reprocessed in the Compact Reprocessing Facility for Advanced Fuels in 
Lead Cells (CORAL). The fissile material had then been refabricated as fuel and loaded back into the 
reactor, thus closing the fast reactor fuel cycle. 
44. India was using established indigenous technology to expand its uranium enrichment capacity to 
partially cover the requirements of its light water reactors. Setting up an adequate reprocessing 
capability had been an important element of IndiaÂs closed fuel cycle based programme, and the 
country had recently begun engineering work on an integrated nuclear recycling plant with facilities 
for both reprocessing of spent fuel and waste management. 
45. Approval had been granted in principle for energy parks at five coastal sites, each to be 
populated with a number of water cooled reactors to be constructed through international cooperation. 
India was thus poised to expand its installed nuclear power capacity to about 60 GW(e) by 2032. 
International cooperation would assist in meeting immediate requirements and bridging the deficit in 
the coming decades through operation of the closed fuel cycle. 
46. India was self-sufficient with regard to heavy water, zirconium alloy components and other 
materials and supplies for PHWRs. A new zirconium complex had been commissioned for the 
production of reactor grade zirconium sponge. The Nuclear Fuel Complex at Hyderabad manufactured 
fuel assemblies for PHWRs, BWRs and fast breeder reactors. The country had extensive capabilities in 
uranium mining and mineral processing. The uranium deposit at Tumallapalle, where a new mine had 
been opened, promised to yield about three times more than originally estimated. India was 
aggressively prospecting for uranium using modern geophysical techniques, some indigenously 
developed. It was also interested in working with international partners in developing uranium mining 
opportunities abroad. 
47. Indian PHWRs offered a variety of options for countries looking for cost-competitive and 
proven small and medium size reactor technologies, with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India 
currently offering 220 MW(e) and 540 MW(e) units for export. Indian industry was ready to play a 
bigger role in the countryÂs own nuclear programme and was on the way to becoming a competitive 
international supplier of special steels, large size forgings, control instruments, software and other 
nuclear components and services. 
48. The Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership, currently being established, would provide a 
forum for joint activities with international partners. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 7 
49. India was pleased that the focus of the 2010 Scientific Forum was cancer, where nuclear 
techniques had an important role to play in both detection and treatment. The Tata Memorial Centre in 
Mumbai, a leader in cancer treatment and research, conducted several training programmes in 
collaboration with the Agency and RCA for countries in the Asia and the Pacific region. A national 
cancer grid was being set up connecting a number of hospitals with the Tata Memorial Centre. About 
30 continuing medical education webcasts were relayed each year. 
50. PACT helped channel resources and expertise to needy and developing countries. An 
indigenously developed Bhabhatron teletherapy unit, donated to Vietnam by India under PACT, had 
been inaugurated in April 2010, and India had taken the decision to donate two more units, including 
one to Sri Lanka. 
51. The hybrid nuclear desalination demonstration plant at Kalpakkam, where multistage flash 
evaporation and reverse osmosis processes were used to produce 6.3 million litres per day, was one of 
the largest such units in the world. 
52. India also continued to use nuclear science to increase agricultural productivity. Two new 
mutant lentil varieties had been announced for commercial cultivation, bringing to 39 the total number 
of mutant crop varieties developed at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre using nuclear techniques. 
53. There had been a number of recent achievements in the area of research and development. A 
real time online decision support system had been set up at Narora Atomic Power Station to provide 
guidance to emergency managers for making quick decisions based on the projected impact of 
accidental releases from the plant. The synchrotron radiation source at Indore had become fully 
functional, with several beam lines set up for experiments. IndiaÂs first industrial scale enriched boron 
production facility based on exchange distillation had been commissioned at Talcher and a similar 
facility based on ion exchange chromatography had been commissioned for Manuguru. 
54. A new impetus was urgently needed to further advance nuclear technology for the benefit of all 
humanity. The Agency would need to increase its efforts towards innovative and appropriate 
technology solutions to satisfy the worldÂs growing energy needs while protecting the environment. 
55. Mr EGLAJS (Latvia) said that his country appreciated the impartial and objective advice which 
the Agency gave Member States concerning the establishment of an appropriate legal and regulatory 
framework and ensuring the highest standards of safety and security. 
56. Technical cooperation was crucial and the increased emphasis on knowledge management had 
further increased the importance of regional projects in sharing experience, exchanging opinions and 
finding the best possible approaches to problems. Latvia had submitted four national projects for the 
next technical cooperation cycle, three related to knowledge management and information exchange. 
LatviaÂs Country Programme Note (CPN) had been elaborated in consultation with stakeholders with a 
strong interest in technical cooperation projects. Invitations to submit project proposals had been sent 
to private and State institutions, thereby involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process. Also, 
regional projects would allow Latvia to provide expertise to other countries, and his country would be 
contributing to the exchange of nuclear knowledge by hosting training courses during the next cycle. 
57. Effective measures to combat terrorism and prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear, biological 
chemical and radiological weapons were of the utmost importance. The Agency was actively involved 
in that area and its role in joint efforts to ensure international security was increasing. Member States 
should attach the highest priority to strong national and internationally coordinated export controls in 
order to combat illicit trafficking in and the procurement of nuclear technologies and materials as well 
as the threat of proliferation of such materials by non-State actors. Activities under the Global Threat 
Reduction Initiative, implemented in cooperation with the United States Pacific Northwest National 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 8 
Laboratory were noteworthy in that regard. The Latvian regulatory body would be hosting a security 
awareness seminar and physical protection workshop in October 2010. As a party to the Convention 
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, Latvia urged States which had not yet acceded to do 
so. 
58. Agency safeguards were an essential part of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and 
Latvia strongly supported strengthening their effectiveness and efficiency. Not all States party to the NPT 
had fulfilled their obligation to bring comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency into force. 
Latvia welcomed the progress made at the recent NPT Review Conference and the action plan which had 
resulted therefrom. 
59. Given the recent increase in interest in developing nuclear power, Latvia called attention to the 
need for countries to adequately inform their neighbours regarding the siting of nuclear installations. 
Latvia had faced situations in 2009 and 2010 where the exchange of such information had not been 
handled in the best way. The views of neighbouring countries should be taken into consideration and 
all issues of concern should be resolved through negotiation before starting the construction of any 
facility. 
60. Latvia appreciated the AgencyÂs enormous efforts and its professionalism in working for the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy despite the challenges it faced, especially in the sphere of nuclear 
verification. 
61. Mr GERÂINA (Slovenia) said that his country had welcomed the Director GeneralÂs set of 
priorities for the year under review. It applauded raising awareness concerning the problem of cancer 
in developing countries to a higher political level and noted that Slovenian experts from the Institute of 
Oncology in Ljubljana had already become involved in PACT. So-called green diplomacy was one of 
his GovernmentÂs priorities and it supported the Geological Survey of Slovenia in joining the IAEA 
Water Availability Enhancement (IWAVE) programme. 
62. Strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system was critical to reinvigorating global 
non-proliferation efforts. Implementing safeguards was the AgencyÂs core mission and it could not be 
accomplished without Member StatesÂ cooperation and their continuous support of all aspects of 
safeguards, including evolution of the safeguards system to address contemporary challenges. 
Slovenia was deeply concerned that, according to the latest reports by the Director General, some 
countries were still failing to comply with Security Council and Agency resolutions or their 
comprehensive safeguards agreements under the NPT, or were not cooperating with the Agency in 
other ways. Slovenia urged them to do so. As a member of SAGSI since 2009, Slovenia was willing to 
help in that regard. 
63. A comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol should be 
considered the universal verification standard. It was encouraging that there were more than a hundred 
additional protocols in force, and Slovenia urged Member States which had not brought a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement into force or were hesitant to conclude an additional protocol to 
do so without delay. 
64. The successful outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference had demonstrated that the States 
Party collectively desired a positive result and it was reassuring that the review process had been 
strengthened and confidence had been restored in the viability of the Treaty after nearly a decade of 
neglect. While the final document contained useful benchmarks for assessing implementation of the 
ConferenceÂs recommendations, that by itself would not guarantee success. More efforts were needed 
to reinforce the three pillars of the NPT: disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 9 
65. The AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear security was critical in order to prevent, detect and 
respond to nuclear terrorism. Risk reduction and security improvements were important elements of 
the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme. Slovenia welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member 
States in improving the security of nuclear facilities and other locations where radioactive substances 
were used or stored, and during transport. 
66. In December 2009, Slovenia had deposited its instrument of ratification of the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, thereby becoming party to 14 of the 
16 United Nations counter-terrorism conventions and protocols, including the amendment to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
67. Multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle could significantly contribute to energy 
security and non-proliferation and discussions on such approaches needed to continue in order to push 
that process forward. Slovenia strongly believed that the Agency could play an important role in that 
process by providing advice and technical knowledge and stressed that participation in assurance 
supply mechanisms should be voluntary. 
68. Slovenia was fully committed to supporting the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. In the 
past year Slovenia had hosted regional workshops, training courses, meetings and seminars and had 
trained Agency fellows from a number of developing countries. Since 2006, Slovenian experts had 
also been active in the demanding Vinca Institute Nuclear Decommissioning (VIND) programme to 
assist Serbia in decommissioning nuclear facilities. 
69. Slovenia had always closely monitored and supported the SecretariatÂs efforts to improve and 
strengthen nuclear and radiation emergency preparedness and response in Member States and 
worldwide. Slovenian organizations had offered to share resources with the growing membership of 
the Response Assistance Network (RANET). In July 2010, his Government had adopted the revised 
nuclear or radiological emergency plan which, inter alia, introduced a user-friendly web-based system 
for major stakeholders to exchange information and documents. The strategy of pre-distribution of 
potassium iodine tablets in the nuclear power plant emergency planning zone had also been agreed. 
70. On the national legislative front, the new law on protection against ionizing radiation and 
nuclear safety and the law on third party liability and insurance had reached the final stage of 
preparation. The texts had been agreed among all the stakeholders and would be fully consistent with 
the latest protocols to the Paris and Brussels Supplementary Conventions. Secondary legislation had 
incorporated most of the Western European Nuclear RegulatorsÂ Association (WENRA) reference 
levels into Slovenian legislation. 
71. One of SloveniaÂs main goals was the continued safe operation of its existing nuclear facilities. 
The KrÂko nuclear power plant had maintained an excellent operating record while supplying almost 
40% of the countryÂs electrical power. It had operated without any automatic or manual reactor trips 
since 2005. The programme for the next periodic safety review had been approved and the relevant 
activities were in progress. In 2009, the plant had applied for a design lifetime extension to 60 years 
and, in that context, an independent safety evaluation by an international team had been prepared. 
72. The feasibility of a new nuclear power plant in Slovenia as an affordable, reliable, safe and 
low-carbon source of energy was still being considered. Slovenia believed that nuclear power could be 
an answer to the challenges of climate change and energy security. The coming years would probably 
see a significant increase in the use of nuclear power, which remained a viable option for Slovenian 
energy policy both now and in the future. Slovenian nuclear related organizations were interested in 
taking part in the renaissance in nuclear power production. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 10 
73. In December 2009, the Government had passed a decree approving the site for a low and 
intermediate level radioactive waste repository in the vicinity of the KrÂko nuclear power plant and the 
Slovenian Agency for Radwaste Management planned to start construction in about two and a half 
years. The site would also be used for storage of all the institutional waste generated in Slovenia. 
74. Slovenia believed that the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety 
of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management were efficient 
instruments for maintaining a high level of nuclear safety worldwide although, strictly speaking, they 
were incentive instruments. The national reports for fifth review meeting of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, to be held in April 2011, were ready and had been made available to the Contracting 
Parties. 
75. In conclusion, he reiterated SloveniaÂs full support of the Agency and its activities and thanked 
the Director General and the Secretariat for their impartial, professional, competent and devoted work. 
Mr Berdennikov (Russian Federation) took the Chair. 
76. Mr POTTS (Australia) said that his country had been proud to take the lead, together with 
Japan, in establishing the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament 
(ICNND) and thanked the Secretariat and Member States for their support of that initiative. The 
Commission had made a major contribution to advancing debate on nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament, in particular at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and to the global shift in attitudes 
over the past two years to a near-universal commitment to a world without nuclear weapons. The 
CommissionÂs report on eliminating nuclear threats had proposed a comprehensive action agenda 
based on 76 recommendations for policies and actions to be taken in the short, medium and long term 
to achieve the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. 
77. Australia welcomed the positive outcomes of the NPT Review Conference and noted in 
particular the contribution of the Vienna Group of Ten, a group of like-minded States, chaired by 
Australia, with a strong commitment to assist the NPT review process by producing text on issues 
concerning safeguards and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
78. The formation of the Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network (APSN) had been announced by 
Australia at the 2009 General Conference and launched on 1 October 2009. Its inaugural meeting in 
Bali in June 2010, hosted by Dr As Natio Lasman, Head of the Indonesian Nuclear Energy Regulatory 
Agency (BAPETEN), and co-chaired by Mr John Carlson, Director General of the Australian 
Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office (ASNO), had been attended by representatives from 
19 safeguards organizations and ministries in ten countries, the Agency and the European 
Commission. Australia thanked APSN members for their contributions and the Government of 
Indonesia for hosting the inaugural meeting. Australia looked forward to working with the Agency, the 
European Commission and the members of APSN to develop its full potential. The APSN statement of 
principles had been published in document INFCIRC/769. 
79. Over the 30 years of its existence, the Australian Safeguards Support Programme (ASSP) had 
worked closely with many other support programmes, most notably those in the United States of 
America, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea. The Australian programme 
had contributed substantially to the effectiveness of Agency safeguards through analytical services for 
environmental sampling, the original work on remote monitoring systems and training. In the area of 
analysis and conceptual work it had contributed most notably through its participation in SAGSI and 
development of the physical model that guided the AgencyÂs safeguards approaches to the nuclear fuel 
cycle. Australia looked forward to continuing that work. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 11 
80. Australia reiterated its call for those NPT States which had yet to fulfil their obligations under 
the Treaty to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol to do so 
without delay. Australia had long supported universalization of the NPT and encouraged those States 
which had not signed and ratified the Treaty to do so as soon as possible. 
81. The major technical challenge faced by the safeguards system was to ensure credible 
verification by providing confidence that safeguards were effective in detecting both the misuse of 
declared facilities and the existence of undeclared facilities. Australia had been the first State to sign 
an additional protocol and the first to ratify one. A comprehensive safeguards agreement with an 
additional protocol helped States assure others of the peaceful intent of their nuclear activities. Every 
State benefited from efforts to make the safeguards system as effective as possible, and the additional 
protocol was an essential part of those efforts. 
82. Compliance with Agency safeguards obligations was not voluntary. Under the NPT, 
non-nuclear-weapon States had made a commitment not to use nuclear energy for nuclear weapons 
purposes and Agency safeguards played an essential role in verifying that commitment. All must 
respect that commitment and hold States accountable for safeguards violations. 
83. Regrettably, certain States continued to be in breach of their safeguards obligations. Iran 
continued to act in violation of binding Security Council resolutions and requirements of the Board of 
Governors. Australia remained deeply concerned that Iran was not cooperating fully with the Agency 
in its investigations, especially with respect to the possible military dimensions of the countryÂs 
nuclear programme. Security Council resolution 1929 (2010), which imposed wide-ranging new 
sanctions on Iran, reflected the international communityÂs deep concerns about that countryÂs nuclear 
programme. Australia urged Iran to comply with Security Council resolutions, engage with the 
Agency to resolve all issues and demonstrate conclusively the peaceful intent of its nuclear 
programme. 
84. Australia supported the AgencyÂs efforts to engage with Syria to clarify a number of unresolved 
issues about its nuclear activities, including the construction of a nuclear reactor with DPRK 
assistance, and urged Syria to resolve those issues and comply fully with the AgencyÂs requests under 
the proposed action plan. 
85. The DPRK continued to be in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations and defy Security 
Council resolutions. Australia urged the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons in a complete, 
verifiable and irreversible manner and comply with its NPT and Agency safeguards obligations. 
86. Australia had long supported the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons 
and other weapons of mass destruction. It was critical for all States in the Middle East to comply fully 
with their non-proliferation obligations in order to build mutual confidence and security in the region. 
It was important to build on the positive momentum of the recent NPT Review Conference and focus 
on implementing its agreed outcomes, including the agreement to convene a conference in 2012 on the 
establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 
At such a critical juncture, Australia encouraged all States to avoid actions that might disrupt progress 
towards reaching that important goal. 
87. Australia continued to work closely with its regional neighbours and the Agency on nuclear 
safety and security. As a major uranium producer and exporter holding some 30Â40% of the worldÂs 
uranium resources, Australia was committed to the safe and environmentally sound mining, processing 
and transport of uranium and was proud of its strong record in those areas. As a sign of that 
commitment, Australia had established the Friends of Responsible Uranium Mining (FoRUM), an 
informal Vienna-based contact group for existing and prospective uranium mining countries as a 
means of exchanging views and experience on best practices in uranium mining. In that context, 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 12 
Australia was once again hosting a side event during the General Conference on ÂUranium Production 
Cycle: Future Needs and ChallengesÂ. 
88. Noting that denial of shipment had been a factor in the global shortage of key medical 
radioisotopes such as molybdenum-99 over recent months, he stressed the importance of international 
efforts to address the issue of timely and reliable transport of radioactive materials. In that regard, he 
noted that AustraliaÂs LEU-fuelled OPAL reactor had operated for 266 days at full power from 1 July 
2009 to 30 June 2010, thus providing a strong basis for the Australian Nuclear Science and 
Technology OrganisationÂs (ANSTO) LEU-based molybdenum production facility to achieve routine 
operation and to work on increasing production capacity to help meet global demand. 
89. Australia supported the activities of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network and the important role it 
was playing in Southeast Asia by fostering interaction among States planning to introduce nuclear 
power as well as those operating existing research reactors. Australia looked forward to the 
round-table discussion during the current General Conference session on enhancing collaboration 
among global and regional networks. 
90. Australia reaffirmed the right of Member States to use nuclear energy peacefully in accordance 
with their international obligations. Australia shared its expertise, equipment and personnel in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology through ANSTO, an Agency collaborating centre for 
neutron scattering applications, and was consistently ranked among the top contributors to the 
AgencyÂs TCF. 
91. Mr ABDULLATIF ABDULLA (Bahrain) said that the AgencyÂs action to ensure that nuclear 
energy was used only for peaceful purposes and to promote nuclear safety played an extremely 
important role in the context of national, regional and international efforts to use nuclear energy for 
electricity generation, seawater desalination, improved health services and sustainable development. 
The world as a whole also depended on successful Agency action to avert the threat of nuclear 
terrorism and to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
92. Since joining the Agency, Bahrain had taken resolute steps to use nuclear energy in support of 
national development goals, to strengthen regional cooperation and to establish the requisite legislative 
and technical infrastructure. It had also expanded the scope of its international obligations in respect of 
nuclear safety and continued to support action to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
93. Bahrain had signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement in 2007 and had recently signed an 
additional protocol. Also, it had acceded to a number of international instruments such as the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the amendments thereto, the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
94. Bahrain had set up a national commission, based on international standards, to deal with all 
issues pertaining to peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the Kingdom. All relevant ministries took part 
in the commissionÂs work. In that context, he thanked the Agency for its ongoing technical and legal 
assistance. 
95. Bahrain was proud of current efforts among the Member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council 
to promote peaceful uses of nuclear energy in cooperation with the Agency. He was also proud of 
Arab cooperation in using nuclear energy to achieve development goals as part of the Arab nuclear 
energy strategy for the period 2010Â2020. 
96. The Arab States relied heavily on the action taken by the Agency to apply effective safeguards 
in the Middle East region pursuant to General Conference resolution GC(50)/RES/16, with the aim of 
creating a NWFZ in the Middle East region. He also referred in that connection to General Conference 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 13 
resolution GC(53)/RES/17, adopted on 18 September 2009, in which the Conference had expressed 
concern about the Israeli nuclear capabilities and called on Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its 
nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. Bahrain emphasized the need for action to 
ensure the effective implementation of that resolution. 
97. Bahrain welcomed the outcome of the Nuclear Summit held in Washington, which had agreed 
on a work plan for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It also welcomed the outcome of the 
NPT Review Conference, which had called for the convening of a regional conference in 2012 on the 
establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle 
East. Bahrain urged all concerned to take positive steps to ensure the success of the conference. 
98. His country greatly appreciated the steps taken by the Agency to enhance the effectiveness of 
the safeguards regime. It hoped that real progress would be made in the area of nuclear disarmament 
and that all States would be persuaded to accede to the NPT so that it became a universal instrument. 
99. Bahrain emphasized the right of every State to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
welcomed the statement by the Islamic Republic of Iran that it was committed to maintaining the 
peaceful character of its nuclear programme. He stressed the importance of full transparency, 
fulfilment of all the AgencyÂs requirements and compliance with the provisions of the NPT with a 
view to dispelling all doubts regarding IranÂs nuclear programme. 
100. Ms RASI (Finland) affirmed that safeguards and verification were prerequisites for the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy by Member States. Finland strongly supported increasing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Comprehensive safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols thereto should be brought into force promptly and implemented by all 
non-nuclear-weapon Member States. 
101. Agency integrated safeguards had been implemented for two years in Finland and the 
experience had been encouraging, with a 60% reduction in Agency inspections in the first full year, 
namely 2009. 
102. Further synergies between safeguards, safety and nuclear security would be welcome. 
Preliminary design information for new nuclear facilities was required to be submitted without undue 
delay, but it would be cost-effective to address both safeguards and security in the design of such 
facilities. Finland, which had already incorporated that idea in its legislation with positive results, 
suggested that the introduction of safeguards in the design phase of nuclear facilities should be a 
requirement in Agency safety standards. Another area where the AgencyÂs efficiency and effectiveness 
could be improved would be through better cooperation with State systems of accounting for and 
control of nuclear material (SSACs). 
103. Nuclear power would remain a major component of FinlandÂs energy mix. Finland, a small 
country very dependent on energy, had had nuclear power plants in operation since the late 1970s. Its 
safety record was good and its performance indicators excellent. The countryÂs fifth nuclear power 
plant unit, a 1600 MW European pressurized water reactor (EPR), was currently under construction in 
Olkiluoto. The share of nuclear power in electricity power generation would be increasing to around 
40%, making Finland a fairly large user of nuclear power in relative terms. 
104. In the spring of 2010 the Finnish Government had taken a decision in principle, later ratified by 
Parliament, to proceed with two more nuclear power plant units, and the Government would be 
dealing with construction licence applications in due course. Those decisions would shift Finland 
dramatically in the carbon emission-free direction and would ensure the countryÂs self-sufficiency in 
electricity production for the first time in several decades. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 14 
105. Nuclear waste management was an important issue, and a clearly defined waste management 
policy, openly declared by the Government and including solid financing arrangements defined in the 
nuclear legislation, was essential. 
106. FinlandÂs fuel cycle was of the Âonce-throughÂ type. National legislation viewed spent nuclear 
fuel as radioactive waste and required its disposal in Finnish bedrock. Since the decision in principle 
in 2000, industry and the regulator had been working to implement the spent fuel final disposal 
project. The nuclear waste management company, Posiva, was making active preparations to submit 
an application for a construction license in 2012. The Onkalo underground rock characterization 
facility, which was planned to be part of the final repository, had started operation in 2004, and spent 
fuel disposal was scheduled to start in 2020. 
107. Member States and the Agency should strengthen and coordinate efforts to ensure that countries 
embarking on nuclear power programmes developed sound safety infrastructures. Despite the 
AgencyÂs central role in that area, prime responsibility for the safe and secure use of nuclear power lay 
with the licensed operators and strict regulation by national authorities was important. The Agency 
should give them advice and support, and the vendors should ensure safe design and high quality 
construction. It could not be expected, however, that international or foreign organizations would 
assume the responsibilities of the national actors. In that context, Finland underlined again the 
importance of a strong national safety culture and a strong and independent national regulatory 
authority which enjoyed the publicÂs confidence. Finland continued actively to share with other 
countries its experience in building national infrastructure and ensuring the safety of nuclear power 
plants. 
108. Finland had ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism in 2009 and, having completed the required amendments to national legislation, was ready 
to deposit its instrument of ratification of the amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material. Finland called for early ratification by all States of those two conventions, which 
would strengthen the global nuclear security regime. 
109. The Agency continued to play a key role in supporting Member States in their fight against 
nuclear terrorism. Finland had provided financial and in-kind support to the AgencyÂs nuclear security 
activities and she announced that it was making another voluntary contribution to the Nuclear Security 
Fund. 
110. The President of Finland had participated in the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in 
April. The commitments undertaken by the Summit participants were very relevant to and supportive 
of the AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear security. In future, the work of both forums should be 
complementary and mutually reinforcing. 
111. Finland had always paid its contribution to the Regular Budget in full and on time and also, in 
recognition of the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, its share of the TCF 
target; it called upon all Member States to do likewise. The demand for technical cooperation activities 
related to the introduction of nuclear power was increasing, particularly regarding safety. It was 
important that the Agency was able to meet that demand and that technical cooperation modalities 
were developed further. Efforts should be made to find the most efficient way to transfer knowledge 
and technology, with emphasis on long-term capacity building. 
112. Regarding the content of the technical cooperation programme, projects should be fully within 
the AgencyÂs terms of reference and based on national development strategies. Fully recognizing the 
important role of non-power applications for technical assistance, Finland hoped that the Agency 
would continue to develop more cost-effective and sustainable methods and partnerships with other 
organizations, such as WHO and FAO.

113. Mr HAMER (Netherlands) said that a number of important events had taken place over the 
preceding year. After a decade of deadlock, the international disarmament and non-proliferation 
regime had received new impetus with the adoption of Security Council resolution 1887, the signing 
of the New START Treaty, the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington and the consensus outcome of 
the NPT Review Conference. All States now had the responsibility to build on those results and seize 
the opportunity to improve multilateral cooperation and strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
114. Despite the achievements, the non-proliferation regime continued to face many grave 
challenges, including the DPRKÂs ongoing defiance of the international community regarding its 
nuclear weapons programme, IranÂs lack of cooperation in allowing the Agency to verify the peaceful 
nature of its nuclear programme, outstanding questions about SyriaÂs nuclear programme, and the 
danger of nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists and other non-State actors. As a member 
of the Board of Governors, his country would continue to take an active part in shaping the future of 
the Agency and the way it dealt with the challenges and opportunities before it. 
115. The Netherlands fully supported the right of States to develop nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes, but with that right came responsibilities. States must ensure that their development of 
nuclear energy met all the necessary non-proliferation requirements. The AgencyÂs safeguards system 
was essential in that regard. A comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional 
protocol constituted the current verification standard and the Netherlands called on all Member States 
which had not done so to conclude, ratify and implement both those instruments. Only with an 
additional protocol in place could the Agency verify that no nuclear material was being diverted to 
non-peaceful purposes. The safeguards system needed to evolve constantly in order to keep pace with 
technological developments and allow the Agency to perform its verification activities with the 
greatest possible efficiency and effectiveness. His country therefore supported the introduction of 
integrated and information-driven safeguards. In addition, in order to guarantee the integrity of the 
NPT and the AgencyÂs inspection regime, a strong policy against non-compliance was required. 
Specific cases of non-compliance needed to be addressed. 
116. All States had an interest in maximizing the security of nuclear material. The Netherlands 
warmly welcomed the results of the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington and was committed to 
implementing the resulting work plan and agreements. His country took its nuclear security 
responsibilities very seriously and made good use of the AgencyÂs services in that regard. It had 
received three International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) missions that had reviewed 
all the nuclear installations in the country and made valuable recommendations. A fourth mission 
planned for 2011 would evaluate how those recommendations had been implemented. In November 
2010, in close cooperation with the Agency, the Netherlands was organizing a seminar for senior 
managers and high-level officials in the Dutch nuclear field to increase their awareness of nuclear 
security issues. 
117. The Nuclear Security Fund was pivotal to improving nuclear security and should therefore be 
part of the AgencyÂs Regular Budget, not just supported by a few donor countries. Until that came 
about, his country Â which had made substantial unconditional donations to the Fund for several 
years and had pledged another Â750 000 for the next three years Â called upon all Member States to 
contribute to it generously and without conditions. 
118. The shortage of molybdenum-99 supplies was cause for serious concern. The high-flux reactor 
in Petten was the worldÂs second largest producer of radioisotopes for medical use, meeting 30% of 
worldwide demand and used to treat 24 000 patients every day. In 2008, gas leakages had been 
observed in the primary cooling system of the reactor. Given the worldwide need for 
radiopharmaceuticals, and with extra leak monitoring and strict safety measures in place, the operator 
had been granted a special temporary licence by the Dutch Government, approved by an Agency 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 16 
safety mission, to keep operating the reactor for one year. A detailed repair plan had been prepared in 
close cooperation with a team of Agency experts and the repair work had been carried out from 
February to July 2010, replacing faulty pipe parts and taking action to prevent similar problems in the 
future. Radioisotope production had resumed in September 2010. 
119. As a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, the Netherlands had 
pledged its full target share to the TCF for 2011. Through its technical cooperation programme, the 
Agency could make a real contribution to such global issues as health, food, water and the 
environment, and help achieve sustainable national and international development goals, including the 
Millennium Development Goals. However, with a view to making the most of the funds available, the 
management and transparency of the programme needed to be improved and brought into line with 
established United Nations standards. Also, cooperation with relevant international organizations 
should be intensified. The least developed countries needed to be better represented in the technical 
cooperation programme as they had the greatest socio-economic development needs. In addition, the 
programmeÂs statutory and policy framework for safety, security and safeguards should be fully 
implemented to prevent unnecessary risk to the health of the public, workers and patients, or to the 
environment. The danger of material ending up in the wrong hands also had to be addressed. 
120. The growing interest in nuclear power led to a need for secure access to and supply of nuclear 
fuel. The Netherlands supported multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and welcomed the 
recent agreement between the Agency and the Russian Federation to establish a reserve of LEU in 
Angarsk. A number of other countries had made further proposals that could help States exercise their 
right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was time to move forward in the debate on that issue 
and the Netherlands would work actively with all parties concerned to that end. 
121. The increasing urgency of climate change and the scarcity of energy sources had obliged his 
country to think about nuclear energy in its future energy mix. Three scenarios had been prepared and 
sent to parliament and a new Government would have to decide whether to build nuclear power plants 
in the Netherlands. 
122. Mr AL-SALLAL (Kuwait) said that international socio-economic development called for a 
major increase in the energy supply over the coming decades. As nuclear energy was deemed to be a 
supplementary rather than an alternative source of energy, the decision to opt for nuclear energy 
depended on national policies, which were in turn determined by needs, aspirations and capabilities. 
123. Kuwait had entered a new stage in its relationship with the Agency. The Emir of Kuwait, 
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, had instructed the Government to elaborate an integrated 
national strategy for the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy in order to diversify energy 
sources. The Council of Ministers had therefore decided in March 2009 to establish a National 
Commission on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy based on Agency recommendations under the 
chairmanship of the Prime Minister. Kuwait had since engaged in consultations with major nuclear 
States and was cooperating with the Agency on using nuclear energy for electricity generation, 
seawater desalination, capacity-building and the development of relevant national institutions. 
KuwaitÂs national institutions looked forward to engaging in further close consultations with the 
Agency concerning action to meet the expected increase in average energy consumption during the 
coming decade. 
124. Kuwait participated with great interest in meetings between experts from the Member States of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council and Agency experts with the aim of implementing a joint programme on 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. A great deal had been achieved during the past three years and 
Kuwait looked forward to further cooperation in the years ahead. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 17 
125. The technical cooperation programme was a cornerstone of the AgencyÂs capacity-building 
activities and for the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries. Kuwait had long attached 
great importance to technical cooperation activities and had warmly welcomed the signing in 
December 2009 of a CPF agreement with the Agency covering the period 2009Â2013. Moreover, 
Kuwait had ranked first in 2009 in terms of its rate of implementation of the technical cooperation 
programme, attaining a rate of more than 95%. It looked forward to further constructive cooperation 
with the Agency in the areas of training, technical support and the safe use of radioactive material. 
Kuwait also appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation efforts on behalf of the Asia and the 
Pacific region, especially the organization of regional workshops and training courses. 
126. Kuwait attached great importance to the safety and security of radioactive sources and nuclear 
material. It was essential to apply the relevant rules and guidelines aimed at controlling movements of 
such material. Kuwait had taken note of the Director GeneralÂs Nuclear Security Report 2010 and the 
AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan. It had adopted a national integrated nuclear security plan in April 
2010 and notified the Agency of the plan and of a work plan for 2011Â2012 involving various national 
sectors and institutions. Kuwait had agreed with the Agency to hold a training workshop on advanced 
equipment for the detection of radioactive materials. 
127. Kuwait welcomed the increase in international involvement in data collection for the Illicit 
Trafficking Database programme and had itself begun to participate in the programme in 2009. It 
urged the Agency to coordinate with Member States that were building nuclear facilities in their 
territory in order to ensure that they exercised caution and took all necessary safety measures in their 
facilities and nuclear programmes. The Agency should continuously verify compliance by the 
authorities of the countries concerned with safety procedures and urge them to accede to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
128. Kuwait was following developments with respect to the safeguards agreement of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. While it affirmed the right of all States to produce and develop nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of the NPT, it called on the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to cooperate more closely with the Agency, and to respond to its queries in order to dispel any 
fears and doubts concerning the nature of its nuclear programme and to resolve pending issues. It 
further called on all the parties concerned to step up diplomatic efforts to resume the dialogue and 
negotiations in the interests of security and stability in the Middle East region and the world as a 
whole. 
129. The safeguards system, as a cornerstone of the AgencyÂs work and of the non-proliferation 
regime, enjoyed the support of most countries in the world. Kuwait urged all States that had not yet 
signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency to do so, and encouraged States that 
had signed such an agreement to proceed with the signing of an additional protocol. All States Party to 
the NPT should abide by their obligations under the Treaty and under their safeguards agreements, and 
should work closely with the Agency in resolving any doubts regarding their programmes through 
constructive and transparent negotiations and dialogue. 
130. The Agency should redouble its efforts to verify that all nuclear installations and programmes 
throughout the world served peaceful purposes. Kuwait attached great importance to the application of 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East region. It noted with deep regret that, 
although all States in the region were party to the NPT and were committed to the application of its 
provisions, Israel persisted in its refusal to sign the NPT and to place its installations under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards, thereby impeding the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle 
East. Its attitude undermined security and stability in the region and hence also in the world as a 
whole. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 18 
131. The General Conference had adopted a resolution entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ at its 
preceding session and the 2010 NPT Review Conference had adopted a final document in which it 
called for the convening of an international conference in 2012 on the creation of a NWFZ in the 
Middle East. Kuwait supported such important international efforts to achieve the universality of the 
NPT and called on Israel to accede to the Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon State and to place all its 
nuclear installations under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
132. In view of IsraelÂs intransigence, Kuwait supported the submission of a draft resolution entitled 
ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ to the current session of the General Conference and urged Member 
States to adopt the resolution in order to achieve the universality of the NPT and to rid the Middle East 
of nuclear weapons. 
133. Kuwait reaffirmed the inalienable right of all States without distinction to possess and develop 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. In March 2009 it had pledged a sum of $10 million for the 
establishment of a nuclear fuel bank under the AgencyÂs auspices. It supported the continuation of a 
transparent and constructive dialogue aimed at the development of a multilateral approach to the 
nuclear fuel cycle and the establishment of supply assurance mechanisms, including a nuclear fuel 
bank that would serve as a last resort for countries wishing to benefit from such fuel. At the same time, 
Kuwait called on the Director General and the Secretariat to continue studying the proposal and to 
assist in reconciling different views by submitting a further paper on the matter. 
134. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said the General Conference was being held shortly after the 
2010 NPT Review Conference, which had devoted a separate section of its final document to the 
Agency and stressed the importance of increasing its financial resources in order to enhance its 
effectiveness. The Review Conference had also highlighted the AgencyÂs role in promoting peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy and providing technical assistance to States, as well as its role in preventing the 
diversion of nuclear energy for military and other non-peaceful purposes. Furthermore, the Review 
Conference had reaffirmed its 1995 resolution on the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. 
135. There had been a significant increase in global demand for nuclear energy, particularly for 
electricity generation, in the search for sources of energy that could replace or supplement fossil fuels 
that polluted the environment. As a result, attention was again focused on the issue of nuclear safety 
and security, especially in countries that were contemplating the use of nuclear energy for the first 
time. People were becoming increasingly convinced of the need for regional integration of such 
projects in order to minimize the risks involved and spread the benefits more widely. 
136. A long-term solution to the complex problem of nuclear fuel supplies could be found only if a 
number of basic conditions were met. It was important to avoid the hasty imposition of solutions and 
mechanisms that might be viewed as an attempt to deprive developing countries of their right to 
possess enrichment technology. The technical, legal, economic and political dimensions of any 
solution should be discussed and a balance should be struck between the views of all States concerned, 
based on the principle of impartiality and agreement on the objectives to be achieved. A further aim 
was to assure a continuous fuel supply without resorting to political pressure or approaches that were 
incompatible with standards of fairness and equality. 
137. Lebanon commended the Director General on according priority during his first year in office to 
the PACT programme, without of course neglecting other programmes and pressing needs in the areas 
of water resources, food security, agricultural pest control, energy and environmental degradation. 
138. Lebanon was deeply grateful to the Agency for its assistance under the technical cooperation 
programme and for the transparency and assiduity it had displayed in seeking the best possible results. 
His country was, for its part, fully committed to compliance with the AgencyÂs standards and 
guidelines. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 19 
139. Lebanon planned to build a nuclear research reactor in order to develop scientific research on 
nuclear applications, to train human resources and to create an enabling environment for the projects 
planned by most States in the region in the areas of electricity generation, seawater desalination and 
medical treatment. Lebanon had submitted a technical cooperation project under the AgencyÂs 
2012-2013 technical cooperation programme for a feasibility study concerning the building of a 
nuclear research reactor. It was also developing the legal framework required to ensure the safety of all 
peaceful uses of atomic energy, in accordance with the international instruments it had ratified and the 
AgencyÂs regulations and recommendations. 
140. The issue of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities was raised at each session of the General Conference 
and in 2009, for the first time in 20 years, a majority of the Member States had adopted a resolution 
(GC(53)/17) calling on Israel to accede to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards. The Arab States that were members of the Agency had submitted 
a draft resolution containing the same provisions to the current session of the Conference. He hoped 
that it would be adopted by the largest possible majority of Member States so that the Agency would 
again be proved worthy of its statutory mandate, a mandate that had been reaffirmed by the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference. 
141. Lebanon regretted the fact that the Director General had been unable, despite his serious and 
conscientious efforts, to report any progress in implementation of the preceding yearÂs resolution to 
the Board of Governors and the General Conference. Concerns regarding nuclear proliferation would 
therefore persist in the Middle East, and the regionÂs security would remain under threat as long as a 
single State refused to accede to the NPT and possessed nuclear facilities that were not subject to the 
comprehensive safeguards regime. The Evans and Kawaguchi report on eliminating nuclear threats 
had stated that so long as any State had nuclear weapons, others would want them. The peoples of the 
Middle East were dreaming of the day when they could live, like others, in a region free of nuclear 
weapons. It was no secret that the Israeli leaders had admitted on numerous occasions that their 
country possessed nuclear weapons. Moreover, the Evans and Kawaguchi report, which was an 
impartial document, estimated IsraelÂs arsenal at between 60 and 200 weapons. 
142. Lebanon and the other Arab States had reaffirmed a set of basic principles on numerous 
occasions. Thus, the principle of the universality of the NPT constituted a strategic interest for 
humankind as a whole which overrode all political considerations and circumstantial interests. All 
Arab States were party to the NPT and had signed up to the safeguards regime without invoking the 
Arab-Israeli conflict as an excuse to defer compliance with their obligations. Nuclear weapons could 
not be perceived as a means of guaranteeing the security of any party. Otherwise the region would be 
plunged into an unwanted arms race. Non-proliferation efforts should take regional dimensions into 
account, adopting a comprehensive regional approach in order to achieve security for all parties. 
Non-proliferation efforts should also address all aspects of the issue. An approach that fell short of the 
principle of comprehensiveness and universality would obstruct achievement of the goals pursued. 
143. Double standards were the antithesis of law. IsraelÂs intransigence, its repeated threats of war 
and destruction and its encroachment by land, sea and air on the sovereignty of Lebanon rendered it 
unaccountable and a State above international law. Lebanon reiterated its position that the basis for 
protecting international peace and security and for ensuring justice and equality among nations was the 
power of law and not the law of the powerful. International law was a social contract among States 
and should be respected by all. The peoples of the region would be reassured and their belief in such 
principles would be restored when serious international pressure was brought to bear on Israel to 
accede to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. They 
were the two basic steps required to build confidence and to achieve a NWFZ in the Middle East. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 20 
144. Lebanon believed that, in the absence of peace and trust, it was impossible to achieve the 
development to which the world aspired. An effective and goal-oriented partnership between all 
members of the international community would serve as a vehicle to promote the peace and 
development process, a process in which the Agency played a vital role. 
145. Mr MANTICA (Italy) said that there had been a number of important developments in the 
preceding year concerning the Agency. The results of the 2010 NPT Review Conference were 
particularly positive and it was important to build on that success through implementation of the final 
document and the action plan. In that regard, the current General Conference could contribute by 
creating conditions conducive to that end. 
146. His country attached great importance to strengthening the international non-proliferation 
regime, as demonstrated during its G8 presidency in 2009 when the G8 Heads of State and 
Government had adopted the Aquila statement on non-proliferation, which had continued to attract 
interest in 2010. 
147. Nuclear energy development and access to nuclear technology were a right for all Member 
States and one of the fundamental objectives of the AgencyÂs work. However, Italy was concerned 
about recent developments in certain countries. According to the Director GeneralÂs latest report, Iran 
was still failing to observe Security Council resolutions and cooperate with the Agency concerning the 
access and information required to demonstrate the absence of undeclared nuclear material and 
activities in the country. Even though IranÂs right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was 
not being questioned, those problems had to be resolved. 
148. Another matter for concern was the lack of positive developments in the DPRK. In accordance 
with Security Council resolutions, the DPRK must respect its obligations under the NPT and its 
safeguards agreement. The six-party talks were the appropriate framework for resuming dialogue in 
that regard. 
149. The Nuclear Security Summit in Washington and the resulting communiquÃ© and work plan 
demonstrated the growing interest in international cooperation in that field. Although important, the 
application of existing legal documents was not sufficient. It was also important to raise public 
awareness and train staff. Italy was therefore establishing a school for nuclear security, in 
collaboration with the Agency and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste. 
150. Any country developing a nuclear programme had to give absolute priority to the safety of the 
population and workers. In that regard, the AgencyÂs international safety standards served as a primary 
reference for Member States and the services offered by the Agency for their application were 
particularly useful. 
151. Italy supported the AgencyÂs activities to develop nuclear energy applications for scientific and 
medical purposes in the fields of health, food and agriculture, access to energy and water, and 
environmental protection. It encouraged the Agency to continue its collaboration with the FAO and to 
develop the activities of its Marine Environment Laboratories in Monaco as a centre of excellence in 
protection of the marine environment. 
152. The 2010 Scientific Forum on cancer in developing countries, being held in the margins of the 
General Conference, was an important event for strengthening international cooperation in that area. 
PACT was a good example of the results that could be achieved by such efforts and merited support. 
153. He confirmed that, despite financial difficulties, Italy would support the TCF in 2011. The 
technical cooperation programme needed to focus on priority sectors for the development of the 
beneficiary countries. Also, activities should be implemented more efficiently. Human resource 
training and development were a priority if the technical cooperation objectives were to be fully met. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 21 
His country therefore continued to support the AgencyÂs training efforts, regularly receiving 
researchers and scientists from various Member States at its universities and research centres. 
154. It was gratifying that an agreement had been reached on the 2011 budget despite a difficult 
international economic context. Italy, which was about to become a member of the Board of 
Governors, was committed to helping the Agency achieve its statutory objectives, taking into account 
the limited resources available and the need clearly to identify priorities. His country had welcomed 
the Director GeneralÂs announcement regarding the guidelines for the preparation of the 2012Â2013 
programme and budget. Given the current financial difficulties, there was a need to identify 
opportunities for rationalizing costs. 
155. On the national front, over the past year the Italian Government had made progress in its nuclear 
renaissance, establishing an institutional framework for its national nuclear programme. A new 
national authority for nuclear safety and security had been created and its statute approved in July 
2010. Furthermore, Italy had developed a knowledge network in the industrial sector, universities, 
research centres and public authorities, particularly in the fields of nuclear safety and security 
regulation and control, radioactive waste management and the dismantling of nuclear facilities. 
Research related to nuclear power generation remained a priority, as had been highlighted by the 
Ministry of Education, Universities and Research in the 2010Â2012 national programme for research, 
which had just been adopted. At the same time, the authorities were providing information to the 
public about the challenges posed by ItalyÂs return to nuclear power. Debate was under way with a 
view to finding the most appropriate solutions at the local and national level. At the international level, 
the nuclear renaissance had boosted ItalyÂs cooperation with several countries, including France and 
the United States of America. The country hoped to strengthen existing partnerships and develop new 
ones. Also, Italy hoped to benefit from the AgencyÂs expertise and assistance and pledged its 
continuing support to the Agency in the responsible development of nuclear energy around the world. 
156. Mr RÃNAKY (Hungary) said that his country welcomed the current global momentum for 
disarmament and non-proliferation. The action plan adopted by the 2010 NPT Review Conference 
clearly demonstrated renewed international commitment to curbing the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, and Hungary hoped that the General Conference would contribute to that planÂs full 
implementation. 
157. Hungary was concerned that the growing consensus around the ultimate goal of the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons was being offset by overt and covert attempts at the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and missiles by certain countries. Hungary condemned all such attempts 
and urged the parties concerned to cooperate fully with the international community and, if required, 
the Agency, on clarifying those matters. 
158. Climate change and the extreme weather conditions prevailing in most countries put energy 
networks under enormous stress and highlighted the need for a secure energy supply. Hungary 
produced about 40% of its electrical energy using nuclear power and its reliance on nuclear power had 
increased the previous year when parliament had instructed the Government to start preparations for 
the construction of new units at the Paks nuclear power plant site. As a result of that decision in 
principle, the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had revised the countryÂs nuclear safety regulations 
to provide a framework for the regulation of new facilities. 
159. The Paks nuclear power plant had continued to operate safely through power uprates which had 
brought all units to 108% of their previous capacities, and the plant currently provided a total of 2 GW 
power to the grid. 
160. Hungary had continued to share its experience in nuclear safety through project IRA/9/018 to 
train Iranian nuclear safety inspectors for the safe operation of the soon-to-be operational power plant 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 22 
at Bushehr. The project had been funded partly by Norway and had been in full compliance with 
Security Council resolutions. Hungary had thereby demonstrated that it was prepared to cooperate 
with Iran on nuclear activities that were clearly intended for exclusively peaceful purposes. IranÂs 
nuclear programme, and in particular its enrichment of uranium and production of heavy water, were 
nevertheless a source of great concern. Hungary urged Iran to promptly and fully implement all 
relevant Security Council resolutions and return to meaningful negotiations with representatives of the 
international community on outstanding questions regarding its nuclear programme. 
161. The fact that Hungarian nuclear safety, safeguards and security experts were regularly invited to 
take part in Agency expert missions reflected the excellent and longstanding working relationship 
between the Agency and the Hungarian nuclear community, including the regulatory body, operators, 
universities and research institutes. 
162. Hungary had already submitted its national report to the Secretariat for the upcoming fifth 
review meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and commended the 
AgencyÂs work in preparing for that important event. 
163. Hungary attached great importance to the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme and the new 
series of related publications, including the AgencyÂs security fundamentals and its recommendations 
on nuclear materials and nuclear facilities, on radioactive material and associated facilities, and on 
nuclear and radioactive material out of regulatory control. 
164. Recent developments in the Hungarian nuclear power programme Â power uprate, extension of 
service lifetime and planned expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant Â highlighted the importance 
of radioactive waste management. Construction continued on the national radioactive waste repository 
near the village of BÃ¡taapÃ¡ti, where low and intermediate level waste from the Paks nuclear power 
plant could be safely disposed of at intermediate depth in granite host rock. The above-surface part of 
the facility, which had been completed in September 2008 and licensed, had begun receiving waste 
packages for buffer storage. The first underground disposal chambers were being prepared and would 
start receiving containers in 2012. 
165. Hungary continued to take part in the AgencyÂs safeguards support programme, providing 
training for safeguards inspectors and developing and testing new technologies for safeguards. 
166. Significant resources and efforts had recently been dedicated to the establishment and operation 
of the Analytical Laboratory for Nuclear Materials at the Institute of Isotopes, and that laboratory was 
in the process of joining the AgencyÂs Network of Analytical Laboratories. 
167. New cooperative initiatives were anticipated under the Novel Technologies Project, and 
Hungary had already offered to take part in evaluation and field testing of the new hand held laser 
induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) unit. 
168. Hungary highly valued the AgencyÂs work in the area of human health. With Agency assistance, 
cancer therapy centres in the country had been audited, which had helped to highlight the importance 
of quality control in medical diagnostic and treatment processes and the importance of well-trained 
personnel. As a result of the audit, the Budapest University of Technology and Economics had started 
a new masterÂs course in medical physics and there were plans to make it available also in English for 
interested students from abroad. 
169. Hungary appreciated its many years of technical cooperation with the Agency and renewed its 
offer to reciprocate by sharing its experience with other States through the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 23 
170. Hungary strongly supported implementation of the Strategy for the Technical Cooperation 
Programme in the Europe region, believing that it would be successful in fostering fruitful cooperation 
between Member States and the Agency. HungaryÂs CPF, revised in cooperation with the Agency and 
signed in early 2010, reflected the countryÂs commitment to cooperate in numerous fields of 
application of atomic energy and provided a good basis for future cooperation. Hungary continued to 
believe that the cooperation should be mainly through regional projects as well as bilateral projects 
with other Member States. 
171. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had established a nuclear knowledge management 
system in 2009 which was expected to reach full capacity in 2011, and the country greatly appreciated 
the contribution of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme to that project. 
172. As incoming President of the EU, Hungary was following the changes taking place in the 
Agency with special attention. Mr Amano had taken over leadership at a difficult time characterized 
by steadily increasing demand for Agency services and a shortage of available funds due to the 
economic crisis. The steps that the Director General had taken to help the Agency cope with the 
financial difficulties while continuing to foster cooperation among Member States were moving the 
Agency in the right direction, and he assured him of HungaryÂs full support. 
173. Mr COGAN (Ireland) said that his country remained committed to effective multilateralism as 
the best way of upholding the rule of law, ensuring international peace and security and advancing 
international cooperation. The Agency played a vital and unique role in promoting safe, secure and 
peaceful nuclear technologies and the importance of its mission would increase further in the years 
ahead as new demands, technologies and challenges arose. Ireland remained committed to working 
with the Agency and its Member States towards common goals. 
174. The most significant event of the past year for the Agency had been the positive outcome of the 
2010 NPT Review Conference, which offered renewed prospects for realizing the vision of a world 
free of nuclear weapons and underlined again the importance of ensuring the TreatyÂs universality. 
175. The ConferenceÂs final document had strongly reaffirmed the right of States to develop and 
cooperate on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy within the context of the Treaty. At the same time, it 
had emphasized the responsibility of States to ensure that any expansion of the use of nuclear energy 
was done safely, securely and without increasing the risk of proliferation. 
176. For the first time in the history of the NPT, a forward-looking action plan had been agreed 
across its three pillars. The implementation of those plans would be a significant challenge for States 
over the next five years and it underscored the importance of international cooperation and the key 
role of the Agency in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
177. Regarding the Middle East, the NPT parties had recognized the importance of a process leading 
to full implementation of the 1995 resolution that was reinforced by concrete and substantive practical 
steps, including the convening of a conference in 2012. Discussion of Middle East issues at the current 
General Conference should aim to advance implementation of that 1995 resolution and actions must 
be avoided that could damage the positive atmosphere created by the agreement in New York and 
undermine work towards the conference in 2012. 
178. The Agency was a key focal point for strengthening international cooperation on nuclear 
security. Ireland very much welcomed the impetus given to that issue by the Nuclear Security Summit 
held in Washington in April. 
179. The AgencyÂs work on safeguards and verification was more crucial than ever as it underpinned 
international confidence and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was vital that States 
met their obligations in that area and that the Agency had the tools and authority to act effectively and 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 24 
decisively. A comprehensive safeguards agreement with an additional protocol was the necessary 
verification standard, and Ireland encouraged those States that had yet to adopt them to do so without 
delay. 
180. The renovation and expansion of the AgencyÂs laboratories at Seibersdorf Â towards which 
Ireland had also made a modest contribution Â would significantly improve the AgencyÂs verification 
capabilities. 
181. The safeguards regime was facing unprecedented challenges. In May, the NPT States Party had 
underscored the importance of resolving all cases of non-compliance with safeguards obligations, in 
full conformity with the AgencyÂs Statute and StatesÂ legal obligations. 
182. The DPRK must comply unconditionally and without delay with its international obligations 
under the relevant Security Council resolutions and its safeguards agreement and resume full 
cooperation with the Agency. Ireland called on the DPRK to return to the six-party talks immediately 
and without preconditions and urged it to abandon and completely dismantle any nuclear weapons 
related programme in a transparent and irreversible manner. 
183. A matter of ongoing serious concern for his Government was that the Agency remained unable 
to confirm that all nuclear material was in peaceful activities in Iran because that country was not 
providing the necessary cooperation. Iran should take steps towards full implementation of its 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and subsidiary arrangements, as well as relevant resolutions of 
the Board of Governors and the Security Council, and it should work proactively to clarify activities 
with a possible military dimension. Ireland called on Iran to cooperate fully with the Agency and 
implement an additional protocol without delay. 
184. Ireland greatly valued and benefited from its membership of the Agency. Nuclear technology 
would impact daily life in increasingly sophisticated ways in the years ahead; already it was playing an 
essential role in health, agriculture, water management and environmental monitoring. As a result, the 
Agency would be assuming a wider range of roles and facing more complex challenges. 
185. Although it remained IrelandÂs clear policy not to use nuclear energy for electricity generation, 
it fully recognized the sovereign right of each country to decide its own energy mix in keeping with 
international obligations in such areas as safety and environmental protection. 
186. Ireland believed firmly in the benefits of a collective and multilateral approach to safety and 
security and considered that the Agency provided a vital framework for cooperative efforts to build 
and strengthen the international nuclear safety and security regime. 
187. Ireland welcomed and sought to contribute to the culture of learning and continuous 
improvement fostered by the Agency. Safety standards and practices were best supported and 
enhanced by international peer review and the sharing of knowledge, both of which were well served 
by Agency programmes, and by practical assistance to Member States. Such approaches were 
important for nuclear and non-nuclear States alike, and Ireland was pleased to be able to play a 
constructive part in that dialogue as a non-nuclear nation. 
188. Ireland had significant stakeholder interest in the matter of reprocessing and had long been of 
the view that it raised real safety and environmental concerns. Radioactive discharges from 
reprocessing operations into the shared marine environment were of particular concern. His country 
would continue to support the AgencyÂs work in that area aimed at minimizing the risk and 
environmental impact of such activities. 
189. The Medium Term Strategy provided an important opportunity for States to reflect on the 
AgencyÂs future work and ensure its ability to meet the challenges ahead. It was important that it 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 25 
provide strategic vision, practical guidance and clear targets and that it encourage the Agency to 
reform its management so that the available technical, human and financial resources were used as 
effectively and efficiently as possible. 
190. In the same way, technical cooperation, a key element of the AgencyÂs work, had to be 
structured and supported to advance the AgencyÂs mandate. 
191. Ireland, with Agency involvement, continued to seek to advance the dialogue between coastal 
and shipping States with a view to ensuring effective communication between them regarding the 
marine transport of nuclear materials. Attention had recently been given to national and international 
emergency response measures in the unlikely event of an accident. It was clear that complete 
information had to be provided in order for national authorities to perform risk assessments for such 
contingencies. 
192. As the burden on the Agency increased in the years to come, it was incumbent on Member 
States to ensure that it had the political, technical and financial support it needed to carry out its 
responsibilities. It was equally incumbent on the Agency to improve the efficiency, efficacy, 
cost-effectiveness and transparency of its structures and practices. 
193. Ireland appreciated the manner in which the Director General had advanced the AgencyÂs key 
agenda during his first year in office and would continue to support his, and his staffÂs, unstinting 
efforts and professionalism. 
194. Mr RISTORI (European Commission) said that three important events in 2010 Â the 
International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy in Paris, the Nuclear Security Summit in 
Washington and the NPT Review Conference in New York Â had demonstrated political recognition 
of the global trend of renewed interest in the civil use of nuclear energy. Those events and the recent 
nuclear arms reduction agreement between the United States of America and the Russian Federation 
had increased global security and had addressed the main concerns surrounding the use of nuclear 
energy. 
195. Cooperation between the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) and the Agency had 
intensified in recent years. In addition to the traditional cooperation on safeguards, very significant 
progress was being made in nuclear safety, security and radiation protection. All non-nuclear-weapon 
EU Member States had finalized accession to the EU safeguards agreement. Joint efforts by the 
Commission, EU Member States and the Agency had paved the way for the introduction, in early 
2010, of integrated safeguards in all the non-nuclear-weapon EU Member States with significant 
nuclear installations. Furthermore, the Commission supported the AgencyÂs safeguards system with 
over 40 projects. 
196. As regards nuclear safety, the Commission had received strong Agency support in the 
preparation of its directive on the subject, which had been adopted in 2009 with the support of all 
27 EU Member States and the European Parliament, thus making the EU the first major regional actor 
to give legal force to the main international nuclear safety standards, including the AgencyÂs 
Fundamental Safety Principles. At the aforementioned Paris conference, Commission President 
Barroso had called for those international safety standards to be made binding worldwide. In August 
2010 the Commission had submitted, on behalf of Euratom, the 5th Euratom Report for 2011 peer 
review under the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
197. April 2011 would mark the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. Ukraine was still 
working to clean up the Chernobyl site and international solidarity would be essential in order to raise 
the funds needed to complete the major ongoing projects. The successful European 
Commission-IAEA-Ukraine joint project to evaluate the safety of Ukrainian nuclear power plants had 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 26 
provided a wealth of experience to all parties and was a model for similar evaluations in other 
countries. 
198. Reporting on relevant events in the area of nuclear security and non-proliferation, he said that 
the EU was committed to implement fully the results of the recent NPT Review Conference. In that 
context, the Commission invited Iran to cooperate with the international community and become a 
member of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
199. The CommissionÂs Instrument for Stability (IfS) provided the legal basis and funds for 
cooperation in relation to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear risk mitigation. A major 
contribution under that fund was earmarked for the LEU bank proposed by the Agency. 
200. In addition, accession by all EU Member States and Euratom to the amendment to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was progressing well. 
201. In the area of radiation protection, the Commission had undertaken to transpose the 
2007 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) into the 
Euratom basic safety standards legislation, which created an opportunity for consolidation of that 
legislation into a single act. The CommissionÂs proposal for that act was scheduled to be adopted at the 
beginning of 2011. Also, the Commission was actively involved in the revision of the relevant 
international standards in order to ensure consistency and to allow for future co-sponsorship of the 
international standards by Euratom. 
202. Turning to recent developments and challenges for Euratom, he said the importance of nuclear 
energy in the EU could be seen in the fact that about one third of all nuclear power plants in the world 
were in Europe. Those 143 plants generated nearly one third of European electricity and two thirds of 
low-carbon electricity. Nuclear energy was the main source in Europe of low-carbon electricity and 
the most reliable source of baseload electricity. It was therefore a crucial part of EuropeÂs energy mix 
and contributed directly to the three main priorities of European energy policy: security of supply, 
addressing climate change and competitiveness. Earlier in the year, the Commission had put forward 
its Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, which had been endorsed by the 
European Council in June 2010. Energy was one of the key priorities and the Commission was 
preparing a specific EU energy strategy for the period 2011Â2020. The Commission was also 
preparing a new nuclear illustrative programme focusing on the share of nuclear energy that would be 
needed for a sustainable low-carbon energy mix at the EU level and on the associated financial and 
investment issues. 
203. The Commission was working to put in place the most advanced European legal framework for 
nuclear energy. The aforementioned nuclear safety directive would be transposed into national laws by 
July 2011. Following adoption of the directive, Commission President Barroso had announced that by 
the end of the current year there would be a similar initiative on the safe management of spent fuel and 
radioactive waste. In preparing its proposal, the Commission had been using the same concept of 
coordination and cooperation with the Agency as it had for the nuclear safety directive. The 
Commission encouraged non-EU Member States to begin the process of making the basic 
international standards legally binding. 
204. The European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG) was helping the Community to 
achieve its objectives in nuclear safety and the management of radioactive waste and spent fuel. The 
Commission strongly supported ENSREGÂs objectives for the period 2010Â2011, noting in particular 
the GroupÂs commitment to facilitate implementation of the nuclear safety directive and contribute to 
the development of a similar instrument for radioactive waste management. 
GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 27 
205. With the legal initiative on spent fuel and radioactive waste, the EU was aiming to establish a 
comprehensive European legal and regulatory framework to ensure the highest possible levels of 
nuclear safety and security. In that context, close cooperation between Euratom and the Agency was of 
the utmost importance, both within the EU and globally. Joint efforts must continue to improve safety 
and security in the interest of all nations using or intending to use nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
206. The European Nuclear Energy Forum (ENEF) sought to foster broad and constructive 
discussion with all nuclear stakeholders. Its most recent meeting had taken place in May 2010 in 
Bratislava and the next one would be in 2011 in Prague. In the key area of human resources and 
training, ENEF had sparked important initiatives, including the European Nuclear Energy Leadership 
Academy, financed by six European companies, and the European Human Resource Observatory for 
the Nuclear Energy Sector, run by the CommissionÂs Joint Research Centre. The Commission also 
welcomed the recent establishment of the European Nuclear Safety Training and Tutoring Institute, a 
joint initiative of four national technical safety organizations. 
207. The Commission was an active participant in major research and development projects. Under 
its strategic energy technology plan, an industrial initiative would be launched in November to 
develop prototypes of Generation IV fast neutron reactors. 
208. The CommissionÂs sustainable nuclear energy technology platform was enhancing cooperation 
in nuclear research and the same would be done for all aspects of geological disposal. In the same 
vein, key EU Member States had established the MELODI initiative to coordinate national and 
Euratom radiation protection research programmes, particularly in the area of risks from low doses. 
209. In the area of decommissioning, a common understanding had been developed by the 
Commission and EU Member States over the preceding two years for the management of financial 
resources for the safe decommissioning and management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. Also, the 
assistance programme for decommissioning of the Bohunice, Ignalina and Kozloduy nuclear power 
plants was continuing, with the Council extending financial support for Kozloduy until 2013. 
210. A variety of legal regimes co-existed within the EU in the area of nuclear liability, and the 
Commission, in close cooperation with all its external partners including the Agency, was examining 
the implications of such a Âlegal patchworkÂ and possible improvements at the European level. 
211. In August 2010, the Commission had adopted a communication to the European Parliament and 
to the Council on medical applications of ionizing radiation in which steps were proposed to resolve 
the urgent issue of shortages in the production of medical isotopes. In that regard, the Commission 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative on the subject of cancer. 
212. In conclusion, he said that it was important to continue the momentum of the Paris conference, 
the Nuclear Security Summit, and the NPT Review Conference and further raise the level of 
international cooperation. The EU was in a position to help strengthen the NPT regime and contribute 
significantly to developing global nuclear safety and safety culture. 
213. Mr SIRRY (Egypt), exercising his right of reply under Rule 58 of the Rules of Procedure said 
that, in his statement the preceding day, the representative of Israel had referred repeatedly to Egypt.2 
He had expressed the view that Egypt had apparently lost interest in what he called the ÂconversionÂ 
of the Middle East into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. He must be the only delegate to hold that view 
because, unlike Israel, which was widely known to pay no more than lip service to the objective of a 
___________________

GC(54)/OR.5 
22 September 2010, Page 28 
nuclear-weapon-free Middle East, EgyptÂs consistent efforts, as well as the concrete and tangible steps 
it had taken over the years Â and continued to take, were extensively and well documented. 
214. The representative of Israel had also stated that, for Egypt, the singling out of Israel had been set 
as a principal goal. It was not anything that Egypt had said or done that had caused Israel to be singled 
out in the Middle East. Rather it was through its own deliberate choice to remain the only State in the 
region to continue to operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, to reject the NPT and consider 
accession to it as being Âagainst its best national interestÂ that Israel had chosen to single itself out. 
215. The representative of Israel had further referred to the fact that Egypt had not ratified the 
Pelindaba Treaty. On that particular count, he was Â for a change Â correct. Egypt was only a 
signatory State. What the representative of Israel had conveniently omitted to mention, however, were 
the following three important and very salient facts. First, Egypt had been entrusted with hosting the 
signing ceremony of the Pelindaba Treaty in Cairo in 1996. Second, the very text of the Treaty 
stipulated that Âthe establishment of other NWFZs, especially in the Middle East, would enhance the 
security of States Parties to the African NWFZÂ. And, third, the African Group itself clearly 
recognized that, while the Pelindaba Treaty had entered into force on 15 July 2009, there remained a 
need to create the necessary conditions for other African countries to ratify that important Treaty. 
216. The representative of Israel had also referred to Egypt in connection with the Safeguards 
Implementation Report for 2009. He had done so in a manner that demonstrated clearly that he had 
either not read or understood the Report. Furthermore, and bearing in mind that the Safeguards 
Implementation Report had been only partially derestricted, the representative of IsraelÂs reference to 
it in a public meeting had clearly incriminated his country as one of the culprits in the continuing saga 
of leakages of confidential information, mostly targeting States of the Middle East, that had plagued 
the Agency for years. 
217. Finally, his delegation had taken note of the repeated claim by Israel that it had always 
demonstrated a responsible policy of restraint in the nuclear domain. The question begged was: What 
exactly was Israel restraining itself from doing? Beyond IsraelÂs feeble attempt to question EgyptÂs 
steadfast commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, the remarks made by the 
representative of Israel had served only to demonstrate the full meaning of the word ÂchutzpahÂ.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 (continued) 
(GC(54)/4) 
1. Mr KAHUURE (Namibia) said that the NPT remained the most viable instrument for achieving 
a world free from nuclear weapons and all its three pillars Â disarmament, non-proliferation and the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy Â were equally important. Nuclear-weapon-free zones helped to foster 
regional peace and security and his country looked forward to the establishment of such a zone in the 
Middle East. Namibia, for its part, had demonstrated its commitment to furthering the AgencyÂs 
safeguards and verification objectives by signing all relevant instruments including the NPT, a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, the latter of which should be ratified 
shortly. 
2. The inalienable right of all countries to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes 
should be respected and all Member States must be given the opportunity to utilize nuclear technology 
for peaceful purposes. Namibia commended the AgencyÂs efforts to help developing countries use 
nuclear technology for their socio-economic development. Under its national development agenda, 
Namibia was seeking to achieve industrialization through the full utilization of its natural and human 
resources, including uranium mining. He noted with satisfaction that, under his countryÂs CPF, nuclear 
technology would make a meaningful contribution to that agenda and the strategies to achieve its 
objectives. Those strategies included the provision of appropriate education and affordable health care, 
building of industries in all sectors of the economy in order to add value to natural resources and 
diversify the economy, and the maintenance of stable, productive and diverse ecosystems. In 
conformity with its strategic objectives, Namibia had proposed that its technical cooperation 
programme for 2011Â2012 should focus on key areas such as human resources development, health 
care, energy and food security. As skilled human resources were essential for the successful 
development and implementation of the technical cooperation programme, his country was proposing 
the training of a core number of professionals, as well as capacity building at higher education 
establishments, with a view to sustaining human resources capabilities in the area of nuclear 
technology. 
3. Namibia was a major supplier of uranium, supporting the industries and economies of many 
countries around the world. It hoped to be able to participate in other high-value parts of the nuclear 
fuel cycle apart from just mining with a view to accelerating its economic growth. He called on the 
Secretariat to support his countryÂs proposals and provide the necessary guidance. 
4. Noting that cancer killed more people than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, he 
said that his country had proposed a national cancer control programme that would adopt an integrated 
approach to cancer management, including nuclear medicine and radiation therapy. He commended 
the work of PACT and expressed the hope that it would foster the achievement of important 
milestones with regard to cancer management in Namibia. 
5. Namibia was an arid country and water resources management and food security were important 
priorities, as was animal health. Given the prevailing climatic conditions, the challenge was to ensure 
sustainable utilization of available water resources, and the development and adoption of improved 
soil, water and nutrient management practices to support crop production and enhanced yields. He 
called on the Agency to ensure that the role of nuclear technology in those areas was maintained and 
strengthened. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 2 
6. His country was committed to ensuring that an effective and efficient regulatory framework was 
in place to protect people and the environment against the harmful effects of nuclear technology. The 
Atomic Energy and Radiation Protection Act served as the basis for regulation of all activities 
involving the use of devices generating radiation, and of radioactive and nuclear material. Efforts had 
been made over the preceding year to establish and staff the regulatory authority. The challenge was to 
ensure that the law was responsive to emerging needs. His Government had already launched 
initiatives to develop the national policy and legislative framework to address the challenges 
associated with the uranium exploration, mining and milling industry. 
7. With regard to the Director GeneralÂs report on measures to strengthen international cooperation 
in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety contained in document GC(54)/8, he said that Namibia 
supported the initiatives to assist Member States in strengthening the effectiveness and sustainability 
of regulatory programmes, build capacity in Member States embarking on the development of a 
nuclear power programme, and facilitate regulatory networking to improve safety performance 
through the sharing of experience. 
8. Finally, he noted that the invitations to the Director General and the Deputy Director General 
for Technical Cooperation to visit Namibia remained valid and his country hoped to welcome them in 
the near future. 
9. Mr PARVEZ (Pakistan) said that the AgencyÂs unique role as the worldÂs focal point for 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology was assuming greater significance in the wake of 
the global surge of countries wishing to embark on a nuclear power programme. That posed a variety 
of challenges to the Agency in terms of the use of its resources, particularly as most such countries 
looked to the Agency for guidance and support. His country, which had benefited immensely from the 
expertise made available by the Agency in the form of expert missions under such mechanisms as 
OSART and ASSET, and through its technical cooperation programme, valued highly its interaction 
with the Agency. 
10. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had brought tangible benefits to many 
developing Member States in the area of peaceful applications of nuclear technology. Its assistance in 
human resources development and capacity building had ensured the impact and sustainability of the 
programme. Pakistan strongly supported the AgencyÂs efforts to make the technical cooperation 
programme even more useful and more compatible with the changing and growing requirements of 
Member States, against the odds of resource constraints. 
11. In light of the renewed interest in nuclear power, it was important not to underestimate the 
importance of the safe operation of nuclear power plants. The AgencyÂs safety standards and 
guidelines were of great value to Member States in that regard, most especially developing countries 
which might not have the resources or expertise to develop such systems independently. 
12. The Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington in 2010 had focused attention on nuclear 
security issues, another area in which the Agency played an important role in assisting Member States. 
13. Pakistan had established a strong safety and security infrastructure, including the establishment 
of an independent regulatory authority Â the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority Â in the year 
2000. In addition, it was party to several relevant international conventions and participated actively in 
the nuclear safety and security activities and programmes of the Agency, including the Nuclear 
Security Plan. Also, it was contributing to such Agency databases as the illicit trafficking database, the 
International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale and the International Reporting System for 
Operating Experience.

14. The AgencyÂs verification responsibilities had been growing in significance. Striking a balance 
between the organizationÂs role as a promoter of nuclear energy and its responsibility as the Ânuclear 
watchdogÂ was a veritable challenge in view of the large number of countries aspiring to use nuclear 
energy and the AgencyÂs limited resources. Pakistan hoped that the Agency would continue to 
maintain is principle-based role, assisting Member States on an equitable and non-discriminatory basis 
in line with its Statute. 
15. Recently, his country had been hit by devastating floods affecting not only the lives of more 
than 20 million people, but also the logistics and economic infrastructure of the entire country. The 
countryÂs nuclear power plants had kept operating at full power throughout that major catastrophe. 
16. Against the backdrop of limited indigenous energy resources, Pakistan had long been a strong 
advocate of building nuclear power plants. In 1965, when it had embarked on its first commercial 
plant, it had been the 15th country in the world and only the second developing country to start a 
nuclear power programme. That plant, the Karachi nuclear power plant, had come on line in 
1972. Unit 1 of the second, the Chashma nuclear power plant, built by the China National Nuclear 
Corporation, had come on line in 2000 and had just celebrated 10 years of safe and successful 
operation. Unit 2, again built by China under a long-term agreement between the two countries, would 
be commissioned in 2011. 
17. Pakistan now had more than 45 years of safe reactor operating experience, as well as the 
technical and engineering infrastructure to maintain, and provide technical support to its plants. That, 
coupled with its know-how in the areas of manpower development, energy planning, reactor siting, 
safety analysis, and out-of-core as well as in-core fuel management, and the existence of an 
independent and well developed regulatory regime, provided the necessary ingredients for a 
sustainable nuclear power programme. 
18. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission had been participating in INPRO since its inception. 
It congratulated the Agency on the 10th anniversary of that very valuable programme. 
19. The Commission had been given a mandate by the Government of Pakistan to install 
8800 MW(e) of nuclear power capacity by 2030 to alleviate the countryÂs energy shortfall and to 
support its socio-economic development. 
20. In addition to nuclear power, Pakistan had focused on the application of ionizing radiation and 
radioisotopes in the fields of health, agriculture and industry. The Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission was currently managing 14 nuclear medical centres across the country, catering for some 
half a million patients every year, mostly free of charge. Another 4 such centres were under 
construction. 
21. Taking advantage of Agency-sponsored programmes, a campaign had been launched in his 
country to raise awareness about cancer. The Commission planned to build on the upcoming 
international breast cancer awareness month in October 2010 Â which included the global 
mammogram day Â as part of that campaign. 
22. The Commission used its research reactor to produce most of the radioisotopes required for the 
medical centres in the country. A molybdenum production facility had recently been commissioned. 
That facility would not only meet domestic requirements, but would also have spare capacity for 
export to other countries. 
23. Based on its sizeable nuclear power programme, well trained experts and accumulated 
experience in power generation, health, medicine, agriculture, biotechnology and industrial 
applications, Pakistan was now poised to share its knowledge and expertise with newcomer Member 
States via training placements and expert missions. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 4 
24. The relationship between the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the Agency, both of 
which had been established at about the same time, was founded on mutual respect and cooperation. 
Pakistan looked forward to that relationship growing even stronger in the future. 
25. The AgencyÂs admirable record in terms of outreach was due in large measure to its leadership, 
the efficiency of its Secretariat and the work of its Policy-Making Organs. The entry into force of the 
amendment to Article VI of the Statute, once it was ratified by the required number of States, would 
enhance the representative character of the Board of Governors and thus contribute to making the 
Agency even more effective. 
26. Ms GOICHOCEA ESTENOZ (Cuba) said that her country recognized and supported the 
AgencyÂs important role in promoting peace and sustainable development. The application of nuclear 
techniques helped significantly to mitigate soil deterioration, desertification, climate change and other 
natural phenomena that impinged on food production and human life. 
27. Cuba attached the highest priority to cooperation among developing countries. Thus, it was 
pleased that ARCAL was celebrating its 25th anniversary and congratulated the Secretariat on the 
results achieved in implementing the action plan for the strategic alliance between ARCAL and the 
Agency. 
28. Her country attached special importance to Agency technical cooperation because it was 
essential to the promotion of nuclear technologies in developing countries. CubaÂs commitment to that 
activity was demonstrated, inter alia, through its strict compliance with its obligations under the 
technical cooperation programme, attaining in 2009 a project implementation rate of 85%, which was 
above the regional average; through its participation in CRPs, with Cuban researchers having 
participated in 29 research contracts in 2009; and through its timely and full discharge of its financial 
obligations to the TCF, including all of its NPCs. In addition, in 2009 it had contributed the euro 
equivalent of US $800 000 towards the shared cost of procuring a SPECT-CT system under project 
CUB/6/018. 
29. The unjust economic, commercial and financial blockade which had been imposed on Cuba by 
the United States of America for more than 50 years was having an adverse impact on the AgencyÂs 
promotional activities on the island and contravened not only the AgencyÂs Statute but also the Charter 
of the United Nations and international law. The new United States Government, despite its promises, 
had brought no essential changes to the illegal blockade policy and CubaÂs economic losses were 
estimated, conservatively, at more than $1154 million at current prices. Other examples of the 
negative impact of the blockade for the Agency included the difficulties it encountered in purchasing 
specialized equipment from United States companies and in obtaining visas for Cuban nationals to 
participate in training organized in the United States. Another area affected was the implementation of 
cancer-related projects, which was an Agency priority under the new Director General. Her country 
acknowledged the SecretariatÂs ongoing efforts to find alternatives and solutions, noting with 
satisfaction the nuclear and radiation safety activities carried out by the Agency in 2009. She 
highlighted in particular its efforts to ensure the safe use of radiation sources through strengthening of 
infrastructure for national radiation and transport safety, radioactive waste management and 
emergencies. 
30. Cuba assigned appreciable human and material resources to nuclear safety. It also contributed to 
that field in the Latin America and the Caribbean region through the organization of regional activities 
and projects and by making its radiation protection experts and services available. As a member of the 
Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, it took an active part in 
projects in the medical field. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 5 
31. Her country welcomed the approval in 2009 of the Nuclear Security Plan and urged the 
Secretariat to implement it in accordance with the specific requirements of each Member State. In that 
context, she underlined the support provided to her country by the Office of Nuclear Security. 
32. Cuba was a staunch supporter of the Agency as an international leader in the field of nuclear 
security. In view of its global impact, the issue of nuclear security should be approached in an 
inclusive way and it required generally accepted solutions. As a consequence, her country recognized 
only documents of a universal nature promoted by or under the legal auspices of the Agency. 
33. She welcomed the fact that, despite the financial crisis, more than 60 countries Â many of them 
developing countries Â had expressed an interest in including nuclear power as an option for 
sustainable energy development. 
34. Cuba endorsed the statement made recently to the Board of Governors on behalf of the NAM 
and the Group of 77 and China on the issue of nuclear fuel supply assurances2. Any analysis of that 
crucial matter should be inclusive and transparent and related decisions should be agreed by 
consensus. Her country rejected any attempt to use the supply of nuclear fuel as a means of political or 
economic coercion, as a means of discrimination or as a mechanism for preserving the monopoly of a 
few. 
35. Her country was pleased that the Agency had once again concluded that it had complied strictly 
with its safeguards obligations, confirming that the country had no undeclared nuclear material or 
activities. 
36. She reaffirmed CubaÂs support for and acknowledgement of the Agency as the sole competent 
authority for nuclear verification, which activity must be carried out objectively on the basis of 
technical criteria in line with the requirements of the AgencyÂs Statute and the principles enshrined in 
the Charter of the United Nations. The Agency should promote peace and international cooperation 
with a view to achieving global disarmament. 
37. The climate of lack of confidence that had arisen with respect to the AgencyÂs verification 
activities in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic, as a result of geopolitical 
interests and double standards, was a cause for deep concern. Verification activities should, above all, 
respect the sovereignty and national interests of the Member States, and Agency inspectors and staff 
should act with impartiality and professionalism and not be subject to any pressure. She called on the 
Secretariat to continue its efforts to foster a climate of understanding, impartiality, confidence and 
transparency in which a solution could be found once and for all to the safeguards issues under 
consideration by the Board of Governors and the General Conference. Cuba supported the Director 
GeneralÂs efforts to facilitate the supply of fuel for the Tehran research reactor, based on the 
agreement signed by Brazil and Turkey with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and it urged the Vienna 
Group to respond positively to that proposal. It also supported denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula through a negotiated solution. The elimination and total prohibition of nuclear weapons, and 
the threat they posed, was the only guarantee for human survival. 
38. In that context, she referred to NAMÂs proposed action plan Â submitted at the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference Â to eliminate and prohibit nuclear weapons by 2025 at the latest. That plan had 
not been supported by the nuclear powers or by other developed countries that, paradoxically, 
proclaimed themselves to be champions of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

39. Cuba was confident that the Director General would continue his efforts to implement fully the 
mandates conferred upon him by the Board of Governors and the General Conference concerning the 
application of comprehensive safeguards in the Middle East and Israeli nuclear capabilities. Her 
country supported the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and the 
convening of an international conference for that purpose in 2012, which had been approved by the 
2010 NPT Review Conference, represented an important step in that direction. 
40. Her country urged Israel to accede to the NPT without delay and without conditions. 
Furthermore, Israel should place all its nuclear installations under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
The United States Government, if it was truly sincere in its commitment to nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation, should be at the vanguard of that demand. 
41. Humankind stood at a crucial juncture in its history and its survival was at stake. Fidel Castro, 
the leader of the Cuban revolution, had referred on numerous occasions to those dangers and the need 
to ward them off through the application of responsible policies that saved lives, reassigned the 
enormous resources spent on arms to economic and social development and, in particular, led to 
nuclear disarmament and the prevention of war. 
42. In conclusion, she quoted the words of Fidel Castro at the 1996 World Food Summit: ÂMay the 
truth reign and not hypocrisy and lies. Let us be aware that in this world hegemony, arrogance and 
egotism must end. The bells that toll today for those who are dying of hunger every day will toll 
tomorrow for all of humanity if it did not want to, did not know how to, or was not able to be 
sufficiently wise to save itself from itself.Â 
43. Mr BERNHARD (Denmark) said his country had been pleased with the successful conduct of 
the NPT Review Conference earlier in the year and its final document. He urged all States to make 
implementation of the action plan contained therein a priority, with a view to promoting international 
disarmament and non-proliferation, and thus peace and security. It was also important to avoid any 
steps that might jeopardize that work. 
44. The Agency would continue to play a central role in the worldÂs efforts to prevent nuclear 
proliferation. With its highly professional and dedicated staff and its inspection procedures, the 
Agency verified the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and offered essential assurances in that 
regard. Through full cooperation with the Agency, its Member States were given the opportunity to 
clear themselves of any suspicion of wrongdoing. As experience showed, however, the Agency needed 
to have the necessary tools in place for it to carry out that role effectively. Denmark was convinced 
that a comprehensive safeguards agreement in combination with an additional protocol constituted the 
modern verification standard under the NPT. It called for universal accession to and implementation of 
both instruments. 
45. The United Nations Security Council also had a key responsibility with respect to 
non-proliferation. Denmark welcomed the adoption of Security Council resolution 1887 (2009) and 
continued to support resolution 1540 (2004), whose adoption had marked a fundamental step forward 
in that regard. The Security Council had also adopted a number of country-specific resolutions with 
the aim of upholding the integrity and efficiency of the non-proliferation regime. It was essential that 
all countries concerned implemented in full the respective resolutions on the DPRK and Iran. 
46. With regard to Iran, his country shared the serious concern expressed in a succession of reports 
by the Director General over IranÂs failure to extend to the Agency the necessary cooperation to allow 
it to confirm that all nuclear material in the country was in peaceful activities, and to dispel doubts 
about possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme. Denmark urged Iran to comply fully 
with all relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the Board of Governors, and with its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 7 
47. Denmark also shared the AgencyÂs concern about SyriaÂs failure to cooperate with the Agency 
sufficiently to allow the Agency to make progress in resolving the outstanding issues surrounding the 
peaceful nature of that countryÂs nuclear programme. It joined the Director General in urging Syria to 
bring into force an additional protocol in order to facilitate the AgencyÂs work in verifying the 
completeness and correctness of that countryÂs declarations. 
48. His country was very concerned that the Agency was not being permitted to fulfil its mandate 
with respect to the DPRK. It strongly supported the calls on the DPRK to comply with its international 
obligations and to allow an early return of Agency inspectors. 
49. Denmark highly valued the AgencyÂs work in the sphere of nuclear security. The 2010 Nuclear 
Security Summit had demonstrated the increasing need for protection against nuclear terrorism and 
other malicious acts involving nuclear material. Denmark welcomed the work plan adopted at the 
Summit and would strive to make its own contribution to the promotion of global security. 
50. Once again, his country was glad to have been able to contribute to the Nuclear Security Fund 
and he expressed his countryÂs commitment to ensuring that the Fund had sufficient resources to step 
up its work to help all Member States to protect themselves and each other against nuclear terrorism. 
Denmark was also pleased that the AgencyÂs budgets for 2010 and 2011 had moved in the right 
direction in that regard. 
51. Earlier in the year, Denmark had ratified the amendment to the CPPNM and hoped for its early 
entry into force. In general, his country was keen to increase its involvement in that important field. 
52. Turning to the issue of peaceful uses of nuclear technology, his country had taken the decision 
that nuclear power should not be included in its energy mix because it did not consider it to be a 
sustainable form of energy. While it was thus not in favour of a promotional role for the Agency in the 
field of nuclear power, it did respect the choice of other Member States and the AgencyÂs statutory 
obligations in that regard. Also, it recognized the interest of an increasing number of States in 
introducing nuclear power and, in that regard, set a high value on the AgencyÂs contribution to 
ensuring that progress in that direction was made under the best safety, security and non-proliferation 
conditions. 
53. His country had followed with interest the discussions which had taken place both in Vienna 
and at the 2010 NPT Review Conference on multilateral assurances of nuclear fuel supply and it had 
come to the conclusion that such assurances could have important advantages in terms of 
non-proliferation in view of the growing demand for nuclear power. Denmark, together with its 
European Union partners, was therefore ready to support a multilateral proliferation-safe mechanism 
for assurance of nuclear fuel supply for those States which had chosen the nuclear power option. For 
that reason, it had supported the Russian FederationÂs initiative to establish a physical reserve of LEU 
in Angarsk. While recognizing that some Member States still had concerns about the implications of 
such mechanisms, Denmark believed that the time had come to try to address concerns and solve 
problems through the practical implementation of a specific project. It hoped that the Board of 
Governors, on which it was currently serving, would soon come to a positive decision regarding the 
proposal to set up an IAEA LEU bank. 
54. Reaffirming his countryÂs appreciation for the AgencyÂs work in the field of nuclear safety and 
technical cooperation, he noted that Denmark had again pledged in full its share of the TCF target. It 
was highly relevant that the Director General had chosen to focus on fighting cancer in developing 
countries. With regard to safety, Denmark was looking forward to hosting an Agency workshop on 
safety assessment for decommissioning in October, and to sharing its experience in the field with 
interested Member States. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 8 
55. The world would continue to rely on the Agency for expertise and support in all its fields of 
activity. Denmark was grateful to the Director General and his staff for their invaluable contribution to 
building a safer and more prosperous world. 
56. Mr HERNÃNDEZ GARCÃA (Spain) said that one of the priorities of his GovernmentÂs foreign 
policy was to help strengthen the non-proliferation regime, one fruit of which was the Spanish 
safeguards support programme. 
57. He commended the Director General and Secretariat for their impartiality and professionalism 
in clarifying the nature of IranÂs past nuclear programme and expressed appreciation for their 
persistence in verifying that countryÂs declared activities and ensuring compliance with its obligations 
under its comprehensive safeguards agreement. Spain joined others in calling on the Iranian authorities 
to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions, display greater transparency, cooperate 
with the Agency and apply the additional protocol in order to rebuild international confidence in the 
peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. 
58. His country was concerned at the dangerous path taken by the DPRK and urged that country to 
return to the six-party talks, comply with Security Council resolutions, return to the NPT, allow the 
return of Agency inspectors, halt its plutonium reprocessing activities, and abstain from any other 
activities that increased tension in the region. 
59. Spain thanked the Director General for the information he had provided in his latest report on 
SyriaÂs willingness to cooperate with the Agency regarding previously unreported uranium conversion 
and irradiation activities at the miniature neutron source reactor in Damascus, and its additional 
explanations regarding the presence of natural uranium particles. Syria should continue cooperating 
fully with the Agency to rebuild the international communityÂs confidence in the exclusively peaceful 
nature of its nuclear programme. 
60. The Spanish authorities believed that the most effective way of responding to the threat of 
nuclear proliferation was the rapid and universal entry into force of the additional protocol. It was 
therefore cause for concern that Â 13 years after the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol Â 
92 States were still not applying it and 18 NPT State Parties had not yet even concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements. The Agency needed to maintain its efforts to achieve the swift 
universalization of those instruments. However, Spain appreciated the fact that the Agency was 
already applying integrated safeguards in 36 States, with the aim of extending their application to all 
States with additional protocols and comprehensive safeguards agreements in force. The human and 
financial resources that could be saved as a result were especially important in times of budgetary 
constraints. The joint declaration signed by the Agency and the European Commission in January 
2010, announcing the conclusion of arrangements to apply integrated safeguards in all European 
Union non-nuclear-weapon States with nuclear activities, showed the importance the European Union 
attached to strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
61. The Spanish authorities continued to support the activities of the Department of Nuclear Safety 
and Security aimed at improving the security of nuclear facilities and material and high-activity 
radioactive sources. Their support for the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013 was demonstrated by their 
major contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
62. Spain also attached special importance to the correct functioning of an integrated national 
system to ensure security in the nuclear industry and nuclear activities, and prevent illicit trafficking in 
and improper use of nuclear and radioactive material. It would continue to work together with the 
institutions of other Member States through the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. At the 
latest Plenary Meeting of the Initiative, Spain had assumed leadership of the group that would prepare 
the work plan and coordinate all activities of a technical nature. One of its main priorities in that 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 9 
regard was to develop flexible mechanisms for coordination with the Agency to avoid duplication and 
promote synergy among all international stakeholders in combating nuclear terrorism. 
63. In its important work to promote the development of safety standards in Member States, the 
Agency had the support of SpainÂs Nuclear Safety Council, which dedicated part of its extrabudgetary 
contribution to translating proposed Agency standards into Spanish. 
64. Spain welcomed the progress that had been made in negotiating an agreement between the 
Agency and the European Union to improve cooperation on peer reviews using IRRS missions as a 
model, the details of which would be presented at an international conference to be held in Brussels in 
June 2011 under the presidency of the Nuclear Safety Council. 
65. The latter collaborated fully with the Agency in implementing such missions and would be 
holding a workshop on design basis threat in October 2010 to share best international practices, in 
accordance with the commitments it had undertaken following the IRRS mission in 2008. At the start 
of 2011, it would receive a follow-up mission to review compliance with the recommendations and 
suggestions of that mission. 
66. The Nuclear Safety Council worked with the regulatory bodies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
Cuba, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay within the framework of the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological 
and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, which promoted a high level of safety in the region and benefited 
from the AgencyÂs valuable assistance. 
67. Spain had also continued to provide financial and technical support to technical cooperation 
programmes to strengthen the regulatory structures in the countries of North Africa. In November 
2009, the Nuclear Safety Council, together with the Agency, had organized a workshop on regulatory 
practices for experts from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. 
68. The Council had celebrated its 30th anniversary in June 2010 and thanked the AgencyÂs 
Director General for his participation in the commemorative activities. 
69. Spain recognized the importance of technical cooperation and supported the conclusions of the 
study on the Millennium Development Goals performed by the Department of Technical Cooperation. 
It also applauded the Director GeneralÂs decision to assign high priority in 2010 to PACT, to which it 
had made significant financial contributions. Spain paid its TCF target in full and contributed 
additional extrabudgetary funding to projects in Latin America and North Africa, providing experts for 
specific missions, offering training courses and subsidizing and hosting fellowships and scientific 
visits to companies in the nuclear sector, in particular the Research Centre for Energy, Environment 
and Technology (CIEMAT). In that connection, he paid tribute to Mr Juan Antonio Rubio, the 
Director General of CIEMAT, who had recently passed away and who had enthusiastically promoted 
cooperation activities with the Agency under ARCAL. 
70. With regard to the preparation of the programme and budget for 2012Â2013 and the Medium 
Term Strategy 2012Â2017, in view of the budgetary constraints caused by the serious economic and 
financial crisis Spain advocated zero growth in the budgets of all international organizations in the 
United Nations system, including the Agency. Any discussions should therefore focus on where cuts 
could be made while still ensuring compliance with the AgencyÂs statutory objectives, using the 
2011 budget as a reference. The Spanish authorities also reiterated their offer of support to the 
Director General in launching the long anticipated reform of management procedures. 
71. Nuclear power continued to play an important role in Spain. The country had eight nuclear 
power units in operation with an installed capacity of 7728 MW, representing 7.85% of the total 
installed capacity for electricity generation. In 2009, gross electricity generation from nuclear power 
had been 52 890 GWÂ·h, which was 17.6% of all electricity generated nationally. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 10 
72. Work on selecting a location in Spain for a centralized temporary storage facility for spent fuel 
and high-level waste was still ongoing. The public was being kept informed of progress via a special 
website. Once the Government had received a report on the proposals from an interministerial 
commission set up for that purpose, it would choose one of the eight proposed locations for the facility 
and its associated technological centre. 
73. Mr BAYER (Turkey), summarizing recent developments in the nuclear energy field in his 
country, said energy demand in his country was projected to double in fifteen years. Ensuring secure, 
reliable, affordable and environmentally sustainable energy was the core of TurkeyÂs energy policy, 
and a well balanced energy portfolio was key to improving the security and sustainability of the 
energy sector. It was a policy priority for his country to include nuclear energy in its energy mix, to 
meet growing electricity demand while avoiding increasing dependence on imported fuels and adverse 
impact on the environment. To that end, Turkey had concluded an agreement with the Russian 
Federation for the construction of four WWER-1200 reactors at the already licensed Akkuyu nuclear 
site. In addition, an agreement was being negotiated between the Turkish nuclear authorities, the 
nuclear authorities of the Republic of Korea and companies for the construction of nuclear power 
plants with a total capacity of 5000 MW(e) at the Sinop nuclear site, at which location detailed 
investigations were still being performed. His country therefore expected to have an installed nuclear 
capacity of at least 10 000 MW(e) by the year 2030. 
74. Turkey was also enhancing its human resources and nuclear knowledge capacity and updating 
its existing nuclear legislation, taking into consideration the AgencyÂs latest safety standards. A draft 
nuclear law reorganizing the existing nuclear regulatory infrastructure and a number of new or revised 
supporting nuclear safety regulations were also being approved. 
75. Construction of a proton accelerator facility Â the first of its kind in Turkey Â had begun in 
February 2010 at the SaraykÃ¶y Nuclear Research and Training Centre of the Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority and would be completed by the end of the year. 
76. The AgencyÂs nuclear applications assistance to developing countries made a direct contribution 
to human well-being and helped build broad support for the Agency and its energy, safety, security, 
and non-proliferation missions. For Member States with no nuclear power reactors, i.e. the majority, 
technical cooperation in applications of nuclear techniques in agriculture, human health, industry, 
environment, hydrology, or biological and physical research was a primary benefit of membership in 
the Agency. Those programmes were therefore crucial to making the Agency relevant to the entire 
human family. 
77. Strengthening the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities would substantially increase the 
quality of life throughout the world, particularly in developing countries and in LDCs. 
78. Turkey had always strongly supported the AgencyÂs promotional activities and its technical 
cooperation programme, the funding of which it considered to be the shared responsibility of all 
Member States. Turkey had been a non-user of Agency technical cooperation funds for the period 
2009Â2011 and had financially supported projects in partner countries such as Kazakhstan and 
Tajikistan. 
79. Member States should continue to provide the Agency with adequate resources through the 
Regular Budget so that it could conduct its statutory functions properly and effectively. In light of the 
AgencyÂs urgent needs in the near future, Turkey would continue to support all reasonable, balanced 
and affordable budget increases. 
80. The NPT regime was founded on a bargain that rested on the three pillars of nuclear 
disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 11 
energy. Those three pillars deserved equal attention from all State Parties, nuclear-weapon and 
non-nuclear-weapon States alike. 
81. Non-proliferation and disarmament were mutually reinforcing and his country would continue 
to spare no effort to promote issues of key importance for the long-term sustainability of the NPT, 
including universalization of the Treaty, further reduction of nuclear weapons and strengthening of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. Those steps, together with the additional protocol, should be regarded as 
the current universal verification standard. 
82. Universalization of the additional protocol would strengthen the non-proliferation regime, 
increase security throughout the world and, most importantly, significantly increase confidence, 
allowing international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to reach its full potential. 
83. Turkey was concerned that 93 States still had no additional protocol and that, of those, 19 had 
still not brought into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency pursuant to the 
NPT. It called upon those States to sign, ratify and implement comprehensive safeguards agreements 
and additional protocols without delay. 
84. It should be remembered that the NPT assigned responsibilities not only to non-nuclear-weapon 
States; it also placed important obligations (e.g. under Article VI) on the nuclear-weapon States. 
Turkey understood the ultimate goal of the NPT to be a world without nuclear weapons, and efforts 
aimed at non-proliferation should therefore be accompanied by efforts aimed at disarmament. Turkey 
applauded the recent developments in nuclear disarmament, in particular the New START agreement 
signed by the Russian Federation and the United States. It looked forward to rapid progress and 
concrete outcomes in connection with that agreement and called upon the other nuclear-weapon States 
to take similar steps to fulfil their obligations under Article VI of the NPT. 
85. In his countryÂs view, the Agency should have a mandate for the verification of disarmament 
activities. Concrete efforts toward nuclear disarmament were very important to encourage 
non-nuclear-weapon States to accept and implement a strengthened safeguards system. 
86. Meanwhile, the existence of non-NPT States with nuclear weapons programmes was 
dangerously undermining the global safeguards system and the NPT and Turkey called on those States 
to sign the NPT and eliminate totally their military nuclear capabilities and programmes as soon as 
possible. 
87. Turkey was fully committed to the objectives of the NPT based on its three mutually reinforcing 
pillars which, in its view, were of equal importance and should be addressed holistically. It thus 
welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and the unanimous adoption 
of a balanced and comprehensive final document with a forward-looking approach on each of the 
TreatyÂs three pillars. In particular, it welcomed the final documentÂs reaffirmation of the importance 
of full and effective implementation of the Treaty and the commitment to reduce and eventually to 
eliminate nuclear weapons; and the reaffirmation of State PartiesÂ commitment to implement 
effectively the decisions and resolutions of previous Review Conferences, including the right of all 
State Parties to develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without 
discrimination and in conformity with the relevant articles of the Treaty, and the commitment to hold a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. 
88. Turkey supported the establishment of zones free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of 
mass destruction wherever feasible, and in particular the establishment of an effectively verifiable 
zone free of such weapons and their means of delivery in the Middle East. It encouraged all efforts 
aimed at developing a common regional understanding to that end, with the participation of all parties 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 12 
concerned. It strongly believed that all countries in the region should become party to all international 
arrangements for the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly the 
NPT. Possession of weapons of mass destruction did not provide additional security for any country, 
but rather further increased instability. Moreover, IsraelÂs non-accession to the NPT and its widely 
acknowledged possession of weapons of mass destruction undermined international efforts to foster a 
regional environment conducive to the achievement of lasting peace and security. In that connection, 
Turkey attached particular importance to the reaffirmation by the 2010 NPT Review Conference of the 
commitment of the parties to achieve universality of the Treaty, and the concern expressed regarding 
the lack of progress in achieving that and in implementing the resolution on the Middle East adopted 
at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, which a majority of State Parties believed 
seriously undermined the Treaty and posed a threat to regional and international peace and security. 
Thus, his country welcomed the endorsement by consensus by the 2010 NPT Review Conference of 
the convening of a conference in 2012, to be attended by all States of the Middle East, on the 
establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass 
destruction on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region. It looked forward 
to the constructive involvement of all States in the Middle East and the sponsors of the 1995 resolution 
throughout the preparatory process and beyond. 
89. The AgencyÂs international safeguards system was an essential part of the global nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, and Turkey attached great importance to its effectiveness and appreciated 
the meticulous manner in which the Secretariat approached verification activities under its mandate. 
90. In that context, his country noted with satisfaction that the Agency continued to verify the 
non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. However, it also noted that the Agency was still 
unable to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and 
activities in that country and that concerns were expressed in the Director GeneralÂs reports in relation 
to the issues that remain unresolved. Turkey encouraged Iran to continue its dialogue and cooperation 
with the Agency in order to help clarify those issues, with a view to reaching a common understanding 
and building confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities. 
91. Turkey remained fully committed to a diplomatic solution to the issues relating to the Iranian 
nuclear file. As a neighbour of Iran, Turkey had been actively contributing to all constructive efforts 
that would ease the way for dialogue and cooperation. 
92. A major diplomatic breakthrough had been achieved with the signing of the Joint Declaration in 
Tehran on 17 May 2010 by Iran, Turkey and Brazil. Based on the original nuclear fuel exchange 
proposal put forward by the Agency and supported by the Vienna Group, the Declaration laid out a 
realistic and achievable plan for negotiating, within specified timelines, the necessary agreements 
between the parties directly involved for the provision of 120 kg of nuclear fuel needed for the Tehran 
research reactor, in exchange for depositing 1200 kg of LEU. His country firmly believed that that 
agreement could serve as a significant confidence-building measure and a basis for negotiations 
between the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany and Iran. 
It therefore called on the relevant parties to implement the agreement without further delay. 
93. Similarly, on the issue of the implementation of SyriaÂs NPT safeguards agreement, it was 
essential that all parties display full transparency with a view to assisting the Agency in concluding its 
verification activities in Syria without further complications. Turkey trusted that continued 
engagement by and with Syria would help the Agency clarify ambiguities and eventually close that 
file. 
94. His country reiterated its grave concern at the decision by the Government of the DPRK to 
cease all cooperation with the Agency in April 2009, and at other actions by the DPRK, in particular 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 13 
the testing of two nuclear explosive devices and the resumption of operations at the reprocessing 
facility in Yongbyon. Those acts posed a severe threat to international peace and security and 
undermined the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the region. Turkey therefore called on the DPRK 
to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete and irreversible 
manner under Agency verification, to cease immediately all related activities, act strictly in accordance 
with its international obligations and return immediately to the six-party talks without preconditions. 
95. Turkey was following closely the ongoing debate on multilateral approaches to assurance of 
supply of nuclear fuel. The proposed arrangements had technical, political, legal and economic 
implications that needed much more discussion. His country was prepared to consider 
non-discriminatory approaches that would assure uninterrupted supply of nuclear fuel in a manner 
which did not impair the current fuel market, based on objective criteria and without prejudice to the 
legitimate rights of States to develop their own peaceful nuclear capabilities under the NPT. From 
TurkeyÂs perspective, those mechanisms should fully convince States that they would be able to obtain 
nuclear fuel in a predictable, stable and cost-effective manner over a long period without any undue 
interference. 
Mr Puja (Indonesia) took the Chair. 
96. Mr TURDIU (Albania) said that his countryÂs foreign policy was strongly marked by its 
commitment to peace and prosperity not only in Europe, but worldwide. As an active member of the 
Agency, Albania attached great importance to disarmament and non-proliferation, and to meeting its 
obligations in that regard under relevant international treaties. It also attached great importance to the 
implementation of all resolutions adopted by the General Conference and decisions of the Board of 
Governors, in particular those aimed at ensuring an effective and efficient international safeguards 
system and universality of that system. Aware as it was of the importance of the additional protocol as 
a fundamental instrument for achieving the aforementioned objectives, Albania had ratified its 
additional protocol just a few days previously. 
97. In recent years, his country had made tremendous progress in combating organized crime and 
illicit trafficking. The Albanian Government gave due attention to continued and close cooperation 
with the relevant international agencies Â including the Agency Â in the field of nuclear security and 
the fight against terrorism. Its integrated border management and control was of the highest quality 
and very efficient at all border checkpoints, as well as along its land and sea borders. As the Nuclear 
Security Report 2010 (GC(54)/9) showed, the Agency was continuing to assist Member States in 
developing a sustainable nuclear security capacity. He noted with satisfaction that Albania was part of 
the AgencyÂs global plan to combat nuclear terrorism and affirmed his GovernmentÂs commitment to 
implementing that plan successfully. Most Member States, including his own, participated actively in 
the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database and Albania continued to have a strong interest in the 
AgencyÂs training and educational programmes in that area. 
98. Regarding nuclear applications, Albania attached great importance to applications in the areas 
of energy, health, environment, education, safety and security, in line with its mid- and long-term 
development priorities. Preparation of the countryÂs new CPF for the period 2011Â2015 was 
progressing well. Following the recent developments in the country, in particular the recent 
establishment of AlbaniaÂs National Nuclear Agency, the promotion and introduction of nuclear power 
was now a priority and one that would be reflected in the new CPF. The proposed programme of 
technical cooperation with the Agency for the 2012Â2013 cycle covered those important issues and the 
National Nuclear Agency, working closely with the relevant Agency departments, would be 
developing a suitable infrastructure for the introduction of nuclear power in Albania. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 14 
99. His country would continue to be a beneficiary of PACT. The Albanian Government was very 
appreciative of the AgencyÂs assistance in that regard and was fully committed to strengthening cancer 
control in the country. 
100. With respect to nuclear power and non-power technology applications, nuclear technology 
transfer and implementation were lengthy processes and the AgencyÂs assistance would be required 
for many years to come. 
101. His Government believed that the Agency could play a crucial role in facilitating nuclear 
disarmament through verification. In its answer to the Director GeneralÂs letter regarding resolution 
GC(53)/RES/16 on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, the Albanian 
Government had indicated that it viewed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that 
region, and in others, as a positive step towards achieving global nuclear disarmament. The 2010 NPT 
Review ConferenceÂs endorsement of the convening of a conference in 2012, with the participation of 
all relevant Member States, to address the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all 
other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East afforded a good opportunity to work towards 
achieving a comprehensive and long-term peace in that region. For the conference to succeed, all of 
the parties in the region would need to come together voluntarily. It was important therefore that the 
Agency approach the issue in harmony with the consensus achieved at the NPT Review Conference in 
New York. 
102. In conclusion, he reiterated his GovernmentÂs full support for the Agency in the fulfilment of all 
its statutory functions under the guidance of its Director General. 
103. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden) said that 2010 marked an important milestone for the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. His country was committed to effective multilateral action against the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and welcomed the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference. The action plan on all three pillars of the NPT, and the agreement on a process to 
implement the 1995 resolution on the Middle East, demonstrated the common resolve of all countries 
to uphold and strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and promote disarmament. The 
AgencyÂs safeguards system was a fundamental component of that regime and played an indispensable 
role in implementation of the NPT. As had been reaffirmed by the NPT Review Conference, a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol ensured a solid and 
effective safeguards system. Believing that such a system should also make effective use of State and 
regional systems, his country welcomed the collaboration between the Agency and the European 
Union, as demonstrated by their partnership approach and their initiative to conduct joint training of 
inspectors. Sweden also warmly welcomed the initiative of the Russian Federation and the United 
States of America to invite the Agency to verify independently the implementation of their agreement 
on the disposition of plutonium no longer required for defence purposes. 
104. Sweden remained convinced of the benefits of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle 
and was willing to continue discussions on the development of such approaches in a 
non-discriminatory and transparent manner. The European Union would support financially the LEU 
bank proposed by the Secretariat once the conditions and modalities had been defined and approved 
by the Board, and he called upon the Director General to update that proposal to reflect prior 
discussions so that the Board might soon be in a position to take the necessary steps to implement that 
important project. 
105. Iran was failing to cooperate fully with the Agency and continued to defy numerous United 
Nations Security Council resolutions. Sweden underlined the importance of resolving the issue 
diplomatically, peacefully and without delay. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 15 
106. It was great cause for concern that the Syrian Arab Republic had not cooperated with the 
Agency since June 2008 on the matter related to the Dair Alzour site, thus preventing the Agency from 
completing its assessment and determining the nature of the site. His country urged Syria to cooperate 
fully with the Agency and to bring into force an additional protocol. 
107. He reaffirmed his countryÂs support for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their 
means of delivery in the Middle East. A balanced and consensual approach was needed to enable the 
Agency and its Member States to contribute positively to that goal. Sweden looked forward to a 
successful outcome of the 2012 conference on that subject. 
108. It was deeply regrettable that the Agency had not been able to implement safeguards in the 
DPRK since December 2002 and therefore could not draw any safeguards conclusion regarding that 
country. 
109. Only effective multilateralism could deal with the threat of nuclear weapon proliferation. The 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the CPPNM, in 
conjunction with Agency security and verification activities and national implementation of 
international instruments, were vital to countering nuclear terrorism and illegal diversion of or 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. The self-assessment and benchmarking offered 
under the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had proven to be invaluable in 
raising national awareness and encouraging the creation of national policies and appropriate legal and 
regulatory systems, and a higher level of safety and radiation protection. 
110. As a prerequisite for embarking on nuclear power programmes, countries should be required to 
set up the necessary technical and regulatory infrastructures for nuclear safety and security. Relevant 
nuclear safety and security instruments and the AgencyÂs safety standards and security guidance 
should be vital tools in such a task, and an independent regulatory body with the necessary powers and 
human and financial resources to supervise the planned nuclear facilities was an indispensable 
requirement. Solutions for waste management and decommissioning of facilities also had to be taken 
into consideration. 
111. Sweden welcomed the completion of the reviews of the Euratom safety standards and the Basic 
Safety Standards, which had taken due account of ICRP recommendations, the AgencyÂs Safety 
Fundamentals and advances in radiation protection research. The new safety standards were expected 
to enhance, modernize and harmonize measures taken within the international community to protect 
human health and the environment from the harmful effects of radiation. The AgencyÂs continued 
long-term work in that area was important and greatly appreciated. 
112. In June 2010, the Swedish parliament had adopted a law lifting the ban on the building of new 
nuclear reactors. Under the new law, which would enter into force in 2011, it would be possible to 
build a new reactor to replace an existing reactor that was permanently shut down, on a site where an 
operating reactor was already located. The Parliament had also passed a new act on liability and 
compensation in the event of radiological accidents, under which the operator of a nuclear facility had 
unlimited liability and was obliged to finance that liability up to Â1200 million. The act would enter 
into force once the relevant decision was taken by the Government. Furthermore, Sweden would be 
acceding to the 2004 amendments of the Paris Convention and the Brussels Supplementary 
Convention. 
113. SwedenÂs nuclear power plants were undergoing extensive safety modernization to improve 
their resistance to malfunctions and incidents, as a result of more stringent requirements imposed by 
the regulator. Power upgrades were also planned for 8 of the 10 nuclear power plants, thereby adding 
1200 MW(e) electrical power. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company (SKB) 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 16 
had selected a site at Forsmark for a final repository for spent nuclear fuel. It would be submitting a 
licence application for its construction in early 2011, and it was foreseen that the repository would be 
operational by around 2025. Several safety reviews, additional research and follow-up programmes 
would be implemented before commissioning the repository. Sweden underlined the importance of 
international efforts to find a common framework for safe radioactive waste management and disposal. 
114. Swedish regulatory activities were characterized by openness, transparency and trustworthiness. 
The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority had requested a full-scope IRRS review of its activities to be 
carried out in 2012. His country looked forward to that review, the preceding self-evaluation and to 
benefitting from the regulatory experience and expertise of the international review team members. 
Sweden supported the IRRS and would continue to provide experts for IRRS teams. 
115. His country continued to be active in the field of international nuclear safety and security 
cooperation. In 2009, the annual budget for SwedenÂs bilateral engagement had amounted to 
Â6 million and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority had implemented some 50 projects. Sweden 
welcomed the initiative of the United States to host a Nuclear Security Summit in April 2010. It had 
participated and reported on its engagement within the framework of the G8 Global Partnership 
against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction and other fora for international 
cooperation on nuclear safety and security. 
116. Mr LABBÃ VILLA (Chile) underlined the importance of the AgencyÂs non-proliferation, 
verification, technical cooperation and nuclear safety activities. 
117. Promoting and facilitating research, development and the practical application of atomic energy 
was one of the AgencyÂs central functions, carried out through the Department of Technical 
Cooperation and specific projects implemented with Member States. Availability of resources was 
vital to those activities and he announced that Chile had paid its full share of the TCF. 
118. The current technical cooperation programme cycle had begun in January 2009 and his country 
was implementing 14 national projects and participating in 57 regional and interregional projects, 
including 24 ARCAL projects, four of which Chile would lead. 
119. Chile had continued to study the possibility of integrating nuclear energy into its national 
electricity grid. For three years, the Agency had been collaborating with it in various studies to provide 
objective answers to the complex questions that nuclear power raised for an informed, democratic 
society. 
120. Over the preceding year, a group of young professionals had been established within the 
Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission. The CommissionÂs role was to undertake similar studies and 
address particularly sensitive areas such as public acceptance of nuclear power. Although no political 
decision had yet been taken on the introduction of nuclear power in Chile, the possibility was being 
discussed and it remained an option. He expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs support in studying 
the possibilities and in helping Chilean professionals attend training courses, technical meetings and 
seminars. 
121. With regard to radiation safety, the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission had organized a course 
on front-line response to radiological emergencies in August 2010 in collaboration with the Agency. 
Forty representatives of various national bodies, including the fire, police and customs services, the 
army, and the Ministry of Health, had participated in the course, the main aim of which had been to 
train leaders to deal with a radiological emergency and equip them with the necessary tools to fulfil 
their function as front-line responders. They had also received training in peer education and the 
establishment of action groups to respond to such events. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 17 
122. Work had continued on a storage facility for low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste, with 
significant assistance in the design phase from the United States Department of Energy. 
123. In line with its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, Chile had decided to eliminate all 
existing HEU fuel from its research reactors. Under the global initiative to reduce use of HEU fuel, 
ChileÂs fuel had been sent to the United States. Careful planning had allowed the operation to be 
completed successfully and without incident. 
124. In February 2010, Chile had suffered an earthquake measuring 8.9 on the Richter scale, the fifth 
strongest since the scale had been introduced. Although the earthquake had reached a magnitude of 
8.3 in the area of the country where its nuclear research reactors were located, neither reactor had 
sustained any damage. One reactor had been in full operation and its safety systems had worked 
perfectly, shutting it down and maintaining it in a safe mode. The Agency had immediately offered to 
send an expert mission to assess the situation on the ground. A mission organized by the International 
Seismic Safety Centre, comprising experts from the Agency, Japan, the United States and Chile, had 
evaluated the situation and held a seminar on both the Chilean earthquake and experience in other 
countries. He thanked the Agency for its rapid response in the face of a natural disaster on such a 
scale. 
125. The AgencyÂs nuclear security programme had gained particular prominence over the preceding 
year thanks to various multilateral events, including the International Conference on Effective Nuclear 
Regulatory Systems held in December 2009, the Washington Nuclear Security Summit and the 
successful 2010 NPT Review Conference, which, from their different perspectives, had all helped to 
highlight the overarching nature of the AgencyÂs work and the valuable advisory services it provided 
to States. Chile was party to multilateral instruments relating to nuclear and radiation safety, 
emergency assistance, civil liability for nuclear damage and physical protection of nuclear material. 
126. In his introductory speech, the Director General had recalled that over 60 countries had 
expressed interest in national nuclear programmes, between 10 and 25 of which were hoped to have 
taken concrete steps by 2030. In that situation, it was vital to strengthen the multilateral legal 
framework, enhance international cooperation and consolidate the safety culture. In all those areas, it 
was the AgencyÂs job to provide support in accordance with its Statute and the mandate given to it by 
Member States, in particular responding effectively and promptly to the latterÂs requests for assistance. 
127. His country attached high priority to the safe transport of nuclear material, an issue it raised 
frequently in international forums. The nuclear industry could not be completely risk-free. Within the 
Agency, Chile would continue to support actively such initiatives as the annual resolution submitted to 
the General Conference on strengthening the transport safety regime. A culture of transparency, 
notification and cooperation between States and relevant international bodies was needed in that area. 
Consultations between coastal and shipping States within the General Conference helped to build 
confidence and encourage dialogue, improving communication on the safe maritime transport of 
radioactive material. He expressed appreciation to the Secretariat for supporting the meeting on that 
issue earlier in 2010, which had included a simulated incident. 
128. Chile supported general and complete disarmament and all global and regional efforts to prevent 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It was an active party to all relevant international 
instruments, which it wished to see universally applied, and to various multilateral and 
intergovernmental agreements. It had ratified the CTBT, the entry into force of which was essential for 
progress in nuclear disarmament. He therefore urged all States that had not yet ratified that Treaty, 
particularly Annex 2 countries, to do so. 
129. As a member of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area, his 
country supported the establishment of such zones in other parts of the world, notably the Middle East. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 18 
130. Article III of the NPT entrusted the Agency with a vital role in verification. The additional 
protocol enhanced the AgencyÂs ability to provide assurances regarding the non-existence of 
undeclared nuclear activities in a country. Though it was still a voluntary instrument, it became 
binding once ratified and its provisions helped strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Universal 
adherence to it would allow for substantial improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
131. The annual report on safeguards implementation presented an encouraging picture of how 
Member States were meeting their commitments, but some areas of concern remained. The lack of 
progress in efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula was regrettable. Chile deplored the 
2009 nuclear test by the DPRK and the fact that the Pyongyang regime was not allowing the Agency 
access to its nuclear facilities, thereby preventing the Director General from reporting adequately on 
the nature and scope of that countryÂs activities. His country hoped that the DPRK would return to the 
six-party talks and rejoin the NPT. Chile would once again be sponsoring the draft resolution on that 
issue submitted to the General Conference. It had also consistently supported the AgencyÂs 
verification work in the Islamic Republic of Iran and recognized that countryÂs collaboration in 
safeguards activities. Nevertheless, it was an objective fact that there was still a lack of confidence in 
the non-existence of a military dimension to IranÂs nuclear programme, and Iran should cooperate 
fully with the Agency to dispel the international communityÂs doubts. Iran must meet its international 
commitments if it wished to occupy its deserved place in the community of nations. 
132. He underlined the need for all organizations, including the Agency, to maintain sufficient 
flexibility and resources to meet the challenges of an ever changing world. The 2005 World Summit of 
the United Nations had affirmed the interdependence of and synergies between the three pillars of the 
multilateral system: safety, development and human rights. The Agency contributed to achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals through its work in the areas of power, agriculture, mining and other 
industrial applications, health and the environment. The nuclear renaissance was also due to the 
undeniable advantages of atomic energy in preventing climate change. It was in the interests of all 
countries for the Agency to be strong, with the human and other resources it needed to carry out its 
mandate. Chile would continue to support the AgencyÂs work in all areas. 
133. Mr SABBAGH (Syrian Arab Republic), in connection with the issue of the application of 
safeguards in his country, thanked those Member States that had expressed understanding and support 
for SyriaÂs position. He expressed regret at the statements of some States, in particular their failure to 
condemn the Israeli act of aggression against Syrian territorial sovereignty in September 2007 which 
constituted a flagrant violation of international law and for which Israel had never been held to 
account. 
134. As regards SyriaÂs cooperation with the Agency, he pointed out that it had allowed an Agency 
team to visit the site of the destroyed building in Dair Alzour in June 2008, to move around freely and 
to take samples without hindrance. Also, Syria had provided the Agency with information and replies 
to all its questions that were sufficient to prove the nature of the site. Recently, it had reached an 
agreement with the Secretariat on a plan to clarify some questions related to the results of the analysis 
of the samples taken from the miniature neutron source reactor, with a view to closing that issue and 
returning to routine safeguards implementation. Syria was committed to continuing its cooperation 
with the Agency in accordance with its obligations under the Statute and its NPT comprehensive 
safeguards agreement. 
135. On the longstanding issue of the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, he noted 
that all States in the region were now within the framework of the NPT regime except for Israel, which 
still refused to accede. Syria, which had long striven to make the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, 
had submitted a draft resolution to that end, on behalf of the Arab Group, to the United Nations 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 19 
Security Council when it had been a member in 2003. Unfortunately, the resolution had failed to 
secure the approval of the States that supported Israel. 
136. The final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference had called for the convening of a 
conference in 2012 aimed at ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons. His country considered that 
to be a step towards the establishment of useful mechanisms, if Israel demonstrated the clear political 
will to take that path. In the past, the intransigence of successive Israeli Governments had undermined 
the chances of success of such initiatives. Great responsibility was borne by the nuclear-weapon States 
to help achieve the objective of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. They needed to fulfil 
their obligations under the NPT, particularly the commitment to refrain from supplying Israel with 
nuclear material and technology. 
137. The successful adoption of resolution GC(53)/RES/17 on Israeli nuclear capabilities the 
preceding year had sent a clear message expressing the concern of a large section of the international 
community regarding IsraelÂs continued efforts to develop its nuclear capabilities outside any 
international control. The resolution had also stressed the importance of the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The Director GeneralÂs report on the topic was 
disappointingly lacking in content. It simply annexed letters from Member States without any attempt 
to analyse or comment on them. Also, the report contained no assessment of Israeli nuclear 
capabilities, especially those of a military nature. Syria had hoped that the report would set forth the 
vision of the Agency Â as the sole international organization responsible for preventing nuclear 
proliferation Â vis-Ã -vis the concerns of States in the region about the existence of Israeli reactors 
outside international control. The report did not put forward any proposals regarding verification of 
Israeli activities or measures to deal with IsraelÂs refusal to implement relevant United Nations 
Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, as well as resolutions of the General Conference, 
or its refusal to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear installations under Agency comprehensive 
safeguards, thereby realizing the goal of universality of the NPT in the Middle East. 
138. In that connection, Syria called for support for the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities 
which was being submitted by the Arab Group to the current session of the General Conference and it 
appealed to States which had abstained or voted against the resolution the preceding year to reconsider 
their positions. 
139. Syria welcomed the recent examination by the Director General of the need to respect the 
confidentiality of information the Agency received from Member States, and the measures taken with 
respect to the obligation of officials not to divulge confidential information even after they ceased 
working for the Agency. That was a matter which impinged on the AgencyÂs credibility and the rights 
of Member States and his country looked forward to further steps in that regard. 
140. Syria valued the AgencyÂs efforts to focus support on strategic plans for training and education 
in the area of radiation, transport and waste safety. His country wished to strengthen its cooperation 
with the Agency and, in that connection, he mentioned the training course on radiation protection 
organized by the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria in cooperation with the Agency which, in the 
11 years for which it had existed, had produced some 260 graduates from Arab States. In addition, the 
Commission had recently inaugurated a science and technology training centre which would help 
build competencies in all peaceful applications of atomic energy at both national and regional level. 
141. The Syrian Arab Republic, through its competent bodies, provided a great deal of support to the 
technical cooperation programme, not only under ARASIA but also through other regional activities 
conducted by the Agency, to consolidate the principle of regional cooperation and partnership. 
GC(54)/OR.6

142. As regards SyriaÂs national technical cooperation programme, his country had now finalized and 
would soon sign its CPF for 2010Â2015. It looked forward to that document laying the foundation for 
closer cooperation with the Agency in future cycles. 
143. In 2010, his Government had held the first national conference on energy to discuss available 
options for meeting the global growth in energy demand. The conference had recommended 
considering nuclear power as one possible energy option for the future. Syria was cooperating with the 
Agency regarding the necessary infrastructure and nuclear safety issues and had received an Agency 
expert review mission under a technical cooperation project on the construction of its first nuclear 
power plant. Also, the relevant national bodies were preparing the corresponding national plans. In 
that connection, Syria valued highly the AgencyÂs efforts to prepare guidance documents and training 
courses to assist States which had decided to embark on nuclear power programmes in drawing up 
their national plans. 
144. In conclusion, his country looked forward to further efforts by the Agency in the field of nuclear 
science and technology, particularly in view of the growing need of developing States for practical 
solutions to the development problems they were facing. 
145. Mr SYCHOV (Belarus) said that the role of nuclear power in the socio-economic development 
of States was growing. The range of peaceful applications of atomic energy was very broad: from 
electricity generation to medicine. The importance of the Agency as the coordinator of global use of 
nuclear energy and a provider of technical assistance and advice to Member States was growing 
similarly. 
146. His country had announced its interest in developing a national nuclear power programme and 
had taken the decision to construct its first nuclear power plant, a project that would require ongoing 
collaboration with the Agency. Belarus was also establishing the necessary infrastructure for nuclear 
power. A law on the utilization of atomic energy had been adopted in 2008 and it defined the legal 
basis for the safe development of nuclear power, outlined the powers of State and local authorities and 
regulated matters connected with nuclear facilities and material. Belarus has also approved a strategy 
document in 2010 for the development of its electricity generation capacity up to 2020, which 
included a list of legislative and regulatory documents that would need to be adopted for a nuclear 
power plant to be constructed. 
147. A great deal of work had gone into a national assessment of the environmental impact of 
planning and constructing a nuclear power plant in the country. In October 2009, public hearings had 
taken place near the site of the future nuclear power plant with participation by experts, academics, the 
public and representatives of foreign States. Information on the environmental impact assessment had 
also been sent to States that had expressed the intention of participating. In 2010, public hearings and 
interorganizational consultations had taken place in Austria, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine. 
Critical comments and proposals were being taken into consideration in producing the assessment 
document. 
148. Belarus was also actively involved in international cooperation in connection with its nuclear 
power plant project. In 2009, an intergovernmental agreement had been signed between Belarus and 
the Russian Federation on cooperation on the peaceful use of atomic energy. The agreement defined 
areas of cooperation in the development, planning, construction and operation of the plant, supply of 
nuclear fuel, nuclear and radiation safety, and scientific collaboration and staff training issues. Belarus 
had signed a similar agreement with China. 
149. It would be impossible to undertake such a large-scale nuclear power project without the 
involvement of the Agency, and his country greatly appreciated its close cooperation on a wide range 
of issues related to the programme. The role of the Agency in supporting States considering or 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 21 
adopting nuclear power should be strengthened. Agency assistance had also been important in 
developing BelarusÂs nuclear culture, including through the seminar on nuclear power development 
issues held in Minsk in February 2010 and attended by high-level State officials and Agency experts. 
150. His country was actively involved in Agency technical cooperation in areas of major 
socio-economic impact such as nuclear power infrastructure development, rehabilitation of land 
affected by the Chernobyl accident, and health. Since 2009, the Agency had been providing assistance 
for the establishment of nuclear power in Belarus and further cooperation was planned in the training 
of staff for the nuclear power programme and the development of the countryÂs nuclear safety 
regulatory system. 
151. The cooperation between Belarus and the Agency to rehabilitate land contaminated by the 
Chernobyl accident was fully in line with the United Nations Chernobyl strategy, which envisioned 
the transition of the affected land to sustainable socio-economic development. Belarus expected the 
Agency to be actively involved in the United Nations plan for the decade of recovery and sustainable 
development for areas affected by Chernobyl. 
152. Belarus was among the countries that had submitted project designs for the 2012Â2013 technical 
cooperation cycle. The projects focused on further nuclear power infrastructure development, 
strengthening of the nuclear and radiation safety system, application of nuclear energy in medicine, 
and rehabilitation of areas affected by the Chernobyl accident. 
153. His country strongly supported the strengthening and expansion of the technical cooperation 
programme. Funding for the programme should be more predictable and assured. For a number of 
years, Belarus had pledged and paid its voluntary contributions to the TCF in full and on time. It 
would be doing so again in 2011 and called on all Member States to follow that example. 
154. Belarus supported the AgencyÂs work on nuclear and radiation safety, a subject to which it gave 
a high priority. In that connection, he stressed the importance of the universalization and effective 
implementation of international legal instruments like the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. 
155. The AgencyÂs work on nuclear security was equally deserving of appreciation. Belarus and the 
Agency had begun work on a draft Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan. An expert meeting on 
the issue had been held in Minsk in June 2010. The plan was awaiting final approval. 
156. In 2010, Belarus would be holding a national seminar on issues related to implementation of the 
1963 Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the 1997 protocol amending that 
Convention, with a view to meeting its obligations under those instruments. 
157. Belarus was committed to the goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. It accorded 
great importance to the strengthening of Agency safeguards and fully implemented its own obligations 
under the NPT and its safeguards agreement. By the end of 2010, it expected to have completed the 
internal governmental processes needed to ratify its additional protocol. 
158. He stressed the inalienable right of all Member States under the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute 
to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It was essential to ensure equal, non-discriminatory access to 
nuclear energy for all interested countries. 
159. In the current global economic situation, the limited resources available to the Agency must be 
used with the greatest efficiency, focusing on priorities which were based on the needs and interests of 
Member States. The welfare of many people depended on the AgencyÂs effective implementation of 
ambitious, long-term projects in conjunction with Member States. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 22 
160. Mr FERUTA (Romania) said that his country had continued to explore and evaluate ways of 
maintaining nuclear power as a significant option in meeting its future energy needs and 
environmental goals. Continued growth in the nuclear power contribution to the national energy mix 
was an objective of the national energy strategy. 
161. The global financial crisis had affected prospects for major investments, but the Romanian 
authorities were pursuing their plans for the commissioning and operation of Units 3 and 4 of the 
Cernavoda nuclear power plant. The Government was looking into ways of attracting new investors 
and a number of options were under consideration, including a reduction in State participation in 
several projects to below the majority shareholder level. Work on a new nuclear power plant, expected 
to become operational in the next decade, was in progress; a preliminary site selection study was being 
conducted. 
162. The national strategy for medium- and long-term management of spent nuclear fuel and 
radioactive waste called for the construction of a surface repository for low- and intermediate-level 
waste generated by the Cernavoda plant. 
163. With regard to the promotion of non-power nuclear energy applications for sustainable 
development, Romania was focusing on the areas of human health and the environment, as well as 
nuclear science and technology. 
164. His country planned to introduce new medical and industrial image analysis and processing 
systems. Expansion of early diagnosis and cancer treatment centres throughout the country that made 
use of positron emission tomography remained a priority. 
165. Technical cooperation projects were also planned in the area of nuclear medicine with a view to 
training medical personnel and transferring expertise, with a particular focus on a new generation of 
physicians specialized in early prevention and monitoring of cancer. He referred in that connection to 
the fruitful discussions which the Romanian authorities had had with the Director General during his 
visit to the country earlier in the year, and he commended the Director General for the emphasis he 
had placed on the AgencyÂs role in combating cancer. 
166. The preceding year had seen the completion of a project related to the new control-command 
console for the TRIGA reactor at the Pitesti Nuclear Research Institute. Commissioned in 1980, that 
reactor, which was the most powerful TRIGA reactor ever built, had been the worldÂs first reactor to 
be fully converted Â in 2006 Â from HEU to the more proliferation-resistant LEU under the Global 
Threat Reduction Initiative and the Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Programme. 
The modernization of all the control-command systems, including the reactor operation and safety 
systems, had taken into account operating experience and IAEA guidance. 
167. The Pitesti TRIGA reactor was essential for fuel characterization and implementation of new 
fuel cycles for Cernavoda Units 3 and 4 and the new power plant planned. Nuclear research would 
also be further developed in the field of radioisotopes, advanced materials technologies and irradiation 
techniques with applications in industry, agriculture, medicine, environmental and civil protection, and 
research. 
168. In implementing the national nuclear programme, efforts were also being made to attract human 
resources and strengthen nuclear knowledge management. Romania looked forward to cooperating 
with IAEA expert missions to address the impending loss of critical knowledge and skills and promote 
human resources training and retention. With a view to expanding its national nuclear programme, his 
country would be stepping up its participation in INPRO projects focusing on new power 
technologies, as well as studies and simulations for a synergic approach to different fuel cycles. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 23 
169. Romania had consistently paid its contribution to the TCF and was in the process of becoming a 
technical assistance donor State, offering its experience and expertise in preparing and organizing 
international and regional activities, and in the field of capacity building and peer reviews for nuclear 
newcomers. The Romanian regulatory body planned to create a regional centre of excellence in the 
nuclear field to provide training courses for Romanian and foreign experts and organize fellowships 
and visits under the technical cooperation programme. 
170. In keeping with its commitments under the NPT, Romania actively supported non-proliferation, 
disarmament and the right to peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The NPT was an essential 
instrument for collective security. Its three interconnected pillars were the appropriate framework for 
preserving and strengthening international peace and security, while spreading the benefits of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference was 
balanced and pragmatic and reflected the firm commitment of the international community to 
strengthen the global nuclear regime. The real challenge would be to ensure implementation of the 
action plan. 
171. Over the years, his country had actively promoted Agency activities in the area of nuclear safety 
and security. International cooperation and adherence to the relevant instruments in the field remained 
crucial to promoting the global nuclear safety framework. Romania complied with all international 
conventions on nuclear safety and applied the Agency codes of conduct and safety standards. It 
commended the Agency for its work in the nuclear security field and would continue to support it. 
172. Integrated safeguards were currently being applied in Romania at major facilities in the nuclear 
fuel cycle. His country met its obligations under its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the 
Agency, to which it had been a party since the 1970s, and under its additional protocol. As of 1 May 
2010, it would be applying the safeguards agreement and additional protocol concluded between 
Euratom, European Union non-nuclear-weapon States and the Agency. 
173. Romania felt honoured to be guiding the process for preparation of the AgencyÂs Medium Term 
Strategy 2012Â2017 on behalf of Member States. The current year, which had seen many important 
events in the nuclear field, from the Nuclear Security Summit to the NPT Review Conference, offered 
Member States an opportunity to elaborate a more robust and relevant strategy that would guide the 
AgencyÂs activities effectively for the next three biennia. 
174. Finally, he stressed the importance his country attached to consolidating a culture of 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through joint international efforts and active global 
diplomacy. 
175. Mr DÃAZ (Mexico) said that the Annual Report for 2009 duly reflected the AgencyÂs 
achievements in promoting international cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear technology, and 
its efforts to promote effective nuclear safety, security and verification. Mexico noted with satisfaction 
that the Agency had focused in 2009 on assisting Member States in meeting their energy needs, 
responding to concerns about climate change, promoting food security and access to drinking water, 
and using nuclear technology to improve health care. 
176. The international community was facing a number of challenges in the field of the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy. The first challenge related to efforts to secure a successful supply of energy for 
development, use of renewable forms of energy and the fight against climate change, on the one hand, 
and maintenance of international peace and security, on the other. The international community 
needed to have a clear awareness of common goals and ensure that its goals were not mutually 
exclusive. The second challenge related to closer coordination of the various components of the 
international nuclear regime which, owing to their diverse legal and political nature, could sometimes 
lead to problems of manageability. The third challenge facing the international community was the 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 24 
need to finish consolidating the individual instruments and mechanisms, especially those that were 
legally binding, in the areas of disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
That should be done the basis of the mandates of the organizations concerned. 
177. The Agency should continue to adopt a balanced and equitable approach in the areas of 
cooperation, safety and security, and verification in order to achieve its core objectives, especially 
since events during the preceding two years had created a climate conducive to disarmament and 
non-proliferation. 
178. The AgencyÂs role as the principal intergovernmental forum for technical and scientific 
cooperation in support of peaceful uses of nuclear technology should be continuously enhanced. 
Mexico attached great importance to the technical cooperation programme and to all measures 
designed to ensure optimum use of resources in that area, especially in the fields of human health, 
food and agriculture, and the use of nuclear energy for electricity generation. Thus, it had prepared a 
CPF that would shortly be signed. 
179. As an active promoter of technical cooperation among developing countries in the Latin 
American and Caribbean region, his country continued to support activities under ARCAL. The 
current week marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of ARCAL. Mexico would continue to demonstrate 
its support for ARCAL by hosting technical meetings, training fellows and sending experts to other 
countries in the region. 
180. MexicoÂs relations with the Agency were governed by the concept of partners in development. 
In addition to seeking the AgencyÂs assistance in areas where it required international support, his 
country would continue to make available its knowledge and experience in the field of peaceful 
applications of nuclear science and technology to the international community in general and to the 
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular. 
181. His country had gained considerable experience in recent years in the use of food irradiation as 
a quarantine treatment and was willing to transfer the knowledge it had acquired through courses, 
workshops, fellowships and scientific visits. 
182. As nuclear energy was a clean and safe source of energy that did not generate greenhouse gases, 
Mexico would continue studying the possibility and appropriateness of expanding its nuclear facilities. 
The Laguna Verde nuclear power plant was continuing with the power upgrade of its two reactors. 
The capacity of Unit I had been upgraded to 800 MW(e) and pre-operational tests were under way. 
Work on Unit II would be completed in 2011. 
183. The Mexican Academy of Engineering had published a very detailed paper in 2010 on nuclear 
power in Mexico, and the Senate had held a seminar on the subject in April 2010 which had been 
attended by national and foreign experts and representatives of international organizations, including 
the Agency. 
184. Mexico appreciated the AgencyÂs work under the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013 and took 
note of the Nuclear Security Summit that had been held in Washington earlier that year. While nuclear 
security was primarily the responsibility of individual States, the Agency played a vital role in the 
nuclear security regime. His country therefore reiterated its support for Agency efforts to promote 
physical protection of nuclear material and facilities and of radioactive sources, and to strengthen State 
legislation and regulations with a view to preventing nuclear terrorism. It also supported the 
application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the 
supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
185. He noted with concern that 222 incidents had been reported to the illicit trafficking database 
during the preceding year, 21 of which had involved activities such as unauthorized possession of and 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 25 
attempts to sell or smuggle nuclear material or radioactive sources, and 61 of which had involved the 
theft or loss of nuclear or other radioactive material. He further noted that, in 58% of the latter 
incidents, the recovery of the material had not been reported. 
186. His country was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it gave to Member States with 
improving protection against possible nuclear attacks, such as the support it had given to Colombia 
during the IX South American Games and to South Africa during the FIFA World Cup earlier in the 
year. The Agency had also launched a programme of nuclear security assistance to Mexico in 
preparation for the XVI Pan American Games to be held in Guadalajara in October 2011. 
187. The additional protocol to the safeguards agreement between Mexico and the Agency had been 
submitted to the Senate for consideration. It was hoped that its ratification would shortly be approved. 
188. The Agency continued to support, at Member StatesÂ request, the replacement of HEU fuel in 
research reactors. At the Nuclear Security Summit in April 2010, President CalderÃ³n had therefore 
announced the Mexican GovernmentÂs decision to replace the HEU in the TRIGA III research reactor 
at the National Nuclear Research Institute with LEU, and to convert the reactor prior to its 
replacement. 
189. The NPT Review Conference held in May 2010 had recognized the importance of ensuring the 
highest possible level of nuclear security and had urged State Parties to promote exchange of best 
practices in nuclear safety and security, including through dialogue with the nuclear industry and the 
private sector. 
190. At the recent Nuclear Security Summit, his country had reaffirmed its commitment in that area. 
The Summit had reaffirmed the AgencyÂs essential role in the international nuclear security 
framework. 
191. Mexico had held the office of Vice-President at the 2010 NPT Review Conference and had 
played a prominent role in the small group of States that had negotiated the final document, which 
referred to the three pillars of the Treaty, namely disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. The document consisted of two main sections: a review of implementation of the 
Treaty, and conclusions and recommendations for follow-up action. The Conference had reaffirmed 
the essential role of the Agency in promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, developing safety 
guidelines, and promoting technical cooperation and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through 
its safeguards system. It clearly demonstrated StatesÂ commitment and the fact that agreement could 
be reached notwithstanding differences of opinion. Mexico welcomed the fact that the Conference had 
agreed to hold a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. In his countryÂs view, the 64 actions contemplated in 
the final document laid a solid foundation for achieving the shared goals of nuclear disarmament, 
non-proliferation and promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Mexico was a strong advocate of 
disarmament and non-proliferation and believed that the two were complementary. It would therefore 
continue working to bring about the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which 
contravened all norms of international humanitarian law. 
192. The AgencyÂs efforts to establish a safeguards system that ensured effective compliance with 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime would never succeed in the absence of political will on the part of 
States. Mexico had made significant efforts in the area of non-proliferation and strongly supported all 
steps taken by the Agency to establish an effective international safeguards system. 
193. His country continued to urge the resumption of the six-party talks aimed at promoting the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the reincorporation of the DPRK in the NPT regime. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 26 
194. It also called once again on the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate 
effectively and without delay with the Agency, and to take steps to resolve all outstanding issues in a 
transparent and expeditious manner with a view to contributing to international peace and security. 
195. Lastly, he urged Member States to reaffirm their commitment to all NPT rights and obligations 
in order to strengthen the three pillars of the Treaty for the benefit of all. 
Mr Hu Xiaodi (China) took the Chair. 
196. Ms MACMILLAN (New Zealand) said that the successful conclusion of the NPT Review 
Conference had provided an opportunity and an incentive to make progress towards the goal of 
achieving a world free of nuclear weapons, and the opportunity had to be seized. Preventing the spread 
of nuclear weapons through the implementation of safeguards under the NPT was a fundamental pillar 
of the AgencyÂs work, and her country welcomed the recognition given to that fact and to the 
AgencyÂs broader mandate in the final document of the Conference. The Agency had a crucial role to 
play in moving the non-proliferation agenda forward. An important outcome of the Conference had 
been the reaffirmation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and the agreement to convene a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of 
mass destruction in the region; that was a highly significant agreement that all must play a part in 
supporting. 
197. As a strong supporter of the NPT, New Zealand endorsed the principle that nuclear technology 
should be available for peaceful uses in conformity with Articles II and III of the Treaty, but with the 
expansion of the use of nuclear energy came a growth in the associated risks. It was her countryÂs 
belief that safeguards, safety, security and waste management should be an integral part of the 
development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. There was a need to ensure that nuclear technologies 
were accessible to all, while at the same time ensuring that such technologies were managed safely 
and securely and did not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
198. New Zealand attached importance to ensuring that the Agency had all the tools it needed to 
provide robust assurances to the international community that nuclear activities undertaken by States 
were solely for peaceful purposes. Current proliferation challenges meant that a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement alone was not sufficient to provide the Agency with the necessary authority to 
carry out its verification mandate fully. The additional protocol constituted the contemporary 
verification standard and should always feature as a condition in new supply arrangements for nuclear 
and associated material. In that context, her country welcomed the decision of the NPT Review 
Conference to encourage all State Parties which had not yet done so to conclude and bring into force 
additional protocols as soon as possible and to implement them provisionally pending their entry into 
force. 
199. Her country recognized the paramount importance of ensuring the safety of nuclear material and 
nuclear facilities and welcomed the AgencyÂs work to support Member States in strengthening 
nuclear, radiation, transport and radioactive waste safety and emergency preparedness. The safe 
maritime transport of radioactive material remained of fundamental importance to New Zealand. 
Shipments must take place against a backdrop of the highest possible safety and security standards. 
Appropriate information must be provided to coastal States in advance of any shipments. Proper 
emergency response systems must be in operation, and there must be an effective liability regime in 
place to protect against harm to human health and the environment, and possible economic loss due to 
an incident or accident during the transport of radioactive material. New Zealand was pleased that 
some progress had been made in many of those areas but noted that there was scope for further 
positive developments. In that context, she welcomed the continued dialogue between coastal and 
shipping States, in particular on exchange of information regarding shipments. The most recent such 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 27 
meeting on the preceding day had dealt with the issue of emergency preparedness and response. 
New Zealand strongly supported the work of INLEX, in particular its examination of gaps and 
ambiguities in the nuclear liability regime. 
200. New Zealand concurred with the assessment that the possibility of terrorists obtaining nuclear or 
other radioactive material remained a grave threat and believed it was of paramount importance to 
maintain stringent standards of physical protection for nuclear material and nuclear facilities. It 
recognized the AgencyÂs important role in helping Member States improve the global nuclear security 
framework. Although her country welcomed the inclusion in the AgencyÂs Regular Budget of some 
funding for nuclear security activities, it noted with concern that uncertainty made it difficult for the 
Agency to plan and prioritize its activities in that area. It was therefore pleased to announce that it 
would be making a further contribution to those activities during the current year. 
201. The NPT Review Conference had underscored the importance of resolving all cases of 
non-compliance with safeguards obligations in full conformity with the AgencyÂs Statute and Member 
StatesÂ respective legal obligations, and she highlighted the decision of the Conference to call for 
Member States to extend their cooperation to the Agency. 
202. New Zealand condemned the nuclear tests conducted by the DPRK, and its refusal to comply 
with United Nations Security Council resolutions and cooperate with Agency inspectors. It urged the 
DPRK to refrain from further destabilizing acts and to refocus its efforts on peace and dialogue, 
including its six-party talks commitment to abandon its existing nuclear programme. 
203. Her country shared the international communityÂs concerns about the questions that remained 
with respect to IranÂs nuclear programme and it urged that country to comply with relevant Security 
Council resolutions and suspend its enrichment and heavy water-related activities. It was concerned at 
the late disclosure of the nuclear facility at Qom, and IranÂs decision earlier in the year to enrich 
uranium to 20%, and it urged Iran to implement fully its safeguards agreement and other obligations, 
including the modified Code 3.1 of its Subsidiary Arrangements and the additional protocol. 
204. New Zealand also called on the Syrian Arab Republic to be more cooperative and transparent in 
its provision to the Agency of information about and access to the Dair Alzour site and other related 
locations, and it encouraged Syria to cooperate fully with the Agency on the outstanding issues at the 
miniature neutron source reactor in Damascus. 
205. The challenges facing the international non-proliferation regime were numerous, and only likely 
to grow. It was important for the international community to work together to agree upon and 
coordinate effective responses to meet those challenges. The Agency had a vital role in that collective 
response, working with Member States to safeguard and secure nuclear material for exclusively 
peaceful purposes to the benefit of the global family. 
206. New Zealand welcomed and supported the AgencyÂs work in applying the benefits of nuclear 
technology to the fields of human health, water quality, crop enhancement, and pest control. It also 
welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts to develop national capacity in Member States, and promote 
regional and international cooperation in those areas. Such issues needed urgent action on a global 
scale, and progress in that regard would make a considerable difference and, over time, would benefit 
many millions of people. 
207. Mr VALLIM GUERREIRO (Brazil) pledged his countryÂs full support for the objectives of the 
Agency as defined in its Statute. Brazil was fully committed to the safe and secure promotion of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Its nuclear programme was expanding. The construction of its third 
nuclear power plant with a 400 MW light-water pressurized reactor was in progress and it was 
expected to be operational by 2015. The Brazilian nuclear programme envisaged the construction of 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 28 
eight additional nuclear power plants for which site studies had already begun. Fuel cycle activities 
were also expanding. Earlier in the year, an UPSAT mission had visited the uranium mine in CaetitÃ© 
for the first time. The commercial enrichment facility in Resende was being rapidly enlarged. 
Although BrazilÂs enrichment capacity still fell far short of current and future needs, the aim was to 
become self-sufficient in all stages of the fuel cycle by 2015. Work would begin shortly on the 
construction of a conversion facility. 
208. All Brazilian nuclear facilities, both civilian and military, were under Agency and ABACC 
safeguards. Brazil cooperated fully with the Agency in the field of safeguards, as was demonstrated by 
the accreditation of the Institute of Radiation Protection and Dosimetry of BrazilÂs National Nuclear 
Energy Commission as the first laboratory in the developing world in the AgencyÂs network of 
safeguards laboratories. 
209. All those activities were being carried out in accordance with Agency requirements and 
standards. Over the years, Brazil had developed a strong and effective regulatory authority, the 
National Nuclear Energy Commission. The Commission exercised full control over tens of thousands 
of radioactive sources in Brazil and kept them in safe storage facilities after their use by industry or 
hospitals. The lessons learned from the 1987 Goiania incident, which had been the result of 
carelessness on the part of the owners of a medical clinic, had been instrumental in the development of 
the regulatory authority currently in place for the control of sources. 
210. The current session of the General Conference was being held shortly after the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference. The NPT established rights and obligations. It did not create an institutional 
machinery entrusted with overseeing the TreatyÂs implementation. One pillar of the Treaty was 
overseen by the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. The other two Â non-proliferation and 
peaceful uses Â fell within the mandate of the Agency. If all of the pillars of the NPT were considered 
in conjunction with one another, the ultimate objective of the Treaty Â a world free of nuclear 
weapons Â would be closer. 
211. There was a widespread misconception that the Agency was the guardian of the 
non-proliferation provisions of the NPT. That was simply not so. The AgencyÂs mandate under the 
Treaty was to apply safeguards to source, and especially fissionable material in non-nuclear-weapon 
States party to the NPT. Beyond that, prying into activities of States which might be relevant to the 
nuclear field in one way or another was not part of the job description of the Agency, unless the State 
concerned agreed to allow it to do so. Brazil did not accept what many perceived as the AgencyÂs 
jurisdiction creeping into areas which went beyond the scope of comprehensive safeguards agreements 
based on INFCIRC/153. 
212. His country was convinced that the main focus of the AgencyÂs activities should be the 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for the enhancement of the well-being of humankind. 
That objective could only be achieved if requirements relating to safety, security and safeguards were 
met. However, the ultimate objective was the use of nuclear energy itself. Without the necessary safety 
requirements in place, the use of nuclear energy would defeat its own purpose. For example, the 
damage which might be caused by the unsafe operation of a power or research reactor would clearly 
outweigh its benefits. Safety was therefore of intrinsic importance. Security and safeguards, on the 
other hand, had been devised to guard against the evil side of human nature and were no less 
important. 
213. In the more than fifty years of its existence, the Agency had had to adapt to new realities and 
find the means to meet new challenges. With the expected increase in the use of nuclear energy, the 
Agency would have to strike a balance between universal rules and procedures, and issues of a 
regional or national character. One size clearly did not fit all. However, the Agency also could not 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 29 
afford to be accused of discrimination and double standards. In some parts of the world, the precepts 
upheld by the Agency might be well reflected in the domestic legal framework but might not be 
implemented effectively, and the opposite might also be true. Hence the importance of critical 
judgment, common sense and as wide a knowledge as possible of diverse realities. 
214. His country was pleased at the way the new Director General had discharged his responsibilities 
in his first year in office. The Brazilian Foreign Minister had had a thoughtful exchange of views with 
the Director General during his visit to Brazil in March when he had visited the headquarters of 
ABACC. Brazil appreciated the cooperation between ABACC and the Agency and hoped that efforts 
would be redoubled in that area to avoid unnecessary duplication of work. One of the objectives of 
Argentina and Brazil was the strengthening of ABACC, as stated by the Presidents of the two 
countries in the recent Joint Declaration of San Juan. 
215. The current session of the General Conference would have to address important and sensitive 
matters, some of which were controversial in nature. His country was confident that a spirit of 
compromise, and understanding for the concerns of others, would ultimately prevail. It was up to 
everyone to make the Agency a more effective institution that carried out its mandate in accordance 
with the Statute. 
216. Mr DE LA PENA (Philippines) said that the 2010 NPT Review Conference had underlined the 
AgencyÂs important role in helping countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals through its 
technical cooperation programme and its activities in nuclear power and non-power applications. The 
Philippines had chaired the Conference and looked forward to working with others in moving forward 
on the follow-up actions related to the AgencyÂs work contained in the final document. 
217. Through its cooperation with the Agency, the Philippines had been developing the necessary 
human resources and physical infrastructure for the use of nuclear technologies to help meet 
challenges in such areas as food security, environmental resources management and human health. 
218. With regard to human health, his country welcomed the focus placed by the Director General on 
cancer control in developing countries. It looked forward to receiving an imPACT mission to assist it 
in finalizing a draft national action plan on cancer control and identify ways in which it could further 
contribute to the network of cancer training centres in the region. 
219. In the area of the environment, the Philippines had achieved significant milestones in the use of 
stable isotopes and environmental radiotracers in water resources management, and was participating 
as the pilot Member State in the implementation of the AgencyÂs water availability enhancement 
project, which aimed to enhance the capacity of Member States to undertake water resources 
assessment. It was also working as an IAEA collaborating centre with the IAEA Environment 
Laboratories in Monaco on algal bloom studies. 
220. In food and agriculture, irradiation technology had been used in support of the countryÂs 
national agenda on food security for mutation breeding work, with a view to making some agricultural 
products drought-resistant and helping them gain access to the export market, and for disinfection of 
agricultural equipment to control the spread of infectious animal diseases. The Philippines welcomed 
the FAO decision in 2009 to extend and strengthen the work of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of 
Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, which had helped enhance the delivery of nuclear 
technologies for crop improvement, livestock production, soil and water management and food safety. 
221. As countries were turning increasingly to the Agency for assistance with the development or 
expansion of nuclear power programmes, Member States should enhance their political and financial 
support for the organizationÂs programmes in that area. The Philippines was working on the 
infrastructure components for launching a nuclear power programme, including the establishment of 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 30 
the requisite regulatory framework, and was working with the Agency on human resources 
development; it was also refining a communications plan aimed at enabling the public to arrive at an 
informed decision on nuclear power. It had noted the information provided by the Agency on 
increasing public confidence in nuclear power in recent years, and it encouraged sustained efforts by 
the organization to address outstanding concerns that posed obstacles to the expansion or initiation of 
nuclear power programmes. It called on the Agency to enhance its efforts to facilitate bilateral and 
multilateral funding support for nuclear energy projects. The nuclear renaissance gave rise to 
challenges in terms of nuclear safety, nuclear security and safeguards; confidence in the use of nuclear 
energy hinged on the continuous improvement and strengthening of safety and security. 
222. The Philippines continued to benefit from Agency assistance with the development of a safety 
infrastructure for a nuclear power programme, particularly in human resources development and the 
long-term management of radioactive waste. Knowledge networks and regional cooperation in nuclear 
safety were of great importance, especially in the light of the transboundary effects of a nuclear 
accident. The Philippines participated actively in the Asian Nuclear Safety Network and believed that 
a regional approach to capacity building through the creation of networks of national capacity building 
centres could help ensure the sustainability of national human resources development programmes. 
223. His country shared the AgencyÂs objective of attaining global nuclear security. With Agency 
assistance, it had finalized its national nuclear security plan in 2009 and had accepted the Agency 
Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan for the Philippines in March 2010. It was also collaborating 
with the Agency and bilateral partners on capacity building in nuclear security and radiological 
emergency preparedness and response. 
224. Another challenge posed by the nuclear renaissance was the increasing risk of nuclear 
proliferation. The Philippines had ratified the additional protocol to its comprehensive safeguards 
agreement on 26 February 2010 and had submitted its initial report. The conclusion of comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols, and provision of the Agency with the tools and 
resources to implement a credible verification system effectively, would go a long way towards 
reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation. 
225. The Philippines had consistently stressed the importance of addressing the longstanding concern 
of developing countries with respect to maintaining a balance between the AgencyÂs promotional 
activities and its verification activities. It looked forward to the resumption of discussions in the 
working group on financing the AgencyÂs activities, which it hoped would address issues relating to 
the TCF and reach concrete and implementable outcomes. The final document of the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference had emphasized that the financing of technical cooperation should be in line with 
the concept of shared responsibility, and that NPT State Parties were called upon to make every effort 
and take practical steps to ensure that Agency resources for technical cooperation activities were 
sufficient, assured and predictable. 
226. With regard to the implementation of safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran, his country 
remained concerned over the lack of substantive progress towards resolving the remaining issues that 
would enable Iran to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material 
and activities. It was important to continue constructive dialogue and cooperation among all parties 
concerned to find a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the issue. The Philippines called on Iran to 
comply with the relevant resolutions of the Board and the United Nations Security Council. 
227. Turning to the issue of the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, he recalled that, in the final document 
of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, States Parties had deplored the nuclear test explosions 
announced by the DPRK in May 2009. Considering its proximity to the Korean Peninsula, the 
Philippines remained seriously concerned over the DPRKÂs acts of intransigence, which were serious 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 31 
threats to peace and stability in the region and international norms on non-proliferation, and 
constituted a clear violation of commitments under the six-party talks and of obligations under 
relevant Security Council resolutions. His country had consistently advocated a peaceful and just 
solution to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and was committed to helping create an 
environment of trust and confidence conducive to the DPRKÂs engagement with the international 
community. 
228. On the issue of the implementation of safeguards in the Syrian Arab Republic, he expressed 
concern at the lack of progress in clarifying the substantive issues that had been raised in the 
Director GeneralÂs most recent report. The Philippines urged all parties concerned to extend full 
cooperation to the Agency to enable it to complete the verification process and allow Syria to clarify 
the nature of its nuclear programme. 
229. The Philippines shared the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons in which nuclear energy 
was used only for peaceful purposes. It strongly supported the establishment of nuclear weapon-free 
zones as a way to contribute to international peace and security. The Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations had established the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, and the Philippines 
encouraged the nuclear-weapon States and other partners in the region to accede to the treaty 
establishing that zone. It also supported the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East. The final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference put forward concrete follow-up 
actions that States could pursue to help achieve that goal. 
230. The challenges and issues confronting the Agency were complicated by political realities. 
Differences had to be overcome in order to advance common objectives, and the Philippines was 
committed to working with Member States in a spirit of mutual respect, trust, transparency and 
constructive dialogue. 
231. Mr KONGSTAD (Norway) recalled that, at the NPT Review Conference in May, States party to 
the NPT had reached agreement on a final document setting out 64 concrete actions to strengthen 
disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy under the Treaty. Although his 
country believed that the document could have been more ambitious, it would do its utmost to 
contribute to the implementation of the 64 actions, including the commitment to convene in 2012 a 
conference on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
232. For several years, Iran had not cooperated with the Agency in a satisfactory manner regarding 
possible non-peaceful dimensions of its nuclear programme, nor had it met its obligations under its 
safeguards agreement. Its enrichment and heavy water-related activities were continuing and 
expanding, and no adequate assurance could be provided that all nuclear material in the country was 
for peaceful purposes. While no one was questioning IranÂs right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, 
Norway Â which had supported the AgencyÂs cooperation with Iran to strengthen the Iranian 
regulatory authority and the safety of the Bushehr reactor Â expected Iran to meet its international 
commitments and its responsibilities as an Agency Member State. 
233. For a number of years, the DPRK had refused to cooperate with the international community. It 
must refrain from any further provocation and return to the six-party talks immediately and without 
preconditions. His country called on the DPRK to abandon and dismantle completely any nuclear 
weapon-related programme in a prompt, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
234. While Norway welcomed the recent action plan between Syria and the Agency to resolve 
outstanding issues relating to the miniature neutron source reactor site, SyriaÂs lack of cooperation 
regarding the Dair Alzour site and related locations was regrettable. He called upon Syria to cooperate 
fully with the Agency to resolve the remaining questions concerning its nuclear programme. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 32 
235. Syria, Iran and other States that had not yet done so should sign and ratify without delay the 
additional protocol, since it was only through that instrument that the Agency could provide the 
requisite assurances regarding a nuclear programme, without which non-proliferation, common 
security and the ability to expand peaceful nuclear cooperation would be jeopardized. All States 
should join the NPT, sign safeguards agreements and work towards a world free of nuclear weapons. 
Furthermore, they should support the convening of a conference on the establishment of a zone free of 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
236. Although commitment to nuclear security had been confirmed at the highest levels, slow 
progress was being made in adhering to the 2005 amendment to the CPPNM. All States should sign 
and ratify the global conventions on nuclear security, and cooperate with the Agency in their 
implementation. Norway had pledged $3.3 million at the Nuclear Security Summit in April to 
strengthen the AgencyÂs nuclear security assistance to developing countries. 
237. The Agency had a critical role to play in reducing the risk of nuclear accidents, which was likely 
to increase given the anticipated growth in the use of nuclear energy. However, for too many years the 
Agency had suffered from a lack of resources, which had serious consequences for those States 
requiring assistance from the Agency. Norway had long argued that the Regular Budget of the Agency 
must increase in proportion to the organizationÂs tasks. Despite some rise in budget levels, that was far 
from being the case. Pending adequate funding, Norway had offered to support the AgencyÂs work to 
strengthen the safety capabilities of developing countries, and had formalized an agreement with the 
Agency for the allocation of Â2.5 million over four years. The AgencyÂs efforts in recent years to 
strengthen nuclear safety in Bulgaria and Romania had been supported by Norway and had generated 
a number of recommendations of relevance to other countries. 
238. Efforts should be made to develop national capacities for emergency preparedness, and he 
emphasized the AgencyÂs role in promoting international cooperation and facilitating coordination and 
communication in that regard. The recommendations contained in the international action plan for 
strengthening the international preparedness and response system for nuclear and radiological 
emergencies should be implemented by all. 
239. With regard to cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, concern over possible 
disruptions in fuel supplies was an important matter for the Agency. Norway remained convinced that 
an Agency fuel bank would be an important step towards the development of an equitable and 
sustainable international nuclear fuel supply regime. It would uphold Member StatesÂ right to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and would not require countries to renounce their normal sources of 
fuel supply or their right to develop a national fuel production capacity. It would only add to the 
options available to countries choosing to develop nuclear energy and would help to further 
non-proliferation. Norway welcomed the decision taken the preceding year to establish a uranium 
reserve in Russia, and the generous offer of Kazakhstan to host a future Agency fuel bank. Noting that 
funding to cover start-up costs had already been secured from more than 30 countries, including his 
own, he commended the work of the Secretariat thus far and requested the Director General to update 
the SecretariatÂs proposal for an Agency fuel bank to facilitate a decision by the Board of Governors. 
240. Norway welcomed the fact that the Scientific Forum in 2010 was addressing the issue of cancer 
in developing countries and commended the AgencyÂs contribution to achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals through the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. His country fully 
supported the technical cooperation programme and welcomed experts on scientific visits to Norway. 
241. Mr ZOGRAFOS (Greece) said that his country had a strong interest in the AgencyÂs ever 
expanding nuclear safety and security programmes, attached particular importance to a high level of 
nuclear safety and security worldwide and recognized the AgencyÂs leading role in enhancing the 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 33 
global security framework. The organizationÂs safety standards were fundamental to any nuclear 
activity and should continue to enjoy high priority. 
242. Greece strongly supported implementation of the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013, 
including activities under the EU Joint Action IV agreement. It saluted every effort aimed at 
strengthening safety requirements and the establishment of independent regulatory authorities in all 
countries in order to control and manage radiation sources. 
243. In the field of nuclear safety, Greece had submitted its national report within the framework of 
the forthcoming fourth review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
In the same field but at European level, the Greek Atomic Energy Commission had prepared a draft 
Presidential decree transposing into national legislation European Directive 2009/71/Euratom 
establishing a Community framework for the nuclear safety of nuclear installations. 
244. The International Seismic Safety Centre launched by the Agency several years previously was 
of great importance in assessing the specific needs of countries considering nuclear power reactor 
programmes. 
245. In the nuclear security area, his country was continuing to make use of the equipment installed 
at its borders, and the hand-held equipment distributed to customs, police and coastguard officers, 
among others, and it was sharing the experience gained with other countries. Further activities had 
been agreed within the framework of a practical arrangement concluded between the Agency and the 
Greek Atomic Energy Commission, including the organization of around three regional training 
courses each year on response and detection techniques. 
246. The AgencyÂs activities in support of national efforts should be further strengthened to ensure 
the prevention of nuclear terrorism through effective physical protection. Greece was participating in 
the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database and was assisting in the drafting of relevant Agency 
recommendations and guidance documents. It encouraged the Agency to supply nuclear detection 
equipment to all States in need thereof. 
247. The fact that the nuclear security challenge was global and thus required a global response had 
been recognized at the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington earlier in the year. His country 
appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to provide nuclear security services, and its willingness and 
availability to contribute to national nuclear security programmes. 
248. The successful outcome of the recent NPT Review Conference had enhanced international 
confidence in the non-proliferation regime. The Agency had a very substantive role to play through its 
verification activities. Greece fully supported all the elements contained in the final document of that 
Conference. 
249. The continuing success of Agency safeguards depended to a great extent on political support at 
the international and regional levels to ensure compliance with non-proliferation obligations. Greece 
supported all efforts aimed at further strengthening the AgencyÂs role. Clear goals should be set for the 
implementation of integrated safeguards and information-driven safeguards, and it was vital that the 
safeguards system continue to be effective. All NPT States should conclude a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in order to achieve a global verification standard. 
250. It was important for the Agency to expand implementation of up-to-date safeguards 
technologies for measurement and remote monitoring. Also, it should assist Member States with 
implementation of safeguards agreements and other relevant instruments. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 34 
251. It was equally important that more States ratify the CTBT and negotiate and bring into force a 
non-discriminatory and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty banning 
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. 
252. In his latest report on the implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement with the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Director General had once again pointed out that Iran had not provided the 
necessary cooperation to allow the Agency to confirm that all the nuclear material in the country was 
being used for peaceful activities. The Agency was also still unable to provide credible assurances 
regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material or facilities. Greece was concerned that Iran was 
violating binding resolutions of the Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council and 
was withholding cooperation in connection with the alleged military dimensions of its nuclear 
programme. 
253. It was regrettable that Iran had been reluctant to respond in time to the proposal put forward by 
the Agency in October 2009, following consultations with Iran, France, Russia and the United States 
of America, concerning fuelling of the Tehran research reactor. Instead, Iran continued to enrich 
uranium and had almost doubled the amount of LEU it had produced. 
254. Against that background, his country hoped that Iran would engage immediately in diplomatic 
negotiations with the five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany to resolve all the 
outstanding issues. IranÂs recent objection to the designation of two Agency inspectors and its 
questioning of the professionalism and impartiality of the Secretariat were not contributing to the 
required transparency. 
255. In the same vein, Greece called on the Syrian Arab Republic to improve its hitherto insufficient 
cooperation with the Agency. 
256. As for the DPRK, his Government deplored the recent tensions on the Korean Peninsula and the 
lack of full implementation by the DPRK of all its nuclear non-proliferation obligations, jeopardizing 
all the efforts that were being made within the framework of the six-party talks to achieve complete, 
verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The DPRKÂs continuing policy of 
keeping Agency inspectors out of the country rendered it impossible for the Agency to perform its 
crucial role in accordance with the comprehensive safeguards agreement and Security Council 
resolutions. 
257. Greece supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to mobilize all available resources in order to 
increase the AgencyÂs activities in the area of the peaceful applications of nuclear technology in food 
and agriculture, water management, the environment, and disease prevention and control. 
258. It was important to note that efforts were being made to increase cooperation not only with the 
scientific authorities of Member States, but also with other international organizations on projects of 
common interest in the field of natural sciences. One such example was the strengthening of PACT 
and the partnership agreements concluded with international cancer organizations and agencies, 
including close cooperation with the WHO. A number of countries in Africa and Latin America had 
received assistance through that programme. 
259. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission was recognized as an Agency regional training centre 
for radiation protection and nuclear security. It organized and hosted on a regular basis the upgraded 
postgraduate course on radiation protection and the safety of radioactive sources. The next course was 
due to start in October 2011. 
260. The successful cooperation between the Agency and the Commission in the field of education 
and training was expected to be reflected in a long-term agreement establishing the terms of reference 
for the Commission as a regional training centre in Europe for nuclear, radiation, transport and waste 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 35 
safety. In March 2010, the European Conference on Individual Monitoring of Ionizing Radiation had 
been held in Athens. It had been organized by the Greek Atomic Energy Commission under the 
auspices of the European Commission in cooperation with the Agency and the European Radiation 
Dosimetry Group. 
261. In 2009, the Greek Atomic Energy Commission had applied for an IRRS mission, the first part 
of which involved a self-assessment. 
262. Greece fully supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, the pillar of the 
AgencyÂs activities which had a socio-economic impact on Member States. That programme was 
directly related to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, in that it effectively addressed 
the major challenges facing the developing world. He stressed the need for an improved technical 
cooperation strategy that reflected new trends and realities worldwide. Activities under the technical 
cooperation programme should contribute to enhancing nuclear and radiation safety and security. 
263. With regard to management of the technical cooperation programme, additional efforts should 
be made to achieve a high level of coordination with all related United Nations organizations, and to 
address the new challenges at the international and regional levels. Interdepartmental cooperation 
remained a high priority, and interaction between the Secretariat and Member States and their 
institutions was also necessary to facilitate cooperation on agreed objectives at national and regional 
levels. 
264. Greek scientists were participating actively in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, 
inter alia through expert missions, scientific visits and hosting of fellows at Greek laboratories free of 
charge. There was increasing participation by Greek scientists in regional projects and Greece was 
looking forward to the forthcoming technical cooperation cycles. 
265. The continued expansion of nuclear energy and use of sensitive technologies and materials 
required vigilance, full cooperation with the Agency and intensive international collaboration so as to 
minimize the risks of proliferation. 
266. Mr KUBELKA (Croatia) welcomed the adoption of the final document by the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference, which demonstrated the joint commitment of all Member States to work together 
on the three pillars of the NPT, namely the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, non-proliferation and 
disarmament. Croatia also appreciated all the international efforts made during the year with respect to 
nuclear security and non-proliferation, in particular the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington 
and the New START agreement signed between the United States and the Russian Federation. 
267. Turning to events in his own country, he said that, on 1 April 2010, a new radiological and 
nuclear safety act had come into force in Croatia establishing the State Office for Radiological and 
Nuclear Safety, which would take over from the State Office for Radiation Protection and the State 
Office for Nuclear Safety when it became operational later in the year. 
268. At the end of 2009, his Government had declared the existing storage facility located at the 
Ruder BoÂkovic Institute the central national radioactive waste storage facility. The financial resources 
needed for operation of the facility had been secured and the storage facility would be improved 
through an ongoing technical cooperation project. Moreover, the project to improve the conditions for 
radioactive waste storage at the Ruder BoÂkovic Institute proposed under the European Union 
2010 Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance programme was awaiting approval. 
269. As part of the national energy strategy approved by the Croatian parliament in October 2009, 
the Croatian nuclear energy programme had been launched. A decision by the Croatian Government 
on the construction of a nuclear power plant was expected by the end of 2012. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 36 
270. Nuclear proliferation, in particular the acquisition and use by non-State actors of nuclear 
material, was a continuing threat. Croatia, which was implementing integrated safeguards and used all 
its nuclear facilities for exclusively peaceful purposes, supported efforts to strengthen the verification 
system and called upon all States to conclude and bring into force a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and additional protocol. 
271. Every country should have the right to peaceful uses of nuclear energy in full compliance with 
international safety, security and non-proliferation instruments. Croatia had established relevant 
institutional capacities for the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. 
Radiation detection portal monitors procured within the framework of the European Union PHARE 
2006 project had been installed at main border crossings, and several other border crossings would be 
equipped through the United StatesÂ Second Line of Defense Program. Countries in south-east Europe, 
including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia and the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia had agreed to notify each other of incidences of illicit trafficking in nuclear 
and other radioactive material. Croatia had also been participating actively in all activities relating to 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
272. One of the most important aspects of collaboration between Croatia and the Agency was 
technical cooperation, and his country was grateful for the assistance it had received under the 
technical cooperation programme. In the 2009Â2011 cycle, five national projects based on the 
priorities set out in the countryÂs current CPF were being implemented, covering applications of 
radiation in medicine, improvement of nuclear and radiation safety infrastructure, and implementation 
of nuclear techniques in environmental protection. For the 2012Â2013 cycle, Croatia had submitted 
eight project proposals which had been prioritized in accordance with the CPF, taking into account 
CroatiaÂs new energy strategy. 
273. Croatia fully supported the AgencyÂs activities to enhance regional cooperation and exchange of 
knowledge through regional projects. It actively participated in regional projects, in particular through 
the organization of meetings and workshops in research institutions and other relevant institutions in 
Croatia. A significant number of foreign experts had been trained in Croatia under the AgencyÂs 
fellowship programme. Croatia strongly supported the goals of the technical cooperation programme 
in Europe and welcomed the adoption of the regional strategy for technical cooperation in Europe. 
274. Budgetary issues were of particular importance in the light of the global financial crisis. 
Without adequate funding, the Agency would be unable to fulfil its statutory tasks. Croatia had 
continued to fulfil its financial obligations to the Agency and expected all Member States to do 
likewise. 
275. Mr DÂUJANGA (Uganda), said that the Government and the people of his country were grateful 
for the AgencyÂs ongoing support in the areas of health, water, agriculture and industry, where the 
peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology were of vital importance. 
276. Uganda was experiencing an increase in the incidence of cancer, especially cervical cancer. The 
Agency was providing assistance in radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services, which had enhanced 
the capacity of the Ministry of Health to provide care for all patients. He thanked the Director General 
for his strong support in the fight against cancer. 
277. Access to drinking water continued to be a major problem in many developing countries, 
including Uganda, and the country greatly valued the AgencyÂs ongoing support for the use of isotope 
hydrology to assess underground water resources and develop and implement comprehensive water 
supply strategies for rural and emerging urban areas. 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 37 
278. The work of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture to 
develop disease- and drought-resistant varieties of crops and improve animal production had gone a 
long way towards improving food availability in Uganda and other developing countries. The 
AgencyÂs contribution to the development of improved crop varieties to cope with a growing 
population and climate change were likewise appreciated. 
279. Access to reliable and affordable energy was essential for economic and social development. 
Fossil fuels and renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, biomass, and wind 
power would eventually be insufficient to meet the energy demands of a rapidly growing population, 
and other energy sources, such as nuclear power, would need to be included in the energy mix. The 
use of nuclear technology for civilian purposes, such as the generation of electricity, was the right of 
every country and would help mitigate global warming and climate change. 
280. For the aforementioned reasons, Uganda was putting in place capacity to develop a peaceful 
nuclear power programme under Agency safeguards and safety regimes and greatly appreciated the 
AgencyÂs support Â through both the Department of Technical Cooperation and the Department of 
Nuclear Energy Â to countries interested in launching nuclear power programmes. 
281. His Government urged all countries to work towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Those 
that had such weapons should work to get rid of them under an internationally agreed and verifiable 
treaty, and those that did not have them should not seek to acquire them. 
282. Like other developing countries, Uganda was putting in place an effective legal and regulatory 
framework for nuclear energy applications, and considerable progress had been made despite many 
challenges. The Agency should approach the peculiar situation of developing countries with 
understanding and give them the assistance they required in connection with nuclear science 
applications, especially in critical areas such as radiotherapy. 
283. In conclusion, he expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs support, which had enabled his 
country to provide appropriate services in the areas of food and agriculture, water resources 
development, energy resources development, human health and the development of national radiation 
safety and protection infrastructure. Uganda would continue to support the Agency and all its 
activities, believing that through the joint efforts of Member States and the Secretariat the Agency 
would be able to fulfil its missions and contribute further to the peaceful use of atomic energy. 
284. Mr NYAPHISI (Lesotho) noted the important developments that had taken place over the 
preceding year in moving towards a nuclear-free world, namely the Nuclear Security Summit that had 
been held in Washington in April 2010 and the NPT Review Conference organized by the 
United Nations in New York in May 2010. His country welcomed the consensus reached on the action 
plans related to nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful application of nuclear 
energy, as well as the proposed convening of a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
285. Lesotho strongly supported the work of the Agency to strengthen the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the safeguards regime. In that regard, he was pleased to inform the Conference that the 
Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho had signed an additional protocol to its NPT safeguards 
agreement in April 2010. 
286. Recognizing the importance of regional cooperation as an important means of accelerating 
economic growth and its development agenda, Lesotho had just acceded to AFRA. 
287. Furthermore, his country had acceded to the CPPNM, had ratified the International Convention 
for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism at the 2010 Treaty Event held at United Nations 
Headquarters in New York, and would be signing the Revised Supplementary Agreement Concerning 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 38 
the Provision of Technical Assistance by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Government 
of the Kingdom of Lesotho in Vienna in the coming days. 
288. His country was grateful to the Agency for all the support and guidance it had provided. 
Following the successful advisory and fact-finding missions to Lesotho earlier in the year, it was 
considering joining the relevant international instruments for promoting safety, facilitating 
cooperation, and for exchange of experience. It had also embarked on a programme to draw up 
legislation for the establishment of a nuclear regulatory authority. 
289. Preparations were under way, with Agency support, for LesothoÂs CPF, and his country was 
looking forward to further Agency guidance in the formulation of projects for the 2012Â2013 technical 
cooperation programme cycle. 
290. Finally, he reaffirmed LesothoÂs support for and commitment to the AgencyÂs mandate to use 
atoms for peace, health and prosperity. 
291. Mr AL-ERYANI (Yemen) reaffirmed his countryÂs support for all the activities undertaken by 
the Agency, especially those in the areas of radiation protection, health, agriculture, electricity 
generation, water desalination, industry, science and technology. He urged Member States to make use 
of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy for the benefit of their peoples under the umbrella of the 
non-proliferation regime, including Agency comprehensive safeguards. The AgencyÂs role should be 
strengthened with a view to achieving equality among States as well as international peace and 
security. 
292. Yemen was grateful for the AgencyÂs generous support for the dissemination of peaceful 
nuclear technology through its technical cooperation projects. He underlined two areas in particular 
where the AgencyÂs assistance had been of crucial importance: firstly, in the establishment of radiation 
oncology centres in SanaÂa and in Aden, and in training medical staff working in those centres; and 
secondly, in drafting YemenÂs nuclear law in line with Agency-approved standards. Work on that law 
would continue in cooperation with the main technical partner in Yemen, the National Atomic Energy 
Commission. 
293. His country upheld the inalienable right of all States to use nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes, as provided for in the NPT, which right was not subject to any political limitations. It also 
underscored the need for strict compliance with Agency comprehensive safeguards and for 
strengthening of the AgencyÂs role as the main pillar of the NPT. 
294. His country was engaging in initiatives aimed at controlling the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and creating regions free of weapons of mass destruction, especially in the Middle East 
where uncertainty reigned on account of the imbalance of power among its States and the presence of 
nuclear activities not subject to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
295. While all the Arab States had acceded to the NPT and reaffirmed their continuing readiness to 
take steps towards the establishment of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, Israel 
continued to defy the international community by refusing to accede to the NPT and place all its 
nuclear installations under Agency comprehensive safeguards. It also rejected all international 
initiatives aimed at achieving universality of the NPT and nuclear disarmament in the region. That 
increased instability in the region and made an arms race more likely, potentially with dire 
consequences. 
296. General Conference resolution GC(53)/RES/17, adopted the preceding year, expressed the 
concern of Member States over Israeli nuclear capabilities and called upon Israel to accede to the NPT 
and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency comprehensive safeguards. The final document of the 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 39 
2010 NPT Review Conference had referred to that resolution. Both documents reflected fears over the 
threat posed by Israeli nuclear capabilities to peace and security in the Middle East. 
297. Referring to the Director GeneralÂs report Â contained in document GC(54)/14 Â on 
implementation of the aforementioned resolution, he expressed regret that Israel remained outside the 
NPT. The report did not address any of the concerns of Member States, including those set forth in his 
own countryÂs response to the Director GeneralÂs letter, nor did it present the AgencyÂs vision with 
respect to implementation of the resolution. 
298. In light of the above, he called upon Member States to support the draft resolution on Israeli 
nuclear capabilities which was being tabled by the Arab Group at the current session of the General 
Conference, and appealed to them to resist any attempts to thwart it or to circumvent the call on the 
major international powers to shoulder their responsibility vis-Ã -vis the exacerbation of the situation in 
the Middle East. Those countries should exert pressure on Israel to heed the repeated calls about its 
nuclear capabilities and should eschew any application of double standards. Yemen firmly believed 
that stability and security in the Middle East were contingent upon freeing the region of nuclear 
weapons and that IsraelÂs repeated refusal to accede to the NPT proved that it harboured no genuine 
desire to achieve peace in the region. 
299. Mr RAJEMISON RAKOTOMAHARO (Madagascar) welcomed the recent initiatives of the 
international community aimed at fostering nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and the 
AgencyÂs efforts to promote the peaceful and safe uses of nuclear energy for development, including 
in the fight against cancer. His country attached great importance to accession by all countries to the 
NPT and to the universalization and strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Madagascar 
had acceded to the comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol and the modified 
SQP. It was committed to cooperating closely with the Agency in fulfilling its commitments under 
those instruments. As a party to the Pelindaba Treaty, it fully supported the establishment of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones as a means of promoting international peace and security. 
300. Nuclear applications made an essential contribution to sustainable development and the 
eradication of poverty, and his Government hoped to strengthen its cooperation with the Agency in 
order to improve its scientific, technological, regulatory and human resources capacities. Noting the 
strategic importance of national technical cooperation projects for poverty eradication, he thanked the 
Agency for the assistance his country had received in such areas as cancer control, agriculture, animal 
reproduction, water resources management, the environment, radiation protection and radioactive 
waste management. Madagascar particularly welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts under PACT and it was 
beginning to derive benefit from that programme. It looked forward to further cooperation to 
strengthen the capacity for cancer treatment in the country, which still fell short of needs. 
301. Noting the importance of technical cooperation activities, he pointed out that Madagascar had 
agreed to the renewal of the AFRA agreement for a further five years. It hoped that AFRA would play 
an active role in the establishment of the African Commission on Nuclear Energy to be set up now that 
the Pelindaba Treaty had entered into force. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), President, took the Chair. 
302. Mr BACELA (Mozambique) welcomed the decision by Swaziland, a neighbouring country of 
Mozambique, to join the Agency, as that provided enabling conditions to include nuclear technology 
utilization programmes within the framework of bilateral cooperation, which currently covered several 
areas of common interest for both countries. 
303. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs commitment to its mission to promote the peaceful and 
safe use of nuclear technologies for socio-economic development, contributing to fighting poverty and 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 40 
improving the welfare of the citizens of Member States, particularly in developing countries. The 
number of ongoing projects of a socio-economic nature in various countries testified to that 
commitment. 
304. The Agency had been contributing to the socio-economic development of Mozambique through 
technical cooperation and coordinated research projects. His country was currently implementing 
projects in such fields as radiotherapy and nuclear medicine, soil fertility, animal health and 
production, tsetse fly and trypanosomosis control, and mineral resources. 
305. MozambiqueÂs newly established regulatory authority, the National Atomic Energy Agency, 
had been working actively on drafting a comprehensive nuclear law and had already initiated actions 
aimed at regulatory infrastructure development. 
306. Like many other developing countries, Mozambique was faced with a high incidence of cancer 
all over the country. As the number of cancer patients increased, there was a concomitant increase in 
demand for radiotherapy for both curative and palliative purposes. His Government was seriously 
committed to developing the required radiotherapy capacity to ensure that oncological treatment 
reached most of the countryÂs citizens and that the number of patients seeking treatment abroad was 
reduced. 
307. One of the success factors in the utilization of nuclear technologies was development of human 
resources. Mozambique had a shortage of appropriately trained and qualified professionals in the 
relevant fields and was unable to take full advantage of nuclear technology-driven programmes. It 
therefore appreciated the fact that Agency assistance had focused on the development of human 
resources, as well as support for the Government in establishing basic nuclear infrastructure. Though 
promising progress had been made so far, it was imperative that such cooperation continue in the 
future. 
308. His country believed that the action plan agreed upon at the 2010 NPT Review Conference was 
an important sign of hope for many countries in the world where nuclear technologies could make a 
difference by contributing to various aspects of socio-economic development, including food security 
and capacity building in the sphere of medicine. 
309. He assured the Conference of MozambiqueÂs continued support for the Agency in its noble 
mission to promote the peaceful and safe utilization of nuclear technology for the benefit of humanity. 
310. Mr OLIVEIRA (ABACC) said that currently his institution was applying safeguards on all 
nuclear material at approximately 70 nuclear facilities in Brazil and Argentina through the Common 
System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials, and was carrying out about 110 inspections 
per year, under the Quadripartite Agreement between Argentina, Brazil, the Agency and ABACC 
which had entered into force in 1994. Thanks to the dedication and expertise of all concerned, 
Argentina and Brazil had carried out their activities in the nuclear field in full compliance with their 
safeguards and non-proliferation commitments. 
311. The decision of the Governments of Argentina and Brazil to reactivate their respective nuclear 
programmes for peaceful purposes, including joint undertakings, not only gave rise to an expectation 
of growth in the nuclear sector in both countries, it also opened up new opportunities and broadened 
ABACCÂs responsibilities. As the first fully operational binational organization created by both 
countries, ABACC had acquired much experience in the management of interactions and problem 
solving, which could be very useful in that context. 
312. The Presidents of Argentina and Brazil had recently held a working meeting in San Juan, 
Argentina, to review progress in bilateral cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. They had 
highlighted the specific role played by ABACC in ensuring that all nuclear activities in their countries 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 41 
were under safeguards, thus building mutual and international confidence. In addition, they had 
pointed out ABACCÂs unique contribution to the international non-proliferation regime, a regime that 
should promote cooperation and allow free access by Argentina and Brazil to sensitive technologies in 
the field of the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Thus, they had decided that the ABACC safeguards 
system must be continuously enhanced and strengthened. 
313. The ABACC Secretariat was ready to face new challenges, in line with its internal guidelines, 
including constant improvement of its technical and administrative activities. 
314. Reporting on events in the preceding year, he highlighted the visit that had been made by the 
AgencyÂs Director General to ABACC headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. That occasion had reinforced 
the understanding between the two agencies as regards the importance of mutual cooperation in the 
application of safeguards. One example of such cooperation had been the decision to implement new 
verification techniques at uranium enrichment plants and in the unattended monitoring systems that 
would be applied in various Brazilian and Argentine facilities, demonstrating the willingness of both 
countries to apply innovative technological approaches to safeguards. 
315. In 2009, ABACC had received a special invitation to participate in a consulting group meeting 
of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In its presentation, emphasis had been placed on the tasks it 
performed and the contribution of the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear 
Materials as an essential tool for the verification of nuclear activities in Argentina and Brazil. 
316. Also, ABACC had participated in the 2010 NPT Review Conference. Its statement at the 
plenary session had stressed the originality of ABACCÂs model and the atmosphere of mutual 
confidence that prevailed between the two countries. At the end of the conference, ABACC had given 
an institutional presentation as a side event. 
317. The search for excellence had been an abiding concern at ABACC. Thus, a policy had been 
developed for the qualification of its officials and team of inspectors. In those endeavours, it had 
cooperated with the Agency, the United States Department of Energy and Euratom, particularly in the 
areas of non-destructive analysis, containment and surveillance, training courses and safeguards 
approaches. ABACC encouraged participation of foreign instructors in that initiative as well as its own 
officials and national specialists, and he drew special attention to the participation of specialists from 
the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. 
318. A regional course on systems for national accounting and control of nuclear material had been 
held in Rio de Janeiro in November 2009. The aim of that course, which was organized periodically 
by the Agency, was to disseminate international safeguards procedures among facility operators and 
inspectors in national safeguards systems. 
319. With regard to cooperation with other agencies, ABACC and Euratom were currently 
developing cooperation projects for the application of more modern technologies, such as the use of 
three-dimensional laser images to verify design data and the use of ultrasonic seals. Another project 
under development related to the analysis of procedures for the common use of equipment during joint 
inspections with the Agency. 
320. There had been technical cooperation between ABACC and the Korea Institute of Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation and Control relating to exchange of information on short-notice random inspections 
and new systems and equipment for CANDU-type reactors. 
321. One way to face future challenges related to the expanded use of nuclear reactors would be to 
create independent and reliable regional systems to be applied in coordination with the Agency, thus 
optimizing use of available resources. The successes achieved during ABACCÂs almost 20 years of 
experience could serve as guidance. While regional geopolitical factors and cultural differences would 
GC(54)/OR.6 
22 September 2010, Page 42 
not allow for the direct transposition of models, the concept of developing regional agencies merited 
consideration. 
322. It was pertinent to recall that, in addition to its permanent technical and administrative staff, 
ABACCÂs model included a team of highly specialized inspectors with a thorough knowledge of the 
social, economic and political conditions in the region. That was a significant advantage when 
performing an overall analysis of the safeguards- and non-proliferation-related aspects of the situation 
in the countries concerned.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2009 (continued) 
(GC(54)/4) 
1. Mr KREIMERMAN (Uruguay) said that his country based its international activities on the 
Charter of the United Nations. It was an active member of several UN peacekeeping forces and was 
proud to be one of the first countries to be involved in new UN initiatives, including the ÂDelivering as 
OneÂ initiative. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009, 
Uruguay had announced its intention to ensure that, by 2015, 50% of its energy mix was based on 
renewable energy. 
2. Uruguay remained committed to safeguards, nuclear verification and non-proliferation, and 
considered that the best way to resolve international tensions in those areas was through dialogue and 
multilateral negotiation. It worked to identify synergies between safety and security, and to promote 
international cooperation. It supported the efforts of those countries that had developed initiatives to 
assure the non-discriminatory supply of nuclear fuel, in particular for small countries. 
3. Uruguay had continued to participate actively in the work of the Agency, and had been a 
member of the Board of Governors from 2008 to 2010. During the past year, it had assumed the 
presidency of the Board of ARCAL Representatives and the Technical Coordination Board, and had 
played an active role in the development of the Regional Strategic Profile. 
4. Turning to events within Uruguay, he said that the technical independence of the national 
regulatory authority had been strengthened by law. In the budget for 2010Â2015, provision had been 
made to double the number of technical staff in the area of ionizing radiation with a view to enhancing 
the countryÂs economic development. A medical imaging centre had been established in Uruguay with 
a cyclotron and three PET cameras for the diagnosis of cancer, heart and brain disease. An industrial 
irradiation service had also been created. The Government had ratified the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and had 
approved the national strategy for safe management of radioactive waste. It had also approved a 
national radiological emergency plan. Uruguay had ratified the additional protocol and had been 
applying integrated safeguards since January 2009. 
5. Over recent years, UruguayÂs economy had been growing on average at a rate of 6% despite the 
global financial crisis. The Government was aiming to achieve similar rates of growth in the future, 
including through strengthening and diversifying production. To that end, a long-term energy policy 
developed with representatives of all political parties had been approved. Two of the main elements of 
that policy were the achievement of greater energy efficiency and the widespread use of the renewable 
energy sources available in the country, including wind, water and sun. He was pleased to report that 
Uruguay was already ahead of schedule in achieving the ambitious goal of ensuring that renewable 
energy accounted for 50% of the primary energy mix by 2015. 
6. The Government was also considering the possibility of using nuclear energy for electricity 
generation. The commission established to study the nuclear power option comprised representatives 
from the four political parties with parliamentary representation and was working well. It was to be 
hoped that the Government and citizens of Uruguay would, within the next three years, have all the 
information they required to take an informed decision on that energy option. He thanked the Agency 
for the assistance it had provided in that regard through various regional technical cooperation 
projects, which he hoped would continue. His country was also grateful for the invitation it had 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 2 
received from the Agency to participate in the technical working group on nuclear power 
infrastructure that would meet in November to discuss the development and implementation of 
national nuclear power programmes. 
7. Lastly, he said that Uruguay had been honoured to receive a visit from the Director General in 
March and remained committed to helping the Agency achieve all of its objectives. 
8. Mr OULD HORMA (Mauritania) said his country, under President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, 
had recently embarked on a major socio-economic development campaign and was cooperating in 
every possible way with the Agency. MauritaniaÂs participation in the current session affirmed the 
importance it attached to cooperation with the Agency in a number of areas in coordination with the 
competent technical and scientific authorities. Mauritania had joined the Agency in 2004 and, 
although a relative newcomer, was endeavouring to make up for missed opportunities and participate 
in all forms of cooperation. 
9. Mauritania had enacted new laws, in particular a nuclear law that had been ratified by 
parliament in December 2009. Pursuant to that, it had established a body for the organization of 
nuclear safety and security. 
10. It had also, in coordination and cooperation with the Agency and in record time, set up a cancer 
therapy centre equipped with advanced radiotherapy techniques and trained the staff to run it. 
11. By way of an explanation for major investment in that particular area when other infrastructure 
in Mauritania was fragile, he said that for decades the health sector had suffered from neglect. That 
had led to serious deterioration in the health services at a time when there had been a rapid increase in 
the incidence of cancer. Cancer patients in Mauritania had been forced, at very high cost, to go to 
neighbouring countries for treatment. Often patients died while waiting for treatment and only 
returned home in coffins. Diagnosis and treatment were often too late. In view of that distressing 
situation, the national authorities had decided to address the problem by setting up the centre, which 
they hoped would be a model in the West African region and set an example of south-south 
cooperation. 
12. Mauritania had also cooperated with the Agency in other, non-health, areas such as water, 
animal health, agriculture and mining. He expressed MauritaniaÂs gratitude for the assistance received 
and for the SecretariatÂs efforts in that regard. 
13. He expressed MauritaniaÂs interest in and concern about the current debate on the Middle East 
with respect to who was entitled, or not, to possess nuclear energy and the concomitant fear that 
nuclear energy might be used for non-peaceful purposes. Mauritania stressed the importance of all 
countries of the region, including Israel, acceding to the NPT. There was no doubt that the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East would substantially strengthen international 
efforts to establish peace in that region. In that context, his delegation reaffirmed the need for all 
Member States to support the Agency in its leading role in deterring any use of nuclear energy for 
non-peaceful purposes and for the preservation of humanity. 
14. Ms DENGO (Costa Rica) reaffirmed her countryÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs statutory 
objectives to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity 
throughout the world. The Agency was the only international organization with the technical 
competence and capacities to contribute independently and objectively to those objectives. 
15. The importance that her country attached to the AgencyÂs activities was reflected in Costa 
RicaÂs recent effort, despite the impact of the international financial crisis on its economy, to settle its 
financial obligations. Having done so it had regained its voting rights and was looking forward to 
contributing to the discussion and decision-making on items before the General Conference. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 3 
16. It was essential that the Agency had the necessary financial resources to be able to carry out its 
important mandates and, moreover, that no mandate be given priority over any other. In fact, the 
maintenance of a balance among the three pillars of the Agency (safeguards and verification, nuclear 
safety and security, and the transfer of science and technology) was a concern that had been raised on 
several occasions by her country, GRULAC, and the Group of 77 and China. Any imbalances that 
existed in the appropriation of resources Â and increases thereof Â to the AgencyÂs Major 
Programmes must be corrected. 
17. As regards technical cooperation, the Agency should foster cooperation among the developed 
and developing countries, thereby making greater use of their respective technical capacities and 
facilitating the transfer of nuclear technology and knowledge. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme should remain the basic mechanism for the transfer of such technology for the benefit of 
all Member States. The creation of parallel programmes or alternative cooperation mechanisms should 
be avoided as they would only weaken the programme and reduce the AgencyÂs ability to interact 
effectively and efficiently with all concerned. 
18. To enhance the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, it was important 
to strengthen cooperation with other international organizations, particularly in spheres where other 
organizations had overarching competence, as was the case for health, agriculture and the 
environment. Thus, Costa Rica welcomed the fact that the Secretariat had developed the tools and 
necessary infrastructure to establish strategic alliances with other relevant international organizations, 
as well as national and regional institutions. 
19. Costa Rica took pleasure in celebrating the fact that ARCAL had been in force for 25 years. 
During the past year Costa Rica, an active participant in ARCAL activities, had been involved in 
30 projects under the Agreement, providing 27% of the extrabudgetary contributions received in 2009 
for ARCAL activities. The Agreement was an ideal vehicle for cooperation with the Agency in the 
region and her country urged the Agency to continue supporting and expanding that mechanism. 
20. Costa Rica was concerned about the low level of representation of GRULAC in senior positions 
in the Secretariat, especially considering that there were plenty of top-class professionals and experts 
in the region. She expressed the hope that the Director General would be able to correct that 
imbalance. 
21. In conclusion, she reiterated the importance Costa Rica attached to the Agency, to the decisions 
of its Board of Governors, the resolutions of the General Conference, and the reports it submitted to 
the UN General Assembly and Security Council pursuant to safeguards-related obligations. Costa Rica 
supported the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons under the NPT. 
Those efforts should continue without the hindrance of any political considerations, which undermined 
the good name the Agency had earned in that sphere over the years. 
22. Mr ALOBIDI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), pointing to the clear imbalance between nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, said that the role given to the Agency had been selective 
from the start because it covered verification of the non-diversion of nuclear material from peaceful 
use to military purposes, but did not include the verification of obligations vis-Ã -vis nuclear arms 
reduction and disarmament. 
23. As LibyaÂs President Al Qaddafi had stated before the UN General Assembly on 23 September 
2009, the Agency should undertake its verification role with respect to all States concerned without 
distinction. Further, when addressing the Security Council during the nuclear non-proliferation and 
nuclear disarmament summit on 24 September 2009, the Libyan representative had said that the 
Agency should monitor all nuclear installations without exception, including inspection of the Israeli 
Dimona reactor, otherwise all the Middle East States would have the right to possess nuclear weapons. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 4 
24. To deal with that imbalance, his country felt that the time had come for all the nuclear-weapon 
States and all States not party to the NPT to place all their nuclear facilities under comprehensive 
Agency safeguards, in accordance with the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute, for the exclusive purpose 
of verifying the compliance of the nuclear-weapon States with their obligations. 
25. In his statement to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Director General Amano had referred to 
that issue, saying that nuclear disarmament was an area of great interest for the Agency and that the 
Agency had a role to play through verification activities. He had also said that nuclear disarmament 
had a positive impact on non-proliferation efforts. 
26. Libya affirmed the importance of strengthening the AgencyÂs role in verifying disarmament by 
the nuclear-weapon States and implementation of Article VI of the NPT. It had asked the depositary 
countries to convene a conference for amendment of the Treaty and had called on all States party to 
the Treaty to support that goal through the proposal of two amendments to Article VI. Firstly, to 
ensure that the nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty worked towards general and complete 
disarmament under strict and effective international control subject to verification. Secondly, to ensure 
that all nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty accepted safeguards, as set forth in an agreement to 
be negotiated and concluded in accordance with the AgencyÂs safeguards system and Article III.1 
and 2 of the NPT, for the principal purpose of verification of the fulfilment of their obligations with a 
view to full and comprehensive nuclear disarmament. 
27. He expressed LibyaÂs appreciation for the AgencyÂs provision of technical cooperation, 
particularly in the areas of health and water resource management, in line with its national objectives 
and priorities. In implementing those activities, the Agency should refrain from subjecting assistance 
to any political or economic conditions that conflicted with the provisions of the Statute. Libya 
underlined the right of the developing countries to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear 
technology, to obtain nuclear equipment and material, and to the transfer of related scientific and 
technological information. 
28. In that context he emphasized, firstly, the inalienable right of States party to the NPT to develop 
research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including the nuclear fuel cycle. 
Secondly, the Agency was the sole competent authority entrusted with the task of inspection and 
verification. There was a need to expand that competence to include all States, nuclear and 
non-nuclear, so that the Agency was indeed an international agency. Thirdly, there was no need for 
any new standards or guidelines for the selection of technical cooperation projects since they were 
already effective and sufficient. Fourthly, the proposal regarding assurance of nuclear fuel supply had 
numerous technical, legal, commercial and economic aspects which should be examined in depth and 
be the subject of transparent negotiation. 
29. Libya attached great importance to nuclear and radiation safety. It had acceded to a number of 
conventions and treaties, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on Early 
Notification of a Nuclear Accident, and it also took part in related activities. It had set up an office of 
radiation monitoring and nuclear safety having the functions and competences of a future independent 
supervisory authority in line with the AgencyÂs standards and the applicable national legislation. Also, 
Libya had acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and had ratified 
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. It supported the role 
assumed by the Agency in combating the threat of nuclear terrorism. 
30. Libya valued the AgencyÂs efforts to verify IranÂs nuclear programme and welcomed its 
conclusion about the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in that country. Libya urged Iran to 
continue its cooperation with the Agency in order to resolve all the related issues, including those 
regarding any possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme. Libya called for a resumption of 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 5 
dialogue and negotiation, which was the best way to resolve all issues; the use of threat and sanctions 
as a way of coercing States to relinquish their sovereignty and rights had proved unsuccessful in the 
past and would do so in the future. Libya also called on the international community to treat the 
nuclear programmes of all States equally and to avoid a policy of double standards. Thus, pressure 
should be applied on Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear installations under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
31. Israel had used force against a military site on Syrian territory claiming that it was being used 
for nuclear purposes. That was a flagrant violation of international law. In addition, the Agency had 
been hindered in fully carrying out its duties in that regard. It was surprising that the focus of attention 
had turned on the victim, a party to the NPT, when it would have been more appropriate to condemn 
and impose sanctions on the aggressor. That approach could only feed the rise in extremism and 
violence in the world. IsraelÂs blatant aggression had been strongly condemned by the Arab States at 
the summit held in Sirt, Libya, in March 2010. Libya urged Syria to exercise transparency and to 
continue cooperating with the Agency in order to resolve the matter. 
32. The Israeli nuclear programme, which was still outside the AgencyÂs safeguards regime because 
Israel refused to accede to the NPT, represented a direct threat to international peace and security in 
the world, and especially in the Middle East region. It weakened the credibility of the NPT 
non-proliferation regime and, consequently, contributed to an arms race in the region. 
33. He expressed LibyaÂs disappointment at the support given to Israel by some States, especially 
some nuclear-weapon States which had greater responsibilities in achieving universality of the NPT as 
regards nuclear disarmament, and at the fact that they continued to cast a blind eye on IsraelÂs 
possession of military nuclear capabilities, which constituted a threat to international peace and 
security. Libya warned that a policy of double standards would only exacerbate tension in the region. 
34. Libya paid tribute to all those States which had supported the Arab resolution on Israeli nuclear 
capabilities (GC(53)/RES/17) in 2009 and called upon those States which had abstained or voted 
against that resolution then to reconsider their position during the current session in the interests of 
global peace and security. He expressed the hope that there would be exhaustive and substantive 
discussion of the item. 
35. The objective of the Resolution on the Middle East adopted in 1995 by the NPT Review and 
Extension Conference had been to set up a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. In its Final 
Document, the 2010 NPT Review Conference had reiterated that goal, noted the lack of progress in 
implementation of the 1995 Resolution, and reaffirmed the importance of IsraelÂs accession to the 
NPT and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. It had also 
reaffirmed the urgency and importance of achieving universality of the Treaty. In addition, the 
2010 Conference had called for the convening of a conference in 2012, attended by all States of the 
Middle East, on the establishment of a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of 
mass destruction. Libya expressed some concern about the success of that conference in light of the 
aggressive policy and nature of the Israeli regime, which neither respected international law nor had a 
sincere desire to achieve peace and security in the region. Instead, Israel favoured the advancement of 
its own military nuclear programmes. Nevertheless, Libya felt that the States which had embraced the 
1995 Resolution on the Middle East should uphold their responsibilities and that the resolution should 
be implemented without delay. 
36. In conclusion, he reiterated the need for nuclear disarmament and called on all the 
nuclear-weapon States to eliminate their nuclear arsenals and halt all programmes aimed at the 
development of such weapons, thereby complying with their legal obligations under Article VI of the 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 6 
NPT. The onus should clearly be borne by the States possessing such weapons to take concrete steps 
to rid the world of the threat they posed. 
37. Mr York Chor TAN (Singapore) agreed with the Director GeneralÂs view that the AgencyÂs 
promotion of nuclear safety and security and nuclear science and technology needed to be 
strengthened and strongly supported his focus on the fight against cancer, especially in developing 
countries. At the same time, nuclear non-proliferation remained an important Agency mission, and 
safeguards and verification were important tools in that work. 
38. Singapore welcomed the decision of the 2010 NPT Review Conference to convene a conference 
in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of 
mass destruction. The path ahead would not be easy, and all parties must demonstrate political will to 
ensure a successful conference. Putting any country under undue pressure would facilitate neither 
preparations for the 2012 conference nor the negotiation of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, 
which Singapore had always supported. 
39. Although the NPT States parties had been able to agree on the action section of the Review 
ConferenceÂs Final Document after an impasse of over 10 years, it was regrettable that discussions had 
continued to be highly polarized and that it had not been possible to reach an agreement that would 
further advance nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Much of the Final DocumentÂs language had even regressed compared with the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference. The credibility and relevance of the NPT would remain in question if key parties 
did not demonstrate leadership and the political will to advance the agenda of the Treaty. 
Nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States alike must abide by their respective rights and 
obligations as laid out in the Treaty. Singapore continued to support universalization of the NPT. 
40. While it was the inalienable right of NPT States parties to pursue peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, all rights entailed responsibilities. As more countries explored the use of nuclear energy, it was 
necessary to guard against nuclear proliferation. Singapore was concerned by a few countriesÂ 
non-cooperation with the Agency in the important area of safeguards and verification. The DPRK had 
withdrawn from the NPT in January 2003 and had ceased all cooperation with the Agency in April 
2009. Though Iran had provided assurances regarding its declared nuclear materials and facilities, its 
undeclared nuclear plans and activities and its lack of full cooperation with the Agency created a lack 
of confidence and left the Agency unable to draw a conclusion concerning the peaceful nature of all its 
nuclear activities. Singapore therefore strongly urged Iran to strengthen its cooperation with the 
Agency and abide by its international obligations, including Security Council resolutions and 
decisions by the AgencyÂs Board of Governors. 
41. Singapore welcomed the International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy in Paris in 
March and the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington in April and hoped that the latter would create 
momentum to strengthen global nuclear security and the AgencyÂs work in that area. Organizers and 
participants should reach out to and include as many countries in the process as possible. 
42. Singapore reiterated its support of the Agency as it prepared to join the AgencyÂs Board of 
Governors for the term 2010Â2012. The country welcomed the strengthening of its ties and 
cooperation with the Agency over the previous year. In January the Director General had met with 
Foreign Minister George Yeo on the margins of the Davos World Economic Forum, and during his 
visit to Singapore in August he had had good discussions with the countryÂs leadership on the 
challenges and opportunities facing the Agency. 
43. Singapore would be working closely with the Agency as it prepared a pre-feasibility study to 
explore whether nuclear power should be part of the countryÂs energy mix, and in that context 
SingaporeÂs Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Trade and Industry had made an official visit to 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 7 
the Agency in April. Agency missions to Singapore had included an IPPAS mission in November 
2009 and a workshop on the additional protocol and trade control in August 2010. 
44. Singapore appreciated the AgencyÂs contributions to the ASEAN Regional Forum 
inter-sessional meeting on non-proliferation and disarmament, held in July 2010 in Singapore, on the 
theme ÂPeaceful uses of nuclear energy and technologyÂ. Participants had agreed that the objective of 
a multilateral fuel cycle was to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and that it was 
complementary to a global non-proliferation regime. Singapore had also hosted a World Nuclear 
University course in May 2010 on key current issues in the global nuclear industry including a public 
lecture on the safety and security of nuclear power plants in urban settings. 
45. Recognizing the importance of sufficient, assured and predictable funding for the Technical 
Cooperation Fund, Singapore announced that in 2011 it would continue to pledge and contribute its 
full share. It would also continue to strengthen technical cooperation with the Agency bilaterally and 
regionally through the RCA. Since 2001, 21 scientific visits, 80 fellowships and 24 regional training 
events had been conducted with the Agency, mainly in the areas of human health and radiation 
protection, and over the previous year in particular Singapore had provided technical assistance to 
many developing countries in Asia. It had signed its Country Programme Framework in February 
2010. 
46. Singapore supported strengthening international and regional safety and security standards and 
encouraged Member States considering nuclear power to establish an effective regulatory, 
administrative and legislative infrastructure. In that context, Singapore would work towards accession 
to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the 2005 Amendment thereto 
and would join the Illicit Trafficking Database. 
47. The AgencyÂs role remained essential, especially as more countries explored the use of nuclear 
energy, science and technology, and support needed to continue for the three main pillars of its 
activities. Discussions at Agency meetings, including those of the Board, however, had become too 
political and polarized, and Member States needed to put aside their differences to give the Agency the 
necessary resources to respond credibly, professionally and effectively to the challenges facing it. 
48. Mr Dinh Tien LE (Vietnam) said that his countryÂs consistent policy was one of responsible and 
peaceful use of nuclear energy to further the socio-economic development of the country and improve 
the peopleÂs quality of life. Vietnam had recently decided to launch its own nuclear power programme, 
with the first plant scheduled to begin operation by the year 2020. Nuclear power was expected to 
occupy a significant place in VietnamÂs electricity generation system in future. 
49. VietnamÂs nuclear infrastructure was still underdeveloped. As well as mobilizing domestic 
resources, the Government was strengthening its international cooperation in the field of nuclear 
energy, especially with the Agency and countries expert in nuclear science, technology and industry. 
Vietnam commended the Agency on its efforts to support countries which were introducing or 
restarting a nuclear power programme. 
50. Vietnam attached great importance to the implementation of its cooperation programme with the 
Agency in the fields of nuclear safety and security, safeguards and technical cooperation. The 
programme had achieved productive results in the training of human resources, the improvement of 
the national infrastructure for nuclear power and the increased use of radiation applications in many 
socio-economic spheres. All VietnamÂs technical cooperation projects in the 2009Â2011 cycle, 
including three projects related to nuclear power, were going well. On 28 April 2010, the Bhabhatron 
II therapy unit donated by the Government of India through the PACT programme had been 
inaugurated at the Can Tho Oncology Hospital in the south of Vietnam. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 8 
51. Nuclear energy played an increasingly important role in the modern world in ensuring security 
of energy supplies, environmental protection and sustainable development. However, it also posed 
great challenges, including national infrastructure development, nuclear safety and security and 
non-proliferation. Vietnam had fulfilled its obligations to the Agency and participated in international 
initiatives for the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy. It had participated in the 
International Conference on Access to Civil Nuclear Energy, held in Paris in March 2010, and the 
Nuclear Security Summit, held in Washington, DC, in April 2010. Vietnam had also decided to accede 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and had declared its support for the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism in March 2010. Vietnam also continued to cooperate with the Agency, the United 
States and the Russian Federation in implementing the full core conversion of the Dalat nuclear 
research reactor from HEU to LEU and cooperated with the Agency, the European Union and other 
countries on a number of projects related to safety and security. 
52. In conclusion, he commended all the staff of the Agency for their dedicated and effective work 
and reaffirmed VietnamÂs full support for the activities of the Agency in promoting the use of nuclear 
energy for peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity. 
53. Mr LUMBANGA (Tanzania) reaffirmed his countryÂs unwavering support for the AgencyÂs 
dual function of ensuring the peaceful and safe use of nuclear technology and the non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Those two missions were fundamental and went hand in hand. 
54. Under the various relevant multilateral agreements, safeguards agreements, conventions and 
treaties to which it was party, Tanzania had been cooperating on various programmes to promote the 
peaceful use of nuclear technology and to ensure security and safety. In addition, it had been 
supporting nuclear non-proliferation and meeting its safeguards obligations, and it had been 
contributing its full share of the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and of the TCF target. 
55. Hs country was grateful to the Agency for all the support it had been given, in particular via the 
technical cooperation programme through the successful implementation of national and regional 
projects. Tanzania had benefited specifically in the spheres of health, agriculture, water resource 
management, safety, security, and the building of capacities and of regulatory infrastructure. 
56. With a view to consolidating the achievements made so far under Agency technical cooperation, 
Tanzania had submitted a new Country Programme Note. That Note emphasized the national poverty 
eradication strategy, which not only was the main thrust of national development objectives but also 
contributed to attainment of the MDGs. The programmes in the new cycle focused on end-user 
oriented activities with visible socio-economic impact and, at the same time, addressed broader 
national, rather than institutional, needs. They included activities that promoted the utilization of 
technologies to ensure food security by, for example, reducing post-harvest losses and enhancing 
water resource management. 
57. Tanzania commended the AgencyÂs decision to focus the 2010 Scientific Forum on the topic of 
cancer in developing countries. The number of reported cancer cases in Tanzania was approximately 
35 000 per year. The diagnostic and treatment capacity of the Ocean Road Cancer Institute, the only 
cancer centre in the country, was still inadequate and only a small proportion of cases could be dealt 
with there. 
58. In that context, Tanzania was grateful for the AgencyÂs efforts under PACT to strengthen the 
capacity of the Ocean Road Cancer Institute, thereby making Tanzania a model for cancer therapy in 
Africa. It was also grateful to the Agency for establishing radiotherapy services and a 
radioimmunoassay laboratory, which were very important in the early detection of cancer. Support for 
further cancer centres in the country would increase early detection capabilities and ensure greater 
access to life-saving treatment for those cases diagnosed. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 9 
59. The energy and mining sectors were critical to TanzaniaÂs economy and to poverty eradication. 
He expressed his countryÂs gratitude for the support given thus far by the Agency, through regional 
projects and expert services, in developing regulations for the mining and milling of radioactive ores, 
including uranium. Tanzania would continue to work closely with the Agency to prepare an 
appropriate legal framework to ensure that uranium exploitation was conducted according to Agency 
standards. Also, it requested technical assistance in the development and utilization of capabilities to 
assess radiological safety in mines with respect to technologically enhanced naturally occurring 
radioactive material and pollution. 
60. Tanzania generated energy from a variety of sources, such as natural gas, coal, hydropower, 
solar and biomass. It had one of the worldÂs lowest per capita electricity consumptions, largely due to 
the high cost of generation. Nuclear electricity generation was now being given priority for inclusion 
in the national energy mix. Like other developing Member States, Tanzania was interested in having a 
sustainable nuclear power sector and sought Agency support in the development and deployment of a 
safe and economically viable small or medium-size reactor. 
61. Tanzania had been active in dealing with illicit trafficking in nuclear and radiological material. 
It acknowledged the AgencyÂs role in assisting Member States to establish and maintain effective 
nuclear security through capacity-building and human resource management, and to implement the 
relevant legal instruments for international nuclear security and safety. Tanzania would continue to 
cooperate with the Agency and other Member States in putting in place systems for emergency 
response, notification, licensing, import and export, entry point control, inspection, and enforcement of 
the radiation safety and security of nuclear and radioactive sources. 
62. Tanzania would continue to meet its financial commitments to the Agency and its obligations 
under the various agreements to which it was party. Also, it was committed to establishing an adequate 
legal framework to govern the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear technology. 
63. Tanzania believed that the challenges facing the Agency were not insurmountable provided 
Member States and other key stakeholders worked together in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), President, took the Chair. 
64. Mr WIN (Myanmar) expressed his countryÂs appreciation to the Director General and his staff 
for the activities carried out during the past year in fulfilment of the AgencyÂs mandate. 
65. The Annual Report for 2009 offered a comprehensive review of the AgencyÂs continued efforts 
during the past year in the areas of nuclear power, nuclear fuel cycle and materials, nuclear science, 
capacity-building, nuclear knowledge management, food and agriculture, human health, water 
resources, the environment, radiation technology, radioisotope production, the safety of nuclear 
installations, radiation and transport safety, radioactive waste management, nuclear security, technical 
cooperation and the verification of compliance with nuclear non-proliferation undertakings. 
66. The use of coal and other fossil fuels for electricity generation had given rise to concerns about 
global warming. Nuclear power, on the other hand, was becoming an important contributor to meeting 
carbon emission limits and addressing climate change problems. Myanmar supported the AgencyÂs 
activities to assist Member States in launching nuclear power programmes, to increase public 
awareness about nuclear power, and to enhance StatesÂ capacities to improve nuclear power plant 
operating performance, life cycle management, human performance and quality assurance, as well as 
to develop innovative nuclear technology systems. 
67. The Agency would continue to play a vital role in promoting prosperity and combating climate 
change by helping Member States to build the necessary infrastructure for the safe, secure and 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 10 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, and also in improving human welfare around the world through the use 
of nuclear technology for food, medicine and safe drinking water. 
68. The AgencyÂs technical assistance programme offered important benefits to Member States and 
made a fundamental contribution to sustainable development in various economic sectors in 
developing countries. Myanmar was grateful for the AgencyÂs role in the transfer of nuclear science 
and technology and in promoting peaceful uses of atomic energy under the three pillars of its mandate. 
69. Through the joint FAO/IAEA programme, the Agency was helping developing countries to 
implement modern plant breeding programmes using radiation-induced mutation and 
efficiency-enhancing molecular technologies. Nuclear techniques were being used to enhance crop 
biodiversity and adaptability, improving the yield and quality of various crop mutants. The Agency 
was also assisting Member States in the application of nuclear technology to improve livestock 
productivity and health. The programme was therefore contributing to environmentally sustainable 
food security in those countries. 
70. With Agency assistance, capacities in the developing countries had been enhanced with regard 
to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of health problems by applying nuclear technology within 
the framework of quality assurance. In particular, PACT and the WHO-IAEA joint programme on 
cancer control were saving the lives of many cancer patients in developing countries through 
radiotherapy. Training opportunities in cancer control had increased through the PACT regional 
cancer training networks and the AgencyÂs Virtual University for Cancer Control. 
71. In Myanmar, the AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects had been of particular significance in 
helping to achieve the national development objectives. Current priority areas were agriculture, 
livestock production and health, human health, strengthening of national capacity in nuclear science 
and technology, radiation safety, water resource management and industrial applications of 
radioisotopes. 
72. Myanmar had ten active projects in the 2009Â2011 technical cooperation programme, five of 
which were in the field of food and agriculture, two in human health, and three in nuclear science and 
technology. In addition, Myanmar had participated in many regional and interregional projects and 
had taken part in activities under the RCA. 
73. Myanmar was a developing country with limited infrastructure, expertise and human resources 
in nuclear science and technology applications. Efforts were being made to strengthen the national 
infrastructure for the promotion of such applications for peaceful developmental purposes and 
Myanmar was interested in Agency assistance in capacity-building, developing skilled and 
well-trained human resources and establishing the required infrastructure. 
74. His Government acknowledged the support given by the Agency to Member States in the 
various areas of radiation safety, the development of safety standards and safety guides, the setting up 
of nuclear safety knowledge networks and strengthening worldwide nuclear and radiological, transport 
and waste safety by means of international safety instruments. 
75. He reiterated MyanmarÂs support for the AgencyÂs efforts to improve global nuclear security by 
promoting education in that regard and strengthening measures for the detection of illicit nuclear 
trafficking, responding to nuclear security incidents, upgrading the physical protection of nuclear 
facilities, quality control of nuclear security equipment, and facilitating and implementing 
international nuclear security instruments in Member States. 
76. Myanmar firmly supported global nuclear non-proliferation and a nuclear-weapon-free world. It 
had been party to the NPT since December 1992, signed an SQP pursuant to the NPT in 1995, the 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 11 
CTBT in 1996 and, as a member of ASEAN, had also acceded to the SEANWZ Treaty, which had 
entered into force in 1997. 
77. At the same time, Myanmar supported the legitimate right of every State to use nuclear energy 
for peaceful purposes. It believed in the principles of non-politicization of the NPT and 
non-discrimination against developing countries in the implementation of the NPT. 
78. Myanmar had been a steadfast contributor to regional peace and stability in collaboration with 
other ASEAN Member States. In the past year there had been unfounded allegations reported in the 
international media that Myanmar was attempting to develop a nuclear weapons programme. He 
reaffirmed that the applications of nuclear science and technology in Myanmar were for peaceful 
developmental purposes only and that Myanmar would never engage in activities related to the 
production and proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
79. In conclusion, he thanked the Agency on behalf of his Government for its dedicated efforts and 
excellent contributions to the promotion of safe, secure and peaceful uses of atomic energy. He 
reiterated MyanmarÂs firm support for the activities carried out by the Agency in fulfilment of its 
mandate. 
80. Ms PHETCHARATANA (Thailand) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs contribution to 
the advancement of nuclear science and technology, as well as applications of nuclear techniques, in a 
number of areas for the benefit of all sectors of society. Also, Thailand recognized the AgencyÂs 
important task in verifying the peaceful nature of nuclear activities undertaken by States party to the 
NPT. Agency safeguards were a vital tool for ensuring the use of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
81. The global communityÂs reliance on the Agency in those two interrelated aspects had been 
reaffirmed at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, held in New York. In addition, it was worth noting 
that support had been widely expressed at that Conference for equipping the Agency with adequate 
resources for its extensive responsibilities. 
82. With only five years to go until the 2015 deadline for achievement of the MDGs, many 
countries were intensifying their efforts to accelerate progress to that end. Thailand recognized the 
significant contribution of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme to socio-economic 
development in Member States, particularly in the areas of electricity generation, medicine and health, 
food and agriculture, environmental protection, water resources management and industry, and thus 
also to attainment of the MDGs. Thailand had already pledged 100% of its share of the TCF target for 
2011. 
83. Thailand had long enjoyed close cooperation with the Agency in the area of nuclear 
applications. Under the technical cooperation programme, at both the bilateral and the regional level, 
her country had improved its capacity-building and its technological expertise, especially in the 
spheres of medicine and agriculture. It now had several laboratories for radiodiagnosis and 
radiotherapy, and was home to the South East Asia regional reference laboratory for foot-and-mouth 
disease. 
84. Her delegation commended the Director GeneralÂs initiative to make cancer in developing 
countries the subject of the 2010 Scientific Forum. Cancer was responsible for more deaths globally 
than tuberculosis, HIV and malaria combined. In the developing world, early diagnosis and effective 
treatment of cancer through radiotherapy needed to be improved in order to help save more lives. 
Thailand therefore supported PACT, which made a great contribution to enhancing cancer care 
capacity and services in developing countries in an integrated and sustainable manner. Thailand 
looked forward to continuing its cancer-related technical cooperation activities in the years to come. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 12 
85. Thailand was ready to share its long experience in radiation medicine and cancer treatment with 
other Member States. It was willing to collaborate with the Agency in hosting relevant technical 
training sessions for other developing countries in Asia and the Pacific. Also, it could work with the 
Agency and WHO in establishing cancer facilities in other countries in the region. 
86. Thailand had moved ahead regarding implementation of its national power development plan, 
which included 5000 MW of nuclear power, as well as a nuclear power infrastructure establishment 
plan. In that context, she expressed her GovernmentÂs appreciation to the Agency for providing 
technical assistance through an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review. The Ministry of Energy 
anticipated finalizing the self-evaluation report by the end of 2010 for submission to the National 
Energy Policy Council and the cabinet in early 2011 for consideration as to whether Thailand would 
embark on its nuclear power development project. 
87. The Agency continued to be a cornerstone for the verification and non-diversion of peaceful 
nuclear activities. As a fundamental pillar of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, it had 
helped to create an environment conducive to cooperation and confidence-building. 
88. Thailand supported the strengthening of Agency safeguards through the conclusion of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The confidence they built contributed, 
in turn, to the AgencyÂs work in promoting peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology. 
89. Strengthening nuclear safety and security was another key element of the AgencyÂs work to 
which the international community attached great importance. With growing interest in nuclear power 
and ever-wider use of nuclear technology, there was a need for continued vigilance in both areas. 
Although safety and security were primarily national responsibilities, Thailand was aware that they 
would not be achieved in a fully comprehensive, integrated and sustainable manner without the 
technical support of the Agency. Thailand therefore commended the AgencyÂs active role in assisting 
Member States in that regard. 
90. The Nuclear Security Summit, held in Washington, DC, in 2010, had highlighted the AgencyÂs 
role in nuclear security. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the 
AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan were recognized as making a significant contribution to global 
nuclear security norm building. Thailand was convinced that the Agency should continue to play a 
central role in strengthening global nuclear security through its technical cooperation activities. 
91. International cooperative frameworks played a vital role in improving global nuclear security 
and in addressing the threat of nuclear terrorism, and that was another area in which the AgencyÂs 
technical expertise was useful. For its part, Thailand had recently joined the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 
92. At the regional level, Thailand was working closely with other ASEAN Member States within 
the framework of the Treaty on the SEANWFZ Treaty to ensure that the region could benefit from 
nuclear technology while promoting confidence about the peaceful nature of nuclear activities in the 
region. At the SEANWFZ Commission meeting held in Hanoi in July 2010, the ASEAN Member 
States had agreed to forge cooperation with other nuclear-weapon-free zones in promoting peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, and also to increase cooperation with the Agency in relevant capacity-building 
programmes. In addition, Thailand was working towards enhancing transparency regarding the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology in the region through the exchange of information on nuclear 
activities among ASEAN countries, and towards promoting cooperation amongst nuclear regulators in 
the region to strengthen exchanges of best practices on national regulations. Such regional initiatives 
would complement the work of the Agency. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 13 
93. The three pillars of the AgencyÂs work remained relevant to current international security and 
socio-economic development. The Agency had worked to bring the benefits of nuclear technology to 
Member States while minimizing the risks. The AgencyÂs effort to reinforce technical cooperation 
activities and promote close partnership with other relevant international organizations was 
commendable and ensured that the benefits of nuclear technology were having an ever-increasing 
impact. 
94. In conclusion, she reiterated ThailandÂs full support and confidence in the work of the Agency 
under the able leadership of its Director General, Yukiya Amano. 
95. Mr TOUKAN (Jordan) said his country was aware of the importance of nuclear energy and its 
applications and was convinced that it helped to achieve socio-economic development and protect the 
environment. In cooperation with the Agency over many years, Jordan had expanded its various 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy through the development of infrastructure, scientific and educational 
capacity-building, and benefits in the fields of health, medical treatment, cancer control and food 
security. It had also made strenuous efforts to make nuclear energy an alternative available to all 
Member States through its participation in various Agency activities. 
96. Convinced that nuclear energy was of strategic importance in overcoming the shortfall in 
natural resources required for sustainable energy, water desalination and to combat climate change, 
Jordan was giving priority in its nuclear programme to major projects in support of its socio-economic 
development and to meet its future energy and water needs. 
97. Under the road map for implementation of its national nuclear energy strategy, Jordan had taken 
a number of well-planned and transparent steps to contract out to companies worldwide studies 
relating to the establishment of a nuclear power plant in the country. Currently, studies were under 
way to identify the most suitable site, including the investigation of geological, seismic and 
environmental aspects. 
98. As regards identification of the right nuclear technology, the Jordan Atomic Energy 
Commission had worked together with some foreign consulting companies to consider seven bids 
based on various nuclear reactor technologies. The fundamental criteria had been the safest nuclear 
power reactors and nuclear fuel cycles based on tried and tested third-generation power reactors that 
met the highest international standards of nuclear safety and security. After comprehensive evaluation, 
three bids put forward by three foreign companies had been selected from which would be chosen the 
most appropriate technology and the strategic partner to become a potential investor in and operator of 
the Jordanian nuclear power plant in the near future. 
99. Jordan had major uranium ore resources; indeed, that was one of the pillars supporting the 
Jordanian nuclear programme and of clear value for Jordanian self-reliance in nuclear power 
generation. At the beginning of the year, Jordan had signed an agreement with the French AREVA 
company for uranium mining in the central region of the country where the uranium ore reserves were 
estimated to be approximately 65 000 tons. In addition, Jordan was cooperating with other foreign 
companies on exploration activities and geophysical studies in other areas of the country with a view 
to identifying potential resources of other nuclear ores, like thorium and zirconium. 
100. Jordan, which attached great importance to professional capacity-building in the field of nuclear 
power plant safety and security, had established a university course in nuclear engineering at the 
Jordan University of Science and Technology. In that regard, the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission 
and the University had signed a contract with China for the purchase of modern information 
technology for the study of nuclear engineering. The Atomic Energy Commission had also signed a 
contract with the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute and Daewoo Engineering and Construction 
to build a 5 MW nuclear research reactor on the campus to raise the level of research at the University.

101. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with the French Government for the creation 
of a centre of excellence in Jordan specializing in nuclear energy and in major projects to ensure 
development of the human resources required for implementation of the Jordanian nuclear 
programme, and also to provide training services at the regional level. 
102. In the framework of bilateral cooperation, Jordan had signed nuclear cooperation agreements 
with a number of States in order to benefit from their nuclear expertise, including France, China, 
South Korea, Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, Argentina and most recently Japan. It 
expected to conclude other such cooperation agreements later in the year with the Czech Republic, 
Romania and Italy, and was still negotiating with other States, such as the United States of America. 
103. The Agency provided assistance through its technical cooperation programme, which served the 
priorities of Member States by focusing on their special development needs in the context of national, 
regional and interregional projects. Jordan had participated in many such projects, including one to 
study the economic and technical feasibility of a nuclear power and sea water desalination plant, and 
another to assess, on a laboratory and pilot scale, the potential of an extraction technique for 
recovering yellowcake from phosphoric acid, now to be implemented on a large scale. There were two 
technical cooperation projects currently under way in that field, one on uranium exploration and the 
other on uranium extraction. Other important technical cooperation projects included the SESAME 
project, considered a centre of excellence for scientific research in the Middle East, which had first 
opened in 2008. With installation of equipment for the synchrotron accelerator and also of the 
radiation lines now being finalized, the start of operation was anticipated in 2013. 
104. Jordan welcomed the proposals from Member States and the Director General relating to the 
establishment of a mechanism for assured nuclear fuel supply. It was appropriate to start constructive 
and substantive dialogue in that regard to help States implement sustainable civil nuclear programmes 
and broaden the options for an assured nuclear fuel supply covering the complete nuclear fuel cycle, 
including the supply of last resort. Jordan therefore encouraged positive discussion of those proposals 
and emphasized the need for an in-depth study of all the relevant legal, political and technical 
implications. 
105. Jordan had reaffirmed its resolve to expand its options by buying nuclear fuel from global 
markets without prejudice to its right under Article IV of the NPT to develop research, production and 
use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I 
and II of the Treaty. Also, Jordan urged all parties to the NPT to participate in the exchange of 
equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. 
106. Jordan attached great importance to the safeguards regime and considered it to be a basic 
element of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to limit nuclear 
energy to peaceful applications for the benefit of States in compliance with their obligations under the 
NPT. For its part, Jordan had signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency and an 
additional protocol thereto to strengthen the comprehensive safeguards regime. 
107. Jordan was firmly convinced that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction posed 
a threat to global peace and security and especially to stability in the Middle East region, which 
continued to suffer from failure to implement resolutions related to ridding it of nuclear weapons. 
108. Jordan stressed the need for Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear installations 
under Agency safeguards, thereby achieving universality of the Treaty in the region. That would not 
only pave the way for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and help in the 
achievement of international peace and security, but also act as an incentive to States of the region to 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 15 
focus on socio-economic development instead of an arms race, which hindered development and 
confidence-building and exacerbated tensions. 
109. In that connection, Jordan welcomed the importance attached in the Final Document of the 
2010 NPT Review Conference to Israel acceding to the Treaty and subjecting all its nuclear 
installations to Agency comprehensive safeguards and, in particular, to the convening of a conference 
in 2012 attended by all the States of the Middle East to participate in dialogue aimed at making the 
Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. 
110. In conclusion, he reaffirmed his countryÂs confidence in the effective role performed by the 
Agency in various fields of the peaceful use of nuclear technology and its capacity to provide technical 
assistance to contribute to nuclear security and nuclear non-proliferation. 
Mr Berdennikov (Russian Federation) took the Chair. 
111. Mr STACEY MORENO (Ecuador) said that his country firmly believed in the universalization 
of the non-proliferation regime and so welcomed the Kingdom of Swaziland as a member of the 
Agency. He underlined the inalienable right of all States party to the NPT to develop research, 
production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. At the same time, that right brought with 
it certain obligations that needed to be met in full and transparently. 
112. The advances in nuclear technology in recent decades had helped to reduce poverty and improve 
the conditions of life and safety of citizens. Convinced that the multilateral mechanisms should 
address the new international challenges and threats, Ecuador believed that the principles guiding the 
Agency should be respected and not used for political purposes or to promote geopolitical 
confrontation. 
113. Noting that the Ecuadorian Constitution prohibited the development, production, possession, 
sale, import, transport, supply and use of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, he said that a 
global culture of confidence needed to be developed to banish the threats posed by the malicious use 
of nuclear energy. People should work together so that nuclear technology served the causes of 
development in the areas of energy, food, water resources management, medicine, nutrition, 
agriculture and protection of the environment. Ecuador believed the Agency to be the most appropriate 
forum for achieving those objectives. 
114. Since the creation of the UN system, Ecuador had been a tireless advocate of peace and 
universal disarmament and the non-use and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Belonging to the worldÂs first densely populated nuclear-weapon-free zone, it condemned any 
non-peaceful nuclear initiatives. The example set by Latin America could be followed in other parts of 
the world, particularly the Middle East. Ecuador was in favour of diplomatic dialogue to find 
consensual solutions to international conflicts and rejected the adoption of unilateral coercive 
measures outside the UN system and international law. 
115. Ecuador underlined the importance of the conclusions of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
Emphasis had been placed by the Conference on the entry into force of the CTBT as a core element of 
the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. An action plan had been adopted 
for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the importance of concluding nuclear-weapon-free 
zones along the lines of existing models like the Tlatelolco Treaty had been stressed. It had been 
recognized that cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to accelerate and enlarge the 
contribution of atomic energy to peace and prosperity throughout the world was one of the core 
objectives enshrined in the AgencyÂs Statute. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 16 
116. Nuclear security should be subject to strict standards observed by all States without exception. 
Ecuador acknowledged the support given to it in that field by the Agency and reaffirmed that it was 
the responsibility of all to ensure control over the use of nuclear technology. 
117. There was a need for an international regime for the safe transport of radioactive material that 
covered liability for damage to human health and the environment and for economic loss. A crucial 
aspect in that regard was clear and transparent communication among States about shipments, 
especially by sea. 
118. Ecuador, recognizing the Agency as the competent authority to verify and ensure compliance 
with safeguards agreements and additional protocols, highlighted the importance of universal 
application, without exception, of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. However, efforts being made to 
that end by the Agency should be accompanied by an appropriate international cooperation 
programme for development, in particular for the least well-off countries. 
119. Progress in science in the past decades had meant that the peaceful applications of nuclear 
technology, created originally for non-peaceful purposes, were constantly increasing. He urged the 
Secretariat to redouble its efforts with respect to technical cooperation for the benefit of the global 
community. 
120. Ecuador was grateful to the Agency for its support in the implementation of projects 
contributing to its sustainable socio-economic growth. EcuadorÂs Country Programme Framework for 
2010Â2015 represented a road map for its growing participation in the benefits of nuclear energy, 
enabling more technical assistance in areas identified as having a high priority. 
121. His country was also grateful for efforts to implement projects under ARCAL, which was 
currently celebrating its 25th anniversary. 
122. Ecuador considered that changing the energy mix, by reducing the use of fossil fuels and 
including cleaner energy sources such as nuclear energy, would help protect the environment and 
combat climate change. It had therefore launched the Yasuni-ITT (Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini) 
initiative, proposed by the Ecuadorian President, to refrain indefinitely from exploiting the oil 
reserves, estimated at 846 million barrels, lying in the Ecuadorian Amazon forest. The region was also 
home to indigenous populations living in voluntary isolation and had one of the highest biodiversity 
levels in the world. Ecuador invited the international community to join that initiative for sustainable 
development and to reduce carbon emissions by contributing at least $3.6 billion, equivalent to 50% of 
the revenues Ecuador would receive if it opted for exploiting the oil, through a trust fund administered 
by the UNDP. 
123. Finally, he thanked GRULAC for its support for EcuadorÂs membership of the Board of 
Governors for the coming period. 
124. Mr AL-HAMMADI (Qatar) underlined his countryÂs firm support for the Agency in 
implementation of its significant and expanding task with respect to the utilization of nuclear energy 
and the application of up-to-date nuclear techniques for the benefit of humankind. 
125. The State of Qatar had joined the Agency in 1976 because it had been convinced of the 
AgencyÂs important role in transferring the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, through its numerous 
scientific and technical programmes, for the achievement of progress and prosperity. The AgencyÂs 
other main role was to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and, in that regard, he expressed 
QatarÂs concern about the serious shortcoming in the effectiveness of the current safeguards system 
posed by the non-application of comprehensive safeguards in States that had not acceded to the NPT. 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 17 
126. Since the adoption by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference of the Resolution on the 
Middle East there had been no tangible progress as regards implementation of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime or nuclear disarmament in the Middle East. Whereas the Arab States had 
taken a unified stance and had acceded to the NPT, Israel remained the only State outside the regime, 
claiming that the international measures to persuade it to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon 
State and to place its military nuclear installations under comprehensive safeguards were illegal. That 
was a serious shortcoming that threatened regional and international peace and security. 
127. The current session of the General Conference was being held in the wake of the most recent 
NPT Review Conference, which had agreed to hold a conference on the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 2012 attended by all States of the Middle East and 
other States concerned. There was cause for optimism that, provided the participating States Â 
particularly the nuclear States Â demonstrated the serious will to do so, the process of ridding the 
Middle East of nuclear weapons could get under way. The Agency had been assigned a central role in 
that it had been asked to prepare background documentation for the conference, and he hoped it would 
do so on the basis of international resolutions, objectively and in a just and balanced way. 
128. In recent years, a number of States Â especially in the Middle East Â had shown an interest in 
utilizing nuclear technology for the purpose of energy generation. It was important that all States 
taking that path accede to the relevant international instruments so as to ensure the safety and security 
of installations and avoid the hazards of contamination. 
129. The State of Qatar valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, which helped States 
to develop their human and technical capabilities in the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
Qatar, which hoped to increase the number of projects it was implementing with the Agency, had 
recently prepared its Country Programme Framework in which it had defined its future needs. 
130. Qatar was pleased with the special efforts that had been made by Director General Amano in his 
first year of office to place particular emphasis on cancer therapy in the developing States. 
131. In conclusion, he said Qatar looked forward to continued benefits from atomic energy in such 
spheres as health and nutrition, and to the end of the threat of destructive nuclear wars. 
132. Mr TODOROV (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said that his country had joined 
all relevant instruments so as to be in line with international efforts to strengthen the physical 
protection of nuclear materials and facilities and the non-proliferation regime. The threat of nuclear 
terrorism and other security issues merited special attention and the strong commitment of all 
countries and their close cooperation was indispensable in that regard. 
133. In view of his countryÂs ambition to join the European Union it had, over the past decade, 
developed and implemented a wide range of measures to strengthen its nuclear regulatory framework 
and infrastructure. Effective instruments had been put in place to protect its border against illicit 
trafficking in radioactive and nuclear materials. It would continue to build capacity in order to achieve 
further improvements regarding the physical protection of nuclear applications, border control 
management and the regulatory infrastructure. 
134. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs global 
role in the domain of the peaceful use of nuclear applications and welcomed its readiness to develop 
initiatives proposed by its Member States. In particular, his country applauded the stepping up of 
Agency activities in the area of agricultural and food safety within the European region. The former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had been among the first countries in the region to initiate and 
successfully implement projects having a positive impact on crop breeding and good agricultural 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 18 
practices, including quality and food safety, under its national strategy for agriculture and rural 
development. 
135. Expressing appreciation for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, he said that the 
envisioned Country Programme Framework for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would be 
implemented by means of national and regional projects. The driving force would be the progress in 
existing programmes to address the countryÂs priority development sectors. 
136. Project proposals had already been submitted for the 2012Â2013 cycle and were undergoing 
evaluation. The projects selected were in full compliance with the new Country Programme 
Framework for 2012Â2015, which was about to be signed, and focused on building capacities in the 
areas of human health, food safety, cultural heritage protection and knowledge management. 
137. The application of nuclear technologies in the field of medicine was extremely important for 
improving health services and his Government was committed to projects in that field. 
138. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs activities aimed at strengthening regional cooperation. It 
participated extensively in regional and interregional technical cooperation as a complement to its 
national activities. It contributed actively to the technical cooperation programme by hosting 
workshops and fellowships and offering expertise to other Member States in the areas of human 
health, food safety and veterinary medicine. 
139. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was happy to host foreign participants in training 
programmes in its institutions and for its institutions to become centres of excellence. It had expressed 
explicit interest in hosting Agency Radiation Safety Infrastructure Appraisal missions, Quality 
Assurance Team for Radiation Oncology audits, and security-related missions. It would continue to be 
an active partner in helping to ensure the effectiveness of regional cooperation. 
140. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia supported the continuation of Agency activities 
focused on the peaceful use of nuclear energy for the benefit of society as a whole. 
141. Ms MUTANDIRO (Zimbabwe) welcomed SwazilandÂs membership of the Agency, which 
brought the number of African Member States to over 40 and would strengthen cooperative synergies 
in AFRA subregional programmes for southern Africa. 
142. For developing countries, the technical cooperation programme remained the most important 
means of transferring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, with nuclear applications playing a 
critical role in improving socio-economic conditions. The AgencyÂs assistance in such areas as 
agricultural productivity, human health, water management and environmental protection had 
contributed significantly towards achievement of the MDGs. Her country called for the strengthening 
of the AgencyÂs promotional activities, in particular by ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
technical cooperation programme and the provision of sufficient, assured and predictable resources for 
it. 
143. Over the years, a strong partnership had evolved between Zimbabwe and the Agency, with 
significant achievements in such areas as human and animal health, agricultural production, water 
resources development, industrial applications, radiation safety and capacity-building. Zimbabwe was 
especially grateful for the technical support extended to its radiation protection agency in 
strengthening the national safety regulatory infrastructure. Her country attached priority to following 
the recommendations made by the Agency during its advisory mission to Zimbabwe the preceding 
year, and was aware of the need to strengthen further the radiation protection agency through building 
capacity for the effective control of radioactive sources. Although nuclear safety and security were 
national responsibilities, the Agency played a fundamental role in developing safety standards and 
nuclear security guidelines and conventions based on best practices. Zimbabwe welcomed the 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 19 
AgencyÂs commitment to promoting high levels of nuclear safety by strengthening international 
cooperation, providing review services to Member States and supporting knowledge networks and 
training. 
144. Although safety and security considerations were important in the use of nuclear energy, they 
should not be used as a pretext to prevent the transfer of nuclear technologies to developing countries 
for peaceful purposes. As Zimbabwe looked into future development strategies, the relevant 
authorities followed keenly all developments in nuclear research, technologies and applications. 
Consequently, future Country Programme Frameworks would provide for enhanced cooperation in the 
fields of energy planning, soil and water management, food safety, livestock production, pest control, 
nuclear medicine and cancer control. Zimbabwe appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance through AFRA 
projects on isotope hydrology, PACT and PATTEC. 
145. Her country applauded the Director GeneralÂs decision to attach priority in 2010 to global 
awareness of the challenges of cancer control in developing countries Â an initiative that was already 
bearing fruit at the highest political levels. Zimbabwe hoped that all efforts in that regard, including 
the Scientific Forum being held alongside the General Conference, would lead to the development of 
comprehensive international strategies and programmes to combat the disease. International 
collaboration on measures to address the high costs of cancer treatment equipment needed to be 
strengthened and Zimbabwe welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to engage with the equipment 
manufacturers. 
146. As a beneficiary of Agency assistance through PACT, her country commended that 
programmeÂs invaluable contribution to effective cancer control. However, its scope needed to be 
broadened in order to benefit all developing countries, particularly those lacking the most basic 
infrastructure. Given the shortage of skills in developing countries in that field, Zimbabwe welcomed 
the establishment of the virtual university aimed at building radiation medicine capacities and she 
called on international partners to increase their financial support to enable the Agency to help more 
Member States cope with the cancer pandemic and make cancer therapy accessible to all those in 
need. 
147. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Zimbabwe had been privileged to chair a committee on 
nuclear disarmament. Although the action plan on nuclear disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, 
nuclear energy and the 1995 Resolution on the Middle East had not met its expectations, Zimbabwe 
welcomed the consensus reached thereon and supported international efforts towards the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. As a State party to the Pelindaba Treaty, Zimbabwe 
strongly believed that the creation of such zones was a positive step towards the goal of global nuclear 
disarmament. It welcomed the decision to convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment in the 
Middle East of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction and urged all 
parties concerned to work towards creating an environment conducive to the holding of the 
conference. The NPT was the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and its universality 
should be achieved as a matter of urgency. 
148. With regard to assurance of nuclear fuel supply, in the absence of comprehensive discussions 
addressing the many concerns expressed by Member States related to the far-reaching political, 
economic, legal, technical and security aspects, Zimbabwe felt that any decision on that issue would 
be premature. Proliferation concerns should not be used to restrict the inalienable right of all States to 
develop and research all aspects of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes in 
conformity with their respective safeguards obligations. 
149. Mr DONÃ (Sovereign Order of Malta) said that humanity was facing critical challenges related 
to maintaining and enhancing its continued prosperity within the context of ever-increasing demands 
GC(54)/OR.7 
23 September 2010, Page 20 
being placed on sustainable food production, health and security. The availability and use of energy 
resources that would foster sustainable development and decrease greenhouse gas emissions was of 
critical importance. In that regard, the Agency was well placed to assist Member States in meeting 
those challenges. 
150. The human race was a single family working together. There was a need to reinvigorate that 
sentiment through multilateralism marked by dialogue and honest and responsible cooperation on the 
part of all members of the international community. Every State should pursue the development and 
well-being of all nations and peoples, and not national power, whether economic or military. The 
essential points of reference were the dignity and fundamental rights of the human being. 
151. The work of the Agency in fulfilment of its triple mandate Â technology, safety and 
verification Â should always be aimed at uniting efforts towards safety, security, disarmament and 
nuclear non-proliferation. The Sovereign Order of Malta drew particular attention to the peaceful and 
safe use of nuclear technology, respect for the environment and mindfulness of the most 
disadvantaged populations. Such a common commitment could lead not only to an equitable 
distribution of the earthÂs resources but, above all, to the building, as set down in Article 28 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of a Âsocial and international order in which the rights and 
freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realizedÂ. 
152. Nuclear technology could yield many positive fruits in such vital fields for human beings as 
food security and medicine. The work being carried out by the Agency in that regard, and in particular 
through PACT, was very significant for Sovereign Order of Malta specialists working worldwide. 
153. The Order was interested in a collaborative arrangement with the Agency aimed at the 
development of human resources through capacity-building and action plans for low- and 
middle-income countries. Existing cooperation included the facilitation of training in nuclear 
medicine, the promotion of related fellowships, and the provision of experts in support of joint cancer 
management initiatives. The Order already had a number of cooperation agreements in place with 
States, international organizations (e.g. FAO, IOM, UNHCR), and with the European Commission, 
and its worldwide relief service, Malteser International, cooperated closely with WHO.

Â Report of the Scientific Forum 2010 
1. The PRESIDENT recalled that the theme of the Scientific Forum for 2010 had been ÂCancer in 
Developing countries: Facing the ChallengeÂ. He invited the Rapporteur, Mr Ngoma, to present the 
report. 
2. Mr NGOMA (Rapporteur of the Scientific Forum) presented the report, which is reproduced in 
the Annex. 
3. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr Ngoma for his most interesting report on the work and outcome 
of the Scientific Forum, and the Secretariat for its excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum. 
Mr Enkhsaikhan (Mongolia), President, took the Chair. 
18. Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between 
the Agency and the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea 
(resumed) 
(GC(54)/12 and Corr.1; GC(54)/L.3 and Add.1 and 2, and L.4) 
4. The PRESIDENT invited those delegations involved in the consultations following the 
preceding meeting to address the Plenary. 
5. Mr BARRETT (Canada) said that the group for which his delegation had acted as facilitator had 
met and made a proposal which it hoped would expedite consensus; that proposal had been conveyed 
to the chair of the Arab Group, which had sponsored the amendment contained in document 
GC(54)/L.4. 
6. Mr ELAMIN (Sudan), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, said that the Group was very keen 
to arrive at an understanding that would allow progress to be made and had thus made a further 
compromise in deciding to withdraw its proposed amendment to the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(54)/L.4. He expressed the hope that that same spirit would be shown by other 
delegations. On behalf of the Arab Group, he requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(54)/L.3. 
7. Mr SHIM Yoon-Joe (Republic of Korea) expressed appreciation to the delegations of Sudan and 
Australia for having withdrawn their respective proposed amendments. There had been a general 
desire in the plenary to maintain the spirit of consensus which had prevailed on the resolution ever 
since its first introduction at the General Conference in 1993. There was no reason to make an 
exception on the present occasion, and he appealed to all Member States to try to achieve consensus 
by adopting the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/L.3. 
8. Mr FERNANDEZ RONDON (Cuba) said his delegation had intended to support the 
amendment contained in document GC(54)/L.4, which would have made the draft resolution more 
balanced. However, Cuba would not block consensus. The proposed amendment enshrined a 
fundamental principle and had unfortunately been rejected by certain States for political reasons and 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 2 
because of their unconditional support for Israel. He emphasized the importance of working more 
vigorously to achieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons, as only their total elimination and the 
prohibition of all nuclear testing could help bring about international peace and security. Cuba was 
deeply concerned at the lack of progress towards nuclear disarmament and called on all States 
possessing nuclear weapons to fulfil immediately and unconditionally their obligations under 
Article VI of the NPT. His country reiterated its support for the complete denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula, which could be achieved only through dialogue, and expressed its concern at the 
heightening tensions in that region. 
9. The PRESIDENT, under Rule 72 of the Rules of Procedure, invited the General Conference to 
proceed to a roll-call vote on the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/L.3. He requested 
those Member States wishing to explain their votes to do so after the vote and reminded them that, 
under Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure, sponsors of the draft resolution were not allowed to explain 
their votes. 
10. Morocco, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
11. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica,

12. There were 94 votes in favour and none against, with 24 abstentions. The resolution was 
adopted. 
13. Mr ELAMIN (Sudan), speaking in explanation of vote on behalf of the Arab Group, reaffirmed 
the GroupÂs support for international efforts to ensure the universality of the NPT and promote nuclear 
disarmament and the placement of all nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The 
final document adopted by the 2010 NPT Review Conference stressed the importance of universal 
adherence to the Treaty and of comprehensive safeguards. The Group also reaffirmed its support for 
international efforts to resolve the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, as a contribution to the 
denuclearization of the world as a whole, including the Middle East. The Arab Group considered that a 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 3 
consistent position should be adopted on the matter in all resolutions and had therefore decided to 
abstain. 
14. Mr ALKAABI (United Arab Emirates) said that his country had voted in favour of the draft 
resolution because it was convinced of the importance of ensuring universal adherence to the NPT, 
and thus of persuading the DPRK to return to the Treaty and the safeguards regime. A consensus on 
both the draft resolution and the principle of universality would, of course, have been preferable in 
view of the goal of ridding the world of weapons of mass destruction and the nuclear threat. 
15. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that Israel had voted in favour of the draft resolution because the 
reckless conduct of the DPRK called for the strongest possible condemnation and action by the 
international community. The DPRKÂs non-compliance with its safeguards obligations, its decision to 
cease all cooperation with the Agency and its continued defiance of United Nations Security Council 
resolutions undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime and regional peace and security. The 
conduct of the DPRK also had dangerous implications for the Middle East, since it was a major 
nuclear proliferator and supplier of ballistic missiles. Israel urged the Agency to pursue its 
investigation of the DPRKÂs assistance to SyriaÂs covert nuclear programme without delay. The 
conduct of the DPRK highlighted the importance of determined and concerted action by the 
international community, which should also send the right message to Middle East violators of 
commitments and obligations in the nuclear domain such as Syria and Iran. 
16. The PRESIDENT, responding to requests for the floor from sponsors of the draft resolution, 
said that, under Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure, sponsors were not permitted to speak in 
explanation of vote but only to make brief general comments. 
17. Mr SHIM Yoon-Joe (Republic of Korea) said that, although he was not fully satisfied with the 
result, he appreciated the fact that an absolute majority of participants in the General Conference had 
voted in favour of the draft resolution, thereby expressing the international communityÂs determination 
to ensure the denuclearization of the DPRK. He urged the DPRK to abide by relevant resolutions of 
the Agency and the United Nations Security Council and the decisions of the six-party talks, and to 
abandon its nuclear ambitions. 
18. Mr NAKANE (Japan) expressed appreciation for the diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring the 
original version of the draft resolution, and regret at the fact that it had not been adopted by consensus. 
His country sincerely hoped that a consensus could be achieved at the next session of the General 
Conference. 
19. Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(54)/13; GC(54)/L.1) 
19. The PRESIDENT said that item 19 had been included in the ConferenceÂs agenda pursuant to 
resolution GC(53)/RES/16. The Director General had submitted the report contained in document 
GC(54)/13 pursuant to paragraph 13 of that resolution. The matter had been considered by the Board 
the preceding week on the basis of that report. Document GC(54)/L.1 contained a draft resolution 
submitted by Egypt. 
20. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution, said that, although the General 
Conference had adopted resolutions by consensus several years in succession on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, it had become apparent that matters were, at best, stagnating, 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 4 
since that consensus failed to lead to concrete results on the ground. Indeed, the General Conference 
seemed to be dealing with the item in an increasingly mechanical and ineffective manner. 
21. As one of the driving forces behind the item, Egypt had a responsibility to prevent an issue of 
such importance from being sidelined. As a result, in 2006 his country had begun to introduce 
amendments to the draft resolution with the aim of reinvigorating the item and updating a text which, 
in some ways, no longer reflected the realities on the ground. In embarking on the process, his country 
had been aware that the amended draft resolution would run into resistance. Unsurprisingly, the 
strongest resistance had come from those who regarded themselves as champions of nuclear 
non-proliferation, but who in fact upheld inconsistent and highly selective positions on the NPT and 
Agency safeguards in the Middle East. 
22. Following three challenging General Conference sessions and a long, intensive and inclusive 
process of consultations during the 2009 General Conference, a revised text of the resolution, 
incorporating proposals made, inter alia, by the European Union and the United States, had been 
agreed upon and subsequently adopted with 103 votes in favour, none against and 4 abstentions. Egypt 
regretted the fact that, despite all the efforts made to rebuild a consensus, the resolution had not been 
adopted without a vote. It also regretted that three States party to the NPT had abstained on a 
paragraph calling on all States in the region to accede to the Treaty. Such a vote was inconsistent with 
the spirit and letter of the Treaty and the final documents adopted by consensus by successive NPT 
Review Conferences. It also sent a disturbing message to the world. With a view to maintaining the 
balance that had been achieved at the preceding session of the General Conference, Egypt had 
reintroduced the resolution without any changes to the text. It sincerely hoped that the General 
Conference would adopt it without a vote. 
23. He thanked the members of the Arab Group and NAM that had consistently supported the 
resolution, as well as other States that had supported Â not only in words but also in deeds Â a 
Middle East free from nuclear weapons and unsafeguarded nuclear activities. 
24. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), speaking on behalf of NAM, said that NAM reiterated its principled 
position on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. It strongly believed that stability 
could not be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military capabilities were maintained, 
particularly through the possession of nuclear weapons, allowing one party to threaten its neighbours 
and the region. NAM regarded the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as 
a positive step towards attaining the objective of global nuclear disarmament and it reiterated its 
support for the establishment of such a zone in accordance with relevant United Nations General 
Assembly and Security Council resolutions. NAM was convinced that the effective and efficient 
application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East promoted confidence among States in the region. 
It therefore considered that achieving universality of comprehensive Agency safeguards in the region 
constituted the first practical step towards that end and was a necessary step towards the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
25. NAM welcomed the fact that its member States that were party to the NPT concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency in fulfilment of their obligations under 
Article III.(1) of the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. All States in the Middle East region except 
Israel were party to the NPT and had accepted comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
26. NAM regretted IsraelÂs continued insistence that Agency safeguards could not be addressed in 
isolation from the regional peace process. It emphasized that there was no automatic sequence 
requiring the conclusion of a peace settlement prior to the application of comprehensive safeguards to 
all nuclear activities in the Middle East. The latter would in fact contribute to the former. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 5 
27. NAM also noted with regret that the Director General had not been able to make further 
progress in fulfilling his mandate pursuant to resolution GC(53)/RES/16 regarding the application of 
comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East. It urged all Member 
States to cooperate to reverse that unacceptable situation and to participate actively in achieving 
universality of comprehensive Agency safeguards in the Middle East region. 
28. NAM also noted that the Director General would continue with his consultations regarding the 
early application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East 
region. It welcomed his efforts to encourage the development and consideration of relevant new ideas 
and approaches that could help move his mandate forward and requested him to brief Member States 
regularly on such efforts. 
29. NAM State Parties to the NPT welcomed the endorsement by the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference of the measure that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the sponsors of the 
resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference, should 
convene in 2012, in consultation with States in the region, a conference to be attended by all States of 
the Middle East on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other 
weapons of mass destruction, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region, 
and with the full support and engagement of the nuclear-weapon States. NAM noted that the 
2012 conference would take the 1995 resolution as its terms of reference. 
30. NAM noted with appreciation the Director GeneralÂs recent efforts to develop an agenda and 
modalities aimed at ensuring a successful forum on the relevance of the experience of existing 
nuclear-weapon-free zones, including confidence-building and verification measures, for establishing 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. For the forum to be successful, its agenda should 
reflect the consensus within the international community on the importance of establishing a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Accordingly, NAM requested the Director General to 
continue consultations with Member States in the region with a view to achieving consensus on the 
agenda and modalities of the forum. 
31. NAM was fully committed to cooperating with the Director General in implementing resolution 
GC(53)/RES/16 and it expected all other Member States to do likewise. 
32. Finally, NAM endorsed the draft resolution submitted by Egypt on the item under discussion. 
33. Mr POURMAND TEHRANI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that more than three decades had 
elapsed since the idea of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East had first been put 
forward. It had been proposed by Iran in 1974 as an important disarmament measure in the Middle 
East region and had led to a United Nations General Assembly resolution. Since 1980, the General 
Assembly had adopted a resolution on the issue each year by consensus, demonstrating global support 
for the promotion of peace, security and stability in the Middle East through the realization of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone. Iran, having ratified all major treaties relating to weapons of mass 
destruction, supported the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. 
34. It was regrettable that, notwithstanding global attempts to establish nuclear-weapon-free zones, 
particularly in the Middle East, 30 years later no progress had been made towards realization of that 
aim owing the intransigent policy of the Zionist regime. Owing to that regimeÂs non-adherence to the 
NPT and, more importantly, its refusal to place its unsafeguarded nuclear facilities under the AgencyÂs 
verification system, the aspiration of the countries in the region to establish a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone had not been realized. Moreover, that regimeÂs irresponsible behaviour cast serious doubt on the 
possibility of one being established in the near future. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 6 
35. The Zionist regime was the only country not party to the NPT in the region. Despite repeated 
calls by the international community, such as the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 
NPT Review and Extension Conference and related resolutions of the General Assembly, the Agency 
and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, that regime, confident of the political and military 
support of the United States of America, had neither acceded to the NPT nor placed its nuclear 
facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards. It had not even declared its intention to accede to the 
Treaty. Its clandestine nuclear activities seriously threatened regional peace and security and 
endangered the non-proliferation regime. 
36. Unfortunately, the imposed inaction of the United Nations Security Council over several 
decades as regards the well documented nuclear weapons programme of the Zionist regime had given 
that regime the audacity to acknowledge explicitly its possession of nuclear weapons. That regimeÂs 
clandestine development of nuclear weapons not only violated basic principles of international law, 
the Charter of the United Nations, the NPT and numerous General Assembly and Security Council 
resolutions, it also clearly defied the demands and concerns of the overwhelming majority of United 
Nations member States and obstinately disregarded repeated appeals by the international community 
for Israel to renounce nuclear weapons and accede to the NPT. The Zionist regime was the only 
obstacle to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Peace and stability in 
the region were unattainable while its nuclear arsenal continued to threaten the region and the rest of 
the world. 
37. As a State Party to the NPT, Iran was fully committed to its international undertakings and 
believed that the Treaty was the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Universal 
adherence to the NPT, particularly in the Middle East, would effectively ensure the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. Pending the realization of such a zone in the Middle East, no 
country in the region should acquire nuclear weapons, or permit the stationing within its territory or 
under its jurisdiction or control of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices, and countries in the 
region should refrain from actions that ran counter to both the letter and spirit of the NPT and other 
international resolutions and documents relating to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East. It was a matter of regret that, while no practical measure was being taken to contain 
the threat posed by the Zionist regime as the real source of nuclear danger in the Middle East, Iran, a 
party to the NPT and the initiator of the idea of the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East, was under tremendous pressure to renounce its inalienable right to benefit from the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
38. The Director General in a communication on the issue dated 24 June 2010, had stated that there 
was an urgent need for all States in the Middle East to accept forthwith the application of full-scope 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities as an important confidence-building measure. In his report 
on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East contained in document GC(54)/13, he had 
stated that all States in the Middle East region except for Israel were party to the NPT and had 
undertaken to accept comprehensive Agency safeguards. That point was also emphasized in the final 
document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which recalled the reaffirmation by the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference of the importance of IsraelÂs accession to the Treaty and the placement of all its 
nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The Conference had called on all States in 
the Middle East that had not yet done so to accede to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States with a 
view to achieving universality of the Treaty at an early date. 
39. Iran firmly believed that an agreed plan of action and a timetable for achieving universality of 
the NPT, especially in the Middle East, should be a top priority on the agenda of all States party to the 
Treaty, especially the nuclear-weapon States. Pressure should be brought to bear on the Zionist regime 
to eliminate its nuclear weapons and to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under 
Agency safeguards in order to pave the way for realization of the long-sought goal of the 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 7 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and the achievement of peace and 
security in the region. 
40. Mr AZOULAY (Israel) said that in the Middle East, as in other regions, attaining regional 
peace, security and stability was a fundamental goal. Progress on general regional arms control 
measures in the Middle East could only be made through a comprehensive and durable peace in the 
region and full compliance by all regional States with their arms control and non-proliferation 
obligations. Furthermore, progress towards realizing the vision of the Middle East as a zone free of 
weapons of mass destruction required a fundamental change in regional circumstances, including a 
significant transformation of the attitude of some States in the region to Israel. The exclusion of Israel 
from the AgencyÂs Middle East and South Asia regional group was a clear example of what ought to 
be changed. The lamentable regional realities in the Middle East included large-scale terrorism 
practised by non-State actors and nurtured by terror-sponsoring States like Iran and Syria, and a 
culture of non-compliance manifested in recent years by Libya and Syria, which had pursued a 
military nuclear programme under the guise of their NPT membership. 
41. While a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East remained a vision shared 
by many, its applicability seemed more remote than 20 years previously. Until all States in the region 
came forward with clean records and in good faith, there could be no progress towards the 
establishment of such a zone. As his countryÂs neighbours fully understood the consequences of the 
grim regional realities, Israel questioned their statements to the contrary in the General Conference, 
which were detrimental to regional security and the arms control process. 
42. The General Conference had been increasingly politicized and abused by some Member States 
from the Middle East region, which sacrificed the AgencyÂs credibility in the interests of their 
short-sighted anti-Israeli goals. How could one realistically expect to move forward towards the 
establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East at a time when IsraelÂs 
adversaries made every effort to undermine its position in the region and some were even calling 
explicitly for its destruction? Premature advocacy of misguided concepts relating to such a zone in the 
Middle East was not only divorced from regional realities but also an exercise in futility. The Middle 
East as a zone free of weapons of mass destruction remained a long-term goal and must include all 
States in the greater Middle East and other relevant countries, as determined by joint agreement. The 
delineation of the region must be carefully thought through and the zone should be the result of free 
and direct negotiations among all members of the region. Moreover, the issue of regional security 
extended far beyond weapons of mass destruction to all categories of conventional weapons and 
systems for their delivery. That was of particular importance for the State of Israel, which was small in 
size and devoid of strategic depth. Its population centres were within range of tens of thousands of 
missiles and rockets in the hands of States in the region and their proxy terrorist organizations, which 
repeatedly levelled threats against it. 
43. As Israel and the Palestinian Authority strove to move forward jointly by means of dialogue, the 
citizens of Israel were subject to intensified attacks by the Hamas terrorist organization, encouraged by 
Syria and Iran. At the same time, Israel was extending cooperation to the Palestinian Authority in 
many aspects of nuclear medicine, as could be confirmed by a large number of Palestinian physicians 
and patients. He called on Palestinian participants in the General Conference to work together with 
Israel to expand that cooperation. 
44. All aspects of regional security had been addressed by Middle East States within the framework 
of the Working Group on Arms Control and Regional Security, which had been launched in the 
context of the Madrid political process and had met from 1992 to 1996. Israel had proposed a 
comprehensive programme for enhancing security in the region, but meaningful progress had been 
blocked by the insistence of Egypt and others on the nuclear issue. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 8 
45. Israel attached great importance to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and had supported and, 
wherever possible, acceded to arms control and other international treaties. In view of the four 
recognized cases of violations of legally binding NPT obligations by parties to the Treaty from the 
Middle East region, Israel could not subscribe to the notion that universal adherence to the NPT was 
an adequate remedy for the regionÂs problems. IsraelÂs regional approach to a zone free of weapons of 
mass destruction was also anchored in the vast experience gained in similar processes in other regions, 
including Latin America, the South Pacific, South-East Asia and Africa. Thus, his country believed 
that, in the months and years ahead, efforts should aim at moving towards comprehensive peace 
between Israel and the Arab world, reversing the Iranian pursuit of military nuclear capabilities and 
promoting confidence and trust in the Middle East. 
46. Finally, he requested that the draft resolution be put to the vote and that a separate vote be held 
on operative paragraph 2 thereof. 
47. Ms GOICOCHEA ESTENOZ (Cuba) said that making sustainable progress with respect to the 
situation in the Middle East was a priority for the international community. That could only be 
achieved if the military imbalance in the region was corrected, comprehensive Agency safeguards 
were applied in all the regionÂs States and a nuclear-weapon-free zone was established. Her country 
supported all efforts towards that end. 
48. She urged the Secretariat to pursue its efforts to encourage IsraelÂs accession to the NPT, as it 
was the only State in the region that was not a party. That jeopardized security in the region and 
destroyed confidence in non-proliferation. Therefore Israel must accede to the NPT as a 
non-nuclear-weapon State, subjecting all its nuclear facilities to comprehensive Agency safeguards 
and conducting its nuclear activities in accordance with the non-proliferation regime. The United 
States Government should also be transparent about the equipment, materials and facilities and 
scientific and technical assistance it provided to Israel in the nuclear field. 
49. The PRESIDENT asked whether a vote by show of hands on operative paragraph 2 of the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(54)/L.1 was acceptable. 
50. At the request of Mr Shamaa (Egypt), a roll-call vote was taken. 
51. The Philippines, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
52. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Abstaining: Canada, India, Marshall Islands, United States of America. 
53. There were 120 votes in favour and 1 against, with 4 abstentions. Operative paragraph 2 of the 
draft resolution was adopted. 
54. The PRESIDENT asked whether a vote by show of hands on the whole of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(54)/L.1 was acceptable. 
55. At the request of Mr Shamaa (Egypt), a roll-call vote was taken. 
56. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called 
upon to vote first. 
57. The result of the vote was as follows: 
58. In favour: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria,

Against: None. 
Abstaining: Canada, Chad, Haiti, Israel, Marshall Islands, United States of America. 
59. There were 120 votes in favour and none against, with 6 abstentions. The draft resolution was 
adopted. 
60. Mr KHULLAR (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had abstained 
in the vote on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution because it believed that it introduced 
matters extraneous to the Agency. 
61. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that his country supported 
non-proliferation initiatives aimed at eliminating all arsenals of nuclear weapons in all States without 
exception. Given that Israel was the only State in the Middle East region that had not acceded to the 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 10 
NPT and was believed to possess nuclear weapons, Venezuela considered the resolution to be an 
essential tool for achieving the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. He called upon 
all countries, and in particular Israel, to accede to the NPT without delay. 
62. He recalled that the 2010 NPT Review Conference had agreed on the holding of a conference in 
2012 on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, which should provide a good 
opportunity for reviewing what had been achieved thus far and would be complemented by the 
resolution just adopted. 
63. Mr DAVIES (United States of America), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his 
delegation had felt compelled to abstain as it felt that the resolution had not been put forward on a 
consensus basis. However, that abstention should not be taken as an indication that his country was 
any less committed to the goal of universality of the NPT, a commitment it had demonstrated in its 
efforts to achieve consensus at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, despite its reservations about that 
ConferenceÂs outcome. It was his countryÂs belief that the only way to make progress towards peace in 
the Middle East region and the achievement of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction was 
through agreement among all States of the region. 
64. Mr AZOULAY (Israel), speaking in explanation of vote, said that resolutions on the issue in 
question had enjoyed consensus at past General Conferences for 14 consecutive years until 2005, 
demonstrating a shared vision Â despite many differences Â of the Middle East as a zone free of 
weapons of mass destruction. The situation had changed in recent years and his country attributed that 
to a loss of interest on the part of the sponsor of the resolution, Egypt, in the achievement of such a 
zone. Israel regretted the current state of affairs, particularly in view of the years of intensive dialogue 
and efforts by it and other States to formulate an agreed package on Middle East issues at the General 
Conference. 
65. His country had worked in good faith and had striven to build bridges, despite differences in 
approaches and attitudes. In 2009, those efforts had culminated in its full engagement with Egypt and 
other parties, but its positive attitude had not been reciprocated but had been met with a 
confrontational attitude on the part of Egypt, which preferred to pass a resolution by majority vote 
rather than work at achieving consensus. EgyptÂs carefully crafted statements and mastery of the Rules 
of Procedure of the General Conference could not prevent his country from concluding that it had no 
real interest in advancing cooperative regional security measures. 
66. Mr RECKER (Belgium), speaking in explanation of vote on behalf of European Union member 
States, said that the European Union was firmly committed to universality of the NPT, but it also 
placed great importance on full compliance with the provisions of that Treaty. It therefore would have 
preferred the resolution to call on all States party to the NPT to ensure such compliance. The European 
Union would continue to urge all States in the region to implement comprehensive safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols fully, and it felt that the resolution would have been stronger had 
it included a call for implementation of additional protocols. Despite those reservations, it had 
supported the resolution as part of an earnest effort to ensure that the decisions of the General 
Conference were taken by consensus. 
67. Mr BARRETT (Canada), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his country continued to call 
on all States that had not yet done so to sign and bring into force comprehensive safeguards 
agreements with the Agency. Canada was also a strong supporter of the additional protocol and the 
establishment of a verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
68. In past years, resolutions on the issue in question had enjoyed broad support and his country 
regretted the introduction of language that had led to the collapse of that consensus. The current 
resolution unduly politicized a forum that had historically adopted a more technical perspective. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 11 
Canada was also disappointed that the resolution did not address the important issue of compliance 
with safeguards obligations. 
20. Israeli nuclear capabilities 
(GC(54)/14; GC(54)/L.2) 
69. The PRESIDENT noted that item 20 had been included on the agenda pursuant to General 
Conference resolution GC(53)/RES/17. Pursuant to operative paragraph 4 of that resolution, the 
Director General had submitted the report contained in document GC(54)/14. Also before the General 
Conference was document GC(54)/L.2 containing a draft resolution submitted by a group of countries. 
70. Mr ELAMIN (Sudan), introducing the draft resolution on behalf of the Arab States that were 
members of the Agency, said that all Arab States without exception had adopted a united stance in 
favour of the non-proliferation regime, had acceded to the NPT and had approved the initiative aimed 
at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Israel, on the other hand, was the only 
State in the region that possessed nuclear weapons and had refused to accede to the NPT and place its 
nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. Its attitude rendered peace and security difficult to achieve 
and was a source of increased tension in the Middle East that could trigger an arms race. 
71. The goal of the Arab States in raising the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities at successive 
sessions of the General Conference was not only to draw attention to that dangerous situation but also 
to propose a practical solution, which consisted in adopting a comprehensive approach that took the 
security of all countries in the Middle East into consideration instead of dealing in a biased and 
selective manner with each country individually and applying double standards. 
72. At its 53rd regular session, the General Conference had adopted resolution GC(53)/RES/17 
which called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive 
Agency safeguards. Resolutions had also been adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and 
Security Council and by the NPT Review Conferences, including the Conference held in May 2010, 
calling on Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency 
safeguards as a prerequisite for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
73. Impartial reports had confirmed that Israel possessed a significant arsenal of nuclear weapons. 
The Arab States and the international community as a whole could not afford to ignore that situation 
or tolerate IsraelÂs efforts to develop its nuclear capabilities, taking advantage of the lack of any real 
international pressure to impede such an escalation. Some countries did their utmost to prevent any 
light being shed on IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities and to impede the adoption by the General Conference 
of a resolution that mentioned Israel by name. At the same time, charges were levelled against other 
countries without solid proof. 
74. Some States had sought to block a vote on the draft resolution submitted to the preceding 
session of the Conference. They had argued that the AgencyÂs role was a technical one and that it was 
inappropriate for it to address political issues. However, the item had been discussed at numerous 
previous sessions of the Conference and the resolution adopted at the preceding session focused on 
technical issues that fell within the AgencyÂs mandate, namely accession to the NPT and application of 
comprehensive safeguards. 
75. The argument that a single resolution on the Middle East was sufficient was also untenable. The 
resolution on application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East fell under a different agenda item and 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 12 
constituted a basic and necessary step towards the achievement of the goal of the current resolution. 
Moreover, there was nothing in the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference to prevent it from 
adopting two resolutions dealing with the same region. Israel was not being singled out by the Arab 
States but was singling itself out and isolating itself by failing to accede to the NPT and place its 
nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
76. In spite of all the arguments put forward, a majority of Member States had voted against the 
motion of no action tabled at the preceding session and in favour of the draft resolution, thereby 
demonstrating that the international community recognized the danger posed by IsraelÂs sole 
possession of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, and the need to ensure that countryÂs accession to 
the NPT and the placement of its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
77. The Arab Group had expressed appreciation for the Director GeneralÂs report in a statement 
delivered to the Board of Governors the preceding week. It regretted the fact that some States Â 
including nuclear-weapon States Â continued to claim that they espoused the principle of universality 
of the NPT but set aside that principle completely when the question of its applicability to Israel arose, 
impeding implementation of the resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities and applying double 
standards. Israel itself had repeatedly refused to cooperate with the Agency in implementing the 
resolution and all other relevant international resolutions, as attested by the message from the Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel to the Director General dated 26 July 2010. 
The Israeli representative had stated immediately after the adoption of the resolution at the 
53rd regular session of the General Conference that his country would not cooperate in any way with 
the resolution. Moreover, the Israeli Prime Minister had stated after the 2010 NPT Review Conference 
that he rejected all its decisions concerning the Middle East and would not cooperate in their 
implementation. 
78. In view of the lack of progress in implementing resolution GC(53)/RES/17, the Arab Group had 
decided to resubmit it to the current session in order to reaffirm its importance. Some States were 
again trying to block its passage by putting forward new arguments. For instance, they argued that its 
resubmission would obstruct the initiatives stemming from the 2010 NPT Review Conference. That 
argument was baseless, since the prospects of holding a successful conference in 2012 on a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would be boosted if Israel were to comply with the 
provisions of the resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities and other similar international resolutions. 
79. Some States argued that the resubmission of the draft resolution would distract attention from 
other more important agenda items. That position again demonstrated the application of double 
standards, since priority was given to matters concerning certain States at the expense of those with a 
direct bearing on the achievement of security and peace in the Middle East. 
80. The argument that the resolution lacked legitimacy because it was not based on a consensus was 
refuted by public international law. If applied more widely, that argument would cast doubt on other 
resolutions of the General Conference and the Board of Governors. 
81. The draft resolution represented the minimum acceptable to the Arab States, inasmuch as it 
focused on technical points, i.e. the universality of the NPT and the aim of ridding the Middle East of 
nuclear weapons; and the Arab States had demonstrated flexibility and a desire to achieve consensus. 
They had spared no effort over the preceding few days to address concerns and eliminate sources of 
contention. Unfortunately, however, their efforts had run up against the determination of some parties 
to return to the past and reverse the progress achieved at the preceding session when the resolution had 
been adopted. Clearly some States were determined to exempt Israel from compliance with 
international standards and to offer it preferential treatment, applying double standards when it came 
to nuclear non-proliferation in the Middle East. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 13 
82. The Arab States that were members of the Agency, emphasizing the inalienable right of every 
country to express its concerns and seek to resolve them, a right enshrined in the basic instruments of 
all international organizations, urged the General Conference to give the issue of Israeli nuclear 
capabilities the attention it deserved and to vote unanimously for the draft resolution with a view to 
ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons and laying the basis for peace and security in the region 
and the world as a whole. 
83. The Arab Group thanked the Member States that had supported the resolution at the preceding 
session of the General Conference, especially NAM, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and 
the African Group, and urged them to vote in favour of the draft resolution. It called on Member States 
that had abstained or voted against the previous resolution to reconsider their position and adopt a 
stance that was consistent with the principle of universality of the NPT and the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
84. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), speaking on behalf of NAM, reiterated NAMÂs principled position on the 
issue under discussion. NAM strongly believed that stability could not be achieved in a region where 
massive imbalances in military capabilities were maintained, particularly through the possession of 
nuclear weapons, which allowed one party to threaten its neighbours and the region. NAM welcomed 
the fact that its member States party to the NPT concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with 
the Agency in fulfilment of their obligations under Article III.(1) of the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon 
States. It noted that all NAM member States in the Middle East had done so. NAM considered the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East a positive step towards the objective 
of global nuclear disarmament and it reiterated its support for the establishment of such a zone in 
accordance with relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council. 
85. NAM noted with concern that a selective approach to the issue of nuclear capabilities in the 
Middle East undermined the viability of the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. That approach had also 
resulted in the continued and dangerous presence of unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and activities in 
Israel, despite repeated calls on that country to submit those facilities to comprehensive safeguards, 
and despite the conclusion by all other States in the region of comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
NAM was greatly concerned over the acquisition of a nuclear capability by Israel, which posed a 
serious and continuing threat to the security of neighbouring and other States, and over the fact that 
scientists from Israel continued to have access to the nuclear facilities of a certain nuclear-weapon 
State. Those factors could have dire consequences for international security. 
86. NAM urged all Member States to cooperate to reverse that unacceptable situation. It encouraged 
them to contribute to achieving universality of comprehensive safeguards in the Middle East region, 
noting that implementation of General Conference resolution GC(53)/RES/17 was a first step towards 
that end. 
87. NAM had looked forward to the Director GeneralÂs strong and active involvement in 
implementing that resolution, and to comprehensive reporting on the issue to both the Board of 
Governors and the General Conference which would not only reflect the views of Member States but 
would also disclose all information available to the Secretariat on the nature and scope of Israeli 
nuclear facilities and activities that would be covered by any comprehensive safeguards agreement 
concluded with that country, including information pertaining to previous nuclear transfers to it, and 
which would outline how the Agency viewed the way forward, inter alia identifying all necessary 
measures to be undertaken by the parties concerned. 
88. NAM was fully committed to implementing resolution GC(53)/RES/17 and expected other 
Agency Member States to do likewise. It therefore found it regrettable that, almost a year after the 
adoption of that resolution, the Secretariat was not in a position to provide the Board and General 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 14 
Conference with a list of those nuclear facilities and activities that could be subject to a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement should Israel conclude such an agreement. The Secretariat was also not in a 
position to provide information relevant to IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities beyond what was included in 
Section C of the Director GeneralÂs report and in each yearÂs SIR. NAM requested further clarification 
regarding the SecretariatÂs efforts to obtain such information and the responses received from Member 
States. 
89. NAM also regretted the fact that the Director GeneralÂs report did not address its formal 
requests to outline how the Agency saw the way forward, and that it thus fell short of addressing 
concerns that had been expressed by more than two thirds of the AgencyÂs Member States. NAM 
therefore requested that the Director General issue an addendum to his report that would fully address 
its concerns. 
90. NAM regretted IsraelÂs continued insistence that the issue of Agency safeguards could not be 
addressed in isolation from the regional peace process. It emphasized that there was no automatic 
sequence that linked the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle 
East to the prior conclusion of a peace settlement, and that the former would contribute to the latter. 
91. NAM continued to be concerned at IsraelÂs apparent determination not to cooperate in any way 
with resolution GC(53)/RES/17. In that connection, it reiterated its call for the total and complete 
prohibition of the transfer of all nuclear-related equipment, information, material, facilities, resources 
and devices, and the extension of assistance in nuclear-related scientific and technological fields, to 
Israel. 
92. NAM further noted that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel, in 
a letter attached to the Director GeneralÂs report, had stated that Israel valued the non-proliferation 
regime, acknowledged its importance and had over the years demonstrated a responsible policy of 
restraint in the nuclear domain. In NAMÂs view, the official records of the Agency contradicted that 
assertion. In that context, NAM drew attention to the resolutions issued by the General Conference 
prior to 1994 regarding South AfricaÂs nuclear capabilities, as well as a number of United Nations 
General Assembly resolutions which had strongly condemned the extensive collaboration between 
Israel and South Africa, especially in the military and nuclear fields. 
93. Mr AZOULAY (Israel) said that the draft resolution was political in nature and contradicted the 
basic aims and goals of the Agency. Its only purpose was to condemn one Member State, diverting 
attention from the true nature of the AgencyÂs work. A fact that some Member States tended to 
overlook was that, while Israel was not the only State to exercise its sovereign rights in deciding not to 
accede to the NPT, it was the only such State to be singled out, indicating the real political intentions 
behind the draft resolution. He encouraged Member States that wished to contribute to the 
improvement of regional security in the Middle East to focus on improving the cooperative 
relationship among States of the region, rather than pushing forward a controversial draft resolution 
that would widen divisions and increase mistrust. 
94. He asked how progress towards a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction could truly 
be envisioned when Israel was not allowed to become a member of the AgencyÂs Middle East and 
South Asia regional group, and how real dialogue could take place while some Member States were 
calling for IsraelÂs annihilation. 
95. True dialogue could not be based on dictation, coercion or resolutions imposed by a majority 
vote. The uncompromising and negative path taken by the sponsors of the draft resolution indicated 
their real aims, which were political and had nothing to do with the AgencyÂs mandate and the 
maintenance of its credibility as a technical organization. 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 15 
96. His country saw a similarity between the list of sponsors of the draft resolution and the list of 
countries that had been criticized in the SIR. The draft resolution was being used by those States as an 
instrument to divert attention from their gross violations and to sabotage the AgencyÂs capability to 
fulfil its mission and legal mandate. The Agency should focus on violations of safeguards obligations 
rather than wasting time and resources on a cynical, politically motivated resolution. The most 
significant threats to the non-proliferation regime and the NPT came from Member States that 
breached their NPT obligations, pursuing nuclear weapons under the cover of their NPT membership. 
97. It was Iran and Syria that posed the greatest threat to peace and security in the Middle East and 
beyond. Neither of those countries, nor any other State that breached its safeguards obligations, could 
conceal those breaches behind a barrage of statements. Some might see it as advantageous to make 
accusations against Israel, but to do so was a disservice to the efforts being made to stem dangerous 
proliferation trends and promote a meaningful regional arms control dialogue. 
98. The agenda item under discussion and the draft resolution were clearly incompatible with the 
basic principles and norms of international law. The General Conference was not the guardian of the 
NPT and the Agency was not the Secretariat of the NPT. The Agency was required by its Statute to 
carry out its activities with due respect for the sovereign rights of States. To call for States to accede to 
international treaties went far beyond the purview of the AgencyÂs statutory functions. Moreover, the 
preamble to the NPT clarified that it was designed for a political environment where States must 
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of any State, and that parties to the Treaty should share the overall objective of 
attaining peace and security. 
99. In including the current item in the agenda of the General Conference, it was clear that the 
sponsors of the draft resolution were not looking for real progress in the Middle East but were scoring 
political points. Adoption of the resolution would be a fatal blow to any hope for future cooperative 
efforts aimed at achieving better regional security in the Middle East. 
100. Mr DAVIES (United States of America) said that his country continued to be committed to the 
goals of universality of the NPT and a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction. Based on 
those commitments, his country opposed the draft resolution which it viewed as divisive. Adoption of 
the draft resolution could also put at risk any chance of convening in 2012 the conference on a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East that had been envisioned at the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. 
101. It was also unfortunate that the draft resolution was being pursued at a time when peace talks in 
the Middle East had just restarted after a long delay. Prior to the General Conference, the United 
States of America had put forward a proposal to avoid confrontation on the issue at the current session, 
without asking any group to change its principled position. His country had asked for a one-year 
moratorium on the agenda item, so as to give the nascent peace process a chance to proceed without 
the risk of being poisoned by a confrontation at the General Conference. He found it regrettable that 
there had been no positive response to that proposal. 
102. His country believed that the only route towards peace in the Middle East and towards a Middle 
East free of weapons of mass destruction was through agreement among all States in the region. He 
urged Member States to vote against the resolution and, by doing so, to preserve the outcome of the 
NPT Review Conference and avoid undercutting the peace negotiations. 
103. Ms GOICOCHEA ESTENOZ (Cuba) said that her country believed that the adoption of the 
draft resolution by the General Conference would complement the efforts being undertaken in other 
contexts. Its implementation would pave the way for the 2012 conference decided upon by the 
2010 NPT Review Conference. The issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities should be addressed by the 
GC(54)/OR.9 
24 September 2010, Page 16 
General Conference because it constituted a serious threat to international peace and security and 
hence fell within the scope of the AgencyÂs mandate, which required that it verify that nuclear energy 
was used exclusively for peaceful purposes. The fact that Israel was the only State in the Middle East 
that had not acceded to the NPT or expressed an intention to do so, and whose nuclear facilities were 
not subject to Agency safeguards, warranted the continued inclusion of the item in the agenda of both 
the Board of Governors and the General Conference. 
104. Cuba thanked the Director General for his efforts to discharge the mandate conferred on him by 
the General Conference, including his recent visit to Israel. 
105. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) emphasized that the sponsors of the draft resolution had not intended 
to sow division among the participants at the General Conference. The draft resolution was in keeping 
with the AgencyÂs mandate, which required it to ensure that nuclear energy was used for peaceful 
purposes and contributed to the socio-economic development of Member States, and it expressed the 
serious concern of the countries of the Middle East region over IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities. It 
supported the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, the final document of which, which had 
been adopted by consensus, recalled the importance of IsraelÂs accession to the NPT and the 
placement of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. She joined the 
representative of the United States in urging States to make every effort to ensure the success of the 
conference on the Middle East scheduled for 2012. She also encouraged the Director General to 
continue his work with the States concerned, which was greatly appreciated. 
106. Mr PUJA (Indonesia) said that his country strongly believed that the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, which initiative constituted an essential component of 
the peace process, could be achieved only if all countries became constructively involved in the 
process with the support of the nuclear-weapon States. Indonesia had consistently supported General 
Conference resolutions on Israeli nuclear capabilities as a manifestation of its strong belief that all 
nuclear-weapon-related issues in the region must be addressed in a holistic manner. It was therefore 
encouraged by the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, which had tasked the 
Secretary-General and the sponsors of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East with the convening of a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone in the Middle East free of nuclear weapons and all 
other weapons of mass destruction. Such an event should provide a unique opportunity to make 
progress towards a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
107. Indonesia noted with deep regret that one country in the region had stated immediately after the 
NPT Review Conference that it would not attend the 2012 conference. Such a negative reaction 
demonstrated that countryÂs disregard for the painful process that had led to the agreement to hold a 
conference, and it jeopardized the prospects for its success. His country also found it regrettable that 
the efforts to facilitate a compromise solution at the General Conference and prevent confrontation had 
not met with the full support of all Member States. 
108. Mr AZOULAY (Israel) requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution. 
109. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote on the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(54)/L.2. 
110. Thailand, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
111. The result of the vote was as follows:

Report to the 54th Regular Session of the IAEA General Conference 
from the 13th Scientific Forum 
24 September 2010 
delivered by Mr. T.A. Ngoma 
Mr. President, Director General, Distinguished Delegates 
I am pleased and honoured to be given this opportunity to present to the General Conference my report 
on the IAEA Scientific Forum 2010, whose theme was Cancer in Developing Countries: Facing the 
Challenge. 
Mr. President 
When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were set, priority was given to HIV/AIDS, 
Malaria and Tuberculosis. As a result of this, cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 
were marginalized in the global development agenda. 
However, today, cancer and other non-communicable diseases are the major causes of death globally 
accounting for more than double the number of deaths from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS 
combined. 
Statistics show that the majority of cancer cases and deaths today occur in developing countries, some 
of which are so poorly equipped to respond to the looming crisis. It is estimated that by 2030, over 
13 million people worldwide will die from cancer every year and that 9 million of these deaths will be 
in developing countries. 
Mr. President, 
In view of the above, and the lack of global awareness about the enormous magnitude of cancer in 
developing countries, the Director General decided to make cancer control the highest priority of the 
Agency in his first year of office. He also decided to make it the theme of this weekÂs Scientific 
Forum. It brought together the entire spectrum of people committed to fight cancer - governments, 
World Health Organisation (WHO) and other international organizations, NGOs, including Union for 
International Cancer Control (UICC), Livestrong Foundation, Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI), 
doctors, advocates, industry, and many individuals from the public and media. 

GC(54)/OR.9 
Annex 
24 September 2010, Page 2 
During the opening session, the Director General stressed that the aim of the Forum was to give the 
participants an opportunity to learn more about how best to work together to fight cancer in 
developing countries. He expressed the hope that at the end of the Scientific Forum, all the participants 
would have a better understanding of what they could do to contribute to the fight against cancer. 
He noted that, at the international level, work on cancer control is fragmented and cancer is an 
overlooked aspect of global health. There was therefore a need to address this by strengthening 
international cooperation, building publicÂprivate partnerships and mobilizing new resources. The 
Director General further said that the IAEA partnership with WHO is vital and a great example of 
international organizations working together in a common cause. The DG stressed that although the 
international organizations cannot build cancer care infrastructures in developing countries, they can 
assist by providing training, expertise and advice, and by helping to ensure that the voice of 
developing countries is heard. For example, the AgencyÂs Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy 
(PACT) is working with a growing number of Member States. PACT bridges the gap between the 
work of the IAEA in human health and the work underway in developing countries to establish 
comprehensive cancer care networks. 
Mr. President 
The Scientific Forum was fortunate to have two first ladies at the opening session, who are already 
bringing their influence to bear at the highest level. The first lady of Mongolia told the conference that 
cancer is the second main cause of death in her country and said ÂIt is unacceptable that we let our 
people die at their prime age because of a disease which is both preventable and treatable, at the age 
when they would have otherwise lived and enjoyed the beauties of life and contributed to the good of 
humankindÂ. 
EgyptÂs First lady reminded us not to lose sight of the ultimate goal of eradicating cancer. To those 
who say we will not find a cure for cancer, she said: ÂSixty years ago they said the same about polio. 
They were wrong then and I sincerely hope they will be wrong now.Â 
After the opening session, a simulated tumour board was held, in which a multi-disciplinary team of 
doctors Â including radiation oncologists, medical oncologists and surgeons Â discussed the best 
treatment for a hypothetical patient with breast cancer. 
Subsequent sessions dealt with Cancer as part of the Global health Agenda, Bringing Partners 
together, IAEAÂs role in combating cancer, Emerging technologies: challenges and Opportunities and 
safe and appropriate use of New Radiation Medicine Technology in New Surroundings. There was 
hope, passion and energy in the discussions and some heart-rending stories. There was a young 
GC(54)/OR.9 
Annex 
24 September 2010, Page 3 
radiation oncologist from Malawi, the only one in his country, who has no radiotherapy equipment and 
can only prescribe chemotherapy. There were surgeons who said they can only offer mastectomies to 
breast cancer patients rather than less disfiguring lumpectomies because they have no radiotherapy 
facilities. 
The details of the technology and resource gap in the real world were discussed. The critical need for 
Government support in the development of health systems was recognised. In this connection, the 
IAEAÂs significant role in providing radiation medicine know-how and training was acknowledged to 
be a key component of the fight against cancer. The development of partnerships through PACT 
around technology, training and services was recommended. The need to put in place regulations for 
the safe and appropriate use of radiation medicine technology was stressed. There was general 
agreement in the Scientific Forum that having cancer as part of the Global Development Agenda is an 
essential prerequisite for addressing the growing cancer problem in developing countries. 
Mr. President 
Finally after two days of intense and productive deliberations the Scientific Conference closed with 
the following recommendations: 
1. The Agency should maintain the priority given to cancer within its programmes and in 
particular continue to support, allocate and mobilize resources for the implementation of 
its cancer related programme. 
2. The Agency should continue to advocate for a comprehensive approach to cancer control, 
from prevention to palliative care, integrating the safe and effective use of radiation 
medicine in close cooperation with WHO. 
3. The Agency should strive to further pursue the necessary steps to place cancer on the 
development agenda and to support the cancer control capacity building efforts to its 
member states. 
4. The Agency, Member States and NGOs should actively participate in the UN General 
Assembly debate and discussions on the review of the MDGs. The participants in the 
Scientific Conference firmly believe that the support of world leaders and the UN system 
is crucial to turn the focus on the impact of cancer and other NCDs across the developing 
world.

In summary, the Scientific Forum concluded that there was indeed a need for International 
Organizations to put cancer on the development agenda. The message the participants took away was 
one of hope, and an expectation that this must be a continuing process whose momentum must be 
maintained to make sure that cancer in developing countries get the top level recognition it deserves. 
Thank you, Mr President.

20. Israeli nuclear capabilities (continued) 
(GC(54)/14 and Add.1, GC(54)/L.2) 
1. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of vote, said that the 
agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities dealt with a serious security concern affecting the Middle 
East and the whole world. All nuclear activities of the Zionist regime should be subjected to Agency 
safeguards, as had been recommended for all countries in the Final Document of the 2010 NPT 
Review Conference. 
2. Unfortunately, international demands had gone unanswered. IsraelÂs failure to accede to the 
NPT was the only obstacle to universal application of that treaty and the creation of an NWFZ in the 
Middle East. The double standards demonstrated by IsraelÂs allies in the debate on the draft resolution 
voted on during the previous meeting would inevitably have a negative impact on the universality of 
the non-proliferation regime. 
3. The Israeli regimeÂs aggressive practices and its defiance of over 100 resolutions of the United 
Nations Security Council and other bodies gave rise to serious concern. The Agency must take a firm 
stand and ensure the prompt implementation of all relevant resolutions if its credibility was not to be 
seriously jeopardized. The pressure exerted by certain Member States must not be allowed to succeed. 
4. Even though the draft resolution had been narrowly rejected, all peace-loving people of the 
world admired the sustained determination of the sponsors, who had resisted the intensive lobbying of 
Israel and its allies, especially the United States of America. All those who had supported the draft 
resolution in the interests of peace in the Middle East and the world at large were to be commended. 
The actions of the United States and its allies, on the other hand, showed that those countries were not 
putting into practice the fine words they had uttered in support of the NPT. By their actions, they had 
undermined the unanimous adoption of the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The 
fact that over 100 countries had resisted the pressure exerted by the United States constituted a major 
setback for that countryÂs foreign policy. Those countries were to be congratulated on their persistence 
in a noble cause. 
5. Mr TAN York Chor (Singapore), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his countryÂs 
abstention had been due not to doubts about the content of the draft resolution, but to doubts about the 
value of adopting a resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities at present. After 15 years, the States 
parties to the NPT had at last managed to agree on the convening, in 2012, of a conference to discuss 
the creation of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle 
East. The path ahead would not be an easy one; all parties would have to show prudence. 
6. The resumption of direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders Â a crucial first step 
towards a just and lasting peace in the Middle East Â was a positive but fragile development. His 
country did not believe that adoption of the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities would have 
encouraged all the countries of the Middle East to participate in the 2012 conference. 
7. Ms DAVIDSDÃTTIR (Iceland), speaking in explanation of vote, said that her country, a strong 
supporter of nuclear non-proliferation efforts, would like all States to be parties to the NPT. However, 
Iceland had not supported the draft resolution, since it had been aimed at just one country. 
8. Mr RECKER (Belgium), speaking in explanation of vote on behalf of the Member States of the 
European Union, which had voted against the draft resolution, said that the European UnionÂs position 
GC(54)/OR.10 
24 September 2010, Page 2 
had been widely publicized, inter alia by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security 
Policy, Catherine Ashton, in a letter to the League of Arab States, in which she had stated that 
pursuing a non-consensual approach, such as that taken in the draft resolution, would not further the 
progress made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference and could only undermine the AgencyÂs ability to 
contribute to the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of 
delivery in the Middle East. 
9. The situation had changed following the successful conclusion of the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. The current session of the General Conference - the first major meeting dealing with 
nuclear non-proliferation issues since the Review Conference - provided an excellent opportunity to 
work together to implement the Review ConferenceÂs recommendations. The European Union 
continued to believe that a consensual approach was the best way to make progress towards the 
implementation of the resolution on the Middle East adopted in 1995 by the NPT Review and 
Extension Conference and the recommendations of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, including the 
convening of a conference on the Middle East in 2012. 
10. The European Union had consistently advocated universal adherence to agreements on arms 
control and disarmament and on the non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. It 
called upon all States in the Middle East to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols with the Agency. It also called upon all States that were not parties to the NPT to 
comply with its provisions and with relevant Security Council, General Conference and Board of 
Governors resolutions, as a crucial contribution to improvement in the security situation in the Middle 
East. 
11. Mr STACEY MORENO (Ecuador), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had 
voted in favour of the draft resolution in accordance with its principle of encouraging universal 
adherence to the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards system. It hoped that further progress would be 
made towards peace in the Middle East and that the conference to be held in 2012 would be a success. 
12. Ms YPARRAGUIRRE (Philippines), speaking in explanation of vote, said that her country had 
voted in favour of the draft resolution because of its commitment to universal adherence to the NPT. 
The Philippines hoped that further progress would soon be made in the implementation of the Final 
Document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, including the establishment of an NWFZ in the 
Middle East. 
13. Mr KHULLAR (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had abstained 
because the draft resolution dealt with issues which were unconnected with the mandate of the 
Agency. 
14. Ms PHETCHARATANA (Thailand) said that, although her delegation had abstained in the 
vote, her country still advocated universal adherence to the NPT and the establishment of a zone free 
of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Her country greatly 
appreciated the efforts currently being made to promote peace in that region, especially the recently 
resumed direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and urged all parties to work together 
constructively. 
15. Mr CHOREV (Israel) said that his delegation welcomed the rejection of the draft resolution, 
which had served no valuable purpose. The majority of delegations had demonstrated their wish to 
keep alive the prospects for common efforts to promote peace and security in the Middle East, and 
also to maintain the credibility of the Agency. It was to be hoped that the vote had conveyed a clear 
message to the sponsors of the draft resolution and that the positive spirit shown at the General 
ConferenceÂs current session would prevail in the years to come. For its part, his country would do its 
utmost to promote dialogue. 
GC(54)/OR.10 
24 September 2010, Page 3 
16. Mr DAVIES (United States of America) expressed satisfaction at the rejection of the draft 
resolution. The vote had not created winners or losers, but had preserved the opportunity for progress 
towards peace in the Middle East, which, surely, every delegation present wished to promote. Member 
States should set aside the divisiveness that had characterized the discussions under the current agenda 
item and begin working together. The rejection of the draft resolution left Member States in a stronger 
position to pursue the noble goal of a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, but much work 
remained to be done in the coming weeks and months. His country stood ready, with renewed 
determination, to face the obstacles ahead. 
17. Mr AMARSANAA (Mongolia), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his country believed 
that the General Conference should send a positive signal in support of attainment of a noble objective 
Â namely, the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction 
in the Middle East Â and of the convening of a conference in 2012 to that end. Mongolia had 
abstained in the vote on the draft resolution, which, in its view, did not convey such a signal. 
18. Mr NAKANE (Japan), speaking in explanation of vote, said that for many years his country had 
been urging all States which had not yet done so, including Israel, to accede to the NPT and conclude 
a comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol. It had therefore supported the draft 
resolution on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East (GC(54)/L.1), which dealt with 
the same issues as the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities. However, his country had not 
considered that the latter draft resolution would contribute to the implementation of the action plan 
agreed at the 2010 NPT Review Conference or the convening of the 2012 conference, and it had 
therefore voted against it. 
19. Japan hoped that all the States concerned would build up mutual confidence through dialogue 
and achieve the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in the Middle East without further delay. 
20. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela), speaking in explanation of 
vote, said that his country supported the aspiration of Arab States to establish an NWFZ in the Middle 
East. Israel, the only State in the region which had not acceded to the NPT, must renounce nuclear 
weapons, accede to that treaty without delay and submit all its nuclear facilities to the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system. There must be a complete ban on the transfer of nuclear material, technology and 
expertise to Israel. 
21. His delegation had voted in favour of the draft resolution, which related to a priority issue for 
the General Conference. The Israeli nuclear programme posed a major threat to international peace 
and security, and IsraelÂs failure to accede to the NPT was an impediment to the establishment of a 
global safeguards regime. His delegation regretted that a certain group of countries was defending 
Israel, thus preventing the Agency from fully exercising its verification function in the Middle East. 
The entire international community should work for the establishment of an NWFZ in that region Â 
an objective in the attainment of which the Agency had a crucial role to play. 
22. Mr ELAMIN (Sudan), speaking for the Arab Group, said that the Group deeply regretted the 
outcome of the vote, which was evidence of some countriesÂ double standards in respect of 
non-proliferation efforts in the Middle East and would undermine efforts to create an NWFZ there. 
The insistence by some Member States, including certain nuclear-weapon States, that Israel need not 
comply with international resolutions such as General Conference resolution GC(53)/RES/17 showed 
that they did not apply the same criteria to all States and were not serious about achieving universal 
application of the NPT. 
23. Unprecedented pressure had been placed on Member States to vote in a way which would allow 
Israel to pursue its policies, which served only to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East. The Arab 
GC(54)/OR.10 
24 September 2010, Page 4 
States would pursue, by all legal means, their aim of ensuring that all Israeli nuclear facilities were 
subjected to the AgencyÂs safeguards system and would resist attempts to allow Israel to ignore 
decisions of the international community as expressed in resolutions of the General Conference and 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
24. The Arab Group was grateful to those countries which had supported the draft resolution; their 
noble stance would not be forgotten. 
25. Mr QUEISI (Jordan) said that, if universal adherence to the NPT and the creation of an NWFZ 
in the Middle East were to be achieved, underlying problems would need to be discussed thoroughly 
and objectively in the General Conference, followed by the adoption of detailed and equitable 
resolutions. All States in the region, except Israel, had acceded to the NPT and subjected their nuclear 
facilities to the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. Israel had refused to do so, despite the many resolutions 
adopted by the international community since as far back as 1981. That was the underlying problem. 
26. Mr SABBAGH (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the debate on Israeli nuclear capabilities at the 
General ConferenceÂs current session and the resolution on that subject adopted at the previous session 
(GC(53)/RES/17) had shown the concern felt by many Member States about the nuclear activities 
conducted by Israel with the support of certain other States and not subject to international controls. 
IsraelÂs supporters had shown their double standards by advocating universal adherence to the NPT 
but not supporting draft resolutions in which all States in the Middle East were called upon to accede 
to the NPT. 
27. The States which had opposed the draft resolution had prevented the Arab Group from 
expressing its concern about the Israeli nuclear arsenal, which posed a threat to peace and security in 
the Middle East. Israel continued to ignore numerous resolutions adopted in international forums, flout 
international law and occupy Arab territory. Had no international organization the power to curb 
IsraelÂs defiance of international law? The international community, and particularly the NPT 
Depositary States, should act to ensure that Israel complied with the resolutions adopted in 
international forums by acceding to the NPT and opening up its nuclear facilities for Agency 
inspection. 
28. The Arab States wished the item on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ to be maintained on the 
agendas of the Board of Governors and the General Conference. 
29. Mr OULD ZAHAVE (Mauritania), having thanked all the delegations which had voted in 
favour of the draft resolution, said that it had not been intended to be divisive, but to bring about 
IsraelÂs accession to the NPT. Until Israel acceded to that treaty, peace in the Middle East would be 
under threat and all efforts of the Agency to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy would be in 
vain. 
30. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that the resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities adopted the 
previous year (GC(53)/RES/17) had been discussed twice by the Board of Governors and had been the 
subject of a report by the Director General, but unfortunately no progress had been made in its 
implementation. Israel had not acceded to the NPT or subjected all its nuclear facilities to the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system, nor had it agreed to implement the resolution. 
31. Some Member States had used the lack of progress in the implementation of the resolution as an 
excuse for trying to have the item on Israeli nuclear capabilities excluded from the agendas of the 
Board of Governors and General Conference. Those Member States should acknowledge that their 
persistence in condoning IsraelÂs defiance of international law had contributed to the lack of progress 
in the implementation of the resolution. As long as they unyieldingly opposed any discussion of the 
Israeli nuclear programme within the Agency, there was little prospect of an NWFZ being established 
GC(54)/OR.10 
24 September 2010, Page 5 
in the Middle East. Over the years, tolerance had been transformed into a policy of shielding IsraelÂs 
nuclear capabilities from international scrutiny and preserving the opacity which characterized all its 
nuclear activities. 
32. The draft resolution had not been intended to divert the attention of the AgencyÂs 
Policy-Making Organs from other important issues. Any group of countries had the right to raise its 
legitimate concerns without being subjected to intimidation. The draft resolution was long overdue, 
and rejecting it because of a potential threat to the Â as yet hypothetical Â 2012 conference had been 
naive. Acceptance by Israel of the provisions of the draft resolution would have been the best way to 
build confidence and pave the way for a successful conference in 2012. 
33. The General Conference was an appropriate forum in which to raise the issue of Israeli nuclear 
capabilities. For some years it had adopted an annual resolution on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and 
threatÂ until 1992. The decision to stop adopting such resolutions had not improved the situation. The 
draft resolution which had just been rejected did not single out Israel; that country had singled itself 
out by deliberately choosing to remain outside the NPT, thus arousing the fears of its neighbours about 
its nuclear capabilities. The argument that peace was a prerequisite for nuclear disarmament had been 
disproved by the accession of all the Arab States to the NPT and the conclusion by many of them of an 
additional protocol. 
34. Finally, he wondered whether the General ConferenceÂs resolutions had an expiry date. What 
was the benefit to the Agency of adopting an almost identical resolution every year when the Agency 
should be focusing its efforts on implementing the resolutions which already existed? What was the 
legal basis for such a practice? 
35. Pending any answer to those questions, his delegation was grateful to all other delegations that 
had supported the draft resolution, which dealt with a highly controversial issue that was exacerbating 
the already inflammable situation in the Middle East. 
36. Mr. TAJOURI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), expressing disappointment at the outcome of the vote 
on the draft resolution, said that a group of countries that bore a major responsibility for 
implementation of the NPT had turned a blind eye to certain issues relating to Israel while vigorously 
pursuing those issues when they related to other countries. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had 
called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. The rejection of the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/L.2 sent a message to 
Israel that it need not submit to the will of the international community. Israel had not attended the 
2010 NPT Review Conference, and it would probably not attend the 2012 conference either. The Arab 
States had proposed the draft resolution because they had deemed it to be of paramount importance for 
the achievement of universal adherence to the NPT.

Â Oral report by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole 
1. Mr GARCÃA REVILLA (Peru), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented the 
outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 21. 
2. Under item 9, ÂThe AgencyÂs Accounts for 2009Â, the Committee recommended that the 
Conference adopt the draft resolution set out on page i of document GC(54)/3. 
3. Under item 10, ÂThe AgencyÂs Budget Update for 2011Â, the Committee recommended that the 
Conference approve a Regular Budget figure for 2011 of Â331 516 685 and accordingly adopt draft 
resolution A, Regular Budget Appropriations for 2011, as set out in document GC(54)/2; that it 
approve a target for voluntary contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2011 of 
US $86 000 000 and accordingly adopt draft resolution B, Technical Cooperation Fund Allocation for 
2011, as set out in document GC(54)/2; and that it approve a level for the Working Capital Fund in 
2011 of Â15 210 000 and accordingly adopt draft resolution C, The Working Capital Fund in 2011, as 
set out in document GC(54)/2. 
4. Under item 11, ÂAmendment to Article XIV.A of the StatuteÂ, the Committee recommended 
that the Conference adopt the draft decision set out in document GC(54)/18. 
5. Under item 12, ÂScale of assessment of MembersÂ contributions towards the Regular Budget 
for 2011Â, the Committee recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution set out on 
page 3 of document GC(54)/7. 
6. Under item 13, ÂMeasures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport 
and waste safetyÂ, the Committee recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(54)/L.5. 
7. Under item 14, ÂNuclear security, including measures to protect against nuclear and radiological 
terrorismÂ, the Committee had reached broad agreement on most of the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(54)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.2, but there remained several operative paragraphs on which 
some delegations had expressed concerns and which had prevented consensus being achieved during 
the CommitteeÂs deliberations. 
8. Under item 15, ÂStrengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activitiesÂ, the Committee 
recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(54)/L.8/Rev.1. 
9. Under item 16, ÂStrengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology 
and applicationsÂ, the Committee recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolutions 
contained in document GC(54)/L.6 and Add. 1, which were divided into three groups: A, Non-power 
nuclear applications; B, Nuclear power applications; and C, Nuclear knowledge, education and 
training. 
10. Under item 17, ÂStrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Additional ProtocolÂ, there was broad agreement on most of the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/COM.5/L.9/Rev.1, with the exception of two operative 
paragraphs on which some delegations had expressed concerns and which had prevented consensus 
being achieved. 
GC(54)/OR.11 
24 September 2010, Page 2 
11. Under item 21, ÂElections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension CommitteeÂ, the Committee 
recommended that Ms Yema Flora dos Santos Silva of Angola and Ms Miluska Rosario CÃ¡ceres 
Escalante of Peru be elected as alternate members to represent the General Conference on the 
AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee. 
12. He expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the confidence that had been placed in him by 
electing him to undertake the important task of chairing the Committee of the Whole. He thanked 
Mr Jan Petersen of Norway and Mr Cornel Feruta of Romania who had served as Vice-Chairmen; 
Mr Ronald Hutchings of Australia, Mr Luiz OtÃ¡vio Monteiro OrtigÃ£o de Sampaio of Brazil and 
Mr Jim Casterton of Canada, who had conducted consultations on important agenda items; the 
members of the Committee, for their cooperative spirit; and the staff of the Secretariat, along with all 
others who had assisted in the CommitteeÂs work. 
The AgencyÂs Accounts for 2009 (agenda item 9) 
13. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution set out on page i of

GC(54)/L.5 was adopted. 
Nuclear security, including measures to protect against nuclear and radiological terrorism 
(agenda item 14) 
18. The PRESIDENT, recalling that the Committee of the Whole had been unable to reach 
consensus on the draft resolution set out in document GC(54)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.2 during its 
deliberations, said he understood that, as a result of subsequent consultations, the Conference was 
prepared to accept that resolution with two amendments: paragraph (g) of the preamble would be 
amended to read: ÂTaking note of the April 2010 Washington Nuclear Security Summit and the 
Cape Town December 2009 International Conference on effective regulatory systemsÂ, and an 
additional paragraph (g bis) would be inserted in the preamble, to read: ÂTaking note of the April 2010 
Tehran Conference on disarmament and non-proliferation and other international foraÂ. 
19. With those amendments, the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.2 
was adopted.

Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and 
application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 17) 
20. Mr RECKER (Belgium), speaking on behalf of the European Union, proposed that the General 
Conference consider the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/COM.5/L.9/Rev.1, on which 
broad agreement had been reached during the deliberations of the Committee of the Whole. The 
compromise text contained in that document had been recommended by the Chairman of the 
Committee of the Whole as the best basis for achieving consensus. The draft resolution would provide 
important input to the work of the Agency, and he urged all Member States to support it. 
21. Mr KHULLAR (India) said that, as a founder member of the Agency, his country had 
consistently supported all the AgencyÂs activities conducted within the framework of its Statute. India 
attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards activities, in particular, and had contributed to 
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system, including through its active 
participation in the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the framework of the 
IAEA Statute. 
22. His country had hoped that the draft resolution on the important agenda item in question could 
be adopted by consensus. His delegation had striven hard to that end during the meetings of the 
Committee of the Whole, and it was regrettable that his countryÂs suggestion to remove a basic 
inconsistency in operative paragraph 3 of the text had not been followed in the version before the 
General Conference. Until 2000, there had consistently been consensus on the General ConferenceÂs 
resolutions on safeguards. However, in 2001 that consensus had been broken when a new operative 
paragraph had been added urging all Member States to bring into force comprehensive safeguards 
agreements. Regrettably, that paragraph, which was untenable as it overlooked the country-specific 
and voluntary nature of safeguards agreements, had continued to appear in successive draft resolutions 
on safeguards. That fact did not, however, give the paragraph in question any credibility. Safeguards 
undertakings, in whatever form, stemmed from sovereign decisions by States; operative paragraph 3 of 
the draft resolution was inconsistent with that basic element of the AgencyÂs Statute. India had no 
option but to declare its objection to operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution as set out in 
document GC(54)/COM.5/L.9/Rev.1 and to request a roll-call vote on its deletion. 
23. Mr ELAMIN (Sudan), speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, requested a roll-call vote on the 
adoption of the draft resolution as a whole. 
24. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote by roll call on whether to delete operative 
paragraph 3 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(54)/COM.5/L.9/Rev.1, as requested by 
India. 
25. The Holy See, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
26. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: India, Pakistan. 
Against: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, 
Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, 
Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, 
Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, 
Iceland, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Japan, 
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, 
Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, 
Malta, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands,

27. There were 2 votes in favour and 95 against, with 3 abstentions. The paragraph was adopted. 
28. Mr PARVEZ (Pakistan), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his country supported all 
activities of the Agency in every area of its responsibility, in accordance with the provisions of its 
Statute. PakistanÂs support for Agency safeguards was evident from the faithful implementation of all 
its safeguards obligations and its cooperation with the Agency in that regard. The commitment of 
Pakistan to Agency safeguards was rooted in its firm belief that the role of safeguards was to facilitate 
and provide a framework for cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, unaffected by and 
without discrimination based on political or strategic considerations. 
29. His delegation had been constrained to vote in favour of deleting operative paragraph 3 of the 
draft resolution owing to the failure of the sponsors to make the text consistent with the AgencyÂs 
Statute, which took into account the differentiated nature of the safeguards obligations of Member 
States. The draft resolution instead called for the universalization of a particular safeguards model, 
adherence to which was not a legal obligation on all Member States. The AgencyÂs Statute did not 
prescribe a particular safeguards model as the standard for Agency verification. 
30. His delegationÂs vote reflected PakistanÂs commitment to upholding the AgencyÂs Statute in 
letter and spirit. Pakistan would continue to support the AgencyÂs verification activities in a manner 
consistent with the framework laid down in the Statute.

34. There were 80 votes in favour and none against, with 20 abstentions. 
35. Mr PARVEZ (Pakistan), speaking in explanation of vote, said that Pakistan had been 
constrained to abstain from voting on the resolution as a whole owing to the failure of the sponsors to 
make it consistent with the differentiated nature of the safeguards obligations of Member States. It was 
regrettable that the sponsors had once again failed to demonstrate the flexibility and openness required 
to produce a resolution that could be adopted by consensus. He urged the sponsors to take steps to 
address the matter. 
36. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his 
delegation had voted in favour of the resolution because it showed some improvements compared with 
the resolution on the same subject adopted the previous year. He also wished to demonstrate his 
countryÂs support for the safeguards regime. 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities (agenda item 15) 
37. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(54)/L.8/Rev.1 was adopted. 
Strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications 
(agenda item 16) 
38. Mr NAKANE (Japan) said that the Peaceful Uses Initiative had an important role to play in 
strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications. The 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan had requested that US $3.5 million be allocated to the Peaceful 
Uses Initiative as part of the budget estimate for the next fiscal year. He called on all Member States to 
join the Initiative. 
39. Mr DAVIES (United States of America) welcomed the support pledged by Japan as a partner in 
the Peaceful Uses Initiative. The provision of support for Member States wishing to develop nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes was a critical component of the AgencyÂs work and an important element 
of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. His country hoped to expand the Initiative by 
$100 million by the next NPT Review Conference in 2015 and looked forward to working with Japan 
and other Member States to find additional international sources of funding. 
40. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions contained in document 
GC(54)/L.6 and Add. 1 were adopted. 
Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee (agenda item 21) 
41. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, Ms Yema Flora dos Santos Silva of Angola 
and Ms Miluska Rosario CÃ¡ceres Escalante of Peru were elected as alternate members of the AgencyÂs 
Staff Pension Committee.

23. Report on contributions pledged to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund for 2011 
42. The PRESIDENT said that document GC(54)/15/Rev.4 contained details of the pledges of 
contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2011 which Governments had made to the 
Director General by 7 p.m. on 23 September 2010. By that time, Member States had pledged a total of 
Â8 967 969, or 12.73% of the target for 2011. Since that document had been sent for printing, further 
Member States had communicated pledges to the Director General, as follows: Angola Â Â15 765; 
Algeria Â Â86 634; China Â Â2 165 141; Democratic Republic of the Congo Â Â2113; Lebanon Â 
Â15 190; Slovakia Â Â38 400; Syrian Arab Republic Â Â16 904. That brought the total amount 
pledged to Â11 308 116, or 16.05% of the 2011 Technical Cooperation Fund target, which was 2.34% 
higher than the percentage of pledges received by the corresponding time in the preceding year. 
43. He urged all delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2011 pledges and to pay their 
contributions in full at the earliest opportunity so that the Secretariat could submit to the Technical 
Assistance and Cooperation Committee in November a proposed technical cooperation programme for 
2011 based on the level of pledges received, and thereafter implement the approved programme 
without hindrance or uncertainty. 
Â Closing of the session 
44. The PRESIDENT said that the current session of the General Conference had been well 
attended by high-level representatives of Member States, including one Vice-President, one Deputy 
Prime Minister, 27 Ministers, five Ministers of State and two First Ladies. During the general debate, 
119 speakers had taken the floor. 
45. Ms MACMILLAN (New Zealand) paid tribute to the professionalism, patience and good 
humour with which the President had conducted the work of the General Conference. There could be 
no doubt that the decisions reached under his leadership would facilitate the effective work of the 
Agency. 
46. The PRESIDENT expressed his gratitude for the kind words addressed to him on behalf of the 
Conference. It had been an honour and privilege for him and his country to be elected to serve as 
President of the General Conference during its 54th session. 
47. He thanked all delegates for their cooperation, which had allowed the problems encountered 
during the conduct of business to be dealt with. 
48. On behalf of the Conference, he thanked the Director General and his staff for the valuable 
support they had provided during the session, the Austrian authorities which had provided the facilities 
in the Austria Center Vienna, and the city of Vienna for its hospitality during the past week.
