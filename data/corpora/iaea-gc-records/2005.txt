Report 
on 
contributions 
pledged 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2006 
(GC(49)/19/Rev.4) 


1. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
by 
6 
p.m. 
on 
29 
September 
2005, 
the 
contributions 
pledged 
by 
45 
Member 
States 
to 
the 
TCF 
had 
amounted 
to 
$8 
685 
913, 
or 
11.21% 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2006. 
That 
figure 
was 
2.84% 
higher 
than 
the 
percentage 
of 
pledges 
received 
at 
the 
same 
point 
the 
preceding 
year. 
2. 
Since 
then, 
pledges 
made 
by 
Belarus 
($13 
175), 
Brazil 
($400 
000), 
Burkina 
Faso 
($1550), 
China 
($1 
535 
275), 
Malaysia 
($151 
900), 
Morocco 
($34 
875) 
and 
Zimbabwe 
($5425) 
had 
brought 
the 
total 
to 
$10 
828 
113, 
or 
13.97% 
of 
the 
2006 
target. 
3. 
He 
urged 
those 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
make 
their 
2006 
pledges, 
and 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
in 
full 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity, 
so 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
could 
submit 
a 
proposed 
2006 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
TACC 
in 
November 
2005 
based 
on 
reasonably 
assured 
resources, 
and 
thereafter 
implement 
the 
approved 
programme 
without 
hindrance 
or 
uncertainty. 
20. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Democratic 
PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
(GC(49)/13 
and 
L.9) 


4. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
item 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
resolution 
GC(48)/RES/15. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
reported 
to 
the 
Board 
periodically 
on 
the 
issue 
during 
the 
intervening 
year 
and 
his 
report 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/13 
summarized 
developments 
over 
that 
period. 
He 
also 
noted 
that 
a 
draft 
resolution 
on 
the 
agenda 
item 
had 
been 
submitted 
that 
day 
in 
document 
GC(49)/L.9. 
He 
understood 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
take 
it 
up 
immediately 
and 
therefore 
proposed 
suspension 
of 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
5. 
It 
was 
so 
agreed. 
6. 
Mr. 
PROUDFOOT 
(Canada), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
it 
noted 
with 
serious 
concern 
the 
official 
statement 
dated 
10 
February 
2005 
by 
the 
DPRK 
that 
it 
had 
manufactured 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Also, 
the 
draft 
resolution 
strongly 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
in 
Beijing, 
which 
constituted 
the 
first 
step 
towards 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
It 
called 
upon 
the 
DPRK 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
full 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
sent 
the 
correct 
message 
to 
the 
DPRK 
at 
a 
critical 
juncture, 
and 
he 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
7. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
was 
ready 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/L.9 
without 
a 
vote.

8. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
9. 
Mr. 
WU 
Hailong 
(China), 
noting 
that 
his 
country, 
as 
the 
host 
State 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
had 
not 
felt 
it 
appropriate 
to 
co-sponsor 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
welcomed 
the 
flexibility, 
cooperation 
and 
pragmatism 
displayed 
by 
Member 
States 
during 
the 
negotiations 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
The 
consensus 
which 
had 
been 
reached 
reflected 
the 
desire 
of 
all 
the 
parties 
concerned 
for 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
10. 
Mr. 
CHO 
Chang-beom 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
undertaking, 
in 
the 
joint 
statement 
of 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
issued 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
and 
which 
he 
requested 
be 
included 
in 
the 
record 
of 
the 
meeting2, 
to 
abandon 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
to 
return 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
at 
an 
early 
date, 
including 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
DPRK 
had 
also 
stated 
that 
it 
had 
the 
right 
to 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
other 
parties 
had 
agreed 
to 
economic 
cooperation 
and 
energy 
assistance 
to 
the 
DPRK, 
including 
the 
possible 
supply 
of 
a 
light 
water 
reactor 
to 
the 
DPRK. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
agreement 
set 
out 
in 
the 
statement 
envisaged 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations 
between 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
relevant 
parties. 
All 
the 
parties 
committed 
themselves 
to 
joint 
efforts 
for 
lasting 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
North-East 
Asia. 
11. 
The 
agreement 
reached 
at 
the 
talks 
was 
a 
significant 
step 
forward 
for 
comprehensive 
diplomatic 
resolution 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
When 
implemented, 
it 
would 
help 
to 
restore 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
DPRK 
and 
enhance 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
which 
had 
been 
facing 
unprecedented 
challenges. 
It 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
major 
turning 
point 
in 
creating 
lasting 
peace 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
The 
fifth 
round 
of 
talks 
was 
scheduled 
for 
November 
2005. 
He 
hoped 
that, 
building 
on 
the 
spirit 
and 
determination 
already 
exhibited, 
the 
parties 
would 
agree 
on 
the 
detailed 
follow-up 
steps 
necessary 
for 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
commitments 
stipulated 
in 
the 
joint 
statement. 
12. 
The 
Agency 
should 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
the 
verification 
work 
required 
and 
was 
expected 
to 
continue 
providing 
valuable 
advice 
based 
on 
its 
verification 
expertise 
to 
facilitate 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
13. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
balanced, 
constructive 
resolution 
which 
had 
just 
been 
adopted, 
and 
called 
upon 
the 
international 
community 
to 
continue 
its 
valuable 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
talks 
process. 
14. 
Mr. 
AMANO 
(Japan) 
also 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
of 
19 
September. 
The 
agreement 
reached 
was 
an 
important 
first 
step 
towards 
the 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
His 
country 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
States 
concerned, 
particularly 
China, 
which 
had 
chaired 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
15. 
The 
DPRK 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
nuclear 
weapons 
were 
a 
direct 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
North-East 
Asia 
and 
posed 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Japan 
took 
seriously 
the 
DPRKÂs 
commitment 
to 
abandoning 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
returning, 
at 
an 
early 
date, 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
Agency 
safeguards. 
That 
commitment 
provided 
a 
basis 
for 
achieving 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
16. 
All 
the 
concerned 
parties 
should 
now 
endeavour 
to 
implement 
the 
principles 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
joint 
statement 
by 
agreeing 
on 
the 
specific 
details 
of 
verification 
measures 
and 
procedures 
for 
verifiable 
dismantling. 
In 
that 
regard, 
he 
stressed 
the 
key 
verification 
role 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Japan 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would 
comply 
with 
all 
the 
international 
agreements 
related 
to 
nuclear 
issues, 
including 
the 
NPT, 
and 
implement 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
contribute 
to 
all 
diplomatic 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
a 
peaceful 
solution.

17. 
Mr. 
SCHULTE 
(United 
States 
of 
America), 
having 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
appreciation 
for 
ChinaÂs 
leadership 
in 
chairing 
and 
hosting 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
joined 
the 
previous 
speakers 
in 
welcoming 
the 
DPRKÂs 
commitment 
to 
abandoning 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
to 
returning 
at 
an 
early 
date 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards. 
All 
elements 
of 
its 
past 
and 
present 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
would 
be 
comprehensively 
declared 
and 
completely, 
verifiably 
and 
irreversibly 
eliminated. 
It 
was 
imperative 
to 
move 
to 
a 
swift 
agreement 
on 
ways 
of 
implementing 
the 
goals 
laid 
down 
in 
the 
joint 
statement. 
18. 
Ms. 
QUINTERO 
CORREA 
(Colombia) 
and 
Mr. 
OLMOS 
(Bolivia) 
asked 
to 
be 
included 
as 
sponsors 
of 
the 
resolution. 
21. 
Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
(GC(49)/18, 
L.1 
and 
L.1/Add.1) 


19. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
introducing 
the 
agenda 
item, 
said 
that 
it 
had 
been 
included 
pursuant 
to 
resolution 
GC(48)/RES/16. 
Pursuant 
to 
operative 
paragraph 
9 
of 
that 
resolution 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
submitted 
the 
report 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/18, 
which 
had 
been 
considered 
the 
previous 
week 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
20. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/L.1 
and 
Add.1, 
said 
that 
Egypt 
had 
consistently 
called 
for 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
goal 
set 
out 
in 
multilateral 
treaties, 
especially 
the 
NPT, 
and 
in 
General 
Assembly 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
be 
aware 
that 
failure 
to 
subject 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
undermined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
credibility 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
goal 
of 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT, 
and 
made 
it 
impossible 
to 
build 
the 
confidence 
needed 
among 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
to 
achieve 
tangible 
progress 
towards 
stability, 
security 
and 
peace 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
21. 
For 
the 
past 
30 
years 
Egypt 
had 
been 
engaged 
in 
multilateral 
efforts, 
especially 
through 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal, 
unfortunately 
with 
very 
little 
success 
to 
date. 
He 
stressed 
that 
the 
NWFZ 
was 
an 
objective 
of 
such 
urgency 
that 
it 
could 
not 
await 
the 
achievement 
of 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
22. 
Egypt 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
untiring 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
an 
NWFZ 
and 
to 
convene 
a 
forum 
in 
which 
participants 
could 
learn 
from 
the 
expertise 
of 
other 
regions. 
Egypt 
would 
support 
such 
a 
forum 
provided 
that 
it 
focused 
on 
practical 
ways 
of 
achieving 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
instead 
of 
merely 
engaging 
in 
a 
theoretical 
discussion 
of 
the 
advantages 
of 
and 
justifications 
for 
such 
a 
project. 
23. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
before 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
essentially 
identical 
to 
that 
submitted 
at 
the 
forty-eighth 
session. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
consensus 
achieved 
regarding 
the 
text 
would 
be 
translated 
into 
action 
to 
implement 
its 
provisions. 
24. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/L.1 
and 
Add.1 
without 
a 
vote. 
25. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
26. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
commended 
the 
efforts 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
during 
his 
visits 
to 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Unfortunately, 
as 
reported 
in 
document 
GC(49)/18, 
he 

GC(49)/OR.10 
30 
September 
2005, 
Page 
4 


had 
made 
no 
progress 
in 
securing 
implementation 
of 
resolution 
GC(48)/RES/16 
since 
Israel 
had 
still 
not 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
or 
placed 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
It 
continued 
to 
link 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
issue 
and 
the 
question 
of 
regional 
security 
with 
progress 
in 
the 
peace 
process, 
although 
the 
only 
reason 
that 
the 
peace 
negotiations 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
preceding 
yearÂs 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
had 
been 
at 
a 
standstill 
for 
several 
years 
was 
IsraelÂs 
continued 
refusal 
to 
resume 
the 
talks 
from 
the 
point 
at 
which 
they 
had 
been 
halted. 


27. 
The 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
had 
reservations 
regarding 
the 
reference 
in 
operative 
paragraph 
4 
of 
the 
resolution 
to 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
multilateral 
working 
group, 
which 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
promote 
mutual 
confidence 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Paragraph 
10 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
stated 
clearly 
that 
Israel 
would 
not 
discuss 
the 
signing 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
or 
regional 
security 
issues 
in 
isolation 
from 
the 
regional 
peace 
process. 
Indeed, 
it 
viewed 
them 
as 
part 
of 
phase 
II 
of 
the 
road 
map. 
28. 
The 
resolution 
did 
not 
mention 
Israel 
explicitly 
or 
urge 
it 
to 
take 
serious 
steps 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
its 
nuclear 
installations, 
immediately 
and 
unconditionally, 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Operative 
paragraph 
7 
on 
confidence-building 
measures 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
should 
have 
referred 
to 
the 
need 
for 
such 
action 
by 
Israel 
as 
a 
gesture 
of 
goodwill. 
How 
could 
one 
speak 
of 
confidence-building 
while 
Israel 
continued 
to 
occupy 
the 
territory 
of 
several 
of 
the 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
and 
its 
Government 
continued 
to 
violate 
the 
human 
rights 
of 
the 
Arab 
people 
on 
a 
daily 
basis? 
29. 
His 
country 
had 
hoped 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
refrain 
from 
applying 
double 
standards 
and 
give 
serious 
attention 
to 
the 
legitimate 
concerns 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
in 
the 
face 
of 
IsraelÂs 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
its 
violation 
of 
all 
international 
resolutions 
on 
the 
subject. 
30. 
Although 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
totally 
disagreed 
with 
certain 
paragraphs 
of 
the 
resolution, 
it 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
as 
in 
previous 
years 
so 
as 
not 
to 
disrupt 
the 
proceedings 
of 
the 
Conference. 
31. 
Mr. 
BAHRAN 
(Yemen) 
said 
that 
although 
Yemen 
had 
sponsored 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted, 
it 
was 
not 
entirely 
satisfied 
with 
its 
wording. 
Its 
support 
was 
merely 
intended 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
importance 
it 
attached 
to 
the 
topic 
it 
addressed 
and 
his 
countryÂs 
desire 
to 
keep 
that 
topic 
on 
the 
agenda 
until 
such 
time 
as 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
agree 
on 
a 
more 
robust 
text 
that 
would 
subsequently 
lead 
to 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
to 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
turning 
it 
into 
an 
NWFZ. 
The 
Middle 
East 
would 
never 
be 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
until 
Israel 
joined 
the 
NPT 
and 
signed 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
32. 
Mr. 
EL-MISSLATTI 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
working 
towards 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
full-scope 
safeguards 
regime. 
The 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
all 
countries, 
without 
discrimination, 
should 
be 
subject 
to 
comprehensive 
and 
effective 
verification 
inasmuch 
as 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
especially 
in 
tension-fraught 
regions, 
was 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
threats 
currently 
facing 
the 
world. 
33. 
The 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
was 
extremely 
worried 
at 
the 
prospect 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
into 
the 
Middle 
East. 
That 
concern 
had 
prompted 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
to 
support 
all 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
since 
1974 
that 
urged 
the 
parties 
concerned 
to 
take 
practical 
steps 
to 
create 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
refrain 
from 
acquiring 
the 
means 
to 
produce 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
especially 
nuclear 
weapons. 
His 
own 
countryÂs 
undertaking 
to 
work 
for 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
Security 
Council 
statement 
entitled 
ÂDecision 
of 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
to 
abandon 
its 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
programmeÂ 
(S/PV.4949).

34. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
follow 
suit. 
Israel, 
in 
particular, 
which 
had 
a 
large 
nuclear 
arsenal, 
should 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
sign 
a 
full-scope 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
The 
resources 
of 
the 
region 
could 
then 
be 
channelled 
into 
economic 
development 
and 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Statute. 
35. 
Mr. 
KODAH 
(Jordan) 
said 
that 
his 
Government 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Jordan 
was 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
had 
not 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
or 
placed 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
resolution 
that 
had 
just 
been 
adopted 
would 
therefore 
fail 
to 
achieve 
its 
objectives 
of 
protecting 
against 
nuclear 
dangers, 
universalizing 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
achieving 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
furthermore 
gave 
the 
impression 
that 
double 
standards 
were 
being 
used 
in 
dealing 
with 
countries 
whose 
nuclear 
programmes 
served 
non-peaceful 
purposes. 
36. 
Jordan, 
as 
IsraelÂs 
closest 
neighbour, 
was 
more 
exposed 
than 
others 
to 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
radiation 
from 
Israeli 
reactors 
that 
had 
not 
been 
placed 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
therefore 
represented 
an 
environmental 
hazard. 
37. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
influential 
countries 
to 
do 
their 
utmost 
to 
persuade 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
international 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
to 
endeavour 
at 
least 
to 
implement 
the 
content 
of 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted. 
38. 
Jordan 
had 
not 
opposed 
the 
resolution 
so 
as 
not 
to 
break 
the 
consensus. 
39. 
Mr. 
AKHONZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
urge 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
conclude 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
without 
delay 
and 
without 
preconditions. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
more 
proactive 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
40. 
Mr. 
FRANK 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
on 
the 
resolution 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
an 
NWFZ 
would 
complement 
efforts 
to 
increase 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
However, 
he 
wished 
to 
dissociate 
himself 
from 
the 
language 
used 
in 
the 
resolution 
and 
the 
modalities 
suggested 
for 
achieving 
that 
goal. 
41. 
Experience 
from 
other 
regions 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
impetus 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
must 
come 
from 
within 
the 
region 
concerned 
and 
could 
not 
be 
imposed 
from 
outside. 
42. 
IsraelÂs 
aim 
was 
increased 
peace 
and 
security 
throughout 
the 
Middle 
East 
region, 
rather 
than 
arms 
control 
as 
an 
end 
in 
itself. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
address 
the 
threats 
perceived 
by 
each 
State 
and 
maintain 
each 
oneÂs 
margin 
of 
security. 
All 
States 
in 
the 
region, 
without 
exception, 
must 
participate 
in 
any 
security 
measures 
adopted. 
43. 
A 
practical, 
step-by-step 
approach 
was 
required, 
beginning 
with 
confidence-building 
measures 
such 
as 
IsraelÂs 
recent 
disengagement 
from 
Gaza. 
He 
hoped 
that 
all 
parties 
would 
make 
use 
of 
the 
opportunity 
accorded 
by 
IsraelÂs 
actions 
to 
improve 
reconciliation, 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East.

and 
25) 


44. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
it 
had 
been 
agreed 
in 
consultations 
that 
he 
should 
read 
out 
the 
following 
statement 
for 
endorsement 
by 
the 
Conference: 
ÂThe 
General 
Conference 
recalls 
the 
statement 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
36th 
session 
in 
1992 
concerning 
the 
agenda 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ. 
That 
statement 
considered 
it 
desirable 
not 
to 
consider 
that 
agenda 
item 
at 
the 
37th 
session. 
ÂThe 
General 
Conference 
also 
recalls 
the 
statement 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
43rd 
session 
in 
1999 
concerning 
the 
same 
agenda 
item. 
At 
the 
44th, 
45th, 
46th, 
47th, 
48th 
and 
49th 
sessions, 
this 
item 
was, 
at 
the 
request 
of 
certain 
Member 
States, 
re-inscribed 
on 
the 
agenda. 
The 
item 
was 
discussed. 


ÂSeveral 
Member 
States 
requested 
that 
this 
item 
be 
included 
in 
the 
provisional 
agenda 
of 
the 
50th 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂ. 


45. 
The 
Conference 
endorsed 
the 
Presidential 
statement. 
46. 
Mr. 
AL-RIYAMI 
(Oman)3, 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group, 
said 
that 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
recently 
held 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
fallen 
short 
of 
expectations, 
especially 
its 
failure 
to 
adopt 
a 
final 
document 
reaffirming 
the 
need 
for 
universality 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
which 
was 
being 
undermined 
by 
selectivity 
and 
double 
standards 
as 
well 
as 
the 
non-compliance 
of 
the 
nuclear 
weapon 
States 
with 
their 
obligations. 
The 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Review 
Summit 
had 
also 
proved 
disappointing 
in 
that 
regard. 
47. 
The 
meetings 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
the 
previous 
week 
had 
been 
characterized 
by 
politicization 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
The 
Agency 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
refer 
a 
State 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
despite 
its 
voluntary 
undertakings 
and 
commitment 
to 
continue 
negotiations 
that 
had 
produced 
positive 
results, 
while 
ignoring 
a 
State 
with 
nuclear 
capabilities 
that 
threatened 
security 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
a 
State 
that 
had 
not 
committed 
itself 
to 
any 
treaty 
or 
legal 
regime 
pertaining 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
whose 
nuclear 
facilities 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
international 
verification. 
48. 
The 
1995 
NPT 
Review 
and 
Extension 
Conference 
had 
agreed 
to 
extend 
the 
validity 
of 
the 
Treaty 
indefinitely 
and 
decided 
to 
work 
for 
its 
universalization, 
to 
adopt 
principles 
and 
objectives 
in 
respect 
of 
its 
application 
and 
to 
establish 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
particularly 
nuclear 
weapons, 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Was 
it 
reasonable 
in 
those 
circumstances 
that 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
had 
now 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
were 
applying 
safeguards 
agreements, 
except 
one, 
namely 
Israel, 
which 
continued 
to 
refuse 
to 
accede 
and 
insisted 
on 
remaining 
outside 
the 
scope 
of 
any 
nuclear 
disarmament 
regime? 
How 
could 
the 
international 
community 
continue 
to 
accept 
such 
a 
phenomenon? 
49. 
The 
possession 
of 
such 
weapons 
had 
created 
a 
security 
imbalance 
in 
the 
region 
and 
prevented 
the 
achievement 
of 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace, 
as 
did 
StatesÂ 
tolerance 
of 
IsraelÂs 
violations 
of 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Group 
of 
Arab 
States, 
which 
had 
voluntarily 
renounced 
nuclear 
weapons, 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
because 
such 
weapons 
constituted 
a 
major 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
It 
based 
its 
position 
on 
the 
1996 
3 
Speaking 
under 
Rule 
30 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure.

Advisory 
Opinion 
of 
the 
International 
Court 
of 
Justice 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
there 
existed 
an 
obligation 
to 
pursue 
in 
good 
faith, 
and 
to 
bring 
to 
a 
conclusion, 
negotiations 
leading 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
in 
all 
of 
its 
aspects 
under 
strict 
and 
effective 
international 
control, 
on 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
aimed 
at 
achieving 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
on 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
487 
(1981) 
and 
687 
(1991) 
that 
urged 
all 
parties, 
including 
Israel, 
to 
consider 
taking 
practical 
steps 
to 
establish 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
all 
their 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
activities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
concern 
of 
the 
Arab 
States 
and 
peoples 
at 
the 
dangers 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
the 
Arab 
Group 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community, 
especially 
those 
with 
special 
responsibility 
for 
preserving 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
to 
deploy 
all 
the 
resources 
at 
their 
command 
to 
achieve 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 


50. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
consensus 
at 
the 
current 
session 
and 
ensuring 
the 
success 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Arab 
Group 
had 
agreed 
to 
a 
Presidential 
statement 
on 
the 
item 
under 
discussion. 
It 
wished 
to 
stress, 
however, 
that 
the 
statement 
raised 
the 
question 
of 
double 
standards 
in 
addressing 
agenda 
items. 
The 
Conference 
had 
failed 
to 
deal 
seriously 
with 
the 
item 
despite 
the 
flexibility 
and 
balance 
of 
the 
text 
submitted 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
and 
their 
aspiration 
to 
promote 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
51. 
The 
Arab 
Group 
reaffirmed 
its 
confidence 
in 
the 
Agency 
and 
commended 
its 
efforts 
to 
develop 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
to 
verify 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
installations. 
It 
called 
on 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
pursue 
his 
efforts 
to 
persuade 
the 
State 
that 
was 
preventing 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
goodwill 
and 
comply 
with 
the 
relevant 
Security 
Council, 
General 
Assembly 
and 
other 
international 
resolutions 
calling 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone. 
The 
continuation 
of 
the 
existing 
situation 
would 
undermine 
the 
AgencyÂs 
credibility 
and 
the 
aim 
of 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
52. 
The 
Arab 
Group 
requested 
that 
the 
item 
entitled 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
be 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
fiftieth 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
53. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
said 
he 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
at 
the 
lack 
of 
attention 
given 
to 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
which 
were 
incompatible 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
which 
it 
continued 
to 
develop 
in 
disregard 
of 
the 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
international 
community, 
the 
first 
being 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
the 
most 
recent 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
59/106 
entitled 
ÂThe 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
in 
the 
Middle 
EastÂ, 
which 
mentioned 
Israel 
explicitly 
and 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
its 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
placement 
of 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Unfortunately, 
however, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
hitherto 
failed 
to 
exert 
the 
kind 
of 
pressure 
on 
Israel 
to 
comply 
with 
those 
resolutions 
that 
it 
exerted 
on 
other 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
54. 
The 
Israeli 
nuclear 
arsenal 
was 
the 
greatest 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
a 
region 
that 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
volatile 
in 
the 
world. 
His 
delegation 
had 
hoped 
that 
the 
Conference 
would 
adopt 
a 
resolution 
that 
would 
draw 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
IsraelÂs 
continued 
high-handed 
policies 
and 
its 
failure 
to 
respect 
any 
international 
resolutions, 
upsetting 
the 
balance 
of 
power 
in 
the 
region 
through 
its 
possession 
of 
all 
kinds 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Moreover, 
IsraelÂs 
unsupervised 
nuclear 
reactors 
could 
cause 
an 
environmental 
disaster 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
55. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
Conference 
had 
failed 
to 
respond 
adequately 
to 
the 
concern 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
regarding 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
its 
ongoing 
occupation 
of 
Syrian 
and 
Palestinian 
territory. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
put 
strong 
pressure 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
as 
a 
step 
towards 
creating 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
to 
adopt 
a 
balanced 
policy 
that 
respected 
all 
peoples 
and 
their 
sovereignty 
and 
avoided 
the 
application 
of 
double 
standards.

56. 
Mr. 
KHALIL 
(Egypt) 
expressed 
regret 
and 
frustration 
that 
an 
item 
concerning 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
was 
placed 
on 
the 
Conference 
agenda 
year 
after 
year 
but 
the 
international 
community 
still 
failed 
to 
live 
up 
to 
its 
responsibilities 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
dangerous 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
1995 
NPT 
Review 
and 
Extension 
Conference 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
that 
referred 
to 
the 
situation 
and 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
calling 
for 
universal 
ratification 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Moreover, 
the 
General 
Assembly 
adopted 
a 
similar 
resolution 
every 
year. 
All 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
except 
Israel, 
were 
now 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
placed 
their 
programmes 
under 
the 
safeguards 
regime. 
Some 
had 
also 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
others 
had 
entered 
into 
voluntary 
verification 
and 
cooperation 
arrangements 
with 
the 
Agency. 
And 
yet 
they 
were 
the 
ones 
who 
were 
being 
urged 
to 
do 
more 
and 
some 
were 
even 
being 
reproached 
with 
tardiness 
in 
honouring 
voluntary 
obligations. 
57. 
Israel, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
continued 
to 
develop 
its 
nuclear 
programmes, 
possessed 
the 
means 
to 
deliver 
nuclear 
warheads 
and 
was 
trying 
to 
develop 
a 
second 
strike 
capability. 
It 
was 
completely 
free 
to 
handle 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
technology 
without 
any 
restraint 
or 
inspection. 
It 
refused 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
or 
to 
accept 
any 
disarmament 
obligations. 
Moreover, 
it 
refused 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
General 
Assembly 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Instead, 
it 
engaged 
in 
empty 
political 
arguments 
about 
the 
need 
for 
peace 
and 
confidence-building 
in 
the 
region 
and 
viewed 
itself 
as 
a 
ÂresponsibleÂ 
nuclear 
power 
that 
applied 
the 
nuclear 
suppliersÂ 
standards. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
was 
engaged 
in 
unsafe 
nuclear 
waste 
disposal 
practices 
and 
its 
ageing 
nuclear 
reactors 
were 
liable 
to 
cause 
an 
international 
environmental 
disaster. 
58. 
The 
international 
community 
as 
well 
as 
participants 
in 
the 
General 
Conference 
who 
had 
spoken 
in 
defence 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
had 
called 
for 
the 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
had 
developed 
criteria 
for 
the 
codification 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
transfers 
should 
take 
action 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation 
of 
General 
Conference 
and 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
concerning 
the 
dangers 
of 
Israeli 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
need 
to 
rid 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Preservation 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
required 
equitable 
treatment 
of 
all 
States 
without 
exception. 
Egypt 
furthermore 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
to 
start 
cooperating 
with 
others 
to 
create 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Otherwise 
the 
persistence 
of 
double 
standards 
would 
lead 
to 
an 
escalation 
of 
the 
current 
crisis 
in 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
would 
undermine 
the 
AgencyÂs 
credibility. 
The 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
preserve 
that 
regime, 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
their 
political 
and 
economic 
resources. 
Such 
action 
would 
achieve 
the 
objective 
of 
the 
agenda 
item 
concerning 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat, 
which 
should 
remain 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
59. 
Mr. 
AKHONZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capability 
was 
a 
serious 
concern 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Besides 
the 
many 
atrocities 
committed 
by 
the 
Israeli 
regime 
against 
the 
innocent 
civilians 
of 
Palestine, 
its 
nuclear 
arsenal 
and 
activities 
were 
a 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region 
as 
a 
whole. 
All 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
were 
members 
of 
the 
NPT 
except 
Israel. 
IsraelÂs 
refusal 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
its 
extensive 
nuclear 
activities 
outside 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
were 
the 
only 
obstacle 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
regret 
that 
all 
such 
illegal 
activities 
took 
place 
with 
the 
collaboration 
and 
support 
of 
certain 
nuclear 
weapon 
States. 
60. 
In 
1974, 
Iran 
had 
proposed 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
had 
been 
pursuing 
that 
goal 
actively 
ever 
since. 
Iran 
repeated 
its 
request 
that 
the 
Agency 
intensify 
its 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard. 
Iran 
expected 
the 
international 
community 
to 
strongly 
urge 
Israel 
to 
give 
up 
its 
resistance 
to 
the 
collective 
objective 
of 
the 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
and 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards 
without 
any 
delay 
or 
precondition.

61. 
Mr. 
EL-MISSLATTI 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
viewed 
disarmament 
and 
the 
eradication 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
confidence-building 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
had 
taken 
practical 
steps 
to 
implement 
the 
initiative 
it 
had 
announced 
in 
2003, 
namely 
its 
renunciation 
of 
any 
programme 
or 
equipment 
that 
might 
lead 
to 
the 
production 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
weapons. 
It 
was 
also 
party 
to 
all 
international 
treaties 
relating 
to 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
62. 
Some 
States, 
however, 
still 
espoused 
nuclear 
weapons 
as 
a 
strategic 
option. 
Israel 
had 
possessed 
such 
weapons 
for 
years 
and 
continued 
to 
develop 
them, 
refusing 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
He 
underlined 
the 
threat 
that 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
weapons 
constituted 
for 
security 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
It 
was 
time 
to 
rid 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
the 
international 
community 
had 
a 
duty 
to 
put 
pressure 
on 
Israel, 
which 
was 
the 
stumbling 
block 
impeding 
achievement 
of 
that 
aim. 
63. 
Lastly, 
he 
urged 
all 
the 
parties 
concerned 
to 
channel 
their 
resources 
into 
economic 
development 
of 
the 
region 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
organizations 
that 
supported 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Statute. 
64. 
Mr. 
ELAMIN 
(Sudan), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
AFRA, 
said 
that 
the 
countries 
of 
Africa 
had 
decided 
to 
rid 
the 
continent 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Consequently, 
49 
of 
the 
continentÂs 
53 
States 
had 
signed 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
Nuclear 
weapons 
constituted 
a 
fearsome 
threat 
wherever 
they 
were 
located 
and 
regardless 
of 
the 
political 
context. 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
posed 
just 
such 
a 
threat 
to 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
African 
and 
Arab 
countries, 
including 
Sudan, 
and 
could 
provoke 
an 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region. 
It 
was 
wrong 
to 
turn 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
such 
weapons, 
since 
it 
could 
set 
a 
precedent 
for 
other 
States 
to 
follow. 
Furthermore, 
their 
existence 
undermined 
AFRAÂs 
efforts 
to 
establish 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
Africa. 
65. 
Mr. 
BELAOURA 
(Algeria) 
said 
that, 
for 
several 
years, 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
adopt 
a 
consistent 
position 
regarding 
the 
continuing 
threat 
from 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
deliver 
the 
message 
needed. 
The 
topic 
was 
a 
particularly 
difficult 
one, 
which 
endangered 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
sensitive 
region 
of 
the 
Middle 
East. 
66. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
to 
face 
up 
to 
its 
responsibilities 
and 
not 
allow 
double 
standards 
to 
be 
applied 
in 
the 
field 
of 
non-proliferation 
such 
that 
Israel 
continued 
to 
benefit 
from 
special 
treatment. 
Israel 
refused 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
or 
submit 
its 
installations 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime. 
67. 
Following 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
and 
despite 
the 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions, 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
1995 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
487 
and 
687, 
the 
lack 
of 
any 
progress 
in 
establishing 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
serious 
concern. 
IsraelÂs 
persistence 
in 
maintaining 
its 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
not 
only 
undermined 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
NPT, 
but 
also 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
decisions 
adopted 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
failed 
completely 
to 
respond 
to 
either 
the 
legitimate 
attempts 
being 
made 
by 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
region 
or 
their 
aspirations 
for 
peace 
and 
security. 
68. 
In 
the 
face 
of 
increasing 
global 
challenges 
and 
threats, 
the 
international 
community 
must 
exert 
the 
necessary 
pressure 
on 
Israel 
to 
conform. 
Algeria 
urged 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
increase 
their 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
requested 
that 
the 
item 
of 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
to 
be 
included 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
fiftieth 
General 
Conference. 
69. 
Ms. 
HUSSAIN 
(Malaysia), 
supporting 
the 
position 
taken 
by 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States, 
said 
that 
her 
country 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
early 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in

the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
487 
(1981) 
and 
687 
(1991) 
and 
the 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 


70. 
Pending 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone, 
Malaysia 
called 
on 
Israel, 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
not 
to 
have 
joined 
the 
NPT 
or 
declared 
its 
intention 
to 
do 
so, 
to 
renounce 
possession 
of 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay. 
Malaysia 
also 
urged 
Israel 
promptly 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
to 
conduct 
its 
nuclear-related 
activities 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
71. 
In 
its 
capacity 
as 
Chairman 
of 
NAM 
and 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Organization 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Conference, 
Malaysia 
re-emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
She 
recalled 
the 
declaration 
made 
by 
the 
NAM 
Heads 
of 
Government 
or 
State 
at 
the 
NAM 
Summit 
in 
Kuala 
Lumpur 
in 
February 
2003, 
reiterating 
their 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
from 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
expressing 
their 
concern 
about 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
capability 
by 
Israel, 
which 
posed 
a 
serious 
and 
continuing 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
neighbouring 
and 
other 
States, 
and 
condemning

They 
believed 
that 
stability 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
in 
a 
region 
where 
massive 
imbalances 
in 
military 
capabilities 
were 
maintained, 
particularly 
through 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
which 
allowed 
one 
party 
to 
threaten 
its 
neighbours 
and 
the 
region. 
72. 
Malaysia 
called 
on 
all 
the

creation 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
relevant 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
without 
delay. 
73.

that 
since

the

basis 
of 
its 
three

technology, 
safety 
and 
verification. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
efforts 
of

international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
strong 
leadership 
provided 
by

ElBaradei 
had 
ensured

expanding 
world 
economy, 
accounting 
for 
about 
16 
per 
cent 
of 
global 
electricity 
production. 
An 
increasing 
number 
of 
countries 
were 
exercising 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option 
in 
ensuring 
their 
sustainable 
development. 
New 
factors, 
such 
as 
the 
sharp 
rise 
in 
oil 
prices 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
stricter 
emission 
rules 
after 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol, 
had 
helped 
win 
support 
for 
nuclear 
power 
as 
a 
viable 
element 
of 
the 
energy 
mix 
for 
the 
future. 
5. 
The 
Agency 
was 
a 
focal 
point 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
human 
health, 
water 
resources 
management 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
Nuclear 
techniques 
had 
become 
indispensable 
for 
social 
and 
economic 
development 
around 
the 
world. 
6. 
Also, 
establishing 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
and 
facilitating 
their 
application 
worldwide 
remained 
high 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
the 
recent 
period 
had 
been 
marked 
by 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
necessary 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
instruments 
and 
by 
a 
considerable 
improvement 
in 
the 
overall 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
installations. 
7. 
The 
Agency 
had 
faced 
increased 
verification 
challenges 
over 
the 
past 
year. 
Its 
activities 
in 
the 
verification 
field 
had 
been 
guided 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
objectivity 
and 
impartiality 
and 
had 
been 
distinguished 
by 
high 
standards 
of 
professionalism. 
It 
had 
responded 
to 
the 
challenges 
in 
a 
way 
which 
had 
upheld 
the 
authority 
and 
integrity 
of 
the 
multilateral 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
based 
on 
the 
NPT. 
8. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
joint 
efforts 
of 
its 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat, 
the 
period 
since 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
witnessed 
important 
achievements. 
The 
Agency 
had 
continued 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
versatile 
instrument, 
and 
Member 
States 
had 
benefited 
from 
its 
work 
irrespective 
of 
their 
priorities. 
9. 
The 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
all 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
set 
guidelines 
for 
the 
year 
to 
come. 
Member 
States 
must 
work 
together 
in 
order 
to 
further 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enabling 
it 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
mandate 
for 
the 
good 
of 
all.

15. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
GRULAC, 
and 
being 
situated 
in 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free

3. 
Message 
from 
the 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
24. 
Mr. 
ABE 
(United 
Nations 
Under-Secretary-General 
for 
Disarmament 
Affairs) 
read 
out 
the 
following 
message: 
ÂThis 
forty-ninth 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
comes 
less 
than 
two 
weeks 
after 
the 
World 
Summit 
in 
New 
York. 


ÂThe 
Summit 
made 
progress 
on 
a 
number 
of 
important 
issues 
facing 
the 
international 
community. 
But 
when 
it 
came 
to 
the 
challenge 
of 
strengthening 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation 
Treaty 
Â 
disarmament, 
non-proliferation 
and 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
Â 
the 
Summit 
was 
a 
failure. 
States 
were 
not 
able 
even 
to 
reaffirm 
existing 
commitments, 
or 
find 
a 
way 
forward 
even 
at 
the 
level 
of 
principles. 


ÂA 
group 
of 
States 
led 
by 
Norway 
Â 
including 
Australia, 
Chile, 
Indonesia, 
Romania, 
South 
Africa 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
Â 
are 
working 
to 
try 
to 
chart 
a 
way 
forward. 
I 
encourage 
all 
IAEA 
Member 
States 
Â 
and, 
indeed, 
all 
States 
Â 
to 
support 
their 
initiative. 
And 
I 
hope 
that 
this 
IAEA 
conference 
can 
send 
a 
signal 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
seriousness 
and 
determination 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT. 


ÂThe 
IAEA 
plays 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
the 
maintenance 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
development. 
The 
international 
community 
recognizes 
and 
relies 
on 
the 
IAEAÂs 
independence, 
technical 
competence 
and 
impartial 
verification 
capacity 
of 
global 
non-proliferation 
efforts. 
And 
it 
looks 
to 
the 
Agency 
to 
promote 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
which 
are 
important 
tools 
for 
social 
and 
economic 
development. 


ÂIf 
planning 
indicators 
are 
correct, 
we 
can 
expect 
to 
see 
considerable 
expansion 
of 
civilian 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
in 
the 
next 
few 
years. 
This 
calls 
for 
additional 
vigilance 
in 
maintaining 
safety 
standards, 
services 
and 
procedures. 
So 
too 
do 
the 
heightened 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism. 
I 
welcome 
the 
comprehensive 
plan 
of 
action 
developed 
by 
the 
IAEA 
to 
enhance 
StatesÂ 
capacity 
to 
detect 
the 
sources 
of 
such 
threats 
and 
take 
countermeasures. 


ÂWe 
must 
also 
come 
to 
terms 
with 
the 
fact 
that 
developments 
in 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
have 
led 
to 
proliferation 
risks 
that 
were 
not 
fully 
envisioned 
when 
the 
NPT 
was 
established 
35 
years 
ago. 
In 
this 
context, 
I 
believe 
that 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle 
must 
be 
followed 
up. 
Its 
February 
report 
suggested 
multilateral 
options 
for 
improved 
controls 
over 
the 
proliferation-
sensitive 
portions 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
while 
preserving 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
services. 


ÂI 
have 
in 
my 
report 
ÂIn 
larger 
freedomÂ 
called 
for 
the 
universal 
adoption 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol, 
which 
I 
believe 
should 
become 
the 
standard 
for 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
NPT. 
And 
I 
fully 
endorse 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotion 
of 
strengthened 
safeguards.

ÂThe 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
is 
a 
significant 
step 
forward 
in 
multilateral 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
as 
is 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material. 


ÂI 
welcome 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
a 
peaceful 
and 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
I 
urge 
all 
parties 
to 
continue 
and 
intensify 
their 
efforts 
to 
fully 
implement 
the 
agreement. 


ÂI 
also 
continue 
to 
hope 
that 
there 
can 
be 
an 
outcome 
satisfactory 
to 
all 
parties 
concerning 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
I 
believe 
that 
confidence 
and 
trust 
need 
to 
be 
rebuilt 
on 
all 
sides, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
solution 
to 
this 
difficult 
and 
delicate 
issue 
that 
effectively 
dispels 
proliferation 
concerns. 


ÂOn 
these 
specific 
challenges, 
and 
on 
the 
global 
challenge 
of 
strengthening 
the 
NPT, 
there 
is 
no 
substitute 
for 
strong 
leadership 
and 
a 
spirit 
of 
cooperation. 
I 
hope 
that 
both 
are 
on 
display 
at 
this 
conference, 
and 
I 
wish 
you 
all 
the 
best 
in 
your 
deliberations.Â 


4. 
Statement 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
25. 
The 
DIRECTOR 
GENERAL 
said 
that 
each 
session 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
an 
occasion 
for 
reflection, 
but 
the 
current 
session 
was 
perhaps 
a 
little 
more 
so 
for 
him, 
as 
he 
was 
about 
to 
start 
a 
new 
term 
in 
office. 
Today 
he 
would 
like 
to 
review 
how 
far 
the 
Agency 
had 
come 
in 
recent 
years, 
in 
terms 
of 
each 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
activity 
that 
supported 
its 
mission 
Â 
technology, 
safety 
and 
verification 
Â 
and 
then 
to 
describe 
what, 
in 
his 
view, 
should 
be 
its 
vision 
for 
the 
future. 
26. 
Turning 
first 
to 
nuclear 
technology, 
he 
said 
that 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years 
there 
had 
been 
a 
significant 
change 
in 
attitudes 
towards 
nuclear 
power. 
Fast-growing 
global 
energy 
demands, 
an 
increased 
emphasis 
on 
the 
security 
of 
energy 
supplies, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
climate 
change 
were 
promoting 
a 
reconsideration, 
in 
many 
quarters, 
of 
the 
advisability 
of 
investment 
in 
nuclear 
power. 
In 
addition, 
sustained 
improvements 
in 
nuclear 
plant 
availability 
and 
safety 
performance 
had 
made 
plant 
operating 
costs 
relatively 
low 
and 
stable. 
27. 
Near-term 
nuclear 
growth 
remained 
centred 
in 
Asia 
and 
Eastern 
Europe, 
which 
together 
accounted 
for 
22 
of 
the 
24 
units 
now 
under 
construction. 
The 
Russian 
Federation 
intended 
to 
double 
its 
nuclear 
generating 
capacity 
by 
2020; 
China 
was 
planning 
a 
nearly 
six-fold 
expansion 
in 
capacity 
by 
the 
same 
year; 
and 
India 
expected 
a 
ten-fold 
increase 
by 
2022. 
Elsewhere, 
plans 
remained 
more 
modest, 
but 
it 
was 
obvious 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
re-emerging 
in 
a 
way 
that 
few 
would 
have 
predicted 
just 
a 
few 
years 
previously. 
28. 
When 
he 
had 
addressed 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2001, 
about 
to 
start 
his 
second 
term 
in 
office, 
the 
Agency 
had 
just 
established 
INPRO, 
whose 
primary 
achievement 
had 
been 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
future 
needs 
of 
all 
countries 
(including 
developing 
ones) 
as 
regards 
reactor 
size, 
economics, 
infrastructures, 
safety, 
security, 
proliferation 
resistance 
and 
waste 
management 
were 
considered 
when 
innovative 
nuclear 
systems 
were 
evaluated. 
29. 
For 
a 
number 
of 
years, 
he 
had 
been 
advocating 
the 
consideration 
of 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
front 
and 
the 
back 
end 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
Â 
both 
to 
address 
challenges 
posed 
by 
proliferation-sensitive 
operations, 
such 
as 
those 
related 
to 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
plutonium 
separation, 
and 
to 
address 
the 
safety 
aspects 
of 
managing 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel.

30. 
As 
delegations 
might 
recall, 
in 
2004 
he 
had 
informed 
them 
of 
the 
establishment 
by 
him 
of 
a 
group 
of 
senior 
experts 
to 
explore 
options 
for 
the 
multilateral 
control 
of 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities. 
In 
February, 
the 
expert 
group 
had 
issued 
its 
report, 
and 
he 
had 
been 
encouraged 
by 
the 
initiatives 
that 
had 
followed. 
31. 
A 
major 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
scientific 
and 
technical 
work 
involved 
the 
transfer 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
techniques 
for 
use 
in 
applications 
related 
to 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
management 
and 
preservation 
of 
the 
environment. 
He 
would 
like 
to 
give 
a 
few 
examples. 
32. 
Cancer 
was 
a 
major 
global 
health 
concern, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
cancer 
cases 
was 
rising 
Â 
most 
rapidly 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Access 
to 
life-saving 
radiotherapy 
was 
in 
many 
areas 
very 
limited 
or 
non-existent. 
Whereas 
in 
Austria, 
for 
instance, 
there 
was 
approximately 
one 
radiotherapy 
machine 
for 
every 
270 
000 
people, 
in 
most 
African 
countries 
the 
ratio 
was 
about 
one 
machine 
for 
every 
ten 
million 
people, 
and 
some 
countries 
had 
no 
such 
facilities. 
PACT 
was 
designed 
to 
increase 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capacity 
to 
assist 
developing 
Member 
States 
by 
mobilizing 
more 
resources 
to 
address 
personnel, 
infrastructure, 
technology 
and 
training 
needs. 
Meeting 
the 
challenge 
of 
cancer 
was 
an 
intrinsically 
multidisciplinary 
effort. 
The 
Agency 
was 
therefore 
seeking 
to 
build 
partnerships 
with 
key 
organizations 
Â 
such 
as 
WHO 
Â 
for 
a 
coordinated, 
holistic 
approach. 
33. 
The 
use 
of 
isotopes 
and 
radiation 
in 
food 
and 
agricultural 
R&D 
was 
continuing 
to 
yield 
rich 
results. 
For 
example, 
in 
Peru 
harsh 
local 
environments 
had 
traditionally 
caused 
many 
crops 
to 
fail. 
Through 
radiation-induced 
mutation 
breeding 
to 
create 
new 
crop 
varieties, 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
incomes 
had 
been 
increased 
in 
the 
remote 
regions 
in 
question. 
34. 
Nuclear 
techniques 
were 
increasingly 
being 
used 
in 
environmental 
applications. 
The 
IAEA 
Marine 
Environment 
Laboratory 
in 
Monaco 
had 
become 
a 
world 
leader 
in 
the 
use 
of 
radionuclides 
to 
track 
ocean 
currents 
Â 
and 
also 
in 
the 
use 
of 
isotopes 
to 
study 
carbon 
dioxide 
sequestration 
on 
the 
ocean 
surface, 
a 
process 
crucial 
to 
the 
tracking 
of 
climate 
change. 
35. 
The 
past 
four 
years 
had 
also 
been 
a 
period 
of 
evolution 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Four 
years 
previously, 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
had 
recently 
entered 
into 
force, 
he 
had 
been 
urging 
greater 
participation 
in 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
Member 
States 
had 
still 
been 
questioning 
whether 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
should 
be 
accepted 
internationally. 
And, 
as 
many 
delegations 
would 
recall, 
during 
the 
week 
following 
the 
terrorist 
attacks 
in 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
calling 
for 
a 
sweeping 
review 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme. 
36. 
Clearly, 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
on 
many 
fronts. 
37. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
now 
with 
56 
Contracting 
Parties, 
was 
becoming 
a 
forum 
for 
increasingly 
substantive 
discussions 
on 
safety 
issues, 
with 
equally 
increasing 
Agency 
involvement 
and 
input. 
38. 
Parties 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
had 
met 
in 
July 
and 
agreed 
on 
major 
amendments 
that 
made 
it 
legally 
binding 
for 
States 
Parties 
to 
protect 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
material 
in 
peaceful 
domestic 
use, 
storage 
and 
transport. 
He 
hoped 
that 
all 
States 
Parties 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
would 
ratify 
the 
amendments 
as 
rapidly 
as 
possible 
and, 
in 
the 
meantime, 
act 
as 
if 
the 
amendments 
were 
in 
force. 
39. 
Another 
case 
of 
progress 
had 
been 
the 
increasingly 
broad 
acceptance 
of 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
as 
the 
global 
reference 
for 
protecting 
people 
and 
the 
environment 
against 
nuclear 
accidents 
and 
the 
harmful 
effects 
attributed 
to 
radiation 
exposure.

40. 
The 
strong 
relationship 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
operational 
safety 
standards 
and 
its 
safety 
review 
services 
had 
been 
important 
for 
evaluating 
and 
enhancing 
their 
effectiveness. 
Feedback 
from 
OSART 
missions 
and 
other 
safety 
services 
was 
being 
drawn 
upon 
in 
the 
reviewing 
and 
revising 
of 
the 
standards. 
He 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
countries 
taking 
full 
advantage 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
services. 
41. 
In 
2001, 
after 
taking 
note 
of 
the 
conflicting 
views 
about 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
1986 
Chernobyl 
accident, 
he 
had 
called 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
Chernobyl 
Forum 
Â 
to 
set 
the 
record 
straight 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
best 
possible 
scientific 
analysis 
and 
to 
stimulate 
more 
effective 
international 
cooperation 
in 
further 
actions 
that 
could 
help 
local 
populations 
regain 
control 
over 
their 
own 
livelihoods. 
42. 
He 
was 
pleased 
that 
a 
report 
Â 
ÂChernobylÂs 
LegacyÂ 
Â 
based 
on 
the 
extensive 
work 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
Forum 
had 
been 
issued 
earlier 
in 
the 
month 
at 
a 
conference 
held 
in 
Vienna. 
Authoritative 
documents 
on 
the 
health, 
environmental 
and 
social 
impacts 
of 
the 
accident 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon, 
reflecting 
the 
consensus 
achieved 
among 
the 
relevant 
United 
Nations 
bodies 
and 
the 
Governments 
of 
Belarus, 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine. 
A 
press 
campaign 
had 
publicized 
the 
reportÂs 
conclusions, 
and 
the 
organizations 
involved 
were 
discussing 
cooperation 
on 
initiatives 
related 
to 
assistance 
with 
safe 
food 
production 
and 
improved 
health 
care. 
43. 
Few 
Agency 
programmes 
had 
expanded 
so 
much 
in 
a 
short 
period 
as 
the 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
over 
the 
past 
four 
years. 
The 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
September 
2001 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
security-related 
resolution 
had 
been 
followed 
rapidly 
by 
the 
development 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
nuclear 
security 
plan 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
to 
which 
Member 
States 
had 
immediately 
begun 
contributing 
generously. 
44. 
In 
the 
intervening 
four 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
conducted 
more 
than 
100 
nuclear 
security 
field 
missions. 
Approximately 
1500 
individuals 
from 
all 
regions 
had 
received 
Agency 
training 
in 
measures 
related 
to 
preventing 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism. 
The 
results 
had 
been 
significant: 
increased 
security 
awareness 
among 
responsible 
national 
officials; 
strengthened 
physical 
protection 
at 
nuclear 
facilities; 
the 
recovery 
and 
enhanced 
security 
of 
hundreds 
of 
high-intensity 
radioactive 
sources; 
better 
cooperation 
among 
international 
law 
enforcement 
organizations; 
enhanced 
detection 
capabilities 
at 
border 
crossings; 
and 
improved 
preparedness 
for 
responding 
to 
incidents. 
45. 
A 
high 
Agency 
priority 
was 
to 
assist 
countries 
in 
implementing 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
which 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
endorsed 
in 
2003. 
Missions 
to 
assess 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
for 
radioactive 
source 
control 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
more 
than 
40 
countries 
over 
the 
past 
year, 
using 
relevant 
Agency 
standards 
and 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
evaluation. 
46. 
As 
regards 
the 
verification 
area, 
one 
needed 
only 
to 
consider 
a 
snapshot 
of 
the 
challenges 
confronting 
the 
Agency 
when 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
met 
in 
2001 
in 
order 
to 
appreciate 
how 
much 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
four 
years. 
He 
had 
been 
calling 
for 
an 
opportunity 
to 
resume 
verification 
activities 
in 
Iraq, 
and 
had 
been 
hoping 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
able 
to 
move 
from 
its 
minimal 
inspector 
presence 
in 
the 
DPRK 
to 
full 
verification. 
And 
concrete 
steps 
by 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
in 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
Âunequivocal 
commitmentÂ 
to 
disarmament 
which 
they 
had 
reiterated 
at 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
were 
being 
awaited. 
47. 
As 
with 
other 
areas 
of 
Agency 
activity, 
times 
had 
changed. 
The 
Agency 
had 
clearly 
made 
progress 
on 
some 
fronts, 
but 
perhaps 
regressed 
on 
others. 
The 
resumption 
of 
inspections 
in 
Iraq, 
the 
termination 
of 
inspections 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
investigation 
of 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
the 
discovery 
of 
illicit 
nuclear 
procurement 
networks 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
agreement 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
put 
the 
spotlight 
on 
an 
unprecedented 
array 
of 
challenges 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
arms 
control 
regime.

48. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system 
had 
shown 
great 
resourcefulness 
and 
resilience 
in 
dealing 
with 
many 
of 
those 
challenges. 
The 
Agency 
had 
rapidly 
initiated 
intensive 
verification 
efforts 
in 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
and 
investigated 
the 
illicit 
procurement 
network. 
It 
had 
strengthened 
the 
verification 
system 
through 
the 
enhanced 
use 
of 
satellite 
imagery, 
environmental 
sampling 
and 
a 
variety 
of 
new 
technologies 
and 
through 
the 
introduction 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
And 
perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
in 
dealing 
with 
those 
verification 
challenges, 
it 
had 
maintained 
its 
objectivity 
and 
independence, 
and 
thereby 
strengthened 
its 
credibility. 
In 
short, 
the 
past 
few 
years 
had 
continued 
to 
underscore 
the 
central 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
combating 
proliferation. 
49. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
continued 
to 
be 
one 
of 
the 
principal 
mechanisms 
for 
accomplishing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
mission 
Â 
supporting 
activities 
related 
to 
a 
host 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
and 
also 
safety, 
security 
and 
safeguards 
activities. 
The 
Agency 
had 
greatly 
increased 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
programme 
in 
recent 
years, 
by 
shifting 
from 
a 
technology-driven 
to 
a 
needs-driven 
approach 
focused 
on 
producing 
tangible 
socio-economic 
benefits 
in 
Member 
States. 
The 
current 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Strategy 
highlighted 
three 
elements 
essential 
for 
successful 
delivery 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme: 
strong 
government 
commitment, 
high 
project 
quality 
and 
adequate 
funding. 
50. 
As 
more 
developing 
countries 
had 
become 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
grown 
substantially 
in 
size 
and 
complexity 
and 
as 
regards 
the 
number 
of 
participating 
Member 
States. 
The 
2004 
programme 
had 
supported 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
in 
114 
countries 
and 
territories, 
and 
disbursements 
had 
totalled 
over 
US 
$73 
million. 
51. 
The 
funding 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
been 
a 
constant 
challenge, 
frequently 
hampered 
by 
late 
or 
only 
partial 
payments 
by 
many 
Member 
States. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
adopted 
a 
number 
of 
approaches 
Â 
such 
as 
the 
Ârate 
of 
attainmentÂ 
mechanism 
and 
the 
Âdue 
accountÂ 
mechanism 
Â 
in 
an 
effort 
to 
put 
programme 
implementation 
on 
a 
sound 
financial 
footing. 
52. 
During 
his 
first 
term 
of 
office, 
from 
1997 
to 
2001, 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
initiated 
an 
extensive 
programme 
of 
management 
reform. 
A 
results-based 
approach 
to 
programming 
and 
budgeting 
had 
been 
launched. 
Offices 
for 
policy 
coordination, 
programme 
support, 
internal 
oversight 
and 
nuclear 
security 
had 
been 
established. 
A 
medium-term 
strategy 
had 
been 
developed 
and 
implemented. 
Information 
technology 
had 
been 
used 
to 
enhance 
efficiency 
and 
streamline 
internal 
processes. 
Annual 
senior 
management 
conferences 
had 
emphasized 
a 
Âone-houseÂ 
approach 
to 
management, 
reviewing 
the 
results 
of 
past 
reforms 
and 
catalysing 
new 
initiatives 
where 
needed. 
53. 
With 
the 
basic 
ÂmachineryÂ 
in 
place, 
the 
focus 
during 
the 
past 
four 
years 
had 
been 
on 
fully 
implementing 
those 
reforms, 
searching 
for 
areas 
where 
greater 
efficiency 
could 
be 
achieved 
and 
fine-tuning 
programmes 
where 
necessary. 
54. 
A 
key 
achievement 
in 
2003, 
after 
many 
months 
of 
intensive 
consultations, 
had 
been 
a 
consensus 
in 
the 
Board 
on 
a 
ÂPackage 
ProposalÂ 
to 
ease 
the 
AgencyÂs 
longstanding 
budgetary 
constraints, 
characterized 
by 
nearly 
15 
years 
of 
adherence 
to 
a 
Âzero 
real 
growthÂ 
policy. 
The 
increased 
funding 
had 
been 
essential 
in 
enabling 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
address 
increasing 
high-priority 
programme 
needs. 
55. 
In 
his 
statement 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2001, 
he 
had 
called 
for 
increased 
public 
outreach 
to 
explain 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contributions 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
work. 
Little 
had 
he 
realized, 
at 
that 
time, 
the 
degree 
of 
public 
exposure 
the 
Agency 
would 
receive. 
56. 
In 
the 
four 
intervening 
years, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
public 
image 
had 
been 
transformed 
Â 
in 
large 
part 
owing 
to 
emergent 
non-proliferation 
issues, 
but 
also 
owing 
to 
successful 
efforts 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
raise 
public 
awareness 
of 
its 
important 
work. 
The 
Agency 
had 
substantially 
stepped 
up 
its 
Internet 
presence. 
It 
had 
revitalized 
its 
public 
seminar 
programme. 
And 
it 
had 
conducted 
a 
series 
of 
media 
campaigns 
on 

GC(49)/OR.1

important 
topics, 
including 
nuclear 
security, 
radiotherapy, 
nuclear 
power 
and 
Â 
earlier 
that 
month 
Â 
the 
Chernobyl 
Forum 
report. 
The 
results 
of 
those 
efforts 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
The 
Agency 
had, 
in 
the 
public 
domain, 
moved 
from 
being 
a 
relatively 
unknown 
body 
to 
being 
a 
trusted 
institution 
that 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
both 
security 
and 
development. 


57. 
The 
rapid 
overview 
just 
given 
by 
him 
encapsulated 
the 
remarkable 
changes 
that 
had 
occurred 
on 
nearly 
every 
nuclear 
front 
in 
recent 
years, 
and 
reflected 
the 
dynamic 
nature 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
in 
anticipating 
and 
responding 
to 
change. 
He 
now 
wished 
to 
outline 
a 
few 
key 
aspects 
of 
his 
vision 
for 
the 
next 
four 
years 
Â 
ways 
in 
which, 
through 
both 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
programme, 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
endeavouring 
to 
meet 
Member 
State 
needs 
and 
priorities. 
58. 
Regarding 
nuclear 
power, 
he 
hoped 
that 
in 
the 
coming 
years 
there 
would 
be 
a 
more 
explicit 
focus 
on 
the 
theme 
of 
Âenergy 
for 
developmentÂ. 
He 
had 
personally 
been 
reminded 
of 
the 
current 
global 
energy 
imbalance 
during 
a 
recent 
trip 
to 
Nigeria, 
where 
per 
capita 
electricity 
consumption 
was 
only 
about 
70 
kilowatt-hours 
per 
year, 
which 
contrasted 
sharply 
with, 
for 
example, 
the 
OECD 
average 
of 
8000 
kilowatt-hours 
per 
year. 
The 
energy 
shortage 
in 
developing 
countries 
was 
a 
basic 
impediment 
to 
development. 
Accordingly, 
he 
believed 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
increase 
its 
ability 
to 
offer 
energy 
assessment 
services 
which 
built 
Member 
StatesÂ 
capacities 
for 
national 
energy 
analysis 
and 
energy 
planning 
with 
account 
taken 
of 
all 
three 
aspects 
of 
sustainable 
development 
Â 
economic, 
environmental 
and 
social. 
59. 
In 
addition, 
the 
international 
nuclear 
community 
needed 
to 
become 
more 
creative 
in 
developing 
regional 
approaches 
to 
energy 
needs. 
Regional 
approaches 
could 
be 
useful 
in 
addressing 
many 
issues 
that 
had 
made 
nuclear 
power 
impractical 
for 
developing 
countries 
Â 
for 
example, 
low 
electrical 
grid 
capacities, 
high 
upfront 
capital 
costs, 
and 
infrastructure 
and 
workforce 
limitations. 
Also, 
they 
were 
consistent 
with 
concepts 
which 
the 
Agency 
was 
already 
exploring 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
multilateral 
control 
of 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities, 
and 
would 
bring 
similar 
advantages 
related 
to 
safety, 
security, 
proliferation 
resistance 
and 
economies 
of 
scale. 
60. 
Regarding 
nuclear 
applications, 
a 
key 
feature 
of 
modern 
science 
was 
its 
synergy 
Â 
the 
way, 
for 
example, 
in 
which 
advances 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
nanotechnology, 
bioengineering 
and 
information 
technology 
interacted 
to 
produce 
ever 
greater 
achievements. 
With 
that 
in 
mind, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
seek 
new 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
which 
could 
offer 
tangible 
benefits 
to 
society. 
61. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
applications 
made 
the 
greatest 
positive 
impact, 
the 
Agency 
had 
strengthened 
its 
efforts 
to 
forge 
effective 
strategic 
partnerships 
with 
other 
United 
Nations 
system 
organizations, 
with 
international 
financial 
institutions, 
with 
regional 
organizations 
and 
Â 
first 
and 
foremost 
Â 
with 
Member 
States. 
62. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
safety, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
press 
for 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime, 
and 
in 
that 
connection 
he 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
growing 
support 
for 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
Agency 
safety 
standards. 
The 
Agency 
should 
also 
press 
for 
broader 
Member 
State 
participation 
in 
international 
safety 
conventions, 
for 
greater 
use 
to 
be 
made 
of 
Agency 
safety 
reviews 
and 
for 
enhanced 
coordination 
among 
international 
nuclear 
safety 
bodies 
such 
as 
WANO 
and 
OECD/NEA. 
A 
related 
point 
of 
emphasis 
would 
be 
increased 
harmonization 
in 
national 
regulatory 
approaches, 
to 
ensure 
high-quality, 
independent 
oversight 
for 
nuclear 
activities. 
63. 
In 
the 
same 
spirit, 
the 
Agency 
needed 
to 
improve 
its 
performance 
in 
fixing 
the 
so-called 
Âweak 
linksÂ 
in 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
chain. 
Since 
the 
1986 
accident 
at 
Chernobyl, 
enormous 
efforts 
had 
been 
made 
in 
upgrading 
reactor 
safety, 
but 
there 
were 
still 
facilities 
for 
which 
nuclear 
safety 
assistance 
should 
be 
a 
high 
priority. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
such 
facilities, 
the 
Agency 
should 
move 
expeditiously,

coordinating 
with 
other 
relevant 
organizations, 
to 
determine 
the 
actions 
needed 
and 
the 
expected 
costs 
and 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
strategy 
and 
schedule 
for 
proceeding. 


64. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
assistance 
efforts 
to 
date 
had 
been 
focused, 
of 
necessity, 
on 
helping 
States 
to 
identify 
and 
address 
vulnerabilities, 
upgrading 
physical 
protection, 
securing 
high-priority 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
developing 
standards 
and 
guidance. 
As 
progress 
was 
made 
towards 
a 
more 
mature 
global 
nuclear 
security 
framework, 
however, 
it 
was 
important 
that 
the 
Agency 
developed 
a 
clearer 
overall 
picture 
of 
remaining 
security 
vulnerabilities. 
For 
example, 
it 
needed 
to 
improve 
its 
understanding 
of 
the 
patterns 
that 
characterized 
illicit 
trafficking 
activities, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
Member 
States 
with 
the 
information 
needed 
for 
effectively 
combating 
such 
activities. 
65. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
verification, 
the 
priorities 
for 
the 
coming 
years 
included 
universalizing 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol, 
expanding 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards, 
normalizing 
safeguards 
in 
Iraq, 
bringing 
the 
DPRK 
back 
to 
the 
NPT 
regime, 
providing 
the 
required 
assurances 
about 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
and 
continuing 
to 
investigate 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
the 
illicit 
procurement 
network. 
66. 
In 
addition, 
he 
remained 
convinced 
that 
a 
key 
to 
strengthening 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
lay 
in 
arresting 
the 
spread 
of 
sensitive 
fuel 
cycle 
activities 
and 
developing 
a 
framework 
for 
the 
multilateral 
management 
of 
such 
activities. 
An 
urgent 
first 
step 
would 
be 
to 
create 
an 
international 
framework 
for 
ensuring 
the 
supply 
of 
reactor 
technology 
and 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
all 
countries, 
to 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
framework 
for 
multilateral 
management. 
67. 
Within 
its 
safeguards 
programme, 
the 
Agency 
must 
devote 
the 
necessary 
resources 
to 
enhancing 
its 
technical 
capabilities 
Â 
including 
independent 
analytical 
capabilities 
of 
its 
laboratories 
and 
its 
capabilities 
for 
developing 
and 
applying 
innovative 
verification 
tools. 
Also, 
the 
Agency 
should 
explore 
the 
possibility 
of 
developing 
mechanisms 
to 
encourage 
better 
information 
sharing 
among 
States. 
68. 
Finally, 
there 
was 
a 
need 
for 
redoubled 
efforts 
to 
launch 
negotiations 
at 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
on 
a 
non-discriminatory 
and 
internationally 
verifiable 
global 
treaty 
banning 
the 
production 
of 
material 
for 
nuclear 
weapons 
Â 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
If 
there 
was 
any 
lesson 
to 
be 
learned 
from 
the 
events 
of 
the 
past 
four 
years, 
it 
should 
be 
that 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
international 
security 
would 
be 
steps 
to 
eliminate 
both 
access 
to 
and 
the 
production 
of 
material 
for 
nuclear 
weapons. 
69. 
Clearly, 
much 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
The 
lack 
of 
agreement 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
extremely 
disappointing, 
given 
the 
urgent 
and 
serious 
challenges 
which 
the 
Agency 
was 
facing. 
Also, 
he 
was 
dismayed 
that 
there 
had 
been 
no 
agreement 
on 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
at 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit 
earlier 
that 
month. 
The 
current 
challenges 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
including 
those 
related 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
arms 
control, 
could 
not 
be 
wished 
away, 
and 
they 
would 
continue 
to 
stare 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
face. 
All 
States 
should 
Âstep 
up 
to 
the 
plateÂ 
and 
pursue, 
at 
the 
highest 
policy 
levels, 
the 
urgently 
needed 
reforms 
to 
the 
global 
security 
system 
Â 
of 
which 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
arms 
control 
regime 
was 
an 
essential 
part. 
There 
was 
a 
need 
for 
a 
security 
umbrella 
covering 
all 
countries 
and 
for 
continued 
work 
on 
both 
the 
symptoms 
and 
the 
causes 
of 
those 
challenges. 
70. 
In 
conclusion, 
one 
more 
achievement 
of 
recent 
years 
was 
worth 
noting 
Â 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
evolved 
into 
a 
true 
agora 
for 
ideas 
that 
stimulated 
continued 
examination 
of 
all 
areas 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission. 
That 
being 
so, 
he 
hoped 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
would, 
during 
the 
week 
ahead, 
build 
on 
the 
ideas 
which 
he 
had 
just 
laid 
out, 
adding 
its 
own 
constructive 
ideas 
for 
enhancing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
The 
Agency 
remained 
dependent 
on 
the 
shared 
commitment 
and 
the 
partnership 
of 
Member 
States, 
and 
he 
looked 
forward 
to 
a 
continuation 
of 
that 
partnership 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come.

71. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
commending 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
his 
statement, 
said 
that 
his 
interesting 
ideas 
on 
the 
challenges 
that 
lay 
ahead 
for 
the 
Agency 
would 
undoubtedly 
be 
considered 
carefully 
by 
Member 
States. 
The 
Director 
General 
left 
the 
meeting. 


6. 
Approval 
of 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
(GC(49)/4) 


72. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
Article 
VII.A 
of 
the 
Statute, 
the 
Board 
had 
decided 
to 
appoint 
Mr. 
Mohamed 
ElBaradei 
to 
serve 
as 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Agency 
for 
a 
term 
of 
four 
years 
from 
1 
December 
2005 
to 
30 
November 
2009 
and 
had 
requested 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
approve 
that 
appointment 
by 
adopting 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/4. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
that 
draft 
resolution. 
73. 
It 
was 
so 
decided, 
and 
the 
Conference 
confirmed 
the 
appointment 
of 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
to 
the 
post 
of 
Director 
General 
by 
acclamation. 
At 
the 
invitation 
of 
the 
President, 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
re-entered 
the 
meeting. 


74. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
informed 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
that 
the 
Conference 
had 
approved 
his 
appointment 
to 
the 
post 
of 
Director 
General 
for 
another 
four 
years. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
be 
the 
first 
to 
congratulate 
him 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
wish 
him 
a 
very 
fruitful 
tenure. 
He 
invited 
him 
to 
take 
the 
oath 
of 
office. 
75. 
Mr. 
ELBARADEI 
took 
the 
following 
oath: 
"I 
solemnly 
swear 
to 
exercise 
in 
all 
loyalty, 
discretion 
and 
conscience 
the 
functions 
entrusted 
to 
me 
as 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency, 
to 
discharge 
these 
functions 
and 
to 
regulate 
my 
conduct 
with 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
Agency 
only 
in 
view, 
and 
not 
to 
seek 
or 
accept 
instructions 
in 
regard 
to 
the 
performance 
of 
my 
duties 
from 
any 
government 
or 
other 
authority 
external 
to 
the 
Agency." 


76. 
The 
DIRECTOR 
GENERAL 
said 
he 
was 
honoured 
and 
humbled 
by 
the 
General 
Conference's 
renewed 
expression 
of 
trust 
in 
him. 
As 
always, 
independence 
and 
impartiality 
would 
guide 
his 
work 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Secretariat. 
The 
Agency 
had 
become 
a 
key 
player 
both 
as 
an 
international 
development 
institution 
and 
as 
an 
instrument 
for 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Security 
and 
development 
issues 
were 
closely 
linked 
and, 
as 
experience 
had 
shown, 
could 
most 
effectively 
be 
addressed 
in 
tandem. 
He 
strongly 
believed 
that 
most, 
if 
not 
all, 
of 
the 
challenges 
faced 
by 
the 
Agency 
could 
be 
mastered 
only 
through 
collective 
approaches. 
Multilateral 
institutions 
were 
more 
important 
now 
than 
at 
any 
time 
before. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
success 
would 
remain 
dependent 
on 
Member 
StatesÂ 
unity 
of 
purpose, 
guidance 
and 
support.

7. 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2006 
(GC(49)/19) 


77. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
an 
agreement 
reached 
in 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2005, 
the 
Board 
had 
recommended 
a 
figure 
of 
US 
$77.5 
million 
as 
the 
target 
for 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
a 
table 
in 
the 
attachment 
to 
document 
GC(49)/19 
which 
showed 
the 
contributions 
that 
each 
Member 
State 
would 
need 
to 
make 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
its 
share 
of 
that 
target. 
78. 
The 
early 
pledging 
and 
payment 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
greatly 
helped 
the 
Secretariat 
in 
planning 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
Delegations 
in 
a 
position 
to 
do 
so 
were 
therefore 
urged 
to 
notify 
the 
Secretariat 
during 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
current 
session 
of 
the 
contributions 
which 
their 
governments 
would 
be 
making 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006. 
79. 
He 
would 
report 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
session, 
under 
a 
later 
agenda 
item, 
on 
the 
contributions 
which 
had 
been 
pledged 
up 
to 
that 
time. 
He 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
report 
favourably 
on 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
2006 
TCF 
target 
figure 
already 
pledged. 
8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(GC(49)/5) 


80. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
authorized 
him, 
under 
Rule 
50 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
to 
limit 
the 
duration 
of 
general 
debate 
statements 
to 
15 
minutes. 
81. 
It 
was 
so 
agreed. 
82. 
Mr. 
ZHANG 
Huazhu 
(China), 
congratulating 
Mr. 
ElBaradei 
on 
his 
re-election 
as 
Director 
General, 
said 
that 
during 
the 
past 
eight 
years 
he 
had 
demonstrated 
exceptional 
competence 
and 
impartiality. 
China 
was 
convinced 
that 
he 
would 
demonstrate 
the 
same 
exceptional 
competence 
and 
impartiality 
during 
the 
next 
four 
years. 
He 
could, 
as 
always, 
count 
on 
ChinaÂs 
full 
support. 
83. 
Human 
society 
was 
currently 
experiencing 
rapid 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development 
coupled 
with 
steady 
economic 
growth. 
As 
the 
global 
economy 
expanded, 
the 
need 
for 
energy 
sustainability 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
pressing. 
After 
considering 
factors 
such 
as 
energy 
supply 
security 
and 
the 
need 
to 
address 
climate 
change 
effectively, 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
had 
begun 
to 
re-
examine 
the 
status 
and 
role 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
84. 
Both 
the 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
March 
and 
the 
13th 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Engineering 
held 
in 
Beijing 
in 
May 
had 
concluded 
that 
nuclear 
power 
would 
make 
a 
major 
contribution 
to 
meeting 
mankindÂs 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
21st 
century. 
According 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
most 
conservative 
forecast, 
by 
2020 
the 
worldÂs 
total 
installed 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
capacity 
would 
reach 
427 
GW, 
which 
would 
be 
equivalent 
to 
having 
built 
127 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
of 
1000 
MW 
each 
over 
and 
above 
those 
forecast 
in 
2000. 
There 
was 
every 
indication 
that 
a 
worldwide 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was 
about 
to 
unfold. 
85. 
In 
China, 
nuclear 
power 
development 
had 
entered 
a 
new 
era. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
national 
energy 
strategy, 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
overall 
plan 
for 
development 
of 
the 
power 
sector. 
That 
strategic 
decision 
would 
make 
a 
substantial 
contribution 
to 
reducing 
the 
consumption 
of 
fossil 
fuel

alleviating

warming. 
According 
to 
preliminary 
planning, 
by 
2020 
ChinaÂs

installed 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
capacity 
would 
be 
around 
40 
000 
MW, 
accounting 
for 
about 
4% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
total 
installed 
power 
generation 
capacity. 
That 
goal 
was 
feasible. 
In 
the 
process 
of 
increasing 
its 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
capacity, 
China 
would 
continue 
to 
engage 
in 
international 
cooperation 
aimed 
at 
the 
introduction 
of 
proven 
advanced 
nuclear 
power 
technology 
while 
making 
full 
use 
of 
its 
own 
capabilities 
and 
striving 
for 
self-reliance 
in 
design 
and 
equipment 
manufacturing. 


86. 
As 
energy 
demand 
grew, 
developing 
countries 
were 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
interested 
in 
nuclear 
power. 
At 
present, 
60% 
of 
the 
reactors 
under 
construction 
were 
in 
developing 
countries, 
and 
China 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
provide 
developing 
countries 
with 
the 
greatest 
possible 
assistance 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
construction 
management, 
operating 
experience 
feedback, 
nuclear 
safety 
regulation 
and 
human 
resources 
development. 
For 
its 
part, 
China 
stood 
ready 
to 
share 
with 
other 
countries 
the 
experience 
gained 
by 
it 
in 
the 
process 
of 
nuclear 
power 
development. 
87. 
The 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
facing 
new 
challenges, 
and 
China 
therefore 
especially 
regretted 
that 
the 
seventh 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
held 
in 
May 
2005, 
had 
failed 
to 
produce 
a 
substantive 
outcome 
document. 
However, 
there 
had 
been 
a 
full, 
very 
useful 
exchange 
of 
views 
on 
the 
present 
situation 
regarding 
international 
arms 
control, 
security 
and 
non-proliferation. 
88. 
As 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
the 
NPT 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
an 
irreplaceable 
role 
in 
nuclear 
proliferation 
prevention, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
international 
community 
should 
firmly 
uphold 
multilateralism, 
pursue 
the 
three 
major 
objectives 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
a 
balanced 
way, 
identify 
practical 
approaches 
to 
new 
issues 
in 
the 
field 
of 
proliferation 
prevention 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
wide 
consultation, 
and 
handle 
regional 
nuclear 
issues 
through 
diplomacy 
and 
dialogue 
so 
as 
to 
maintain 
regional 
peace 
and 
stability. 
89. 
Since 
the 
September 
2001 
terrorist 
attacks, 
non-traditional 
security 
threats 
Â 
especially 
transnational 
and 
transregional 
terrorism 
Â 
had 
been 
on 
the 
rise. 
For 
the 
international 
community, 
nuclear 
terrorism 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dreaded 
types 
of 
terrorist 
activity. 
At 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security: 
Global 
Directions 
for 
the 
Future 
held 
in 
London 
in 
March, 
participants 
had 
analysed 
the 
new 
challenges, 
shared 
their 
experiences 
and 
explored 
ways 
to 
improve 
international 
nuclear 
security. 
His 
Government 
welcomed 
the 
achievements 
of 
that 
conference. 
90. 
China, 
which 
had 
always 
stood 
for 
the 
complete 
prohibition 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
destruction 
of 
all 
such 
weapons, 
had 
always 
resolutely 
opposed 
all 
forms 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
all 
forms 
of 
terrorism 
and 
had 
always 
participated 
actively 
in 
international 
cooperation 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
them. 
It 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
to 
advise 
the 
Board 
on 
ways 
and 
means 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
hoped 
that 
agreement 
would 
soon 
be 
reached 
on 
the 
mandate 
of 
the 
committee, 
the 
scope 
of 
its 
work, 
its 
modus 
operandi 
and 
the 
financial 
arrangements 
for 
it 
through 
consultation 
within 
the 
framework 
authorized 
by 
the 
Board. 
The 
Chinese 
Government 
would 
participate 
constructively 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
committee. 
91. 
China 
had 
participated 
constructively 
in 
the 
deliberations 
regarding 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
its 
positive 
contributions 
had 
helped 
the 
parties 
to 
ultimately 
reach 
a 
consensus. 
The 
Chinese 
Government 
would 
submit 
the 
CPPNM 
amendment 
to 
the 
National 
PeopleÂs 
Congress 
for 
ratification 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
would 
establish 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
regimes 
required 
by 
the 
amended 
instrument. 
92. 
The 
fundamental 
goals 
of 
strengthening 
international 
nuclear 
security 
and 
preventing 
nuclear 
proliferation 
were 
the 
maintenance 
of 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
all 
States 
and 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
all 
societies. 
Recently, 
some 
new 
ideas 
and 
proposals 
regarding 
international 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
had 
been 
put 
forward. 
China 
was 
open 
to 
suggestions 
for 
strengthening 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
stood 
ready 
to 
examine 
them 
together 
with 
other 
countries.

It 
should 
be 
borne 
in 
mind, 
however, 
that 
the 
present 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
effective. 
The 
regime 
had 
taken 
shape 
and 
was 
continuing 
to 
develop 
through 
a 
step-by-step 
process 
of 
improvement. 
Related 
policies 
and 
procedures 
should 
be 
developed 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
universal 
participation 
and 
scientific 
decision-making. 
That 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
ensure 
the 
objectiveness, 
soundness 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
regime 
and 
win 
the 
understanding 
and 
support 
of 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
international 
community. 


93. 
On 
19 
September, 
in 
Beijing, 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
had 
produced 
an 
important 
interim 
result. 
Through 
serious 
and 
pragmatic 
discussions, 
the 
parties 
had 
reached 
agreement 
on 
the 
overarching 
goals 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
They 
had 
issued 
a 
joint 
statement 
accommodating 
the 
interests 
and 
concerns 
of 
all 
of 
them 
which 
was 
a 
balanced, 
win-win 
document 
marking 
the 
entry 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
into 
a 
new 
phase. 
The 
hard-earned 
progress 
that 
had 
been 
made 
demonstrated 
the 
political 
will 
of 
the 
leaders 
and 
governments 
of 
the 
six 
countries 
in 
question 
to 
resolve 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
peacefully 
and 
through 
dialogue. 
The 
joint 
statement 
had 
laid 
a 
good 
foundation 
for 
the 
future 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
but 
it 
represented 
only 
the 
first 
step 
in 
a 
long 
march. 
The 
next 
step 
would 
involve 
addressing 
concrete 
issues, 
which 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
more 
difficult. 
94. 
The 
nuclear 
issue 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
complicated, 
but 
China 
hoped 
that 
all 
the 
parties 
would 
continue 
to 
display 
mutual 
respect 
and 
consideration, 
flexibility 
and 
pragmatism, 
steadily 
building 
mutual 
trust, 
expanding 
the 
common 
ground 
and 
bridging 
their 
differences 
so 
as 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
that 
issue. 
China, 
which 
remained 
firmly 
committed 
to 
resolving 
the 
issue 
peacefully, 
through 
dialogue, 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
It 
stood 
ready 
to 
continue 
working 
with 
the 
other 
parties 
concerned 
and 
with 
the 
international 
community 
in 
general 
in 
striving 
for 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
for 
peace 
and 
stability 
there 
and 
in 
the 
whole 
of 
Northeast 
Asia. 
95. 
China 
had 
always 
favoured 
a 
resolution 
of 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
based 
on 
negotiation 
and 
cooperation 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency, 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region 
concerned, 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
of 
all 
parties. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
would 
continue 
to 
seek 
a 
solution 
through 
dialogue, 
taking 
a 
long-term 
perspective, 
demonstrating 
the 
necessary 
political 
will, 
having 
full 
regard 
for 
one 
anotherÂs 
concerns 
and 
making 
a 
real 
effort 
to 
break 
the 
deadlock 
and 
resume 
talks 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date. 
It 
stood 
ready 
to 
work 
with 
all 
parties 
and 
to 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
constructive 
role 
in 
resolving 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
through 
diplomacy. 
96. 
For 
almost 
half 
a 
century, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
Member 
States, 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
playing 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
promoting 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
It 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dynamic 
international 
organizations, 
and 
China 
believed 
that, 
so 
long 
as 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Statute 
were 
firmly 
borne 
in 
mind 
and 
the 
balanced 
development 
of 
the 
two 
types 
of 
statutory 
activity 
was 
maintained, 
the 
Agency 
would 
play 
an 
even 
greater 
role 
in 
improving 
peoplesÂ 
living 
standards 
and 
maintaining 
international 
security. 
97. 
Mr. 
WRIGHT 
(United 
Kingdom), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
that 
the 
acceding 
countries 
Bulgaria 
and 
Romania, 
the 
candidate 
countries 
Croatia 
and 
Turkey, 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Stabilization 
and 
Association 
Process 
and 
potential 
candidates 
Albania, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
the 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia, 
and 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro, 
the 
EFTA 
countries 
Iceland 
and 
Norway, 
members 
of 
the 
European 
Economic 
Area, 
and 
Moldova 
and 
Ukraine 
associated 
themselves 
with 
the 
statement 
which 
he 
was 
about 
to 
make. 
98. 
The 
European 
Union 
believed 
that 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
with 
the 
safeguards 
obligations 
stemming 
from 
it 
was 
the 
most 
important 
non-proliferation 
challenge 
currently 
facing 
the

international 
community. 
It 
had 
hoped 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
would 
send 
out 
a 
clear 
message 
about 
that 
challenge, 
covering 
issues 
such 
as 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
it 
had 
contributed 
very 
actively 
to 
the 
efforts 
made 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
consensus 
text 
by 
the 
Review 
Conference. 
Regrettably, 
despite 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Review 
Conference 
President 
and 
many 
NPT 
parties, 
the 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
produce 
a 
consensus 
document 
on 
the 
substantive 
points 
under 
discussion. 


99. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
three 
mutually 
reinforcing 
pillars 
on 
which 
it 
was 
based, 
had 
made 
wording 
proposals 
in 
the 
Review 
ConferenceÂs 
three 
main 
committees 
and 
presented 
working 
papers 
on 
Â 
inter 
alia 
Â 
the 
questions 
of 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Global 
Partnership 
against 
the 
Spread 
of 
Weapons 
and 
Materials 
of 
Mass 
Destruction. 
100. 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
consideration 
should 
be 
given 
to 
holding 
the 
first 
meeting 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2007 
Â 
in 
Vienna. 
101. 
As 
regards 
Agency 
safeguards, 
the 
European 
Union 
considered 
them 
essential 
for 
detecting 
and 
deterring 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
for 
use 
in 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
increasing 
confidence 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
materials. 
It 
therefore 
regretted 
that 
37 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency. 
It 
would 
like 
to 
see 
those 
States 
concluding 
such 
agreements 
soon. 
102. 
Experience 
had 
shown, 
however, 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
alone 
did 
not 
provide 
the 
Agency 
with 
the 
means 
to 
detect 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
related 
material 
Â 
some 
States 
with 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
force 
had 
engaged 
in 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes. 
The 
Agency 
could 
give 
credible 
assurances 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
only 
in 
the 
case 
of 
countries 
with 
additional 
protocols 
in 
force. 
103. 
Despite 
an 
agreement 
reached 
at 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
calls 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
for 
the 
conclusion 
of 
additional 
protocols 
by 
all 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT, 
eight 
years 
after 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
123 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
still 
not 
brought 
additional 
protocols 
into 
force. 
In 
order 
that 
an 
important 
non-proliferation 
deficit 
might 
be 
eliminated, 
those 
States 
should 
conclude 
additional 
protocols 
and 
bring 
them 
into 
force 
without 
further 
delay. 
104. 
The 
European 
Union 
agreed 
with 
the 
United 
Nations 
High-Level 
Panel 
on 
Threats, 
Challenges 
and 
Change 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
additional 
protocols 
should 
now 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
standard. 
105. 
It 
also 
agreed 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
that 
SQPs 
in 
their 
present 
form 
constituted 
a 
weakness 
in 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
steps 
taken 
recently 
by 
the 
Board 
to 
address 
that 
weakness 
and 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
States 
with 
SQPs 
concluding 
an 
exchange 
of 
letters 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
giving 
effect 
to 
the 
modified 
standard 
text 
and 
the 
modified 
criteria. 
106. 
As 
regards 
the 
challenge 
to 
the 
safeguards 
system 
posed 
by 
the 
DPRK, 
the 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
which 
had 
been 
taking 
place 
in 
Beijing. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
early 
implementation 
of 
the 
commitments 
made 
by 
them 
and 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
effective 
verification 
arrangements, 
and 
it 
remained 
ready 
to 
assist 
in 
whatever 
way 
it 
could. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
flexibility 
shown 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
commended 
China 
on 
its 
efforts 
in 
hosting 
those 
talks. 
107. 
As 
regards 
the 
challenge 
posed 
by 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
during 
the 
past 
two 
years 
that 
country 
had 
failed 
to 
honour 
commitments 
which 
it 
had 
made 
and 
in 
the 
light 
of 
which 
the 
Board 
had, 
in 
November 
2003, 
abstained 
from 
reporting 
to

non-compliance 
on 
which 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
submitted 
reports. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
not 
fully 
cooperated 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
addressing 
and 
resolving 
all 
outstanding 
issues. 
Having 
taken 
over 
a 
year 
to 
suspend 
all 
its 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities, 
it 
had, 
in 
defiance 
of 
clear 
Board 
requests, 
revoked 
the 
suspension 
well 
before 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
could 
be 
resolved 
by 
the 
Agency. 
The 
European 
Union 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
resolution 
relating 
to 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
24 
September 
and 
would 
like 
to 
see 
that 
country 
implementing 
the 
confidence-building 
measures 
called 
for 
in 
the 
resolution, 
so 
that 
negotiations 
within 
the 
framework 
agreed 
upon 
by 
the 
EU-3 
(on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union) 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
in 
November 
might 
be 
resumed. 


108. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
favoured 
close 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
State 
and 
regional 
systems 
of 
accounting 
for 
and 
control 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
European 
Commission 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
collaborating 
closely 
in 
making 
changes 
to 
the 
existing 
joint 
safeguards 
arrangements. 
109. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
comments 
made 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
of 
recent 
experiences 
with 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities, 
the 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Board 
to 
create 
a 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
with 
the 
main 
task 
of 
recommending 
to 
it 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
view, 
a 
positive 
outcome 
of 
the 
committeeÂs 
work 
would 
further 
enhance 
the 
credibility 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities. 
110. 
The 
European 
Union 
had 
noted 
with 
concern 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
conclusion 
that 
the 
uranium 
enrichment 
programmes 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
had 
certain 
elements 
in 
common 
and 
that 
the 
basic 
technology 
used 
in 
the 
two 
programmes 
was 
very 
similar 
and 
obtained 
largely 
from 
the 
same 
foreign 
sources. 
It 
therefore 
fully 
endorsed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
call 
for 
all 
States 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
in 
efforts 
to 
identify 
the 
supply 
routes 
and 
sources 
of 
the 
technology 
and 
the 
related 
equipment 
and 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
materials. 
111. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
strong 
national 
and 
internationally 
coordinated 
export 
controls, 
believed 
that 
the 
efforts 
being 
made 
to 
tackle 
the 
issue 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
procurement 
networks 
and 
that 
of 
the 
involvement 
of 
non-State 
actors 
in 
the 
proliferation 
of 
technology 
for 
manufacturing 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
should 
be 
strengthened. 
Accordingly, 
it 
had 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
in 
June 
2004 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
on 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
was 
supporting 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative. 
112. 
The 
European 
Union 
had 
also 
welcomed 
the 
General 
AssemblyÂs 
unanimous 
adoption 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
it 
hoped 
that 
all 
States 
would 
sign 
and 
ratify 
that 
convention 
soon. 
113. 
Although 
the 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
nuclear 
security 
rested 
with 
States, 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
essential 
role 
to 
play 
in 
preventing 
and 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Accordingly, 
the 
European 
Union, 
which 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
Agency-organized 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security: 
Global 
Directions 
for 
the 
Future 
held 
in 
London 
in 
March, 
was 
providing 
financial 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
security-related 
activities. 
114. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
recent 
conference 
on 
amending 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
adopted 
amendment 
would 
enter 
into 
force 
soon. 
It 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
States 
that 
were 
not 
yet 
parties 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
acceding 
to 
it 
and 
accepting 
the 
amendment 
and, 
pending 
the 
amendmentÂs 
entry 
into 
force, 
it 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
States 
acting 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
amendment.

115. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide, 
believed 
that, 
although 
nuclear 
safety 
was 
a 
national 
responsibility, 
international 
cooperation 
in 
that 
field 
was 
essential 
and 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
the 
forum 
for 
such 
cooperation. 
It 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
March 
of 
safety 
requirements 
for 
the 
safety 
of 
research 
reactors. 
116. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
continuous 
safety 
improvement 
and 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
safety-related 
matters. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
those 
two 
conventions, 
action 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
within 
the 
European 
Union, 
including 
a 
high 
safety 
level 
in 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
117. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
latest 
review 
meeting 
of 
contracting 
parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
Also, 
it 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
forthcoming 
extraordinary 
meeting 
of 
contracting 
parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
at 
which 
it 
would 
work 
to 
enhance 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
mechanism. 
118. 
The 
European 
Union 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
States 
that 
were 
not 
already 
contracting 
parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
acceding 
to 
those 
two 
conventions. 
119. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
had 
noted 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Transport 
of 
Radioactive 
Material, 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
publication 
of 
the 
2005 
edition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Transport 
Regulations. 
It 
considered 
TranSAS 
missions 
useful 
for 
promoting 
the 
strict 
application 
of 
the 
Transport 
Regulations 
and 
welcomed 
JapanÂs 
intention 
to 
host 
such 
a 
mission 
later 
in 
the 
year. 
120. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
ongoing 
work 
of 
the 
International 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Nuclear 
Liability 
(INLEX), 
to 
which 
several 
of 
its 
Member 
States 
were 
contributing. 
121. 
All 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
which 
had 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
held 
recently 
in 
Bordeaux, 
were 
working 
towards 
implementing 
the 
guidance 
contained 
in 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
associated 
guidance 
on 
the 
import 
and 
export 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
It 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
countries 
informing 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
their 
political 
commitment 
to 
the 
Code. 
122. 
Given 
the 
dual-use 
nature 
of 
the 
technologies 
involved 
in 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
spent 
fuel 
reprocessing, 
the 
European 
Union 
considered 
it 
important 
to 
encourage 
the 
provision 
of 
guarantees 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel-related 
services 
or 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
itself 
under 
appropriate 
conditions. 
It 
would 
like 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
initiate 
discussions 
on 
implementing 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle, 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
assurances. 
123. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
not 
only 
the 
political 
support 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
but 
also 
their 
financial 
support. 
The 
European 
Union, 
whose 
25 
Member 
States 
accounted 
for 
a 
substantial 
part 
of 
the 
Regular 
Budget, 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
Member 
States 
paying 
their 
assessed 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
The 
European 
Union, 
whose 
25 
Member 
States 
also 
accounted 
for 
a 
significant 
proportion 
of 
the 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF, 
would 
like 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
TCF 
resources 
were 
used 
first 
and 
foremost 
in 
developing 
countries 
that 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
did 
not 
have 
APC 
or 
NPC 
arrears. 
124. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
was 
engaged 
in 
many 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
contributing 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
developing 
countries 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 

GC(49)/OR.1

welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
address 
the 
growing 
problem 
of 
cancer 
in 
developing 
countries 
through 
PACT. 


125. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
education 
and 
training 
programmes 
aimed 
at 
updating 
nuclear 
knowledge 
so 
as 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
both 
developing 
and 
developed 
countries. 
Also, 
it 
appreciated 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
a 
founding 
supporter 
of 
the 
World 
Nuclear 
University. 
126. 
The 
European 
Union, 
which 
was 
closely 
following 
INPRO 
and 
other 
current 
projects 
relating 
to 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles, 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
Agency-
organized 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
March. 
In 
his 
Final 
Statement, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
had 
concluded 
that, 
in 
the 
view 
of 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
participants, 
nuclear 
power 
could 
make 
a 
major 
contribution 
to 
meeting 
energy 
needs 
and 
sustaining 
development 
in 
the 
many 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries 
which 
wished 
to 
exercise 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option 
but 
that 
certain 
conditions 
would 
have 
to 
be 
met, 
including 
conditions 
relating 
to 
non-proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security. 
127. 
In 
his 
eight 
years 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
called 
upon 
to 
deal 
with 
several 
challenging 
situations. 
On 
each 
occasion, 
he 
had 
striven 
to 
uphold 
the 
best 
traditions 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
respond 
in 
a 
balanced 
and 
measured 
manner 
to 
the 
demands 
placed 
upon 
him. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
approval, 
by 
consensus, 
of 
his 
appointment 
by 
the 
Board 
as 
Director 
General 
for 
a 
further 
four 
years. 
It 
was 
confident 
that, 
under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
meet 
the 
high 
standards 
which 
he 
had 
set. 
128. 
Mr. 
SCHULTE 
(United 
States 
of 
America) 
said 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
Secretary 
of 
Energy, 
Mr. 
Samuel 
Bodman, 
was 
unable 
to 
attend 
the 
General 
Conference 
session 
and 
had 
asked 
him 
to 
speak 
on 
his 
behalf 
after 
the 
following 
videotaped 
message 
from 
Mr 
Bodman: 
ÂI 
regret 
that 
I 
cannot 
be 
with 
you 
in 
Vienna 
due 
to 
the 
extraordinary 
events 
related 
to 
the 
recent 
hurricanes 
in 
the 
United 
States 
Â 
and 
the 
continuing 
recovery 
efforts 
that 
are 
addressing 
devastation 
on 
our 
gulf 
coast. 


ÂThese 
two 
storms 
have 
claimed 
hundreds 
of 
lives, 
destroyed 
whole 
communities, 
and 
displaced 
large 
numbers 
of 
Americans. 


ÂAs 
you 
know, 
our 
gulf 
coast 
region 
is 
home 
to 
a 
very 
significant 
percentage 
of 
AmericaÂs 
oil 
and 
natural 
gas 
facilities. 


ÂBecause 
of 
the 
severity 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
storm, 
Hurricane 
Rita, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
region 
to 
AmericaÂs 
energy 
supply, 
my 
duties 
as 
Secretary 
of 
Energy 
require 
my 
continued 
presence 
in 
Washington. 


ÂOn 
behalf 
of 
President 
Bush, 
the 
leadership 
in 
Congress 
and 
the 
American 
people, 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
you, 
your 
governments 
and 
your 
citizens 
for 
the 
tremendous 
outpouring 
of 
support 
over 
the 
past 
several 
weeks. 


ÂIn 
response 
to 
tight 
energy 
markets, 
many 
of 
our 
countries 
were 
able 
to 
work 
cooperatively 
to 
calm 
nervous 
energy 
markets 
across 
the 
globe. 


ÂAnd 
the 
generosity 
of 
your 
governments 
and 
your 
citizens 
in 
the 
form 
of 
financial 
pledges, 
personnel, 
equipment, 
and 
disaster 
supplies 
is 
an 
incredible 
display 
of 
international 
solidarity. 


ÂWe 
are 
gratified 
by 
these 
actions 
Â 
actions 
that 
exemplify 
the 
great 
spirit 
of 
international 
cooperation 
that 
is 
the 
engine 
for 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
IAEA.

ÂIn 
1953, 
President 
Eisenhower, 
in 
his 
famous 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
speech, 
noted 
that 
a 
Âspecial 
purposeÂ 
of 
atomic 
energy 
Âwould 
be 
to 
provide 
abundant 
electrical 
energy 
in 
the 
power-starved 
areas 
of 
the 
world.Â 


ÂOver 
the 
past 
50 
years 
he 
has 
been 
proved 
right. 
Nuclear 
power 
brought 
electricity 
to 
many 
corners 
of 
the 
globe. 


ÂIt 
helped 
fuel 
the 
post-war 
economic 
expansion 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
in 
Europe, 
and 
in 
Japan. 


ÂAs 
important 
as 
nuclear 
power 
has 
been 
to 
the 
20th 
century, 
however, 
it 
will 
be 
far 
more 
critical 
to 
meeting 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
21st 
century. 


ÂEnergy 
is 
a 
necessary 
engine 
of 
economic 
growth, 
a 
key 
to 
raising 
living 
standards 
Â 
indeed, 
a 
key 
to 
raising 
nations 
and 
regions 
out 
of 
poverty. 


ÂOur 
Administration 
firmly 
believes 
that 
all 
responsible 
nations 
should 
have 
access 
to 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
the 
atom. 


ÂTo 
ensure 
this 
access, 
while 
minimizing 
the 
threat 
of 
proliferation, 
our 
nations 
must 
work 
together 
to 
phase 
out 
the 
use 
of 
highly 
enriched 
uranium 
in 
commercial 
reactors. 
But 
while 
doing 
so, 
we 
must 
also 
create 
an 
environment 
in 
which 
nations 
are 
confident 
in 
the 
availability 
of 
nuclear 
fuel. 


ÂThat 
is 
why 
I 
am 
pleased 
to 
announce 
that 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy 
will 
reserve 
up 
to 
17 
metric 
tones 
of 
highly 
enriched 
uranium 
for 
an 
IAEA 
verifiable 
assured 
supply 
arrangement. 
Through 
this 
arrangement, 
I 
believe 
we 
can 
advance 
our 
common 
goals 
of 
fighting 
proliferation 
while 
expending 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
around 
the 
globe. 


ÂThe 
wide 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
can 
only 
come 
if 
the 
world 
fully 
embraces 
this 
vision. 


ÂThis 
is 
why 
the 
mission 
of 
the 
IAEA 
is 
such 
a 
worthy 
one. 


ÂOur 
Government 
applauds 
the 
efforts 
and 
contributions 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Â 
and 
pledges 
to 
help 
ensure 
that 
this 
important 
body 
has 
the 
tools 
to 
continue 
this 
critical 
mission. 


ÂLadies 
and 
gentlemen, 
again, 
please 
accept 
my 
sincere 
apologies 
for 
not 
joining 
you 
today. 
We 
have 
important 
work 
to 
do 
and 
important 
challenges 
to 
address. 
I 
wish 
you 
a 
successful 
and 
productive 
conference.Â 


129. 
Mr. 
Bodman 
had, 
in 
his 
message, 
underlined 
how 
important 
nuclear 
power 
was 
going 
to 
be 
in 
the 
21st 
century. 
With 
estimates 
indicating 
that 
world 
net 
electricity 
demand 
would 
almost 
double 
during 
the 
next 
two 
decades, 
more 
than 
half 
of 
the 
growth 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
worldÂs 
emerging 
economies, 
his 
Government 
believed 
that 
nuclear 
power 
would 
Â 
and 
must 
Â 
play 
a 
greater 
role 
in 
meeting 
the 
global 
demand 
for 
clean, 
affordable, 
safe 
and 
reliable 
energy. 
130. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
dramatic 
steps 
were 
being 
taken 
to 
prepare 
for 
an 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
Energy 
Policy 
Act, 
signed 
by 
President 
Bush 
in 
August 
2005, 
would 
facilitate 
the 
first 
significant 
addition 
to 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
power 
capacity 
in 
decades. 
By 
streamlining 
licensing 
processes 
and 
creating 
incentives 
for 
industry, 
the 
United 
States 
aimed 
to 
have 
new, 
advanced 
LWRs 
in 
operation 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
decade. 
Also, 
through 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum 
it 
was 
endeavouring 
to 
accelerate 
the 
development 
of 
advanced 
nuclear 
energy 
systems 
which 
would 
offer 
significant 
improvements 
in 
energy 
efficiency, 
sustainability, 
safety 
and 
proliferation 
resistance 
and 
provide 
tangible 
benefits 
to 
the 
developing 
world. 
131. 
The 
United 
States 
was 
committed 
to 
helping 
responsible 
governments 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes. 
It 
had 
nuclear 
cooperation 
agreements 
with 

GC(49)/OR.1

some 
45 
countries, 
and 
it 
was 
the 
largest 
contributor 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
having 
provided 
$130 
million 
since 
2000 
for 
projects 
in 
over 
100 
Member 
States. 


132. 
The 
groundwork 
had 
to 
be 
laid 
for 
an 
orderly, 
secure 
and 
safe 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
States 
needed 
infrastructures 
for 
operating 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
a 
way 
that 
minimized 
the 
risks 
of 
accidents, 
of 
sabotage 
and 
nuclear 
material 
diversion 
by 
terrorists, 
and 
of 
State-sponsored 
proliferation. 
133. 
It 
was 
necessary 
to 
establish 
a 
dialogue 
among 
States 
both 
advanced 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
and 
wishing 
to 
launch 
nuclear 
power 
programmes 
about 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
nuclear 
power 
development. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
advancing 
such 
a 
dialogue, 
the 
United 
States 
would 
be 
joining 
INPRO. 
Also, 
the 
United 
States 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Commission 
was 
inviting 
countries 
to 
join 
in 
a 
multinational 
design 
approval 
programme 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
facilitating 
their 
licensing 
processes. 
134. 
Earlier 
in 
the 
year, 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
India 
had 
issued 
a 
joint 
statement 
in 
recognition 
of 
the 
important 
contribution 
which 
a 
closer 
relationship 
between 
two 
great 
democracies 
could 
make 
to 
global 
stability, 
democracy, 
prosperity 
and 
peace. 
All 
stood 
to 
benefit 
from 
increased 
cooperation 
with 
IndiaÂs 
civil 
nuclear 
community, 
for 
India 
had 
developed 
an 
advanced 
nuclear 
power 
programme 
from 
which 
all 
could 
probably 
learn. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
bringing 
India 
into 
the 
mainstream 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
community 
would 
strengthen 
the 
overall 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
135. 
As 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
grew, 
Member 
States 
needed 
to 
focus 
increasingly 
on 
the 
second 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Agency 
Â 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
technologies, 
materials 
and 
know-how 
that 
might 
be 
used 
by 
terrorists. 
Promotion 
and 
prevention 
were 
intertwined 
Â 
one 
could 
not 
have 
the 
first 
without 
the 
second. 
A 
special 
onus 
lay 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
which 
had 
worked 
well 
for 
50 
years 
but 
in 
some 
respects 
not 
well 
enough, 
as 
the 
cases 
of 
the 
DPRK, 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
A.Q. 
Khan 
network 
had 
shown. 
Their 
pernicious 
and 
defiant 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
Â 
in 
direct 
violation 
of 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
Â 
posed 
the 
greatest 
challenge 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
NPT. 
136. 
As 
regard 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
the 
BoardÂs 
24 
September 
finding 
of 
non-compliance 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
actions 
of 
its 
leadership 
were 
isolating 
a 
great 
country 
from 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
finding 
sent 
a 
clear 
message 
that 
the 
onus 
was 
on 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
to 
come 
into 
compliance 
with 
its 
international 
obligations 
and 
take 
the 
steps 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
give 
the 
world 
confidence 
that 
its 
nuclear 
programmes 
were 
truly 
peaceful. 
The 
United 
States 
was 
backing 
the 
efforts 
of 
its 
European 
Union 
partners 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
long-term 
agreement 
with 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
As 
President 
Bush 
had 
stated 
on 
14 
September, 
it 
respected 
the 
desire 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
civil 
purposes; 
it 
merely 
wanted 
that 
country 
to 
forgo 
the 
development 
of 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
capabilities. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
such 
capabilities 
were 
neither 
necessary 
Â 
given 
that 
countryÂs 
massive 
oil 
and 
gas 
reserves 
Â 
nor 
acceptable 
Â 
given 
its 
long 
record 
of 
safeguards 
violations. 
Its 
leaders 
should 
take 
immediate 
steps 
to 
re-suspend 
all 
enrichment-related 
activities, 
including 
uranium 
conversion, 
and 
return 
to 
negotiations 
with 
the 
EU-3. 
Also, 
they 
should 
cooperate 
proactively 
and 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency. 
137. 
The 
United 
States 
hoped 
that, 
building 
on 
the 
resolution 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
24 
September, 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
call 
on 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
to 
be 
fully 
cooperative 
and 
transparent 
and 
to 
choose 
a 
course 
of 
negotiation 
and 
confidence-building 
rather 
than 
one 
of 
continued 
confrontation 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
138. 
There 
was 
a 
need 
for 
action 
now 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
harder 
for 
terrorists 
and 
proliferators 
to 
turn 
the 
peaceful 
fruits 
of 
Member 
StatesÂ 
labours 
into 
nuclear 
or 
radiological 
weapons. 
One 
goal 
of 
the 
nuclear 
security 
agenda 
was 
to 
strengthen 
controls 
on 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
technology, 
and 
his

country 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
for 
agreement 
on 
that 
point 
in 
the 
Nuclear 
Suppliers 
Group. 
Also, 
it 
would 
endeavour 
to 
ensure 
that 
States 
renouncing 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
had 
reliable 
access 
to 
fuel 
for 
civil 
nuclear 
power 
reactors. 
It 
was 
working 
with 
the 
major 
suppliers 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
back-up 
supply 
mechanism 
for 
States 
that 
abstained 
from 
investing 
in 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
capabilities, 
and 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy 
had 
announced 
that 
it 
would 
reserve 
up 
to 
17 
metric 
tons 
of 
HEU 
for 
such 
a 
mechanism. 
The 
United 
States 
would 
like 
to 
see 
other 
nations 
to 
joining 
in 
the 
initiative. 


139. 
Another 
goal 
of 
the 
nuclear 
security 
agenda 
was 
to 
improve 
controls 
on 
materials 
of 
greatest 
interest 
to 
terrorists 
and 
proliferators. 
The 
partnership 
between 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Russia 
for 
improving 
such 
controls 
was 
strong. 
Earlier 
that 
year, 
in 
Bratislava, 
Presidents 
Bush 
and 
Putin 
had 
agreed 
to 
accelerate 
security 
upgrades 
at 
Russian 
sites 
holding 
weapons-usable 
materials 
and 
warheads, 
and 
progress 
was 
being 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
surplus 
stocks 
of 
HEU 
and 
military 
plutonium. 
Also, 
the 
United 
States 
was 
consulting 
with 
governments 
around 
the 
world 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
security 
of 
fissile 
materials 
was 
accorded 
the 
highest 
priority. 
140. 
The 
recent 
adoption 
of 
an 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
had 
been 
an 
important 
step. 
His 
Government 
hoped 
that 
all 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
would 
ratify 
the 
amendment 
soon 
and 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
purposes 
pending 
its 
entry 
into 
force. 
141. 
A 
further 
goal 
of 
the 
nuclear 
security 
agenda 
was 
to 
phase 
out 
the 
commercial 
use 
of 
HEU. 
Already 
considerable 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
Â 
nearly 
40 
research 
reactors 
supplied 
by 
the 
United 
States 
had 
been 
converted 
from 
the 
use 
of 
HEU 
to 
that 
of 
a 
low-enriched 
form 
of 
fuel 
that 
could 
not 
be 
used 
in 
weapons, 
and 
a 
similar 
initiative 
relating 
to 
research 
reactors 
supplied 
by 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
had 
been 
launched. 
The 
United 
States, 
which 
was 
prepared 
to 
join 
in 
establishing 
international 
guidelines 
for 
the 
management 
of 
HEU, 
believed 
that 
such 
guidelines 
should 
be 
followed 
by 
all 
HEU 
users 
and 
the 
Agency, 
should 
make 
accounting 
for 
and 
reporting 
on 
national 
stocks 
of 
civilian 
HEU 
a 
requirement, 
should 
call 
for 
strict 
standards 
of 
physical 
protection, 
should 
require 
that 
all 
reactors 
still 
using 
HEU 
be 
converted 
Â 
where 
feasible 
Â 
to 
the 
use 
of 
LEU, 
and 
should 
require 
that 
all 
new 
civilian 
research 
reactors 
be 
designed 
to 
use 
only 
LEU. 
His 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
consulting 
with 
other 
Member 
States 
on 
that 
issue. 
142. 
A 
final 
goal 
of 
the 
nuclear 
security 
agenda 
was 
the 
full 
exercise 
by 
States 
of 
their 
responsibility 
to 
regulate 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
under 
their 
jurisdiction. 
That 
was 
one 
purpose 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540, 
which 
required 
States 
to 
introduce 
strict 
controls 
and 
to 
secure 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
weapons-usable 
nuclear 
materials. 
Universal 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
was 
an 
immediate 
priority. 
143. 
The 
agenda 
was 
ambitious, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
accomplished 
only 
if 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Member 
States 
acted 
with 
unity 
of 
purpose. 
The 
alternative 
Â 
a 
global 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
weapons-usable 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
critical 
technologies 
Â 
was 
something 
which 
no 
Member 
State 
should 
tolerate 
and 
which 
all 
must 
work 
tirelessly 
to 
avoid. 
Historians 
would 
in 
due 
course 
judge 
whether 
enough 
had 
been 
done 
by 
the 
present 
generation 
to 
ensure 
a 
safe 
and 
secure 
nuclear 
future, 
but 
he 
was 
confident 
that, 
if 
all 
Member 
States 
worked 
together 
and 
redoubled 
their 
commitment 
to 
what 
was 
a 
necessary 
task, 
their 
judgement 
would 
be 
a 
favourable 
one. 
144. 
Mr. 
OH 
Myung 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
said 
that 
the 
worldÂs 
nuclear 
community 
was 
responsible 
for 
promoting 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
global 
prosperity 
and 
that 
his 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
that 
task. 
145. 
In 
fulfilling 
its 
mission, 
the 
Agency 
had 
become 
the 
worldÂs 
foremost 
organization 
for 
promoting 
international 
scientific 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
the 
nuclear 
sector, 
in 
no 
small 
part

thanks 
to 
the 
dedication 
of 
its 
present 
Director 
General, 
who 
was 
to 
be 
congratulated 
on 
his 
reappointment. 


146. 
Nuclear 
power 
had 
emerged 
as 
a 
pivotal 
resource 
in 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
endeavours 
to 
prevent 
global 
warming 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
ensure 
stable 
energy 
supplies. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency, 
whose 
support 
for 
the 
development 
of 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
and 
of 
nuclear 
hydrogen 
production 
technology 
was 
greatly 
appreciated, 
would 
continue 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
interested 
in 
making 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
147. 
His 
country, 
which 
believed 
that 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
depended 
on 
transparent 
participation 
in 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
that 
regime 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
preserving 
its 
integrity. 
It 
was 
supporting 
the 
current 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
advisory 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
by 
the 
Board. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
growing 
adherence 
to 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol, 
which 
should 
in 
its 
view 
be 
universalized 
as 
an 
Agency 
safeguards 
standard. 
148. 
Following 
the 
disclosures 
in 
2004 
regarding 
nuclear 
materials 
experiments 
which 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
his 
country, 
its 
SSAC 
had 
been 
strengthened 
and 
its 
relevant 
legislation 
overhauled. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
support 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
connection, 
including 
the 
International 
SSAC 
Advisory 
Service 
mission 
to 
Seoul 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
July 
2005. 
149. 
The 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
had 
ended 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
with 
a 
joint 
statement 
in 
which 
all 
parties 
had 
affirmed 
that 
the 
DPRK 
was 
committed 
to 
abandoning 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
to 
returning 
at 
an 
early 
date 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
welcomed 
the 
commitments 
made 
by 
the 
DPRK 
and 
hoped 
that 
all 
the 
parties 
would 
implement 
the 
agreed 
measures 
referred 
to 
in 
the 
joint 
statement, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
ultimate 
goal 
Â 
the 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
150. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
plan 
for 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regime 
and 
hoped 
that 
all 
Member 
States 
would 
support 
the 
Agency 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
implement 
it 
expeditiously. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
unanimous 
agreement 
on 
safety 
measures 
achieved 
at 
the 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
improvements 
in 
the 
efficacy, 
transparency 
and 
consistency 
of 
the 
review 
meeting 
process. 
151. 
In 
his 
countryÂs 
view, 
the 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
was 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
for 
improving 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
Asia 
as 
it 
allowed 
Member 
States 
in 
that 
region 
to 
share 
technical 
knowledge 
and 
experience. 
His 
country 
would 
like 
to 
see 
similar 
networks 
established 
in 
other 
regions 
and 
cooperation 
between 
the 
various 
networks. 
152. 
In 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
there 
were 
currently 
20 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
with 
a 
total 
generating 
capacity 
of 
17 
000 
MW(e). 
His 
country, 
whose 
first 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
become 
operational 
in 
1978, 
was 
now 
ranked 
sixth 
globally 
in 
terms 
of 
nuclear 
power 
generating 
capacity. 
Nuclear 
power 
plants 
were 
providing 
40% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
electricity, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
energy 
supply 
stability. 
Two 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
were 
currently 
under 
construction, 
and 
they 
were 
due 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
2010 
and 
2011. 
153. 
The 
desalination 
of 
seawater 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
promising 
solutions 
for 
the 
problem 
of 
water 
scarcity, 
and 
his 
country 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
study 
which 
the 
Agency 
had 
conducted 
on 
its 
cost-effectiveness. 
It 
would 
like 
to 
see 
Member 
States 
sharing 
information 
about 
multipurpose 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
reactors 
through 
an 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
project.

The 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
which 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
regional 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
was 
pleased 
to 
be 
hosting 
the 
RCA 
Regional 
Office, 
which 
had 
gone 
into 
full 
operation 
in 
2005 
after 
a 
three-year 
trial 
period. 
It 
had 
contributed 
$700 
000 
in 
support 
of 
the 
RCA 
Regional 
OfficeÂs 
activities, 
and 
it 
was 
planning 
to 
direct 
more 
resources 
into 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
programmes 
and 
the 
education 
of 
nuclear 
professionals. 
155. 
An 
enlargement 
of 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
was 
long 
overdue, 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute 
which 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
unanimously 
adopted 
in 
1999. 
A 
more 
democratic 
and 
more 
representative 
Board 
would 
significantly 
increase 
the 
AgencyÂs 
effectiveness. 
All 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
ratified 
the 
amendment 
should 
ratify 
it 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
156. 
With 
soaring 
oil 
prices, 
an 
increasing 
demand 
for 
energy 
and 
escalating 
concerns 
about 
the 
environment, 
nuclear 
power 
was 
becoming 
ever 
more 
important. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
was 
prepared 
to 
share 
its 
expertise 
and 
experience 
with 
other 
Member 
States. 
It 
had 
made 
distinctive 
contributions 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field, 
and 
it 
would 
stand 
with 
its 
friends 
and 
partners 
in 
facing 
the 
challenges 
that 
lay 
ahead. 
157. 
Mr. 
SHICHIJO 
(Japan) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
non-proliferation 
field 
and 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
important 
and, 
in 
that 
context, 
Japan 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
contribution 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Agency 
during 
the 
past 
eight 
years 
and 
welcomed 
his 
appointment 
for 
a 
further 
term 
in 
office. 
158. 
The 
year 
2005 
marked 
the 
60th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
first 
use 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
the 
history 
of 
mankind. 
However, 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
not 
just 
a 
thing 
of 
the 
past. 
The 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
currently 
facing 
a 
number 
of 
serious 
challenges. 
The 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
had 
become 
still 
more 
critical, 
clandestine 
networks 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
weapons 
materials 
had 
come 
to 
light, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
materials 
by 
non-State 
actors 
such 
as 
terrorists 
had 
grown. 
Strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
therefore 
one 
of 
the 
most 
urgent 
tasks 
facing 
the 
international 
community. 
One 
encouraging 
thought 
in 
that 
context 
was 
that 
no 
country 
had 
questioned 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
May, 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
although 
the 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
adopt 
a 
consensus 
document 
on 
substantive 
issues. 
It 
was 
now 
up 
to 
the 
international 
community 
to 
firmly 
renew 
its 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
For 
its 
part, 
Japan, 
the 
only 
country 
to 
have 
suffered 
the 
tragedy 
of 
atomic 
bombings, 
would 
never 
abandon 
its 
Âthree 
non-nuclear 
principlesÂ 
of 
Ânot 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons, 
not 
producing 
them 
and 
not 
permitting 
their 
introduction 
into 
JapanÂ. 
On 
the 
60th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
atomic 
bombings, 
it 
was 
determined 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
159. 
In 
JapanÂs 
view, 
it 
was 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
entire 
international 
community 
to 
close 
any 
loopholes 
in 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Japan 
was 
therefore 
participating 
in 
the 
current 
discussions 
about 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
It 
believed, 
however, 
that 
in 
those 
discussions 
careful 
consideration 
should 
be 
given 
to 
how 
such 
approaches 
could 
strengthen 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
to 
whether 
they 
might 
not 
unduly 
affect 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
which 
had 
earned 
the 
trust 
of 
the 
international 
community 
by 
conscientiously 
fulfilling 
their 
NPT 
obligations 
and 
being 
very 
transparent 
in 
their 
nuclear 
activities. 
160. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system, 
States 
should 
conclude 
additional 
protocols 
to 
their 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Japan 
was 
conducting 
outreach 
activities 
in 
order 
to 
encourage 
other 
States 
to 
conclude 
additional 
protocols, 
notably 
the 
Asian 
Senior-level 
Talks 

GC(49)/OR.1 
26 
September

on 
Non-proliferation 
(ASTOP). 
Also, 
Japanese 
experts 
would 
be 
participating 
in 
a 
seminar 
to 
promote 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
due 
to 
be 
held 
in 
Australia 
in 
October 
2005. 


161. 
Additional 
protocols 
had 
now 
been 
brought 
into 
force 
by 
half 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Member 
States. 
That 
indicated 
an 
acceleration 
of 
the 
universalization 
process, 
but 
Japan 
was 
still 
urging 
all 
those 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
conclude 
one 
soon. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
recently 
established 
by 
the 
Board. 
162. 
Since 
September 
2004, 
integrated 
safeguards 
were 
being 
implemented 
in 
Japan, 
which 
intended 
to 
continue 
cooperating 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
thereby 
set 
an 
example 
for 
other 
States. 
In 
JapanÂs 
view, 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
made 
for 
the 
efficient 
use 
of 
scarce 
Agency 
resources, 
and 
Japan 
hoped 
that 
integrated 
safeguards 
would 
come 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
more 
States 
with 
a 
good 
safeguards 
track 
record. 
163. 
Any 
State 
wishing 
to 
exercise 
its 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
should 
be 
completely 
transparent 
in 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
conscientiously 
fulfil 
its 
safeguards 
obligations 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
However, 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
DPRK, 
conducted 
without 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards, 
posed 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
164. 
The 
international 
community 
as 
a 
whole 
should 
resolve 
to 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
soon 
and 
in 
a 
peaceful 
manner. 
Japan 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that, 
in 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
taking 
place 
in 
Beijing, 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
a 
joint 
statement 
indicating 
what 
the 
final 
goal 
of 
the 
talks 
was 
to 
be 
and 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
abandoning 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes. 
165. 
That 
agreement 
was 
the 
first 
step 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue, 
and 
the 
six 
parties 
should 
follow 
up 
on 
it 
promptly 
with 
a 
constructive 
dialogue 
on 
particular 
questions 
such 
as 
dismantling 
procedures 
and 
verification 
measures. 
166. 
As 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue, 
in 
its 
resolution 
GOV/2005/77 
of 
24 
September 
2005 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
sent 
a 
clear 
message 
from 
the 
international 
community 
to 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
calling 
on 
it 
to 
Â 
inter 
alia 
Â 
renew 
the 
suspension 
of 
all 
its 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
Japan, 
which 
considered 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Board 
resolution 
to 
be 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
resolving 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
through 
continued 
negotiations, 
hoped 
that 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
would 
take 
that 
resolution 
and 
all 
other 
relevant 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
seriously 
and 
resume 
negotiations 
with 
the 
EU-3. 
167. 
Since 
the 
tragic 
events 
of 
11 
September 
2001 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
had 
become 
an 
important 
issue, 
which 
the 
international 
community 
must 
tackle 
through 
close 
cooperation. 
For 
its 
part, 
Japan 
had 
recently 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
adopted 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
in 
April 
2005, 
and 
it 
welcomed 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
adopted 
by 
a 
diplomatic 
conference 
in 
July 
2005. 
It 
hoped 
that 
both 
would 
enter 
into 
force 
soon. 
168. 
Japan, 
which 
would 
continue 
contributing 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
planned 
to 
host 
an 
Agency 
seminar 
in 
2006 
on 
improving 
nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
region. 
169. 
Given 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
Japan 
would 
like 
to 
see 
all 
States 
committing 
themselves 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources.

170. 
Non-power 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
were 
important 
for 
socio-economic 
development, 
and 
Japan 
therefore 
supported 
the 
promotion 
of 
those 
applications 
through 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
few 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
consistently 
paid 
its 
full 
TCF 
target 
share, 
and 
it 
would 
like 
to 
see 
more 
other 
Member 
States 
paying 
their 
full 
shares. 
It 
would 
also 
like 
to 
see 
all 
recipient 
countries 
fulfilling 
their 
responsibilities 
vis-Ã -vis 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
171. 
Japan, 
which 
had 
been 
providing 
considerable 
support 
for 
regional 
activities 
conducted 
within 
the 
RCA 
framework, 
would 
be 
hosting 
a 
ministerial-level 
meeting 
of 
the 
Forum 
for 
Nuclear 
Cooperation 
in 
Asia 
in 
December 
2005. 
172. 
Japan, 
which 
was 
continuing 
to 
develop 
its 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
was 
doing 
so 
with 
a 
high 
degree 
of 
transparency. 
It 
was 
currently 
preparing 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
policy 
framework 
describing 
its 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
development 
for 
the 
next 
ten 
years. 
173. 
Since 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
2004 
session, 
Japan 
had 
taken 
several 
important 
steps 
in 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
development 
area. 
For 
example, 
pre-commissioning 
testing 
with 
uranium 
had 
begun 
at 
the 
Rokkasho 
reprocessing 
facility 
and 
improvement 
work 
had 
begun 
at 
the 
Monju 
fast 
breeder 
reactor. 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
develop 
its 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
with 
safety 
as 
the 
major 
consideration. 
174. 
The 
ITER 
project 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
the 
past 
year, 
with 
Japan 
becoming 
what 
might 
be 
called 
the 
Âsub-host 
countryÂ, 
in 
which 
capacity 
it 
would 
be 
an 
important 
centre 
for 
nuclear 
fusion 
research. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
closely 
with 
the 
other 
ITER 
project 
participants. 
175. 
Japan, 
which 
would 
do 
its 
best 
to 
continue 
improving 
its 
nuclear 
safety 
record, 
considered 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
to 
be 
very 
important. 
It 
would 
therefore 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
field. 
176. 
The 
international 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials 
was 
based 
on 
the 
right 
of 
freedom 
of 
navigation 
established 
by 
international 
law. 
In 
engaging 
in 
such 
transport, 
Japan 
was 
applying 
the 
strictest 
safety 
measures 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
set 
by 
the 
relevant 
international 
organizations 
and 
had 
an 
excellent 
track 
record 
going 
back 
30 
years. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
in 
order 
to 
build 
mutual 
confidence, 
it 
was 
prepared 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
dialogue 
between 
shipping 
States 
and 
coastal 
States. 
Also, 
it 
would 
later 
in 
the 
year 
be 
hosting 
a 
TranSAS 
team, 
which 
would 
evaluate 
its 
regulatory 
practices 
relating 
to 
safety 
in 
the 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
177. 
His 
country, 
which 
believed 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
provided 
with 
the 
financial 
resources 
necessary 
for 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
tasks 
expected 
of 
it, 
had 
supported 
the 
regular 
budget 
proposals 
for 
2006, 
including 
the 
proposed 
safeguards 
budget 
increase. 
However, 
it 
would 
like 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
make 
budget 
management 
more 
efficient 
through 
project 
prioritization 
and 
cost 
reductions. 
It 
would 
also 
like 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
cooperate 
with 
it 
in 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
Japanese 
staff 
serving 
the 
Agency. 
178. 
The 
Agency 
was 
being 
required 
to 
tackle 
more 
and 
more 
important 
issues. 
In 
tackling 
them, 
the 
Agency 
could 
count 
on 
JapanÂs 
continuing 
full 
support. 
179. 
Mr. 
AGHAZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
it 
was, 
in 
his 
countryÂs 
view, 
important 
to 
have 
an 
overall 
assessment 
of 
what 
the 
Agency 
stood 
for 
and 
of 
whether 
its 
performance 
matched 
its 
original 
objectives 
in 
a 
reasonably 
balanced 
manner. 
180. 
It 
was 
an 
established 
position 
of 
the 
NPT 
membership 
that 
the 
NPT 
rested 
on 
three 
pillars 
Â 
disarmament, 
non-proliferation 
and 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
was 
limited 
to 
the 
latter 
two 
Â 
the 
Agency 
should 
serve 
as 
provider, 
or 
facilitator 
of 
the 
provision 
of, 
nuclear 
material

and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
uses 
while 
ensuring 
that 
they 
were 
not 
diverted 
to 
military 
purposes. 
However, 
the 
ability 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
fulfil 
its 
role 
with 
regard 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
had 
been 
minimized 
over 
the 
years 
as 
a 
result 
of 
severe 
restrictions 
applied 
by 
technology 
holders 
through 
export 
controls. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
its 
monitoring 
functions 
had 
expanded 
systematically, 
to 
the 
point 
where 
the 
Agency 
was 
now 
being 
referred 
to 
as 
the 
ÂUnited 
Nations 
nuclear 
watchdogÂ, 
indicating 
a 
total 
lack 
of 
recognition 
of 
its 
obligations 
towards 
States 
with 
regard 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities. 


181. 
Even 
in 
the 
area 
of 
safeguards, 
there 
was 
scepticism 
about 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
NPT 
membership 
had 
agreed 
that 
the 
application 
of 
additional 
protocols 
provided 
Âcredible 
assurancesÂ 
about 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
programmes, 
but 
their 
applicability 
in 
specific 
situations 
was 
questioned. 
Iran 
represented 
a 
clear 
example. 
182. 
Over 
the 
years, 
Iran 
had 
been 
deprived 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
material, 
equipment 
and 
technology. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
prevented, 
throughout 
that 
time, 
from 
fulfilling 
its 
obligation 
to 
provide 
such 
access. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
unlawful, 
arbitrary 
and 
full-scale 
sanctions, 
some 
failures 
had 
been 
unavoidable 
in 
order 
to 
avert 
the 
total 
collapse 
of 
IranÂs 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities. 
183. 
Iran 
had 
embarked 
on 
remedying 
those 
failures 
through, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
rigorous 
and 
sustained 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocol 
measures. 
Now 
that 
matters 
were 
nearing 
total 
resolution, 
however, 
it 
was 
being 
claimed 
that 
the 
additional 
protocol 
did 
not 
provide 
the 
Agency 
with 
sufficient 
authority 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
conclusion. 
That 
situation 
called 
into 
question 
the 
validity 
and 
viability 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
a 
provider, 
facilitator 
and 
observer 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nuclear 
field. 
184. 
The 
resolution 
passed 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
on 
24 
September 
2005 
demonstrated 
how 
issues 
could 
reach 
the 
boundaries 
of 
absurdity 
when 
politics 
overwhelmed 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency. 
That 
resolution 
was 
based 
on 
an 
invalid 
legal 
precept, 
unjustified 
technical 
grounds 
and 
a 
misguided 
political 
forecast. 
185. 
The 
Statute 
and 
IranÂs 
safeguards 
agreement 
contained 
very 
restricted 
provisions 
regarding 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
CouncilÂs 
involvement, 
which 
was 
envisaged 
only 
in 
rare 
cases. 
A 
correct 
and 
objective 
reading 
of 
those 
documents 
left 
no 
opening 
for 
referral 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Iran. 
186. 
As 
stipulated 
in 
Article 
19 
of 
IranÂs 
safeguards 
agreement, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
would 
be 
empowered 
to 
consider 
engaging 
the 
Security 
Council 
only 
if 
the 
Agency 
established 
that 
it 
was 
unable 
to 
verify 
that 
no 
diversion 
for 
military 
purposes 
had 
occurred 
in 
Iran. 
Since 
the 
Agency 
had 
concluded, 
more 
than 
once, 
that 
no 
evidence 
of 
such 
diversion 
existed, 
the 
Board 
was 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
decide 
to 
report 
the 
matter 
to 
the 
Security 
Council. 
187. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
evaluation, 
as 
reported 
by 
the 
Director 
General, 
confirmed 
that: 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
had 
been 
fully 
resolved, 
and 
the 
Esfahan 
uranium 
conversion 
facility, 
the 
Arak 
heavy 
water 
plant, 
and 
fuel 
fabrication 
and 
laser 
enrichment 
activities 
were 
therefore 
now 
subject 
to 
routine 
safeguards; 
the 
HEU 
issue 
Â 
the 
only 
issue 
with 
the 
potential 
to 
raise 
proliferation 
concerns 
Â 
had 
been 
resolved, 
as 
it 
had 
been 
established 
that 
the 
HEU 
particles 
which 
had 
been 
detected 
were 
the 
result 
of 
contamination; 
and 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
on 
the 
few 
remaining 
questions, 
the 
resolution 
of 
which 
did 
not 
hinge 
on 
the 
cooperation 
of 
Iran 
alone 
but 
also 
on 
that 
of 
certain 
European 
States 
where 
individuals 
involved 
in 
clandestine 
network 
activities 
were 
either 
in 
custody 
or 
under 
surveillance. 
188. 
Given 
that 
technical 
situation, 
there 
was 
no 
objective 
reason 
for 
being 
alarmed 
and 
involving 
the 
Security 
Council, 
particularly 
as 
matters 
were 
approaching 
a 
final 
settlement 
and 
credible 
assurances 
as 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
material 
and 
activities 
were 
imminent. 
In 
fact, 
the 
only 
cause 
for 
alarm 
was 
the 
political 
motivation 
behind 
what 
had 
been 
taking 
place 
in 
the 
Board.

189. 
What 
was 
the 
reason 
for 
the 
strong 
urge 
to 
resort 
to 
the 
Security 
Council? 
By 
what 
magical 
means 
could 
the 
Security 
Council 
bring 
about 
a 
settlement? 
Would 
involving 
the 
Security 
Council 
do 
anything 
other 
than 
exacerbate 
an 
already 
fragile 
political 
environment, 
intensify 
an 
unnecessary 
impasse 
and 
provoke 
an 
unwanted 
crisis? 
The 
submission 
of 
a 
report 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
would 
undoubtedly 
initiate 
a 
chain 
of 
actions 
and 
reactions 
that 
would 
breed 
tension 
and 
add 
volatility 
to 
the 
already 
vulnerable 
political 
situation 
in 
the 
region. 
190. 
With 
the 
Tehran 
Declaration 
and 
the 
ensuing 
Paris 
Agreement, 
Iran 
had 
provided 
its 
European 
interlocutors 
with 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
to 
move 
Â 
over 
a 
two-year 
period 
Â 
towards 
a 
mutually 
acceptable 
agreement. 
The 
European 
proposal, 
however, 
explicitly 
betraying 
IranÂs 
inalienable 
right 
under 
the 
NPT, 
had 
in 
effect 
nullified 
the 
Paris 
Agreement. 
Iran 
had 
therefore 
no 
longer 
been 
bound 
by 
its 
provisions, 
including 
those 
that 
pertained 
to 
the 
Esfahan 
uranium 
conversion 
facility. 
Operations 
there 
had 
consequently 
been 
resumed, 
but 
under 
full 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
with 
monitoring 
of 
the 
sealed 
products. 
It 
made 
no 
sense 
to 
claim 
concern 
about 
Â 
and 
to 
call 
for 
the 
suspension 
of 
Â 
an 
activity 
that 
was 
subject 
to 
routine 
inspection 
by 
the 
Agency. 
191. 
The 
EU-3Âs 
action 
involving 
the 
Security 
Council 
negated 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Tehran 
Declaration, 
the 
quid 
pro 
quo 
constituting 
the 
basis 
of 
which 
was 
therefore 
no 
longer 
in 
existence. 
That 
meant 
that 
Iran 
had 
no 
obligation 
to 
continue 
with 
the 
measures 
voluntarily 
implemented 
pursuant 
to 
the 
agreements 
arrived 
at 
in 
Tehran. 
192. 
Those 
countries 
which 
had 
vigorously 
pressed 
for 
a 
decision 
in 
the 
Board 
Â 
and 
had 
voted 
en 
bloc 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
resolution 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
24 
September 
Â 
were 
essentially 
the 
western 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
and 
their 
NATO 
allies, 
which 
relied 
on 
nuclear 
weapons 
for 
their 
security. 
Those 
countries 
which 
had 
gone 
along 
with 
them 
had 
included 
a 
recent 
violator 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
a 
country 
under 
the 
nuclear 
umbrella 
which 
had 
massive 
stocks 
of 
enriched 
uranium 
and 
plutonium. 
Those 
countries 
which 
had 
not 
joined 
in 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
were 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
which 
had 
been 
forthcoming 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
with 
impeccable 
non-proliferation 
records. 
The 
political 
wrangling 
was 
bound 
to 
intensify 
and 
the 
pressures 
were 
bound 
to 
increase 
in 
the 
following 
weeks 
and 
months, 
but 
the 
conclusion 
would 
remain 
the 
same: 
the 
concerns 
expressed 
over 
IranÂs 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programme 
were 
highly 
exaggerated 
and 
politically 
motivated. 
193. 
The 
proposal 
for 
phased 
action 
put 
forward 
by 
Iran 
remained 
on 
the 
table. 
Also, 
IranÂs 
President 
had 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
made 
a 
generous 
proposal 
regarding 
the 
opening-up 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
to 
participation 
by 
public 
and 
private 
companies 
from 
other 
countries 
Â 
a 
move 
that 
would 
offer 
the 
best 
possible 
guarantee 
against 
diversion. 
The 
proposal 
was 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle, 
which 
had 
been 
mandated 
to 
come 
up 
with 
feasible 
ways 
of 
maintaining 
nuclear 
fuel 
production 
and 
supplies 
while 
averting 
proliferation 
concerns. 
194. 
Iran 
had 
done 
enough 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
settlement, 
but 
its 
confidence 
in 
the 
good 
will 
and 
good 
faith 
of 
its 
counterparts 
had 
been 
shattered. 
It 
had 
already 
demonstrated 
its 
determination 
to 
arrive 
at 
an 
agreement, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
yet 
convinced 
of 
the 
EU-3Âs 
intention 
to 
reverse 
the 
dangerous 
trend 
towards 
confrontation 
or 
of 
the 
EU-3Âs 
wish 
to 
work, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
fully 
recognized 
inalienable 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
towards 
an 
arrangement 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
programme. 
Only 
when 
it 
was 
convinced 
would 
crisis 
and 
confrontation 
give 
way 
to 
understanding 
and 
conciliation.

Â 
Restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
195. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
Statement 
of 
Financial 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Agency 
as 
at 
23 
September 
2005 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/INF/11, 
which 
included 
a 
table 
indicating 
those 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
lost 
their 
voting 
rights 
by 
virtue 
of 
the 
application 
of 
Article 
XIX.A 
of 
the 
Statute. 
196. 
He 
said 
that 
a 
communication 
had 
been 
received 
from 
Iraq, 
which 
was 
one 
of 
those 
States 
to 
which 
Article 
XIX.A 
of 
the 
Statute 
applied, 
requesting 
that 
its 
voting 
rights 
be 
restored. 
The 
communication 
was 
contained 
in 
the 
document 
GC(49)/INF/13. 
197. 
He 
proposed 
that, 
in 
accordance 
with 
past 
practice, 
the 
request 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
General 
Committee 
for 
initial 
consideration. 
198. 
The 
PresidentÂs 
proposal 
was 
accepted.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(continued) 
(GC(49)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
WINKLER 
(Austria) 
said 
that 
the 
recent 
serious 
challenges 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
highlighted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
role 
in 
verifying 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
NPT 
obligations. 
The 
Agency 
continued 
to 
be 
in 
the 
international 
limelight 
and 
bore 
a 
heavy 
responsibility 
for 
maintaining 
international 
stability 
and 
security. 
Austria 
was 
proud 
to 
host 
such 
an 
eminent 
organization. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
standing 
was 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
leadership 
of 
its 
Director 
General, 
Dr. 
ElBaradei, 
and 
Austria 
remained 
convinced 
that 
he, 
and 
the 
Agency, 
would 
continue 
working 
to 
a 
high 
professional 
standard 
and 
live 
up 
to 
the 
expectation 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
2. 
The 
NPT 
was 
a 
unique 
international 
legal 
instrument. 
Its 
aim 
was 
not 
only 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
but 
also 
their 
elimination. 
As 
the 
key 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
treaty 
it 
had 
served 
the 
international 
community 
well 
over 
the 
previous 
35 
years. 
The 
indefinite 
extension 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
1995 
had 
been 
the 
result 
of 
carefully 
balancing 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Now, 
however, 
the 
balance 
between 
those 
pillars 
had 
been 
tilted 
and 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
had 
been 
challenged. 
Increasing 
numbers 
of 
States 
were 
gaining 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
accessing 
nuclear 
technology. 
While 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
complied 
with 
their 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT, 
there 
had 
been 
alarming 
cases 
of 
proliferation 
and 
non-compliance. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
progress 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament 
remained 
elusive. 
Austria 
had 
been 
optimistic 
after 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
that 
the 
NPT 
community 
would 
work 
together 
with 
a 
common 
sense 
of 
purpose, 
but 
instead 
States 
Party 
were 
grappling 
with 
a 
crisis 
of 
confidence. 
Non-proliferation 
was 
not 
enough; 
long-term 
progress 
in 
non-proliferation 
would 
be 
possible 
only 
if 
there 
were 
tangible 
results 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
The 
practical 
steps 
agreed 
in 
that 
regard 
at 
the 
2000 
Review 
Conference 
continued 
to 
be 
very 
important. 
Austria 
regretted 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
failed 
to 
achieve 
a 
substantive 
outcome. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
missed 
an 
important 
opportunity 
to 
reaffirm 
its 
full 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
indispensable 
role 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
security. 
3. 
Safeguards 
were 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
In 
the 
previous 
year, 
the 
Board 
had 
again 
addressed 
a 
number 
of 
proliferation 
challenges. 
Undeclared 
nuclear 
programmes 
which 
had 
not 
been 
detected 
by 
traditional 
safeguards 
measures 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
need 
for 
improvement. 
It 
was 
important 
for 
the 
international 
community 
that 
the 
Agency 
provide 
credible 
assurances 
of 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities. 
Austria 
continued 
to 
advocate 
adherence 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
which 
was 
a 
legal 
obligation 
for 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
Party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
It 
provided 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
better 
insight 
into 
StatesÂ 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
made 
detection 
of 
clandestine 
activities 
more 
likely. 
The 
development 
of 
the 
integrated 
safeguards 
system 
was 
welcome 
and 
the 
Agency 
needed 
to 
be 
given 
the 
necessary 
legal 
authority 
for 
its 
implementation. 
With 
37 
countries 
yet 
to 
conclude 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
universality 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
not 
yet 
attained, 
much 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
4. 
Nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
widest 
sense 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
trade. 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
could 
supply 
nuclear 
items 
only 
if 
they 
were 
confident 
that 
there 
was 
an 
appropriate 
level 
of 
nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
recipient 
country. 
That 
included 
the 
implementation 
of 
an 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
as 
well 
as 
an 
appropriate 
physical

protection 
system 
and 
effective 
export 
controls. 
Many 
countries 
with 
small 
or 
insignificant 
nuclear 
activities 
lacked 
the 
necessary 
experience 
and 
needed 
assistance 
in 
closing 
security 
gaps. 
Efforts 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
would 
not 
succeed 
unless 
appropriate 
nuclear 
security 
control 
systems 
were 
properly 
implemented 
all 
over 
the 
world. 


5. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
responded 
to 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
with 
a 
vast 
array 
of 
measures, 
one 
key 
element 
of 
which 
was 
strengthening 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
nuclear 
facilities. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Austria 
welcomed 
the 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
recent 
conference 
to 
amend 
the 
CPPNM. 
The 
amended 
Convention 
would 
make 
an 
important 
contribution 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
and 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
He 
paid 
tribute 
to 
the 
late 
Dr. 
Fritz 
Schmidt 
of 
Austria 
who 
had 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
that 
process. 
6. 
Nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
were 
inseparable 
and 
Austria 
continued 
to 
contribute 
to 
efforts 
to 
investigate 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations. 
Austrian 
policy 
regarding 
nuclear 
energy 
production 
was 
determined 
by 
a 
constitutional 
law 
on 
a 
nuclear-free 
Austria. 
It 
supported 
the 
phasing 
out 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
production 
internationally, 
while 
respecting 
national 
decisions 
and 
international 
law. 
Austria 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
draft 
self-assessment 
guidelines 
for 
the 
engineering 
safety 
aspects 
of 
the 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
against 
sabotage, 
linking 
physical 
protection 
with 
the 
design 
of 
nuclear 
installations. 
That 
approach 
helped 
to 
identify 
weaknesses 
against 
all 
kinds 
of 
external 
and 
internal 
threats, 
including 
sabotage 
and 
terrorism, 
and 
would 
increase 
the 
stability 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
goal 
of 
achieving 
inherently 
safe 
plants 
where 
even 
a 
severe 
accident 
would 
have 
no 
serious 
radiological 
consequences 
outside 
the 
plant 
would 
remain 
elusive 
as 
long 
as 
the 
technology 
itself 
posed 
a 
risk. 
His 
delegation 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
further 
strengthen 
its 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
safety 
and 
security 
regimes 
worldwide. 
7. 
Austria 
did 
not 
share 
the 
view 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
the 
answer 
with 
respect 
to 
climate 
change 
and 
the 
need 
to 
reduce 
greenhouse 
gases. 
Taking 
all 
aspects 
into 
account, 
including 
the 
full 
life 
cycle, 
nuclear 
power 
was 
not 
a 
viable 
option. 
Energy 
efficiency 
and 
structural 
changes 
would 
help 
solve 
the 
problem, 
and 
would 
also 
increase 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
decrease 
dependencies. 
8. 
Austria 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
number 
of 
States 
which 
had 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
now 
included 
all 
States 
with 
operating 
nuclear 
power 
reactors. 
It 
encouraged 
all 
States 
to 
ratify 
that 
Convention 
and 
hoped 
that 
review 
meetings 
under 
that 
Convention 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
useful 
to 
countries 
without 
a 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
Also, 
Austria 
welcomed 
the 
increased 
ratification 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
and 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
the 
forthcoming 
review 
meeting, 
which 
should 
yield 
positive 
results. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
that 
instrument 
of 
global 
nuclear 
safety. 
9. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
significant 
progress 
that 
had 
been 
made 
in 
increasing 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
While 
remaining 
sceptical 
about 
the 
power 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
Austria 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
the 
broad 
range 
of 
non-power 
applications. 
10. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
work 
done 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff 
during 
the 
previous 
year, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
area 
of 
verification. 
He 
assured 
the 
Agency 
of 
AustriaÂs 
continuing 
support. 
11. 
Mr. 
ADEGBULUGBE 
(Nigeria) 
said 
that 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
visit 
in 
January 
2005 
had 
afforded 
his 
country 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
area 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
which 
would 
be 
extended 
to 
the 
generation 
of 
electricity 
from 
nuclear 
sources. 
His 
delegation 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
bringing 
attention 
to 
NigeriaÂs 
dire 
situation 
with 
regard 
to 
electricity 
generation 
and 
the 
associated 
consequences 
for 
meeting 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals.

12. 
In 
its 
effort 
to 
achieve 
a 
better 
life 
for 
Nigerians, 
and 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals, 
his 
Government 
had 
embarked 
on 
a 
number 
of 
programmes, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
National 
Economic 
Empowerment 
and 
Development 
Strategy 
(NEEDS), 
which 
focused 
on 
key 
issues 
of 
sustainable 
development 
such 
as 
cancer 
treatment, 
disease 
control, 
adequate 
potable 
water 
supply 
and 
sustainable 
energy 
development. 
NigeriaÂs 
current 
electricity 
production 
from 
hydroelectric 
and 
thermoelectric 
plants 
of 
a 
mere 
4000 
megawatts 
for 
a 
population 
of 
more 
than 
120 
million 
meant 
that 
the 
country 
was 
living 
virtually 
in 
darkness. 
Nuclear 
technology 
could 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
meeting 
its 
pressing 
need 
for 
reliable 
power 
and 
to 
that 
end 
his 
Government 
had 
sought 
the 
AgencyÂs 
advice, 
assistance 
and 
cooperation. 
13. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
global 
implications 
of 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
energy, 
Nigeria 
was 
setting 
up 
the 
appropriate 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
frameworks 
as 
well 
as 
safety, 
security, 
safeguards 
and 
physical 
protection 
practices. 
14. 
Nigeria 
was 
pleased 
that 
its 
aspirations 
were 
being 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Projects 
for 
the 
2005/2006 
biennium 
had 
placed 
emphasis 
on 
capacity-building 
through 
further 
training 
in 
radiation 
control, 
protection 
and 
safety, 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear 
facilities, 
including 
an 
industrial 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility 
and 
a 
tandem 
accelerator, 
and 
enhanced 
use 
of 
the 
research 
reactor 
commissioned 
in 
2004. 
15. 
In 
pursuance 
of 
its 
policy 
of 
developing 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology, 
his 
Government 
had 
nearly 
completed 
the 
tandem 
accelerator 
project 
in 
Ile-Ife 
and 
had 
also 
licensed 
a 
multipurpose 
industrial 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
food 
preservation 
and 
pest 
control. 
That 
had 
taken 
place 
with 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Nigerian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(NNRA), 
which 
had 
set 
up 
regulatory 
mechanisms 
requiring 
a 
licence 
for 
the 
siting, 
design 
and 
construction 
of 
the 
industrial 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
commissioning 
licence 
and 
an 
operating 
licence. 
16. 
Nigeria 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
a 
reserve 
fund 
for 
the 
licensing 
and 
commissioning 
of 
the 
industrial 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility. 
It 
intended 
to 
make 
the 
facility 
available 
as 
a 
regional 
centre 
and 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
it 
in 
its 
training 
activities 
for 
the 
region. 
Nigeria 
also 
planned 
to 
set 
up 
an 
isotope 
hydrology 
laboratory 
to 
consolidate 
the 
gains 
made 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
the 
production 
of 
potable 
water. 
Nigeria 
had 
made 
a 
counterpart 
contribution 
of 
$100 
000 
towards 
the 
procurement 
of 
a 
mass 
spectrometer 
for 
the 
laboratory, 
and 
it 
looked 
forward 
to 
timely 
action 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
implementing 
the 
project 
and 
using 
it 
as 
a 
regional 
facility 
for 
its 
closest 
neighbours. 
17. 
Nigeria 
was 
appreciative 
of 
the 
follow-up 
programme 
for 
radiation 
protection 
in 
Africa, 
which 
would 
go 
a 
long 
way 
towards 
strengthening 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
Model 
Project 
on 
Upgrading 
Radiation 
Protection 
Infrastructure. 
Nigeria, 
which 
was 
participating 
in 
all 
five 
regional 
projects 
under 
that 
programme, 
was 
doing 
everything 
possible 
to 
achieve 
the 
goals 
and 
objectives 
of 
milestones 
2 
and 
3 
by 
December 
2005 
and 
milestones 
4 
and 
5 
by 
December 
2006. 
It 
was 
in 
that 
context 
that 
the 
NNRA, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
had 
held 
several 
national 
seminars 
and 
training 
courses 
earlier 
in 
2005. 
18. 
Nigeria 
now 
had 
a 
road 
map 
detailing 
the 
countryÂs 
needs 
and 
required 
level 
of 
competence 
in 
radiotherapy 
practices. 
As 
a 
further 
elaboration 
of 
the 
Nigerian 
Basic 
Ionizing 
Radiation 
Regulation 
2003, 
the 
NNRA 
had 
issued 
five 
practice-specific 
guides 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiography, 
nuclear 
well-logging 
and 
nuclear 
gauges. 
The 
manpower 
challenges 
which 
Nigeria 
faced 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
protection 
were 
being 
effectively 
addressed. 
Approval 
by 
the 
Agency 
of 
a 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
in 
the 
current 
biennium 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
postgraduate 
training 
centre 
in 
radiation 
protection 
would 
crown 
national 
efforts 
in 
that 
area. 
The 
NNRA 
was 
also 
planning

regional 
training 
events 
in 
2006 
to 
further 
promote 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
activities 
in 
Africa. 


19. 
The 
African 
continent 
had 
benefited 
from 
SIT 
for 
the 
eradication 
of 
pests 
and 
parasites. 
Nigeria 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
use 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
funds 
and 
for 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
to 
PATTEC. 
Africa 
had 
begun 
to 
take 
effective 
ownership 
of 
that 
programme. 
In 
Nigeria, 
a 
presidential 
committee 
and 
an 
advisory 
national 
technical 
task 
force 
had 
been 
set 
up 
to 
support 
and 
complement 
African 
Union 
activities 
and 
efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
establish 
a 
subregional 
centre 
of 
excellence 
in 
Nigeria. 
20. 
His 
Government 
fully 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
National 
regulations 
for 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
had 
been 
drafted 
incorporating 
the 
Guidance 
and 
imposing 
licensing 
requirements 
on 
the 
import 
and 
export 
of 
scrap 
metals. 
The 
regulations 
would 
also 
require 
all 
steel 
recycling 
plants 
to 
be 
equipped 
with 
portal 
radiation 
monitors 
to 
prevent 
the 
recycling 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
as 
scrap 
metal. 
His 
delegation 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
the 
outcome, 
earlier 
in 
the 
year, 
of 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
and 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
in 
France 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
other 
delegations 
on 
implementing 
the 
findings 
of 
those 
and 
other 
meetings. 
Nigeria 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct, 
a 
balanced 
international 
instrument 
which 
deserved 
the 
respect 
of 
both 
exporters 
and 
importers 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
21. 
With 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
NNRA 
had 
successfully 
licensed 
NigeriaÂs 
first 
nuclear 
reactor. 
Commissioned 
on 
30 
September 
2004, 
the 
reactor 
was 
undergoing 
monthly 
safety 
inspections 
by 
the 
NNRA 
and 
annual 
safeguards 
inspections 
by 
the 
Agency. 
With 
that 
facility, 
a 
national 
culture 
had 
been 
gradually 
developing 
on 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
the 
need 
to 
respect 
NigeriaÂs 
international 
commitments 
regarding 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Nigeria 
had 
signed 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
September 
2003 
but 
had 
not 
yet 
ratified 
it. 
That 
delay 
had 
been 
due 
mainly 
to 
difficulties 
in 
implementing 
the 
protocol, 
which 
called 
for 
additional 
manpower, 
financial 
and 
material 
resources. 
An 
interministerial 
committee 
had 
been 
established 
to 
study 
that 
and 
other 
relevant 
issues. 
It 
was 
in 
that 
context 
that 
the 
NNRA 
had 
organized 
a 
national 
seminar 
in 
July 
2005 
on 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
22. 
Nigeria 
was 
party 
to 
the 
Assistance 
and 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Conventions 
and 
remained 
very 
active 
in 
all 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
National 
Competent 
AuthoritiesÂ 
Coordinating 
Group 
(NCACG), 
in 
which 
it 
represented 
the 
Africa 
region. 
It 
called 
on 
other 
delegations 
to 
join 
it 
in 
urging 
the 
Agency 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
code 
of 
conduct 
for 
the 
international 
emergency 
management 
system 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
practical 
implementation 
of 
the 
Conventions. 
23. 
Nigeria 
regretted 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
failed 
to 
reach 
an 
agreement 
on 
the 
important 
matters 
before 
it 
and 
called 
on 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
honour 
their 
NPT 
commitments 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
the 
collective 
security 
of 
mankind. 
Expressing 
NigeriaÂs 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
mutual 
agreement 
reached 
to 
de-escalate 
tensions. 
The 
six-party 
talks 
had 
been 
a 
triumph 
of 
diplomacy 
over 
confrontation 
and 
was 
an 
example 
which 
should 
be 
emulated. 
24. 
In 
line 
with 
past 
policy, 
his 
delegation 
pledged 
an 
amount 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006 
equal 
to 
NigeriaÂs 
assessed 
contribution. 
25. 
Mr. 
KADIMAN 
(Indonesia) 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
valuable 
support 
received 
through 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
Noting 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
66 
CPFs 
Â 
used 
as

planning 
tools 
to 
design 
projects 
within 
the 
context 
of 
national 
priorities 
Â 
were 
now 
in 
place, 
he 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
signed 
a 
revised 
CPF 
in 
September 
2004. 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
expand 
and 
intensify 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
with 
a 
view 
to 
promoting 
quality 
of 
life, 
particularly 
in 
the 
developing 
countries. 


26. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
and 
budget 
for 
2006Â2007, 
his 
delegation 
said 
that, 
despite 
budgetary 
changes 
due 
to 
price 
adjustments, 
new 
appropriations 
for 
the 
funding 
of 
security 
measures 
and 
the 
phasing 
out 
or 
merging 
of 
activities, 
it 
was 
optimistic 
that 
the 
specific 
needs 
of 
developing 
countries 
would 
not 
be 
overlooked. 
Indonesia 
noted 
that 
as 
of 
the 
end 
of 
July 
2005, 
Member 
States 
had 
paid 
$2.9 
million, 
or 
only 
66%, 
of 
their 
total 
assessments 
of 
$4.4 
million 
for 
national 
participation 
costs. 
Flexibility 
should 
be 
accorded 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis 
to 
Member 
States 
that 
might 
have 
problems 
in 
meeting 
those 
payments. 
27. 
His 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
revised 
and 
simplified 
its 
approach 
to 
the 
planning 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
The 
new 
project 
concept 
form 
would 
significantly 
reduce 
the 
time 
and 
effort 
spent 
by 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
project 
formulation 
and 
budget 
allocation. 
However, 
the 
Agency 
should 
play 
a 
more 
active 
role 
in 
helping 
Member 
States 
in 
that 
regard. 
28. 
Indonesia 
expected 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
have 
a 
significant 
impact 
on 
securing 
energy 
availability 
and 
food 
supply, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
health 
care. 
For 
its 
part, 
Indonesia 
planned 
to 
utilize 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
further 
exploring 
and 
exploiting 
its 
abundant 
geothermal 
resources, 
which 
amounted 
to 
about 
40% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
total. 
To 
date 
they 
had 
been 
employed 
in 
a 
number 
of 
sites, 
including 
the 
Kamojang, 
Sibayak 
and 
Lahendong 
geothermal 
fields. 
29. 
The 
400 
kW 
underground 
micro 
hydropower 
plant 
was 
to 
be 
commissioned 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
The 
facility 
would 
pump 
a 
significant 
amount 
of 
potable 
water 
in 
a 
karst 
area 
of 
the 
southern 
part 
of 
the 
Yogyakarta 
region. 
A 
demonstration 
electron 
beam 
machine 
for 
treating 
sulphur 
and 
nitrogen 
oxides 
emitted 
from 
a 
coal-fired 
power 
plant 
was 
also 
being 
designed 
in 
cooperation 
with 
a 
State-
owned 
utility 
company, 
drawing 
on 
experience 
gained 
during 
the 
recent 
construction 
of 
a 
low-energy 
electron 
beam 
machine. 
30. 
Indonesia 
had 
been 
using 
radiation-induced 
mutation 
to 
breed 
improved 
varieties 
of 
plants 
for 
biofuel, 
for 
example 
Jatropha 
curcas 
and 
sweet 
sorghum. 
Also, 
two 
new 
high-yielding 
rice 
varieties, 
namely 
Mayang 
and 
Juwono, 
had 
been 
launched 
in 
Indonesia 
and 
more 
than 
200 
000 
hectares 
of 
rice 
fields 
in 
20 
provinces 
had 
been 
cultivated 
with 
varieties 
improved 
by 
means 
of 
radiation-induced 
mutation. 
The 
recent 
International 
Rice 
Conference 
in 
Bali 
had 
showcased 
28 
improved 
varieties 
and 
8 
traits, 
including 
a 
number 
developed 
by 
the 
National 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Agency 
(BATAN) 
using 
radiation-induced 
mutation 
breeding 
techniques. 
To 
speed 
up 
the 
dissemination 
of 
the 
new 
varieties 
and 
ensure 
the 
availability 
of 
seeds, 
cooperation 
with 
local 
governments, 
universities 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
had 
been 
expanded 
to 
include 
NGOs 
dealing 
with 
associations 
of 
Indonesian 
farmers. 
Indonesia 
was 
also 
continuing 
to 
disseminate 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
improve 
animal 
reproduction 
and 
animal 
health 
and 
feed 
supplement 
technology. 
31. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
human 
health, 
Indonesia 
was 
intensifying 
its 
efforts 
to 
develop 
and 
produce 
radioisotopes 
and 
radiopharmaceuticals 
for 
domestic 
use 
and 
for 
export. 
It 
had 
also 
started 
a 
programme 
to 
design 
and 
manufacture 
nuclear 
medical 
instruments 
for 
radiodiagnostics 
and 
radiotherapy. 
IndonesiaÂs 
30 
MW 
multipurpose 
research 
reactor 
had 
increased 
the 
production 
capacity 
of 
iodine-125, 
thus 
ensuring 
supplies 
for 
domestic 
and 
regional 
use. 
32. 
A 
number 
of 
institutions 
in 
Indonesia, 
including 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mineral 
Resources 
and 
the 
State-owned 
company 
responsible 
for 
electricity, 
had 
worked 
to 
set 
up 
responsible 
organizations 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
His 
delegation 

GC(49)/OR.2

expressed 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
in 
that 
matter, 
including 
three 
recent 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
and 
hoped 
that 
such 
support 
would 
be 
extended 
and 
further 
enhanced 
for 
the 
next 
cycle. 
In 
anticipation 
of 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
the 
national 
regulatory 
body, 
BAPETEN, 
had 
embarked 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
programme 
to 
develop 
the 
infrastructure 
needed, 
including 
for 
activities 
connected 
with 
licensing 
and 
inspection. 
Indonesia 
looked 
forward 
to 
Agency 
cooperation, 
in 
particular 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
capacity-building 
of 
the 
regulatory 
authority. 
Close 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
cooperation 
with 
countries 
with 
experience 
in 
developing 
and 
operating 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
would 
also 
be 
useful. 


33. 
National 
legislation 
in 
line 
with 
the 
BSS 
was 
in 
its 
final 
stages. 
In 
August 
2005, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations 
on 
steps 
for 
making 
better 
use 
of 
existing 
capabilities 
to 
establish 
an 
interim 
response 
had 
been 
followed 
up 
by 
a 
training 
course 
in 
emergency 
preparedness 
for 
first 
responders. 
His 
delegation 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
and 
expand 
its 
assistance 
programme 
in 
that 
important 
area 
also. 
His 
Government 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
was 
working 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Guidance 
for 
the 
relevant 
Code 
of 
Conduct. 
34. 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
the 
amendments 
made 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
at 
the 
diplomatic 
conference 
in 
July 
2005, 
which 
would 
strengthen 
the 
Convention 
and 
help 
prevent 
nuclear 
material 
from 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who 
might 
use 
it 
to 
threaten 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Indonesia 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
ratify 
those 
amendments 
in 
keeping 
with 
its 
commitment 
to 
strengthen 
the 
global 
nuclear 
security 
regime. 
35. 
His 
delegation 
expressed 
its 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
dispatching 
experts 
and 
transferring 
knowledge 
to 
anticipate 
increasing 
terrorist 
threats 
by 
improving 
the 
physical 
protection 
system 
of 
IndonesiaÂs 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Regarding 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
reactors, 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
the 
support 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
Member 
States 
through 
the 
extrabudgetary 
programme. 
Agency 
INSARR 
missions 
and 
basic 
professional 
training 
courses 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
to 
assist 
Indonesia 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
of 
research 
reactors 
and 
enhancing 
nuclear 
safety 
knowledge 
among 
young 
scientists. 
36. 
Indonesia 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
supporting 
activities 
in 
education 
and 
capacity-building 
as 
well 
as 
programmes 
with 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
the 
Indonesian 
people. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
stressed 
that 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
in 
Indonesia 
were 
solely 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
37. 
Mr. 
KHELIL 
(Algeria) 
said 
that 
the 
positive 
cooperation 
between 
his 
country 
and 
the 
Agency 
attested 
to 
AlgeriaÂs 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
functions 
under 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
Statute. 
It 
had 
led 
to 
partnership 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
safeguards, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
the 
application 
of 
international 
safety 
standards. 
Scientific 
and 
technological 
development 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
fully 
compatible 
with 
the 
goals 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
non-proliferation 
obligations. 
38. 
All 
national 
activities 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
were 
subject 
to 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
that 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
1997, 
following 
AlgeriaÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
in 
1995. 
AlgeriaÂs 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation 
would 
be 
strengthened 
by 
its 
forthcoming 
signature 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
Algeria 
considered 
the 
NPT 
to 
be 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime 
and 
had 
been 
making 
a 
tangible 
contribution 
to 
the 
realization 
of 
its 
objectives 
by, 
for 
example, 
presiding 
over 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
ratifying 
the 
CTBT 
in 
July 
2003 
and 
chairing 
the 
CTBTO 
Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
2005.

39. 
His 
Government 
considered 
scientific 
research, 
technological 
advances 
and 
innovation 
vital 
for 
AlgeriaÂs 
development 
and 
important 
for 
future 
generations. 
As 
such, 
they 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
government 
policies 
for 
creating 
jobs, 
meeting 
the 
growing 
socio-economic 
needs 
of 
the 
population 
and 
conserving 
natural 
resources. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
the 
acquisition 
of 
scientific 
knowledge, 
including 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
to 
which 
Algeria 
was 
party, 
was 
crucial 
to 
meeting 
the 
challenges 
of 
electricity 
production, 
development 
of 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
exploitation 
of 
water 
resources 
and 
improvement 
of 
the 
health 
services. 
At 
the 
global 
level 
also, 
efforts 
must 
be 
redoubled 
to 
promote 
science 
and 
technology, 
since 
they 
were 
the 
driving 
force 
behind 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
growth 
and 
the 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
the 
environment. 
The 
Algerian 
Government 
had 
launched 
its 
2005Â2009 
five-year 
plan 
for 
economic 
revival 
and, 
to 
consolidate 
the 
political 
and 
socio-economic 
stability 
of 
the 
country, 
the 
Algerian 
people 
were 
about 
to 
participate 
in 
a 
referendum 
on 
a 
draft 
Charter 
for 
Peace 
and 
National 
Reconciliation. 
Socio-economic 
and 
other 
indicators 
promised 
better 
prospects 
for 
the 
future. 
The 
change 
for 
the 
better 
could 
be 
attributed 
to 
the 
policy 
implemented 
by 
President 
Abedlaziz 
Bouteflika. 
It 
was 
vital 
for 
Algeria 
to 
rebuild 
and 
expand 
its 
national 
infrastructure, 
which 
had 
been 
damaged 
by 
a 
decade 
of 
terrorist 
violence 
and 
had 
led 
to 
disinvestment 
that 
had 
been 
detrimental 
to 
economic 
growth. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
electricity 
sector 
was 
under 
great 
pressure 
to 
meet 
growing 
demands 
from 
industry, 
agriculture 
and 
other 
consumers. 
40. 
Algeria, 
an 
oil 
and 
gas 
producing 
country, 
was 
aware 
that 
those 
energy 
resources 
were 
non-renewable 
and 
that 
it 
was 
imperative 
for 
Algeria 
to 
diversify 
its 
energy 
sector 
by 
preparing 
sustainable 
and 
economically 
viable 
options. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
Algerian 
Government 
had 
established 
programmes 
designed 
to 
stimulate 
research 
into 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
such 
as 
solar, 
wind 
and 
biomass. 
Nuclear 
energy, 
which 
was 
a 
non-polluting 
and 
economically 
attractive 
alternative, 
also 
had 
a 
contribution 
to 
make, 
as 
had 
been 
underlined 
at 
the 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
March 
2005. 
41. 
Algeria 
regretted 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
made 
by 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
New 
York 
in 
May 
2005, 
and 
the 
stalemate 
at 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit. 
Rather 
than 
being 
discouraged 
by 
that 
situation, 
the 
international 
community 
should 
redouble 
its 
efforts 
to 
rid 
the 
world 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
That 
meant 
working 
towards 
maintaining, 
and 
the 
universalization 
of, 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
system. 
42. 
At 
the 
regional 
level, 
Algeria 
commended 
the 
African 
contribution 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
in 
the 
form 
of 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty, 
which 
established 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
Africa. 
Algeria, 
which 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
ratify 
the 
Treaty, 
called 
on 
all 
African 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
it 
in 
order 
to 
accelerate 
its 
entry 
into 
force. 
With 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Algeria 
was 
prepared 
to 
host 
a 
regional 
meeting 
on 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
socio-economic 
development 
in 
Algiers 
in 
2006. 
43. 
Universalization 
of 
all 
the 
instruments 
which 
formed 
the 
multilateral 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
in 
particular 
the 
NPT, 
was 
an 
imperative. 
Algeria 
called 
for 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
all 
the 
States 
of 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
particular 
Israel, 
the 
only 
country 
outside 
the 
NPT. 
Algeria 
supported 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
promote 
non-proliferation 
in 
that 
sensitive 
region 
of 
the 
world. 
44. 
Algeria 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
the 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
six 
party 
talks 
on 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Algeria 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
commitment 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
only 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
as 
authorized 
under 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
NPT, 
and 
its 
announced 
return 
to 
the 
NPT 
regime. 
His 
delegation 
paid 
tribute 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
six 
parties, 
in 
particular 
China. 
The 
lack 
of 
consensus 
on 
the 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
achieving 
a 
negotiated 
settlement 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme 
was 
regrettable. 
Like 
other 
countries 
of 
the 
Non-Aligned 
Movement, 
Algeria 
was 

GC(49)/OR.2

of 
the 
view 
that 
the 
Agency 
continued 
to 
be 
the 
most 
appropriate 
framework 
for 
handling 
that 
issue. 
Algeria 
reaffirmed 
its 
confidence 
in 
and 
support 
for 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
objectivity 
and 
professionalism 
in 
carrying 
out 
his 
mandate. 
His 
delegation 
urged 
Iran 
and 
the 
three 
European 
countries 
to 
show 
flexibility 
in 
returning 
to 
negotiations 
so 
that 
the 
outstanding 
questions 
might 
be 
resolved. 


45. 
Turning 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recent 
activities 
to 
accelerate 
and 
enlarge 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
peace 
and 
prosperity 
in 
the 
world, 
he 
paid 
tribute 
to 
the 
commendable 
work 
it 
had 
done 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
verification, 
technical 
cooperation, 
and 
safety 
and 
security, 
helping 
to 
realize 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
objectives 
with 
respect 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
context 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
46. 
Emphasizing 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
commitment 
to 
participating 
in 
international 
efforts 
to 
fight 
terrorism 
in 
all 
its 
forms, 
including 
attacks 
against 
nuclear 
facilities 
or 
material, 
he 
said 
Algerian 
had 
recently 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
The 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
non-State 
actors 
should 
be 
combated 
by 
States 
working 
collectively 
towards 
the 
goal 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
was 
not 
used 
as 
justification 
for 
States 
to 
hold 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
The 
end 
goal 
must 
be 
to 
eradicate 
them 
completely. 
It 
was 
also 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
did 
not 
contribute 
to 
the 
erosion 
of 
StatesÂ 
inalienable 
right 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
delegation 
commended 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
to 
accelerate 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amended 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute, 
which 
would 
expand 
the 
composition 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
He 
appealed 
to 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
that 
Article 
so 
that 
there 
could 
be 
broader 
participation 
by 
Member 
States 
in 
that 
policy-making 
body 
of 
the 
Agency. 
47. 
Algeria 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
must 
be 
strengthened 
by 
the 
provision 
of 
adequate, 
reliable 
and 
predictable 
financial 
resources. 
It 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
new 
impetus 
that 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
given 
to 
technical 
cooperation, 
which 
was 
a 
vector 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
knowledge 
and 
know-how 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
Algeria 
was 
both 
a 
contributor 
to 
and 
a 
recipient 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
programme, 
focusing 
its 
efforts 
on 
human 
resources 
training 
and 
establishing 
nuclear 
research 
infrastructures. 
Technical 
cooperation 
must 
continue 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
technology 
applications, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
industry, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resource 
management. 
The 
development 
of 
programmes 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
power 
and 
to 
strengthen 
national 
energy 
planning 
capacities 
was 
of 
particular 
interest. 
To 
increase 
the 
socio-economic 
impact 
of 
such 
applications, 
the 
priorities 
and 
the 
needs 
of 
Member 
States 
must 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
key 
element 
in 
deciding 
whether 
to 
approve 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
activities 
and 
when 
preparing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regular 
programme. 
48. 
In 
2004, 
60 
foreign 
specialists 
had 
participated 
in 
5 
training 
courses 
and 
workshops 
held 
in 
Algeria 
with 
Agency 
support, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
Algerians 
had 
worked 
as 
experts 
for 
the 
Agency. 
Algeria 
was 
particularly 
interested 
in 
regional 
and 
South-South 
cooperation. 
Reiterating 
AlgeriaÂs 
support 
for 
AFRA, 
he 
requested 
Agency 
support 
in 
helping 
AFRA 
establish 
strategic 
partnerships 
in 
order 
to 
implement 
the 
regional 
cooperation 
programmes. 
As 
a 
founder 
country 
of 
NEPAD, 
Algeria 
was 
working 
towards 
the 
development 
of 
synergies 
between 
NEPAD 
and 
AFRA. 
Still 
on 
the 
regional 
front, 
Algeria 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
work 
with 
the 
FAO 
to 
determine 
the 
feasibility 
of 
using 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
help 
combat 
the 
locust 
plagues 
which 
ravaged 
the 
economy 
of 
many 
African 
countries. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Algeria 
was 
prepared 
to 
host 
a 
meeting 
of 
experts 
and 
to 
make 
available 
its 
experts 
in 
the 
field.

49. 
In 
conclusion 
he 
expressed 
his 
satisfaction 
with 
the 
mutually 
beneficial 
partnership 
that 
had 
existed 
for 
a 
long 
time 
between 
Algeria 
and 
the 
Agency 
towards 
the 
common 
goal 
of 
promoting 
the 
use 
of 
the 
atom 
for 
peace 
and 
development. 
50. 
Mr. 
RUMYANTSEV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
recalled 
that 
ten 
days 
previously 
at 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit 
in 
New 
York, 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
had 
been 
opened 
for 
signature. 
It 
had 
been 
elaborated 
on 
the 
initiative 
of 
Russia 
and 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
Russian 
draft. 
President 
Putin 
had 
been 
the 
first 
to 
sign 
it, 
followed 
immediately 
by 
President 
Bush 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
Many 
countries 
had 
now 
signed 
the 
Convention. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
criminalizing 
for 
the 
first 
time 
incitement 
to 
terrorism. 
The 
Convention 
opened 
up 
new 
possibilities 
for 
reinforcing 
anti-terrorist 
cooperation 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
and 
considerably 
increased 
the 
role 
and 
significance 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
consolidating 
international 
cooperation 
in 
that 
field. 
His 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
willingness 
of 
the 
Agency, 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
committee 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
to 
provide 
active 
assistance 
to 
countries 
requiring 
help 
in 
organizing 
effective 
legislative, 
organizational 
and 
other 
measures 
for 
the 
non-
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery. 
51. 
At 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
held 
in 
May 
2005, 
an 
objective 
and 
balanced 
analysis 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
of 
the 
functioning 
of 
all 
the 
fundamental 
areas 
of 
the 
NPT, 
including 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Despite 
the 
range 
of 
opinions 
about 
the 
NPTÂs 
success, 
States 
Party 
to 
the 
Treaty 
had 
emphasized 
its 
importance 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
their 
commitment 
to 
strict 
compliance 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
In 
July 
2005, 
the 
G8 
leaders 
had 
spoken 
of 
their 
determination 
to 
continue 
to 
make 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
and 
strengthen 
the 
NPT. 
Their 
joint 
declaration 
expressed 
full 
support 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
and 
had 
noted 
the 
need 
for 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
be 
recognized 
as 
a 
norm 
for 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
52. 
Russia 
was 
firmly 
on 
the 
path 
of 
reducing 
surplus 
nuclear 
weapons, 
as 
had 
been 
clearly 
demonstrated 
by 
the 
Agreement 
between 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
concerning 
the 
Disposition 
of 
High 
Enriched 
Uranium 
Extracted 
from 
Nuclear 
Weapons, 
the 
so-called 
HEU-LEU 
Agreement 
or 
the 
Megatons 
to 
Megawatts 
programme. 
In 
2005, 
half 
of 
the 
amount 
envisaged 
under 
that 
Agreement, 
namely 
250 
tons, 
had 
been 
reprocessed 
into 
LEU 
and 
shipped 
to 
the 
United 
States 
as 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
fuel. 
That 
meant 
that 
10 
000 
nuclear 
warheads 
had 
been 
dismantled 
and 
reprocessed 
into 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
a 
unique 
example 
in 
world 
history 
of 
genuine 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Russia 
continued 
to 
develop 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
in 
that 
regard, 
actively 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Energy 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
joint 
declaration 
on 
nuclear 
security 
issues, 
signed 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
both 
countries 
in 
Bratislava 
in 
February 
2005. 
Good 
working 
relations 
had 
been 
established 
with 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Energy 
Mr. 
Bodman, 
with 
whom 
he 
co-chaired 
the 
United 
States-Russia 
senior 
interagency 
group 
for 
cooperation 
on 
nuclear 
security.

In 
the 
Sea 
Island 
action 
plan 
on 
non-proliferation 
adopted 
in 
June 
2004, 
G8 
leaders 
had 
called 
on 
nuclear 
technology 
suppliers 
to 
establish 
new 
measures 
so 
that 
sensitive 
nuclear 
items 
with 
proliferation 
potential 
would 
not 
be 
exported 
to 
States 
that 
might 
seek 
to 
use 
them 
for 
weapons 
purposes, 
or 
allow 
them 
to 
fall 
into 
terrorist 
hands. 
They 
had 
agreed 
to 
declare 
a 
one-year 
moratorium 
on 
the 
transfer 
of 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
equipment 
and 
technology, 
which 
had 
been 
extended 
for 
a

Moscow 
in 
July 
2005, 
had 
further 
developed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
regarding 
the 
internationalization 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
The 
Conference, 
which 
had 
been 
organized 
by 
Rosatom 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
had 
been 
attended 
by 
220 
experts 
from 
23 
countries 
and 
international 
organizations. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle, 
contained 
in 
its 
report 
of 
February 
2005, 
had 
been 
greatly 
appreciated. 
The 
Conference 
had 
identified 
as 
a 
potential 
priority 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
mechanism 
of 
assured 
fuel 
supplies 
to 
countries 
which 
had 
renounced 
the 
development 
of 
national 
uranium 
enrichment 
technology. 
Russia 
was 
prepared 
to 
provide 
such 
supplies. 
As 
a 
first 
step 
in 
that 
direction, 
the 
Secretariat 
should 
consider 
continuing 
work 
in 
the 
area 
and 
creating 
an 
expert 
group 
on 
the 
assessment 
of 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
which 
could 
soon 
begin 
discussing 
the 
issue 
of 
determining 
the 
terms 
and 
scenarios 
for 
establishing 
an 
assured 
nuclear 
fuel 
reserve 
under 
Agency 
control. 
RussiaÂs 
experience 
had 
shown 
that 
an 
efficient 
mechanism 
of 
ensuring 
supplies 
was 
bilateral 
international 
agreements 
that 
provided 
for 
fuel 
supplies 
throughout 
the 
entire 
operating 
life 
of 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
as 
part 
of 
a 
packet 
including 
shipment 
of 
the 
plants 
themselves 
and 
also 
return 
of 
the 
spent 
fuel 
to 
its 
supplier. 
The 
issue 
of 
additional 
safeguards 
was 
still 
outstanding 
and 
needed 
to 
be 
resolved 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency. 


55. 
Even 
the 
most 
conservative 
estimates 
suggested 
that 
the 
development 
of 
the 
world 
economy 
by 
2050 
would 
require 
energy 
production 
to 
more 
than 
double. 
That 
would 
not 
be 
possible 
using 
only 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
such 
as 
the 
sun, 
wind 
and 
water. 
Nuclear 
energy 
therefore 
had 
a 
future. 
The 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
depended 
above 
all 
on 
resolving 
issues 
related 
to 
non-proliferation, 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
materials, 
increasing 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
to 
the 
management 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste. 
Clearly, 
the 
course 
of 
action 
to 
be 
taken 
would 
depend 
on 
a 
number 
of 
factors, 
the 
key 
ones 
being 
limited 
resources, 
environmental 
and 
technological 
safety, 
the 
cost 
of 
nuclear 
power 
production 
and 
the 
degree 
of 
risk 
associated 
with 
its 
use. 
56. 
The 
innovative 
potential 
of 
modern 
nuclear 
power 
engineering 
meant 
it 
could 
be 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
an 
energy 
system 
which 
would 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
ensure 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
civilization 
in 
the 
21st 
century 
with 
environmentally 
clean, 
safe, 
economical 
and 
socially 
acceptable 
sources 
of 
energy. 
Such 
a 
complex 
task 
could 
be 
accomplished 
only 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
international 
cooperation 
and 
collaboration, 
with 
a 
much 
enhanced 
role 
and 
responsibility 
for 
the 
Agency. 
Coordinating 
research 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
power 
engineering 
and 
consolidating 
the 
efforts 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
develop 
innovative 
nuclear 
energy 
were 
key 
elements 
of 
such 
cooperation. 
57. 
His 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
further 
develop 
INPRO, 
which 
was 
a 
unique 
project 
designed 
to 
achieve 
the 
nuclear 
power 
goals 
of 
the 
21st 
century. 
Russia 
proposed 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
look 
into 
establishing 
a 
programme 
to 
provide 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
conducting 
expert 
assessments 
of 
their 
nuclear 
energy 
systems 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
internationally 
recognized 
and 
highly 
regarded 
INPRO 
methodology. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
future 
development 
of 
INPRO, 
the 
Russian 
delegation, 
together 
with 
a 
number 
of 
other 
delegations, 
had 
submitted 
for 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
consideration 
a 
draft 
resolution 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Project, 
taking 
account 
of 
the 
new 
challenges 
to 
be 
addressed 
in 
2006Â2007. 
58. 
The 
ITER 
project 
aimed 
at 
the 
development 
of 
fusion 
energy 
was 
evolving 
successfully 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
Russia, 
the 
EU, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
Japan, 
China 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
It 
was 
now 
entering 
the 
engineering 
phase. 
At 
the 
ministerial 
meeting 
of 
the 
six 
ITER 
participants, 
held 
in 
Moscow 
in 
June 
2005, 
a 
joint 
declaration 
on 
selection 
of 
the 
site 
of 
the 
reactor 
in 
Cadarache, 
France, 
had 
been 
signed. 
That 
would 
soon 
lead 
to 
the 
signing 
of 
an 
agreement 
on 
joint 
implementation 
of 
the 
ITER 
project.

59. 
Russia 
was 
due 
to 
take 
over 
the 
G8 
presidency 
in 
2006. 
One 
of 
the 
central 
themes 
of 
the 
Russian 
presidency 
would 
be 
international 
energy 
security. 
Rosatom 
and 
Rostechnadzor 
were 
taking 
an 
active 
part 
in 
developing 
the 
concept 
for 
a 
strategy, 
to 
be 
agreed 
upon 
by 
the 
partners, 
for 
energy 
security 
ensuring 
a 
reliable 
supply 
of 
all 
types 
of 
energy 
for 
the 
worldÂs 
economy 
and 
its 
peoples. 
60. 
Russia 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
meeting 
held 
in 
April 
2005 
to 
review 
national 
reports 
by 
Contracting 
Parties 
under 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
were 
satisfactory. 
The 
Russian 
FederationÂs 
report 
had 
mentioned 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
legislation 
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
and 
had 
come 
into 
force 
in 
Russia, 
that 
an 
independent 
regulatory 
body, 
Rostechnadzor, 
was 
in 
operation, 
and 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
number 
of 
safety 
assessments 
of 
first-generation 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
61. 
Russia 
affirmed 
its 
readiness 
to 
organize 
the 
AgencyÂs 
International 
Conference 
on 
Effective 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Systems 
in 
Moscow 
in 
FebruaryÂMarch 
2006, 
which 
would 
review 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
issues 
relating 
to 
regulatory 
activities 
with 
a 
view 
to 
improving 
their 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency. 
62. 
The 
Russian 
delegation 
commended 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
work 
on 
safeguards 
implementation 
over 
the 
past 
year 
and 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
position 
that 
further 
progress 
in 
strengthening 
its 
verification 
activities 
could 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
broader 
application 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
and 
the 
development 
of 
cooperation 
with 
State 
and 
regional 
systems 
of 
accounting 
and 
control. 
63. 
Russia 
would 
continue 
its 
active 
participation 
in 
technical 
cooperation, 
and 
was 
about 
to 
transfer 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full. 
64. 
In 
two 
daysÂ 
time, 
Russia 
was 
to 
celebrate 
the 
sixtieth 
anniversary 
of 
its 
nuclear 
industry, 
which 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
components 
of 
global 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
willingness 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
further 
development 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
civilization. 
65. 
Mr. 
LEPRA 
(Uruguay) 
said 
the 
Agency 
was 
an 
essential 
instrument 
in 
maintaining 
world 
peace 
and 
promoting 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
humankind 
and 
the 
environment. 
His 
Government, 
which 
had 
assumed 
office 
on 
1 
March 
2005, 
was 
committed 
to 
helping 
the 
Director 
General 
as 
far 
as 
possible 
in 
fostering 
the 
uses 
and 
benefits 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
66. 
Uruguay 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
safety 
culture 
concept, 
as 
instilled 
by 
its 
President. 
The 
Uruguayan 
regulatory 
authorityÂs 
radiation 
protection 
criteria 
were 
based 
on 
the 
BSS, 
and 
the 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
had 
been 
established 
in 
compliance 
with 
up-to-date 
requirements. 
67. 
Uruguay 
had 
no 
industrial 
irradiators 
or 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
With 
regard 
to 
improving 
the 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructure, 
the 
first 
and 
second 
milestones 
of 
Model 
Project 
RLA/9/041 
were 
close 
to 
completion. 
No 
less 
important, 
and 
part 
of 
the 
national 
radiation 
safety 
strategy, 
was 
the 
attention 
to 
possible 
radiological 
emergency 
situations. 
In 
August 
2005, 
the 
Uruguayan 
Executive 
Authority 
had 
approved 
the 
national 
radiological 
emergency 
plan, 
which 
was 
already 
in 
force. 
68. 
He 
expressed 
thanks 
to 
the 
Agency 
which, 
through 
its 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
had 
offered 
support 
through 
training 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
up-to-date 
equipment 
Uruguay 
needed 
to 
complete 
its 
tasks 
with 
the 
highest 
level 
of 
efficiency. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
also 
always 
enabled 
Uruguay 
to 
keep 
abreast 
of 
the 
demands 
and 
challenges 
posed 
by 
cutting 
edge 
nuclear 
technology, 
taking 
into 
account 
its 
innumerable 
peaceful 
uses, 
including 
radiation 
safety, 
medicine, 
the 
environment, 
agriculture, 
veterinary 
science 
and 
non-destructive 
testing. 
Projects 
under 
ARCAL 
had 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
constant 
updating 
of 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
various 
Uruguayan 
institutions 
where 
it 
was 
used.

69. 
Uruguay 
was 
strengthening 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
which, 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
criminals, 
could 
cause 
terrible 
damage. 
That 
was 
why 
in 
February 
2004, 
Uruguay 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
countries 
to 
give 
its 
support 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and, 
in 
July 
2005, 
had 
been 
the 
fourth 
country 
in 
the 
world 
to 
comply 
with 
its 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
In 
applying 
the 
Guidance, 
Uruguay 
was 
working 
with 
the 
customs 
authorities 
to 
ensure 
strict 
control 
of 
the 
import 
and 
export 
of 
sources 
and 
generators 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
anticipate 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
was 
acting 
as 
a 
contact 
point 
for 
the 
Illicit 
Trafficking 
Database. 
70. 
The 
Uruguayan 
Government 
was 
moving 
towards 
ratification 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
which 
Uruguay 
had 
signed 
in 
1997. 
It 
was 
also 
about 
to 
ratify 
the 
ARCAL 
agreement, 
which 
it 
had 
signed 
in 
1998, 
and 
through 
which 
it 
had 
benefited 
from 
technical 
assistance 
and 
training 
over 
the 
years. 
71. 
Uruguay 
had 
a 
special 
interest 
in 
PACT 
as 
cancer 
was 
the 
second 
largest 
cause 
of 
death 
in 
the 
country. 
On 
27 
June 
2005, 
the 
Government 
had 
set 
up 
a 
national 
cancer 
control 
plan 
(PRONACAN), 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
reducing 
mortality 
from 
and 
the 
incidence 
of 
cancer 
by 
means 
of 
national 
coordination 
of 
activities 
and 
resources 
in 
the 
field 
of 
oncology. 
A 
centre 
of 
excellence 
had 
been 
planned 
for 
that 
purpose 
and 
Uruguay 
hoped 
it 
would 
be 
able 
to 
continue 
to 
rely 
on 
Agency 
recommendations 
and 
support 
when 
PACT 
was 
implemented. 
72. 
He 
reaffirmed 
UruguayÂs 
commitment 
to 
peace 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
as 
seen 
by 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty 
since 
1968. 
Uruguay 
believed 
that 
all 
conflicts 
could 
be 
resolved 
through 
dialogue 
without 
resorting 
to 
the 
use 
of 
force 
and 
that 
every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
free 
the 
world 
from 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
73. 
Mr. 
GOREA 
(Romania) 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
competent 
and 
dedicated 
team 
on 
their 
efforts 
over 
the 
past 
years 
and 
expressed 
conviction 
that 
the 
Director 
General 
would 
show 
the 
same 
wisdom, 
impartiality 
and 
energy 
during 
his 
next 
mandate. 
74. 
His 
Government 
was 
keenly 
interested 
in 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
as 
a 
reliable 
energy 
source 
and 
an 
important 
contributor 
to 
the 
national 
power 
supply. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Romania 
had 
experienced 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
demand 
for 
electricity 
was 
expected 
to 
increase 
constantly 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
current 
decade. 
Based 
on 
that 
positive 
trend, 
which 
had 
been 
confirmed 
by 
several 
national 
and 
international 
studies, 
and 
RomaniaÂs 
high 
nuclear 
safety 
standards, 
the 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
further 
develop 
Unit 
2 
and 
Unit 
3 
at 
the 
Cernavoda 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
The 
construction 
of 
Unit 
3 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
RomaniaÂs 
national 
nuclear 
strategy 
had 
been 
planned 
as 
a 
joint 
venture 
project 
using 
multilateral 
financing 
agreements. 
75. 
The 
conversion 
of 
the 
TRIGA 
research 
reactor 
at 
Pitesti 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU, 
an 
Agency 
project 
financed 
by 
the 
United 
States 
Government, 
the 
Romanian 
Government 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
TCF, 
was 
currently 
under 
way. 
Romania 
hoped 
that 
the 
TRIGA 
fuel 
rods 
would 
be 
delivered 
in 
time 
to 
allow 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
conversion 
by 
mid-2006. 
76. 
Another 
priority 
project 
was 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
WWER 
research 
reactor, 
which 
was 
being 
implemented 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance. 
After 
a 
slow 
start, 
considerable 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
that 
regard 
in 
recent 
months, 
and 
clean 
up 
and 
characterization 
activities 
were 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2005. 
The 
Romanian 
Government 
was 
cooperating 
with 
the 
authorities 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
to 
facilitate 
the 
return 
to 
Russia 
of 
the 
S36-type 
spent 
fuel. 
The 
remaining 
EK10-type 
spent 
fuel 
would 
be 
prepared 
and 
sent 
to 
an 
interim 
repository. 
Those 
achievements 
proved 
that 
the 
best 
results 
were 
always 
obtained 
through 
cooperation 
and 
international 
partnership.

77. 
The 
aforementioned 
projects 
were 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
his 
Government 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Secretariat, 
in 
particular 
to 
the 
Europe 
Section 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
for 
the 
continuous 
support 
Romania 
had 
received. 
78. 
As 
to 
future 
perspectives, 
his 
Government 
looked 
forward 
to 
fulfilling 
its 
commitment 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
reiterated 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
readiness 
actively 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
His 
delegation 
trusted 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
use 
RomaniaÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
some 
of 
its 
projects. 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
would 
certainly 
remain 
important 
to 
Romania 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
79. 
Under 
the 
national 
nuclear 
strategy, 
special 
attention 
was 
being 
placed 
on 
the 
development 
of 
an 
adequate 
legislative 
framework, 
consistent 
with 
European 
Commission 
standards, 
to 
achieve 
national 
objectives 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
Legislation 
would 
be 
brought 
up 
to 
date 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
an 
institutional 
framework 
appropriate 
to 
market 
economy 
conditions 
that 
ensured 
implementation 
of 
the 
national 
nuclear 
strategy 
and 
defined 
responsibilities 
and 
methods 
to 
promote 
and 
manage 
activities 
in 
the 
nuclear 
sector. 
The 
reports 
of 
the 
European 
Commission 
on 
Romania 
confirmed 
that 
substantial 
efforts 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
power 
generation 
sector 
in 
preparation 
for 
EU 
accession. 
In 
addition, 
new 
legislation 
had 
been 
adopted 
aimed 
at 
restructuring 
the 
power 
generation 
and 
power 
distribution 
sectors. 
80. 
Romania 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
That 
political 
will 
was 
clearly 
reflected 
in 
the 
national 
nuclear 
strategy 
adopted 
by 
its 
Government. 
Romania 
was 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
had 
concluded 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
subsequently 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
which 
had 
been 
in 
force 
since 
2000. 
81. 
The 
2004 
SIR 
reflected 
the 
complexity 
of 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
field 
of 
safeguards. 
The 
Report 
had 
drawn 
the 
Agency 
safeguards 
conclusions 
regarding 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
placed 
under 
safeguards 
for 
21 
States 
including, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
Romania. 
That 
conclusion 
had 
been 
based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
evaluation 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
of 
the 
results 
of 
its 
verification 
activities 
under 
the 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
as 
well 
as 
of 
other 
information 
on 
RomaniaÂs 
nuclear 
and 
related 
activities. 
82. 
Romania 
would 
continue 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Safeguards 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
developing 
a 
system 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
adapted 
to 
its 
nuclear 
sector. 
It 
was 
also 
ready 
to 
share 
it 
positive 
experiences 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
with 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
83. 
Consistent 
with 
its 
commitment 
to 
support 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
combating 
international 
terrorism 
and 
implementing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
plan 
on 
nuclear 
terrorism 
adopted 
in 
2002, 
Romania 
was 
a 
contributor 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
In 
that 
connection, 
in 
the 
past 
two 
years, 
it 
had 
organized 
regional 
pilot 
courses 
on 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
incidents 
involving 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
Romania 
had 
recently 
made 
another 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
Fund 
thereby 
reaffirming 
its 
commitment 
to 
strengthening 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
area 
in 
the 
future. 
84. 
His 
delegation 
supported 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
plan 
for 
2006 
to 
2009. 
The 
activities 
proposed 
in 
the 
new 
plan 
would 
contribute 
to 
further 
enhancing 
nuclear 
security 
in 
Member 
States 
in 
such 
crucial 
areas 
as 
needs 
assessment, 
analysis 
and 
coordination, 
prevention, 
detection 
and 
response. 
85. 
He 
reiterated 
his 
delegationÂs 
support 
for 
all 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
for 
its 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
through 
competence, 
confidence 
and 
multilateral 
cooperation. 
That 

GC(49)/OR.2

support 
was 
reflected, 
inter 
alia, 
in 
the 
prompt 
and 
full 
payment 
of 
RomaniaÂs 
assessed 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
of 
its 
pledges 
to 
the 
TCF. 


86. 
Mr. 
MATOUQ 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
Member 
States 
because 
of 
the 
direct 
economic 
benefits 
that 
accrued 
from 
such 
cooperation 
in 
most 
areas 
of 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
and 
health. 
The 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
was 
greatly 
indebted 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
valuable 
assistance 
in 
recent 
years, 
particularly 
in 
the 
priority 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
groundwater 
resource 
management. 
87. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
African 
regional 
cooperation, 
his 
country 
had 
hosted 
a 
coordination 
meeting 
attended 
by 
15 
African 
States 
on 
sustaining 
regional 
capability 
in 
maintenance 
and 
repair, 
and 
a 
coordination 
meeting 
attended 
by 
20 
African 
States 
on 
strengthening 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients 
and 
medical 
exposure 
control. 
88. 
He 
welcomed 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
applications, 
especially 
the 
use 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
in 
water 
resource 
management 
and 
the 
plan 
for 
producing 
potable 
water 
economically 
using 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
reactors. 
His 
country 
accorded 
special 
attention 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
seawater 
desalination 
and 
was 
keen 
to 
participate 
in 
CRPs 
in 
that 
area 
and 
to 
join 
INPRO. 
89. 
Libya 
supported 
all 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
It 
was 
currently 
restructuring 
the 
Radiation 
Monitoring 
and 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Agency 
and 
enacting 
legislation 
that 
would 
enable 
it 
to 
operate 
independently. 
It 
was 
also 
modernizing 
regulatory 
and 
safety 
arrangements 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Tajoura 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
and 
was 
seeking 
to 
supply 
the 
reactors 
with 
low-enriched 
fuel 
instead 
of 
the 
high-enriched 
fuel 
that 
was 
returned 
to 
the 
supplier 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
aegis. 
90. 
His 
countryÂs 
consistent 
opposition 
to 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
was 
attested 
by 
its 
active 
participation 
in 
most 
meetings 
on 
the 
subject 
convened 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Disarmament 
Commission 
and 
by 
its 
ratification 
of 
a 
number 
of 
relevant 
treaties. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
Great 
Green 
Document 
on 
Human 
Rights 
in 
the 
Age 
of 
the 
Masses 
promulgated 
by 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
in 
1989, 
which 
prohibited 
the 
use 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
his 
country 
had 
decided 
in 
December 
2003 
voluntarily 
to 
divest 
itself 
of 
all 
equipment 
and 
to 
end 
all 
programmes 
that 
might 
lead 
to 
the 
production 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
weapons. 
91. 
The 
failure 
of 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
to 
heed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
repeated 
calls 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
safeguards 
agreements 
was 
perhaps 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that, 
notwithstanding 
the 
JamahiriyaÂs 
voluntary 
renunciation 
of 
the 
means 
to 
produce 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
transparency 
and 
credibility 
it 
had 
demonstrated 
in 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
other 
parties 
concerned, 
it 
had 
not 
received 
any 
guarantees 
of 
non-aggression 
or 
protection 
of 
its 
national 
security 
against 
the 
use 
or 
threat 
of 
the 
use 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Its 
initiative 
had 
not 
led 
either 
to 
any 
offers 
of 
assistance 
from 
developed 
countries 
in 
enhancing 
its 
capacity 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
to 
enhance 
the 
well-being 
of 
the 
Libyan 
people. 
States 
that 
had 
contemplated 
following 
LibyaÂs 
example 
were 
now 
having 
second 
thoughts. 
He 
therefore 
urged 
the 
developed 
countries 
to 
respond 
to 
LibyaÂs 
request 
for 
economic, 
political 
and 
security 
assistance. 
92. 
In 
its 
1996 
Advisory 
Opinion, 
the 
International 
Court 
of 
Justice 
had 
unanimously 
held 
that 
Â[t]here 
exists 
an 
obligation 
to 
pursue 
in 
good 
faith 
and 
bring 
to 
a 
conclusion 
negotiations 
leading 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
in 
all 
its 
aspects 
under 
strict 
and 
effective 
international 
controlÂ. 
Unfortunately, 
countries 
outside 
the 
NPT, 
including 
Israel, 
had 
developed 
a 
military 
nuclear 
capacity 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
certain 
other 
countries, 
a 
fact 
that 
had 
undermined 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
thereby 
posing 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
rid 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
all

weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
to 
insist 
that 
all 
States 
accept 
international 
verification 
and 
inspection 
of 
their 
nuclear 
facilities. 
He 
drew 
attention 
in 
that 
regard 
to 
a 
series 
of 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
beginning 
in 
1974 
and 
to 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
which 
urged 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
consider 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
to 
place 
their 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
It 
had 
become 
more 
urgent 
than 
ever 
to 
recognize 
the 
fundamental 
role 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
preserving 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
through 
the 
twin 
pillars 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
He 
further 
stressed 
the 
need 
for 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime. 
Moreover, 
unless 
the 
nuclear 
weapon 
States 
eliminated 
their 
arsenals 
and 
halted 
all 
programmes 
to 
produce 
and 
develop 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
the 
NPT 
would 
remain 
a 
dead 
letter. 


93. 
He 
regretted 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
representation 
of 
developing 
countries 
on 
its 
staff 
had 
so 
far 
made 
little 
progress. 
It 
was 
particularly 
important 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
wide 
range 
of 
expertise 
now 
available 
in 
those 
countries 
to 
fill 
high-level 
positions. 
94. 
Mr. 
AL-ATHEL 
(Saudi 
Arabia) 
said 
the 
success 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
depended 
on 
its 
safety 
and 
economic 
benefits. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
continually 
increasing 
global 
demand 
for 
energy, 
developing 
countries 
benefited 
greatly 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
drawing 
up 
energy 
plans 
that 
catered 
to 
their 
needs 
and 
that 
took 
into 
account 
their 
economic, 
environmental 
and 
social 
circumstances. 
95. 
Some 
of 
the 
greatest 
challenges 
facing 
the 
Agency 
were 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
the 
disposal 
of 
radioactive 
waste, 
the 
ageing 
nuclear 
workforce, 
which 
had 
prompted 
the 
Agency 
to 
focus 
on 
promoting 
nuclear 
knowledge 
through 
educational 
networks 
and 
training 
opportunities, 
and 
the 
conversion 
of 
research 
reactors 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU. 
96. 
Saudi 
Arabia 
supported 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
related 
to 
industry, 
the 
environment 
and 
health, 
to 
increase 
food 
production 
and 
to 
ensure 
efficient 
water 
resource 
management 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
International 
Decade 
for 
Action, 
ÂWater 
for 
LifeÂ 
(2005Â2015). 
97. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
an 
important 
mechanism 
for 
strengthening 
national 
scientific, 
technological 
and 
regulatory 
capacities 
and 
enhancing 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
countries. 
The 
difficulty 
of 
guaranteeing 
adequate 
funding, 
however, 
demonstrated 
the 
need 
to 
finance 
the 
programme 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
He 
proposed 
that 
the 
beneficiary 
States 
bear 
a 
greater 
share 
of 
the 
costs 
of 
project 
implementation 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
implementation 
of 
approved 
projects. 
98. 
He 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
develop 
and 
apply 
radiation 
safety 
standards, 
to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
to 
review 
the 
regime 
of 
civil 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage. 
99. 
He 
noted 
with 
some 
concern 
countriesÂ 
growing 
dependence 
on 
international 
support 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
strengthening 
their 
capacity 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
new 
nuclear 
security 
plan 
and 
measures 
to 
detect 
clandestine 
nuclear 
trafficking 
networks 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
theft 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials. 
100. 
With 
regard 
to 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
concluded 
in 
the 
light 
of 
its 
verification 
reports 
that 
were 
no 
indications 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
proliferation 
activities. 
However, 
its 
authority 
to 
verify 
the 
existence 
of 
nuclear 
weaponization 
activities 
was 
extremely 
limited. 
101. 
A 
number 
of 
verification 
measures 
were 
being 
held 
in 
abeyance 
for 
some 
60 
countries 
that 
had 
signed 
small 
quantities 
protocols 
to 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
thereby 
reducing 
the 
expenses 
incurred 
in 
respect 
of 
safeguards 
activities. 
Saudi 
Arabia 
considered 
that 
the 
recent 
proposal 

GC(49)/OR.2

that 
the 
Agency 
should 
refrain 
from 
adopting 
such 
protocols 
should 
be 
backed 
up 
by 
an 
objective 
comprehensive 
study. 


102. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
decision 
to 
establish 
a 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
committee, 
which 
should 
endorse 
existing 
international 
resolutions 
that 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
apply 
integrated 
safeguards 
to 
all 
countries 
with 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
States 
that 
violated 
their 
safeguards 
agreement 
should 
be 
prohibited 
from 
sitting 
on 
the 
committee 
or 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
That 
would 
hopefully 
persuade 
all 
countries 
possessing 
nuclear 
technology, 
including 
Israel, 
to 
sign 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
to 
permit 
international 
verification 
of 
their 
facilities. 
103. 
Saudi 
Arabia 
called 
on 
all 
peace-loving 
nations 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
promoting 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
disarmament 
as 
the 
foundation 
of 
international 
security 
and 
stability. 
His 
country 
had 
acceded 
to 
all 
international 
treaties 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
supported 
steps 
to 
create 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, 
especially 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Saudi 
Arabia 
was 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
June 
2005 
as 
well 
as 
a 
small 
quantities 
protocol, 
since 
his 
country 
had 
no 
nuclear 
plants 
or 
reactors 
and 
engaged 
in 
no 
nuclear 
activities 
that 
would 
require 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards. 
104. 
While 
Saudi 
Arabia 
supported 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
safeguard 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
in 
countries 
that 
used 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
it 
considered 
at 
the 
same 
time 
that 
countries 
wishing 
to 
acquire 
or 
modernize 
such 
technology 
should 
be 
able 
to 
count 
on 
the 
support 
of 
the 
developed 
countries. 
105. 
Mr. 
BUGAT 
(France) 
said 
that 
ensuring 
respect 
for 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
was 
one 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
key 
tasks. 
While 
no 
consensus 
document 
on 
substantive 
points 
had 
been 
adopted 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
it 
had 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
reaffirm 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
NPT, 
which 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Growing 
concerns 
over 
proliferation 
showed 
that 
the 
regime 
needed 
strengthening. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
acquire 
means 
to 
respond 
effectively 
in 
cases 
of 
failure 
to 
comply 
or 
non-compliance 
with 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
and 
continue 
the 
debate 
on 
adequate 
responses 
when 
States 
withdrew 
from 
the 
NPT. 
To 
prevent 
proliferation, 
stricter 
controls 
were 
needed 
on 
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
most 
sensitive 
technology, 
equipment 
and 
nuclear 
materials, 
with 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
relevant 
regulations. 
Such 
measures 
must 
not, 
however, 
run 
counter 
to 
the 
legitimate 
development 
needs 
of 
those 
States 
that 
honoured 
their 
international 
commitments. 
Under 
conditions 
yet 
to 
be 
specified, 
those 
States 
should 
be 
given 
assurance 
of 
access 
to 
non-sensitive 
technology 
and 
equipment 
and 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
associated 
services. 
106. 
A 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
combined 
with 
an 
additional 
protocol 
should 
be 
the 
norm 
to 
ensure 
the 
credibility 
of 
international 
verification 
and 
to 
show 
the 
commitment 
to 
and 
respect 
for 
the 
NPT 
by 
States 
Party. 
France 
had 
long 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
universal 
application 
of 
those 
two 
instruments 
and 
had 
participated 
in 
relevant 
initiatives 
undertaken 
by 
the 
G8 
and 
the 
EU. 
It 
had 
submitted 
an 
updated 
initial 
declaration 
in 
Mary 
2005 
with 
respect 
to 
its 
additional 
protocol, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
on 
30 
April 
2004. 
107. 
His 
delegation 
had 
followed 
with 
interest 
the 
work 
of 
the 
SAGSI, 
which 
contributed 
to 
enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
safeguards. 
France 
welcomed 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification, 
which 
would 
hopefully 
commence 
its 
work 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
108. 
Effective 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
was 
crucial. 
To 
that 
end, 
high-level 
dialogue 
should 
be 
strengthened 
with 
a 
view 
to 
meeting 
challenges 
that 
arose. 
Increased 
cooperation 
would 
further 
enhance 
the 
achievements 
already 
obtained 
at 
the 
EU 
level.

109. 
Three 
years 
after 
disclosure 
of 
the 
clandestine 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
the 
international 
community 
remained 
concerned 
over 
the 
true 
purpose 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
According 
to 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
recent 
report, 
full 
cooperation 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Iranian 
authorities 
had 
not 
been 
forthcoming 
and 
a 
number 
of 
important 
issues 
were 
still 
outstanding. 
110. 
In 
November 
2004, 
Germany, 
France 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
High 
Representative 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
had 
concluded 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Iranian 
authorities, 
which 
had 
undertaken 
to 
suspend 
all 
enrichment 
related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
In 
all 
its 
relevant 
resolutions, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
underlined 
that 
full 
implementation 
of 
those 
commitments 
was 
crucial 
to 
restoring 
confidence 
and 
resolving 
outstanding 
issues. 
The 
Board 
had 
also 
requested 
the 
suspension 
of 
the 
heavy 
water 
research 
reactor 
project. 
The 
resumption 
of 
conversion 
activities 
at 
the 
Esfahan 
facility 
on 
1 
August, 
contrary 
to 
repeated 
calls 
from 
the 
Agency, 
and 
the 
refusal 
to 
consider 
the 
assistance 
offer 
from 
Germany, 
France 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
November 
Paris 
agreement 
were 
not 
conducive 
to 
restoring 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
In 
response, 
in 
August 
2005, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
reiterated 
its 
call 
to 
Iran 
to 
suspend 
its 
conversion 
activities 
to 
restore 
international 
confidence, 
had 
further 
underscored 
the 
need 
to 
resolve 
outstanding 
issues 
and 
had 
invited 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
report 
on 
the 
issue 
on 
3 
September. 
111. 
The 
Board 
had 
approved 
a 
resolution 
that 
gave 
a 
clear 
and 
objective 
account 
of 
the 
situation 
and 
left 
the 
door 
open 
for 
negotiations. 
The 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
clarifying 
outstanding 
issues 
and 
monitoring 
the 
suspension. 
Conditions 
permitting, 
France 
remained 
committed 
to 
finding 
a 
solution 
through 
dialogue. 
112. 
France 
had 
followed 
closely 
the 
work 
of 
the 
International 
Expert 
Group 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle 
established 
by 
the 
Director 
General. 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
GroupÂs 
activities 
and 
its 
report 
were 
commendable 
and 
his 
delegation 
looked 
forward 
to 
learning 
of 
the 
latest 
developments 
in 
that 
regard. 
113. 
France 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
to 
the 
early 
implementation 
of 
the 
international 
monitoring 
system. 
Also, 
it 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
negotiations 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
on 
a 
treaty 
prohibiting 
the 
production 
of 
fissile 
materials 
for 
nuclear 
weapons. 
114. 
The 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
was 
another 
cause 
for 
grave 
concern 
and 
the 
international 
community 
had 
endeavoured 
to 
attenuate 
that 
threat 
by 
enhancing 
existing 
nuclear 
security 
measures. 
While 
responsibility 
for 
such 
action 
primarily 
fell 
to 
States, 
international 
cooperation 
was 
vital. 
115. 
The 
Agency 
by 
its 
very 
nature 
played 
a 
prominent 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
facilities. 
France 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
field 
by 
providing 
financial 
and 
technical 
support. 
On 
27 
April 
2005, 
it 
had 
signed 
a 
nuclear 
security 
arrangement 
with 
the 
Agency 
that 
provided 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
assistance 
programme 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
physical 
protection, 
security 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
improvement 
of 
national 
systems 
and 
accession 
to 
relevant 
international 
instruments. 
With 
regard 
to 
physical 
protection, 
France 
welcomed 
the 
consensus 
adoption 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
in 
Vienna 
in 
July 
2005, 
which, 
once 
in 
force, 
would 
strengthen 
the 
Convention 
considerably. 
116. 
The 
risk 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
being 
used 
for 
terrorist 
or 
malicious 
acts 
made 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
particularly 
important. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
G8, 
France 
had 
hosted 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
held 
in 
Bordeaux 
in 
June 
2005. 
The 
Conference 
had 
evaluated 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
outlined 
future 
perspectives. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
revised 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 

GC(49)/OR.2

Sources, 
the 
Conference 
had 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
efforts 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
principles 
contained 
therein. 


117. 
France 
had 
always 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
and 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
had 
provided 
expertise 
and 
training, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radiation 
protection. 
It 
also 
provided 
ongoing 
support 
for 
activities 
undertaken 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
AFRA 
and 
ARCAL 
through 
the 
financing 
of 
several 
footnote-a/ 
projects, 
and 
by 
contributing 
French 
experts. 
France 
contributed 
regularly 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
funding 
difficulties 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
All 
Member 
States 
had 
a 
common 
responsibility 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
thus 
enabling 
it 
to 
fulfil 
its 
promotional 
mandate. 
118. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
had 
facilitated 
progress 
in 
many 
areas. 
He 
urged 
States 
that 
had 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
had 
not 
yet 
acceded 
to 
the 
Convention 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
France 
had 
sent 
its 
national 
report 
and 
contributed 
actively 
to 
the 
review 
meeting 
in 
April 
2005. 
119. 
France 
would 
participate, 
in 
May 
2006, 
in 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
and 
the 
organizational 
meeting 
scheduled 
for 
November 
2004. 
In 
order 
to 
win 
international 
confidence 
in 
spent 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
the 
broadest 
possible 
adherence 
to 
the 
Convention 
was 
vital. 
120. 
France 
was 
contributing 
actively 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Transport 
of 
Radioactive 
Material, 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
March 
2004. 
It 
was 
engaged 
in 
consultations 
with 
its 
partners 
and 
with 
coastal 
States 
to 
enhance 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
confidence 
in 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
maritime 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
121. 
During 
2004, 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
progress 
and 
transparency, 
France 
had 
received 
a 
TranSAS 
mission, 
which 
had 
drawn 
very 
positive 
conclusions 
regarding 
the 
French 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Authority. 
A 
TranSAS 
mission 
was 
planned 
to 
Japan, 
following 
those 
to 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
France, 
which 
would 
allow 
that 
country 
to 
benefit 
from 
an 
international 
evaluation 
of 
its 
practices 
relating 
to 
the 
safety 
of 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
122. 
France 
had 
requested 
an 
IRRT 
review 
in 
2007. 
An 
external 
evaluation 
could 
only 
help 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
activities 
carried 
out 
by 
its 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Authority. 
France 
had 
also 
requested 
an 
OSART 
mission, 
as 
it 
had 
done 
every 
year 
since 
1985 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safety 
of 
its 
operational 
facilities. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
the 
decade, 
all 
of 
France's 
nuclear 
facilities 
would 
have 
received 
an 
OSART 
mission. 
He 
reiterated 
his 
country's 
full 
support 
for 
the 
Agency's 
nuclear 
safety 
activities. 
123. 
Nuclear 
power 
as 
a 
means 
of 
ensuring 
sustainable 
economic 
development 
was 
enjoying 
a 
revival. 
That 
renewed 
interest 
had 
led 
the 
Director 
General, 
with 
the 
OECD/NEA 
and 
the 
French 
authorities, 
to 
organize 
an 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
in 
March 
2005, 
which 
had 
brought 
together 
400 
delegates 
from 
74 
countries. 
The 
success 
of 
that 
Conference 
had 
sent 
a 
clear 
signal 
of 
the 
renewed 
global 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
to 
meet 
growing 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
future, 
while 
taking 
into 
account 
public 
concerns 
and 
expectations, 
particularly 
regarding 
development 
and 
the 
environment. 
Delegates 
had 
delineated 
the 
energy 
situation 
in 
their 
countries 
and 
their 
vision 
for 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
they 
had 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
a 
diversified 
energy 
mix, 
and 
they 
had 
recognized 
the 
economic 
advantages 
of 
nuclear 
electricity 
generation 
in 
terms 
of 
economy, 
sustainable 
access, 
and 
low 
CO2 
emissions. 
In 
that 
context, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
involve 
the 
emerging 
countries. 
The 
energy 
choices 
they 
made 
would 
be 
crucial 
in 
the 
next 
50 
years. 
He 
underlined 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
that 
regard 
recently 
by 
France 
and 
India. 
124. 
For 
more 
than 
30 
years, 
France 
had 
pursued 
an 
energy 
policy 
which 
was 
largely 
reliant 
on 
nuclear 
power, 
ensuring 
high 
energy 
independence. 
In 
2004, 
FranceÂs 
58 
operating 
reactors 
accounted 
for 
more 
than 
78% 
of 
electricity 
generation. 
The 
major 
role 
of 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
formally

confirmed 
in 
a 
law 
passed 
on 
13 
July 
2005, 
which 
had 
fixed 
the 
priorities 
of 
French 
energy 
policy 
until 
2015. 


125. 
A 
1600 
MW 
unit 
of 
the 
European 
pressurised 
water 
reactor 
(EPR), 
a 
reactor 
with 
enhanced 
industrial 
and 
environmental 
performance 
and 
increased 
safety, 
was 
due 
to 
be 
constructed 
on 
the 
EDF 
site 
at 
Flamanville. 
A 
public 
debate 
was 
being 
organized 
for 
the 
period 
from 
October 
2005 
to 
February 
2006 
in 
FranceÂs 
major 
cities 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
commissioning 
of 
a 
demonstration 
reactor 
under 
optimal 
conditions 
between 
2011 
and 
2012. 
126. 
Progress 
had 
also 
been 
made 
in 
the 
long-term 
management 
of 
long-lived 
high-level 
nuclear 
waste. 
Under 
the 
law 
of 
30 
December 
1991, 
a 
global 
evaluation 
report 
was 
due 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
parliament 
by 
mid-2006 
accompanied 
by, 
as 
appropriate, 
a 
draft 
law 
authorizing 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
storage 
facility 
for 
long-lived 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste. 
The 
French 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(CEA) 
and 
the 
National 
Agency 
for 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
(ANDRA) 
had 
been 
particularly 
involved 
and 
a 
public 
debate 
would 
be 
held 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
2006 
deadline. 
127. 
In 
June 
2005 
in 
Moscow, 
it 
had 
been 
decided 
to 
site 
ITER 
at 
Cadarache 
Â 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
electricity 
generation 
by 
controlled 
thermonuclear 
fusion. 
All 
the 
partners 
now 
faced 
a 
significant 
technological 
and 
organizational 
challenge, 
which 
they 
were 
working 
hard 
to 
meet. 
Discussions 
had 
also 
been 
under 
way 
regarding 
the 
drawing 
up 
of 
a 
joint 
implementation 
agreement. 
He 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contribution 
to 
that 
ambitious 
project. 
128. 
International 
cooperation 
was 
essential 
to 
producing 
a 
new 
generation 
of 
innovative 
systems 
which 
were 
more 
competitive, 
safer 
and 
more 
proliferation-resistant, 
produced 
less 
long-lived 
waste, 
could 
meet 
the 
world's 
energy 
needs, 
and 
could 
ensure 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development. 
For 
that 
reason, 
France 
was 
actively 
participating 
in 
GIF. 
In 
February 
2005, 
France, 
along 
with 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
Canada, 
Japan 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
had 
signed 
a 
framework 
agreement 
which 
marked 
the 
entry 
into 
the 
operational 
cooperation 
phase. 
France 
was 
also 
participating 
in 
the 
INPRO 
Steering 
Committee, 
which 
could 
make 
contributions 
with 
respect 
to 
evaluation 
methodologies 
in 
the 
Agency's 
specific 
fields 
of 
expertise. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
France 
attached 
to 
the 
complementary 
nature 
of, 
and 
coordination 
between, 
GIF 
and 
INPRO. 
129. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
reiterated 
the 
importance 
his 
country 
attached 
to 
the 
preservation 
of 
nuclear 
energyÂs 
role 
in 
global 
power 
generation 
and 
its 
contribution 
to 
progress 
and 
sustainable 
development 
of 
mankind 
and 
the 
planet. 
The 
Agency 
contributed 
to 
that 
objective 
by 
helping 
to 
ensure 
peace 
and 
international 
security 
and 
by 
assisting 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
countries 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
He 
assured 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
FranceÂs 
full 
support 
in 
the 
accomplishment 
of 
those 
missions. 
130. 
Mr. 
PLACHKOV 
(Ukraine) 
said 
that 
the 
past 
years 
had 
been 
critical 
in 
the 
development 
of 
UkraineÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
sector. 
In 
2005, 
Ukraine 
had 
commissioned 
two 
new 
1000 
MW 
nuclear 
power 
units. 
Now, 
atomic 
power 
plants 
were 
generating 
about 
half 
of 
the 
electricity 
consumed, 
providing 
the 
country 
with 
cheap, 
safe 
and 
ecologically 
clean 
electricity. 
Nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
therefore 
remained 
a 
high 
priority. 
Achievement 
of 
adequate 
safety 
levels 
depended 
not 
only 
on 
UkraineÂs 
own 
highly-qualified 
scientific 
and 
technical 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
but 
also 
on 
broad 
international 
cooperation. 
131. 
Confidence 
in 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
been 
restored 
in 
Ukraine 
and 
there 
were 
now 
new 
complex 
and 
crucial 
challenges 
facing 
its 
nuclear 
energy 
sector. 
His 
Government 
saw 
the 
nuclear 
sector 
as 
an 
important 
element 
in 
ensuring 
UkraineÂs 
sustained 
development. 
Furthermore, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
fossil 
fuel 
markets, 
it 
expected 
the 
global 
significance 
of 
UkraineÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
sector 
to 
grow 
in 
the 
future. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
domestic 
energy 
security, 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
remain 
a 
crucial 
constituent 
of 
the 
long-term 
electricity 
generation 
mix. 
The 

GC(49)/OR.2 
26 
September 
2005, 
Page 
20 


Government 
was 
therefore 
formulating 
a 
number 
of 
conceptual 
long-term 
energy 
policy 
documents. 
The 
draft 
concept 
for 
developing 
the 
fuel 
and 
energy 
infrastructure 
by 
2030 
envisaged 
keeping 
the 
same 
mix 
of 
nuclear 
and 
fossil-fuel 
based 
power 
plants. 
An 
important 
element 
of 
the 
concept 
was 
reorientation 
of 
the 
economy 
from 
imported 
fossil 
fuels 
to 
the 
consumption 
of 
electricity, 
including 
that 
generated 
by 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
With 
electricity 
consumption 
expected 
to 
increase 
more 
than 
twofold 
by 
2030, 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
sector 
would 
need 
to 
increase 
output 
significantly. 
That 
would 
be 
achieved 
by 
extending 
the 
operating 
life 
of 
existing 
power 
plant 
units 
and 
by 
building 
new 
units. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Ukraine 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
through 
its 
INPRO 
programme 
and 
would 
participate 
actively 
in 
it. 


132. 
Wider 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
would 
be 
illogical 
without 
suitable 
approaches 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
and 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
As 
to 
the 
first 
problem, 
Ukraine 
intended 
to 
use 
its 
own 
sufficient 
uranium 
reserves. 
It 
was 
willing 
to 
develop 
broad 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
the 
production 
of 
uranium 
concentrate, 
materials 
and 
components 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
with 
all 
interested 
partners. 
With 
regard 
to 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel, 
Ukraine 
was 
looking 
into 
the 
possibility 
of 
constructing 
a 
long-term 
dry 
storage 
repository. 
Radioactive 
waste 
management 
required 
the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
strategy 
and 
the 
use 
of 
an 
integrated 
approach, 
which 
also 
included 
work 
to 
be 
done 
on 
decommissioning 
the 
Chernobyl 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
building 
a 
new 
confinement 
over 
the 
destroyed 
Unit 
4. 
133. 
For 
Ukraine, 
the 
country 
to 
have 
suffered 
the 
largest 
nuclear 
energy 
related 
disaster, 
ensuring 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
remained 
a 
central 
concern. 
The 
safety 
level 
of 
UkraineÂs 
operating 
units 
complied 
with 
modern 
requirements 
and 
were 
equivalent 
to 
those 
of 
similar 
units 
in 
other 
European 
countries. 
A 
safety 
enhancement 
programme 
was 
currently 
under 
way, 
the 
most 
important 
tasks 
of 
which 
would 
be 
implemented 
over 
the 
coming 
three 
to 
five 
years. 
Ukraine, 
which 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
aimed 
at 
increasing 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
facilities, 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
third 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
which 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
Vienna 
on 
11-22 
April 
2005. 
UkraineÂs 
third 
national 
report, 
submitted 
under 
the 
Convention, 
showed 
that 
the 
safety 
approaches 
being 
applied 
were 
correct. 
Ukraine 
regarded 
the 
recommendations 
and 
proposals 
of 
that 
meeting 
as 
a 
programme 
of 
action 
for 
it 
to 
follow 
in 
the 
future. 
134. 
His 
country 
also 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
knowledge 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
Relevant 
regional 
projects 
carried 
out 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
were 
highly 
important 
in 
that 
regard, 
as 
were 
the 
AgencyÂs 
missions 
to 
assess 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
its 
activities 
to 
draw 
up 
and 
review 
safety 
standards. 
135. 
Like 
many 
other 
countries 
with 
a 
well-developed 
nuclear 
infrastructure, 
Ukraine 
was 
concerned 
about 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
threat 
of 
terrorism 
at 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
the 
unlawful 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials. 
It 
supported 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
Member 
States 
to 
prevent 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
strengthening 
the 
regime 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
While 
all 
facilities 
in 
Ukraine 
ensured 
the 
required 
level 
of 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
technical 
assistance 
from 
other 
countries 
to 
increase 
that 
level 
would 
be 
appreciated. 
No 
additional 
effort 
on 
that 
score 
could 
be 
too 
much. 
The 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
Member 
States 
to 
prevent 
the 
illegal 
handling 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
were 
also 
important. 
Ukraine 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
take 
measures 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
136. 
Overcoming 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident 
remained 
a 
central 
concern, 
which 
consumed 
a 
substantial 
part 
of 
the 
State 
budget 
and 
significant 
amounts 
of 
international 
aid. 
In 
the 
20 
years 
since 
the 
accident, 
much 
experience 
and 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
scientific 
data 
had 
been 
obtained. 
However, 
the 
passing 
of 
years 
had 
by 
no 
means 
diminished 
the 
many 
pressing 
questions. 
A 
wide 
range 
of 
work, 
much 
of 
it 
unique, 
was 
being 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
Chernobyl 
site 
related 
to 
decommissioning 
of 

GC(49)/OR.2

the 
plant. 
Special 
attention 
was 
being 
paid 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
requirements. 
Resources 
from 
the 
Ukrainian 
budget 
and 
from 
a 
number 
of 
technical 
assistance 
programmes 
were 
being 
used 
and 
well-known 
foreign 
companies 
were 
participating. 
Unfortunately 
substantial 
delays 
were 
being 
encountered. 


137. 
The 
Ukrainian 
Government 
would 
be 
marking 
the 
20th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident 
in 
2006. 
The 
main 
event 
would 
be 
an 
international 
conference 
on 
its 
results 
and 
the 
future 
outlook. 
The 
Secretariat, 
interested 
Member 
States, 
companies 
working 
to 
overcome 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
accident 
and 
other 
organizations 
were 
all 
invited 
to 
take 
part. 
138. 
The 
Agency 
was 
playing 
an 
invaluable 
role 
in 
helping 
to 
solve 
the 
problems 
related 
to 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident. 
Its 
assistance 
manifested 
itself 
both 
in 
the 
funding 
of 
projects 
and 
in 
attracting 
the 
best 
experience 
from 
the 
international 
nuclear 
community. 
Ukraine 
thanked 
donor 
countries 
for 
their 
efforts. 
139. 
One 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
main 
tasks 
was 
verification 
of 
non-proliferation. 
As 
a 
country 
that 
had 
voluntarily 
renounced 
nuclear 
weapons, 
Ukraine 
called 
upon 
the 
international 
community 
to 
spare 
no 
effort 
to 
bolster 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
An 
important 
instrument 
in 
that 
regime 
was 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
Ukraine, 
for 
its 
part, 
was 
finalizing 
procedures 
aimed 
at 
implementation 
of 
its 
additional 
protocol. 
140. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
made 
a 
considerable 
contribution 
to 
addressing 
tasks 
related 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
Ukraine 
was 
involved 
in 
both 
regional 
and 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
Aspects 
given 
high 
priority 
under 
UkraineÂs 
CPF 
were: 
extending 
the 
operating 
lifetime 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants; 
a 
comprehensive 
solution 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
nuclear 
power 
plant; 
a 
national 
strategy 
for 
radioactive 
waste 
management; 
and, 
improving 
the 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
regulatory 
system. 
Ukraine 
expected 
to 
sign 
its 
CPF 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
141. 
Ms. 
TCHUINTE 
(Cameroon) 
said 
she 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
emphasis 
placed 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Annual 
Report 
2004 
on 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
promoting 
development 
through 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
such 
spheres 
as 
agriculture, 
food, 
human 
and 
animal 
health, 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
and 
the 
environment. 
She 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
support 
of 
development 
and 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
under 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Reaffirming 
CameroonÂs 
full 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives, 
she 
said 
it 
would 
do 
all 
it 
could 
to 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Her 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
working 
with 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
bring 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity 
for 
all 
peoples. 
142. 
The 
NPTÂs 
objectives 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
encourage 
disarmament 
were 
increasingly 
under 
threat. 
There 
were 
thousands 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
existence 
in 
Member 
States 
and 
in 
States 
not 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
The 
Government 
of 
Cameroon 
had 
recently 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
thereto, 
a 
small 
quantities 
protocol, 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention, 
and 
had 
taken 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
Conference 
to 
Consider 
and 
Adopt 
Proposed 
Amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
in 
Vienna 
in 
July 
2005. 
That 
was 
evidence 
of 
CameroonÂs 
support 
of 
efforts 
by 
the 
international 
community 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
or 
any 
other 
illicit 
use 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
or 
radiological 
dispersion 
devices. 
143. 
It 
was 
nevertheless 
important 
to 
remember 
that 
security 
and 
stability 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
in 
an 
environment 
marked 
by 
increasing 
rifts 
between 
cultures 
and 
civilizations, 
and 
between 
the 
rich 
and 
the 
poor. 
The 
chronic 
lack 
of 
good 
governance 
and 
respect 
for 
human 
rights 
in 
many 
regions 
was 
also 
a 
limiting 
factor. 
The 
Government 
of 
Cameroon 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
dangers 
posed 
by 
such 
uncertainties

and 
was 
keen 
to 
see 
a 
reduction 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
nuclear 
threats. 
In 
that 
connection, 
it 
hoped 
to 
see 
fresh 
initiatives 
under 
Agency 
auspices 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 


144. 
Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
decade, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
been 
paying 
increasing 
attention 
to 
peace, 
security, 
development, 
eradicating 
poverty 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
areas 
identified 
as 
priorities 
by 
the 
Millennium 
Summit 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
was 
also 
increasing. 
With 
regard 
to 
scientific 
and 
technical 
cooperation, 
Cameroon 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
support 
it 
given 
over 
many 
years 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
general, 
and 
to 
Cameroon 
in 
particular. 
Such 
cooperation 
enhanced 
national 
competences 
and 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
strategies 
for 
development 
and 
combating 
poverty. 
Cameroon 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
work 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
domains 
of 
human 
health 
and 
in 
particular 
cancer 
control, 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources, 
animal 
health 
and 
production, 
agriculture, 
food 
and 
desertification. 
Also 
important 
were 
its 
activities 
focusing 
on 
sustainable 
energy 
development, 
energy 
planning 
and 
evaluation 
of 
the 
environmental 
impact. 
145. 
Her 
Government 
had 
made 
the 
necessary 
arrangements 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
TCF. 
It 
was 
also 
making 
efforts 
to 
honour 
its 
commitments 
in 
terms 
of 
national 
participation 
costs. 
146. 
Cameroon 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
commitment 
to 
share 
knowledge 
in 
the 
area 
of 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Her 
country 
was 
taking 
steps 
to 
evaluate 
and 
organize 
nuclear 
knowledge 
with 
a 
view 
to 
making 
better 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
national 
development. 
147. 
In 
conclusion, 
she 
said 
that 
Cameroon 
was 
striving 
to 
improve 
its 
radiation 
safety 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations 
and 
was 
also 
making 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
its 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
radiation 
protection.

Arrangements 
for 
the 
Conference 
(a) 
Adoption 
of 
the 
agenda 
and 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion 
1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the agenda for the 
current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in documents GC(49)/1 and 
Add.1. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, the Committee had recommended 
that the items listed in those documents be taken up for initial discussion as indicated there. It had also 
recommended that the order of items be as proposed in those documents. 
2. The General CommitteeÂs recommendations were accepted. 
(b) 
Closing

and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(resumed) 
(GC(49)/5) 
5. Ms. MAGUBANE (South Africa) congratulated the Director General on his reappointment for a 
further term of office. The current challenges facing the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation 
regime required strong visionary leadership and her country believed that Mr. ElBaradei would 
continue to lead the Agency in a way that would ensure that its authority and integrity were preserved. 
He could count on South AfricaÂs fullest cooperation and support. She also offered her GovernmentÂs 
heartfelt condolences to the people of the United States of America and the Caribbean countries 
following the loss of life and suffering which had occurred in that region as a result of two hurricanes. 
6. The outcome of the NPT Review Conference in May 2005 had been a disappointment. The 
continued vitality and effectiveness of the NPT was dependent on the implementation of the Treaty 
regime as a whole. South Africa had consistently indicated that the continual reopening of the debate 
on obligations, commitments and undertakings might provide the logical foundation for others also to 
interpret, negate or withdraw from other parts of the NPT bargains. If agreements, arrived at at one 
conference were allowed to be rolled back at the next, the very premise upon which the multilateral 
system was based would be undermined. The case for non-proliferation rested on the NPTÂs primary 
objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons. There was growing concern that, while demands were 
being made for non-nuclear-weapon States to agree to new measures in the name of non-proliferation, 
concrete actions towards nuclear disarmament were being neglected. South Africa could not support 
unwarranted restrictions on the NPTÂs guarantee of access to nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes 
by States that were fully compliant with their obligations under the Treaty. The imposition of 
additional restrictive measures on some State Parties, while others were allowed access to such 

GC(49)/OR.3 
27 
September 
2005, 
Page 
2 


capabilities only served to exacerbate existing inequalities that were already inherent in the NPT and 
undermined one of its central bargains. 

7. South Africa was also disappointed that the Millennium Review Summit had failed to reach 
agreement on any non-proliferation and disarmament issues and hoped that Member States would 
heed the call by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to work together so that progress could 
be made on those important issues. 
8. Her country welcomed the outcome of the latest round of six-party talks on the DPRKÂs nuclear 
programme and welcomed reports that that country had agreed to abandon all nuclear weapons and 
return to full-scope safeguards and the NPT. It looked forward to the earliest finalization of that matter 
and the normalization of relations with the DPRK. As for the resolution on Iran adopted by the Board 
on 24 September 2005, South Africa urged all parties to continue to exercise maximum restraint and to 
work relentlessly for a sustainable and peaceful resolution of the matter through dialogue and 
negotiations. 
9. The global expansion of nuclear energy required increased international cooperation to ensure 
safety and security, including efforts that would prevent the exploitation of nuclear energy for 
non-peaceful purposes. South Africa was committed to the continuous review and strengthening of 
measures aimed at the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction both nationally and 
internationally. However, real progress in securing the world from the use or threat of use of nuclear 
weapons could only be achieved through concomitant progress in the area of nuclear disarmament. 
President Thabo Mbeki had recently stated that the situation should not be allowed to continue where 
nuclear weapon States obliged everyone merely to focus on the issue of non-proliferation while 
completely ignoring the demand of the overwhelming majority of humanity for the complete abolition 
of weapons of mass destruction, an objective South Africa had already achieved. 
10. South Africa was a country with abundant uranium resources and its integrated energy plan 
recognized the need for nuclear power to play a role in meeting its energy needs. The decision to 
proceed with the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project had been taken in the full understanding that its 
successful commissioning would contribute towards efforts aimed at meeting South AfricaÂs 
objectives of enhancing sustainable socio-economic development. Recent trends had shown a 
continued increase in the market price of uranium and her country believed that the time had come for 
its mining community to take advantage of that price increase and the increased viability of domestic 
value addition to uranium, and to begin to refocus efforts on the development of the resource. 
11. In July 2005, the South African Government had approved the conversion of the SAFARI 
research reactor at Pelindaba from HEU to LEU fuel. The Nuclear Energy Corporation of South Africa 
was progressing well with the establishment of technology for manufacturing LEU silicide fuel and 
the first lead test assemblies of that type would be loaded into the research reactor in the coming few 
months. 
12. The AgencyÂs peer review team had made a favourable report on the demonstration of the 
borehole disposal concept for spent sealed sources and the Nuclear Energy Corporation of South 
Africa had been contracted to design and construct a system for the safe handling of spent 
high-activity radiation sources. 
13. Under AFRA, South Africa had continued to send experts to participate in missions in AFRA 
member states in such fields as the promotion of national and regional self-reliance in nuclear science 
and technology, the conditioning and safe storage of spent sources and the auditing of nuclear 
medicine and radiotherapy facilities.

14. South Africa attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and was 
concerned about the inability of the TCF to meet the legitimate needs of developing countries. 
Technical cooperation activities had the potential to contribute to combating and eradicating poverty 
and underdevelopment within the framework of development targets such as the Millennium 
Development Goals and the targets of NEPAD. Furthermore, South Africa recognized the important 
contribution which the application of nuclear energy for peaceful uses could make to sustainable 
development. Her country had nine Agency technical cooperation projects, all of which were running 
well. The programme to eradicate fruit fly infestation in the Western Cape Province using the SIT had 
achieved remarkable success in its pilot phase and had been expanded to include other pests. South 
Africa was grateful to the Agency for the excellent support it was receiving under the technical 
cooperation programme. 
15. Her country supported the AgencyÂs initiatives for the strengthening of international 
cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety through active participation in the safety 
standards programme. It had recently submitted technical information, based on its experience, for the 
International Project on Evaluation and Demonstration of Safety for Decommissioning of Nuclear 
Facilities. The Basic Safety Standards were in wide use in her country which would like to see the 
comprehensive nature of that document retained in any future revision. South Africa had submitted its 
third national report under the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April 2005 and had undertaken a 
detailed review of the conclusions reached, with the objective of identifying future potential 
shortcomings and, where necessary, implementing preventive measures. South AfricaÂs Cabinet had 
approved ratification of the CPPNM and internal processes were under way for South Africa to 
become a party in the near future to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. The nuclear power sector had had a good safety 
record for a considerable period of time, and South AfricaÂs plan was to identify measures that would 
ensure that complacency did not creep in and challenge that record. There was a need to strengthen the 
safety review mechanism through training programmes with an increased focus on compliance 
assurance personnel. South Africa supported the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources together with the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
16. It was imperative that the Agency remain diligent in its efforts to ensure peaceful use of nuclear 
technology and South Africa remained committed to assisting in those efforts. 
17. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) congratulated the Director General on his re-election. 
18. Her country had continued to work with other countries to strengthen the global nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and verification. The recently created safeguards committee was an 
appropriate forum for the discussion of emerging challenges such as the updating of Annex II to the 
Model Additional Protocol, the obligations of States under United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1540, and export controls. 
19. The Czech Republic had initiated its safeguards support programme in 2003. Agency safeguards 
inspectors were being trained at Czech nuclear power plants and uranium mines. Her country had 
provided voluntary financial support for the re-engineering of the AgencyÂs safeguards information 
system, and called upon other Member States to do the same. 
20. Her country supported the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Through close cooperation with 
the United States, the Russian Federation and the Agency, it had returned approximately 6 kg of HEU 
to its country of origin at the end of 2004 and would soon be converting a training reactor from HEU 
to LEU fuel, returning HEU fuel elements to the Russian Federation. The Czech Republic was 
prepared to share its technology and expertise in that area.

21. In the area of nuclear security, the Czech Republic was preparing to ratify the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and had endorsed the amendments to the 
CPPNM adopted in July 2005. It had fulfilled its obligations under United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1540 and submitted its national report. It had contributed to the Nuclear Security Fund 
every year since the FundÂs inception, assisting with the financing of improved physical protection at 
the Medzamor nuclear power plant in Armenia and at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, 
and with the enhancement of capabilities for the detection of nuclear material and radiation sources in 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It would continue to provide highly focused support for 
nuclear non-proliferation and security activities. 
22. The security and safety of radioactive sources was another important aspect of nuclear safety 
and security. The Czech Republic had endorsed the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources and the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive 
Sources. It had provided both funding and expertise for the establishment of national registries of 
sources, the safe disposal of orphan sources and the creation of an appropriate legislative and 
institutional framework in the countries of the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia. Czech 
experts considered Radiation Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources Infrastructure Appraisal 
missions, combined with periodic self-assessment, the most appropriate tools for improving her 
countryÂs own performance in that area. With its long experience in the application of the ALARA 
principle, her country was ready to share its expertise in the coordination of ALARA networking. 
23. Minimizing the exposure of patients to radiation during medical treatment was a long-term goal 
in which the Agency played an important part. A Czech radiotherapy department had recently 
undergone one of the first international audits. Her country believed that systematic and sustainable 
training to upgrade the skills of medical staff, especially the younger generation, was essential. The 
Centre of Competence for Radiation Oncology, Radiology and Nuclear Medicine in the Czech 
Republic would disseminate the results achieved in that field. 
24. It was essential for the Agency to strike a balance between the increasing demand for its 
programmes and the resources available to it. Since the late 1990s, the Czech Government had made 
annual extrabudgetary contributions, in particular to the technical cooperation programme, the 
safeguards support programme and the Nuclear Security Fund. Those contributions amounted to over 
US $900 000. In future, her country would be striving to achieve more harmonized planning of its 
extrabudgetary contributions with Agency management, taking into account the overall work 
programme. 
25. In conclusion, she said that her country remained committed to playing its due role as a 
responsible member of the Agency. 
26. Mr. ABRAHAM (Haiti) said that the Annual Report for 2004 showed how much the AgencyÂs 
cooperation programme had been doing to meet the essential development needs of Member States. 
His Government had taken note with considerable interest of the AgencyÂs HIV-1 epidemiology and 
molecular immunology project, which testified to the organizationÂs commitment to the international 
effort to combat the AIDS virus. The Agency had implemented a number of technical cooperation 
projects in Haiti and his country was increasingly interested in the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy. With the AgencyÂs help, it hoped to attain the level of other countries in the Latin America and 
Caribbean region. 
27. The Agency had an important role to play in assisting countries to attain the Millennium 
Development Goals. To that end, it should give greater importance to a more incisive information 
policy to help overcome certain prejudices about nuclear energy, which were due largely to a 
misunderstanding of the potential of techniques used in the nuclear science and technology field. Haiti 

GC(49)/OR.3 
27 
September 
2005, 
Page 
5 


had ratified the ARCAL agreement with a view to contributing to the promotion of nuclear science 
and technology to the extent that its limited resources allowed. The Agency, which was cooperating 
with other international organizations such as the WHO and UNESCO on projects of interest to 
developing countries, should intensify such initiatives with a view to establishing a strategic 
partnership among United Nations bodies for providing assistance to countries in attaining the 
Millennium Development Goals. 

28. LDCs would have to make an enormous effort if they were to attain the Millennium 
Development Goals by 2015. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme already provided 
support in the areas of energy, water, agriculture and the environment. However, in view of the special 
needs of LDCs, he urged the Agency to set up a working group to deal with those needs and help the 
LDCs close the gap in nuclear science and technology and devise and implement a policy for the 
management of expertise. Tangible success in that endeavour would have a positive impact on the 
organizationÂs image. 
29. His Government fully supported the measures taken to protect against nuclear terrorism, 
whether in the framework of the CPPNM or resolutions adopted by the Agency and the United 
Nations. The fight against nuclear terrorism would ensure a safer world for future generations. That 
was all the more important because the increasing scarcity of traditional energy sources meant that 
nuclear energy would play a growing role in the production of electricity in the years ahead. Haiti was 
convinced that the international legal framework comprising the NPT, safeguards agreements, 
additional protocols and the CPPNM was sufficiently sound to guarantee the safe utilization of nuclear 
energy in the future. 
30. Speaking the preceding day, the Director General had expressed surprise at how little electricity 
was available to the vast majority of the population in the Third World and had observed that 
something had to be done so that people in underdeveloped countries could enjoy the benefits of 
modern technology. Without energy, the LDCs would not be able to meet the Millennium 
Development Goals. Haiti was pleased that the Director General had urged Member States to define 
and develop national and regional energy planning programmes and had indicated that the Agency 
would cooperate with them in that regard. 
31. For some time, Haiti had been receiving technical assistance from the Agency in the areas of 
energy planning, radiation protection, agriculture and radiotherapy. For the period 2006Â2010, those 
activities would become part of a CPF aimed at improving the focus of technical assistance and 
coordinating it with HaitiÂs development policy. His presence as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Haiti 
testified to his GovernmentÂs determination to cooperate more closely with the Agency, as well as 
with other developing countries, in the framework of South-South technical cooperation. 
32. The United Nations was very active in Haiti at present and it was important that the Agency 
make its presence felt within the United Nations system, because nuclear techniques could contribute 
effectively to HaitiÂs development and help it attain the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 
Haiti was convinced that nuclear energy had an enormous potential for promoting sustainable 
development. 
33. In conclusion, despite its financial difficulties, his country would do everything in its power to 
pay its arrears of assessed contributions and contribute to the TCF for 2006. 
34. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) commended the Agency on its activities aimed at promoting, inter alia, 
nuclear, radiation, transport waste and safety, strengthening of the safeguards regime and action 
against illicit trafficking in nuclear material and other radioactive sources.

35. YemenÂs National Atomic Energy Commission had an outstanding record in ensuring radiation 
protection and the safety and security of radioactive sources. The reports of the peer review mission 
and the INSServ mission conducted by the Agency at YemenÂs request had indicated that the 
Commission, established in 1999 as an independent regulatory body, had been assigned specific 
responsibilities and functions in keeping with international standards and, in particular, the Basic 
Safety Standards. The Commission had managed in a short time to develop an effective inspection, 
registration and licensing system, and was playing a proactive role in research into and control and 
licensing of radioactive sources. Furthermore, Yemen was now seeking to apply radiation controls on 
its borders and was thus becoming a model for other countries to emulate. 
36. Yemen was currently implementing 15 national projects and participating in 23 regional 
projects supported by the Agency and focusing on the training of human resources in the areas of 
health, agriculture, water, industry and radiation protection. It also benefited greatly from ARASIA. 
37. As a party to the NPT, Yemen had urged the recent NPT Review Conference to reach a 
consensus on strengthening the non-proliferation regime and applying it in all States without 
exception. His country had summarized its ideas in twelve points on which agreement should be 
reached. They included: universal accession to the NPT; making withdrawal from the NPT 
impermissible; the gradual reduction and ultimate elimination of nuclear arsenals by halting military 
nuclear activities and development or modification of nuclear weapon systems, be they small or large, 
tactical or strategic; the establishment of a time frame for the final elimination of nuclear weapons and 
the introduction of safeguards against the military or political use of such weapons; the prohibition and 
criminalization of the illicit transfer of nuclear technology in keeping with Security Council 
resolutions; promotion of the lawful transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes; affirmation 
of the importance of peaceful uses of nuclear energy, not only for national energy security but also to 
mitigate the damage caused by fossil fuels, in particular climate change caused primarily by 
greenhouse gases; and ensuring the safety and security of nuclear material by adopting strict standards 
and preventing such material from falling into the hands of non-State actors. 
38. Finally, he called on the participants in the Conference to imagine a world completely free of 
nuclear weapons but blessed with a virtually inexhaustible supply of nuclear fuel, enough to satisfy the 
demand of humanity for electricity and drinking water for centuries to come, and to eradicate poverty 
and solve the problem of climate change. Who could deny that it was a beautiful vision, however 
fanciful? 
39. Ms. KAPIJIMPANGA (Zambia) offered condolences to the Government and people of the 
United States of America over the loss of human life and property following hurricane Katrina. 
40. She endorsed the BoardÂs decision to extend Mr. ElBaradeiÂs appointment as the AgencyÂs 
Director General for another term, as his leadership of the Agency had been exemplary, and she 
assured him of her countryÂs continued support. She expressed the hope that Agency safeguards would 
be applied in the Middle East in a fair and transparent manner. 
41. Nuclear proliferation continued to be of great concern among peace-loving nations and it was 
regrettable that the 2005 United Nations Summit had not reached an agreement on that issue. She 
urged Member States that had not yet done so to ratify the CTBT in order to enable the CTBTO to 
fulfil its mandate. Research into nuclear weapons by any Member State did not make the world a safer 
place. She urged all nations with nuclear weapons to start dismantling them. While even one nuclear 
weapon remained, humanity was not safe. As the world commemorated the 60th anniversary of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, she urged the Agency and Member States to spare no efforts to persuade the 
DPRK and Iran to return to compliance with the international safeguards regime, which aimed at

ensuring a secure and peaceful world. With that in mind, she urged continued dialogue between the 
European Union and Iran. 

42. Zambia welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in the field of protection against nuclear terrorism, 
which were of critical importance. Member States needed to work together to combat that threat. 
43. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were crucial to the development of Member 
States. Improved delivery systems would result in improved performance. The new two-page project 
concept provided a much faster way for Member States to make possible project requests known to the 
Agency before full proposals were developed. 
44. Construction of the cancer diseases treatment centre in Zambia would be completed in 2005. 
That centre would provide a very rare opportunity for cancer patients to access appropriate treatment 
at affordable prices through the application of nuclear technology. She hoped that many Member 
States would benefit from that technology, especially those around Zambia. 
45. Demand for clean drinking water continued to rise as populations increased, and the provision 
and management of water resources was critical for sustainable development. She commended the 
Agency for the efforts it was making to promote groundwater exploration using isotope hydrology and 
hydrogeology. 
46. She noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs continued activities to strengthen international 
cooperation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety. Those areas were essential to ensuring that nuclear 
activities did not pose any danger to future generations. The AgencyÂs support for improved radiation 
safety infrastructure, including legal reform, was an important undertaking and required support from 
all States. The scientific forum running parallel with the 49th regular session of the General 
Conference was dedicated to nuclear physics, which seemed to be in line with the recent workshop 
held in Trieste, Italy, on managing nuclear knowledge. It was essential to have a pool of young 
scientists to take over from the older generation if nuclear facilities were to be secured for the future. 
Her country would like to see more such meetings organized in the future, especially in the fields of 
operations and safety. Zambia had enacted new legislation to regulate such activities in line with 
international standards. 
47. Her country continued to build on the achievements made through the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation activities. The following developments that had taken place since the preceding General 
Conference: isotope hydrology activities for groundwater pollution monitoring had been initiated; a 
cancer treatment centre had been constructed which should be operational in 2006; personnel had been 
trained in South Africa for the cancer treatment centre; the induced mutation breeding programme had 
been strengthened by training technicians and obtaining more equipment; nuclear medicine and 
neonatal hypothyroidism monitoring capacity had been strengthened by training personnel and 
obtaining equipment; performance of equipment in institutions receiving technical support from the 
Agency had been improved; and human resources in nuclear science and technology had been 
strengthened through the national human resource training project. Furthermore, Zambian scientists 
and technologists had played a critical role in the activities related to and the publication of IAEATECDOC-
1294 on development and field evaluation of animal feed supplementation packages. 
48. Zambia continued to support the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities within the 
framework of AFRA. Zambia had received several expert missions, in particular on radiotherapy, 
radiation protection and radioactive waste management, from AFRA member States. The AFRA 
framework had also been instrumental in strengthening various activities at institutions which were 
participating in AFRA projects. She called on AFRA to diversify its resource base so that it was not 
fully dependent on the Agency for its financial support.

49. In conclusion, she pledged he countryÂs full share of its assessed voluntary contribution to the 
TCF for 2006. 
50. Mr. ADAMOWITSCH (Germany) said that, in the preceding year, the Agency had again played 
a central role in the international non-proliferation discussion. Not least owing to the work of the 
Director General, world public opinion regarded the Agency as a pillar of global security and peace. 
51. The lack of transparency regarding IranÂs nuclear programme and recent unilateral measures 
gave cause for deep concern. More than two years after they had been raised, important questions 
remained unresolved. It was to be hoped that Iran would agree to provide objective guarantees that its 
nuclear programme would and could be used only for peaceful purposes. Germany was prepared to 
pursue a sincere dialogue with Iran if confidence could be restored. It would be regrettable if Iran 
chose the path of confrontation instead of cooperation, because that would lead to referral to the 
Security Council. 
52. The situation on the Korean Peninsula also remained a source of great concern. The six-party 
talks were the appropriate forum for finding a lasting peaceful solution. It was essential to implement 
the joint statement. 
53. Germany strongly supported the deliberations on strengthening of the international 
non-proliferation system. Further discussion of the findings of the expert group on multilateral nuclear 
approaches set up by the Director General was needed and his country looked forward to further 
consideration of that issue in the Board. 
54. Germany regretted the unsuccessful outcome of the 2005 NPT Review Conference. It was 
important to make progress on a number of outstanding issues and prepare the ground for the 
upcoming review process. The Agency could play a useful role in that respect by addressing matters 
within its own field of competence, such as establishing the additional protocol as the standard for 
compliance, assisting countries in developing their export control system, and dealing with the 
question of countries that attempted to withdraw from the NPT. 
55. The new Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of the 
IAEA Statute would contribute to structuring the debate on important safeguards issues. Germany 
shared the view of many delegations that great care should be taken not to reopen or revoke the 
compromise reached by Committee 24. Any overlapping with SAGSI or interference with the 
SecretariatÂs safeguards tasks should also be avoided. 
56. The universalization and implementation of additional protocols remained a high priority. 
Germany continued to believe that the ratification process for the additional protocol was too slow. 
Member States should live up to their commitment and ratify additional protocols as soon as possible. 
Those that had not yet signed an additional protocol should do so without further delay. 
57. Nuclear safety and security was one of the most important issues in the nuclear field. The need 
for a worldwide safety culture would increase in the future thanks to the ageing of reactors, the 
shutdown of research reactors, the increase in the number of radiation sources, illicit trafficking and 
nuclear terror. In that connection, Germany welcomed the third review meeting of the Contracting 
Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the conference on nuclear security held in London and 
the conference to amend the CPPNM. With regard to the latter, he called upon all States to ratify the 
amendments to ensure their early entry into force. The adoption of the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources and the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of 
Radioactive Sources had been an important step towards improving safety and security in connection 
with the fight against nuclear terrorism. Germany had been one of the first States to implement the 
Guidance.

58. With regard to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, peaceful applications of nuclear 
science and technology had promising potential in the areas of food quality and safety enhancement, 
insect pest control, water management, health care and sustainable development. He expressed 
appreciation to the Secretariat for its efforts to highlight the growing need for cancer treatment 
applications in Africa. Germany was prepared to cooperate closely in the R&D field with universities 
and research centres in other countries. 
59. Ms. GONZÃLEZ (Mexico) congratulated the Director General on his re-election. 
60. The Annual Report for 2004 showed the AgencyÂs achievements in promoting international 
cooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology, global nuclear security and verification. 
However, it was regrettable that the 2005 NPT Review Conference had reached no substantive 
agreement. It was likewise discouraging that the final document adopted by the United Nations 
Summit in September 2005 had made no reference to disarmament or non-proliferation, thereby 
missing a major opportunity to contribute to peace and security in the world. Mexico called upon all 
Member States of the Agency to reaffirm their commitment to nuclear disarmament, the international 
non-proliferation regime and Agency safeguards. 
61. The Mexican Government was particularly grateful to the AgencyÂs Secretariat for its objective 
and professional work in the field of verification. The black market in sensitive nuclear technology 
and equipment made an effective and efficient safeguards system essential. At the same time, the 
inalienable right of all Member States to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes had to be protected. Her country had noted with interest the Director GeneralÂs 
proposals for assuring supplies of nuclear fuel in order to strengthen control and prevent illicit 
activities. 
62. Mexico attached importance to strengthening the system of nuclear-weapon-free zones, which 
made a notable contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The first Conference of 
States Parties and Signatories of Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones had been held in 
Mexico City in April 2005 and had adopted the Tlatelolco Declaration, which emphasized the 
AgencyÂs role in ensuring that nuclear energy was used only for peaceful purposes. 
63. Her country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the safety of nuclear installations, 
combat nuclear and radiological terrorism and promote the universal application of the relevant 
international instruments. She welcomed the approval of the action plan for the safety of transport of 
radioactive material. The Agency should exploit all possible synergies with other international and 
regional institutions in order to develop an integrated approach to the security of nuclear installations. 
Mexico was particularly interested in the efforts to evaluate the effects of earthquakes on the safety of 
nuclear installations. The conference to consider and adopt proposed amendments to the CPPNM, held 
in Vienna in July 2005, had adopted a number of proposals intended to broaden the scope of the 
Convention. Unfortunately, however, it had not adopted an explicit statement that attacks on peaceful 
nuclear installations in peacetime constituted an infringement of international law. 
64. Nuclear technology should be used to promote sustainable development in agriculture, food 
production, human health, water resource management, environmental protection and industry. Those 
activities should be better publicized in order to increase public awareness of the benefits of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Mexico would continue to support the Agency in its important work. 
65. Mr. GAISENAK (Belarus) said that the past year had underscored the complicated situation 
which had arisen in the context of the NPT. One of the key features of that Treaty was the balance 
between the obligations and rights of non-nuclear-weapon State Parties. Such States made a voluntary 
commitment to refrain from creating and building up nuclear military capabilities. The Treaty also 
unambiguously confirmed the inalienable right of such States to develop research, production and use 

GC(49)/OR.3 
27 
September 
2005, 
Page 
10 


of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It was difficult to overestimate the importance of the 
AgencyÂs role in ensuring that that balance was maintained. 

66. With regard to the Iranian issue, the objective position and highly professional work of the 
Agency had allowed a number of contentious technical matters to be resolved. Iran had made efforts to 
clarify those matters. Iran should cooperate with the Agency in the future in a spirit of full 
transparency. The issue should be solved within the existing international legal framework and not on 
the basis of politically motivated evaluations. 
67. Belarus welcomed the announcement by the Government of the DPRK regarding its readiness 
to return to the NPT and hoped that the constructive cooperation between all parties to the six-party 
talks would speed up the search for mutually acceptable decisions and would help strengthen security 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
68. His country had always been committed to strengthening the safeguards regime and had always 
strictly fulfilled its international obligations under the NPT and its safeguards agreement. Belarus had 
notified the Secretariat of its decision to sign an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement under 
the NPT and expected the text thereof to be approved at the BoardÂs next series of meetings. 
69. As a State party to the CPPNM since 1993, Belarus had taken part in the amendment process. It 
was satisfying that the diplomatic conference held in July 2005 had been a success. The entry into 
force of the approved amendment would make a significant contribution to reinforcing the regime for 
the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. Belarus had begun the internal procedures 
necessary for the amendment to enter into force. 
70. The International Conference on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, held in 
Bordeaux in June 2005, had constituted a significant step forward in that fundamental area of the 
AgencyÂs work. The conference had underlined the importance of developing international 
cooperation to prevent illicit trafficking in sources and to implement the provisions of the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Belarus was cooperating with the Agency 
on the issue of illicit trafficking and smuggling of nuclear and radioactive material. In 2004, the State 
border of Belarus had become an EU border. Ensuring radiation safety on that border therefore 
contributed to ensuring the safety of EU member States. In 2006 Belarus was proposing to hold a 
regional scientific and practical conference under the auspices of the Agency on the prevention of 
illicit trafficking and smuggling of nuclear and radioactive material on the Belarus/EU border and 
hoped that that initiative would be supported. 
71. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided under the Trilateral Initiative with the 
disassembly and transport to storage of a high-power gamma facility. He hoped that such cooperation 
would continue with regard to other facilities and obsolete irradiators at scientific research and training 
centres in Belarus. 
72. His country was concerned over the plans to build a storage site in Lithuania, close to the border 
with Belarus, for spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste from the closure of the Ignalina nuclear 
power plant. It hoped that Lithuania would adopt a constructive approach to the siting and safety of 
that facility. Given the AgencyÂs recognized authority and its role in the development of international 
standards on radiation safety, his country assumed it would be involved in that process. 
73. Dealing with the consequences of the Chernobyl accident was a priority area of cooperation 
between the Agency and Belarus. His country highly valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
projects on Chernobyl focusing, inter alia, on the socio-economic rehabilitation of the affected regions. 
It hoped that such projects would be retained in future cycles.

74. The Agency had made a valuable contribution to the work of the United Nations Chernobyl 
Forum which the Director General had proposed setting up during his visit to Belarus in 2001. At the 
concluding conference of the Forum held in September 2005 in Vienna, the international community 
had looked at approaches for evaluating the consequences of the Chernobyl accident and 
recommendations for rehabilitating affected regions. The work of the Forum was of great practical 
significance in optimizing policy on dealing with the consequences of the disaster and developing 
international cooperation on Chernobyl. It had also constituted a significant step forward in 
understanding the long-term consequences of the accident. The Forum showed that several questions, 
including some relating to the medical consequences of Chernobyl, remained open and required 
further study. The effectiveness of the Forum would depend not only on the recommendations made to 
the governments of the affected States, but also on continued collaboration to implement them. A 
number of changes needed to be made to the draft final document of the Forum presented to the 
conference, in particular with respect to the recommendations to the governments of the affected 
States. Belarus had passed the relevant proposals to the Secretariat and hoped they would be taken into 
account when finalizing the document. Additional public information work was also needed to ensure 
that the conclusions of the Forum were received appropriately by the international community and the 
affected populations. An international conference on strategies for the rehabilitation and sustainable 
development of affected regions was planned in Minsk in April 2006. 
75. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) congratulated the Director General on his re-election. 
76. The failure of the 2005 NPT Review Conference to adopt a final document demonstrated the 
need for universalization of the non-proliferation regime. The Conference had also failed to convince 
the international community that the goal of the NPT was to promote world peace by moving towards 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Although the Treaty established clear-cut obligations and 
rights for both nuclear-weapon and non-nuclear-weapon States, changes in the international political 
environment had led to the imposition of severe restrictions on non-nuclear-weapon States that sought 
to exercise their inalienable right under the NPT to acquire nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
77. The Syrian Arab Republic had been one of the first States in the Middle East to sign the NPT, 
owing to its conviction that the possession of nuclear weapons by any State in that region would 
constitute a threat to other countries in the Middle East and the world as a whole. At the same time, it 
was eager to use nuclear technology for sustainable development and in the areas of health care and 
environmental protection but was thwarted by the restrictions on access imposed by certain States in 
violation of the NPT. 
78. His country had always firmly opposed terrorism and was working for international agreement 
on a definition that distinguished between terrorism and the legitimate struggle of peoples against 
foreign occupation. However, its efforts had failed for political reasons and owing to the prevalence of 
selectivity and double standards. The Syrian Arab Republic had signed the International Convention 
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism in April 2005 and the International Convention for 
the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in September 2005. Moreover, it was about to sign the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. In August 2005, the Syrian President had 
promulgated Legislative Decree No. 64 on radiation protection and the safety and security of 
radioactive sources which criminalized trafficking in nuclear material and conferred wide-ranging 
regulatory powers on the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria. 
79. An item on application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East had been on the agenda of the 
General Conference for over a decade with the aim of persuading Israel, the only State in the region 
with nuclear weapons, to accede to the NPT and submit its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards 
so that a nuclear-weapon-free zone could be established in the Middle East. Yet again, however, the 
Director General had been unable to fulfil the mandate entrusted to him in that regard under successive 

GC(49)/OR.3

12 


General Conference resolutions. IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons created a security imbalance 
in the Middle East but the major powers turned a blind eye to IsraelÂs violations of the relevant 
international resolutions, particularly Security Council resolution 487 (1981). He urged the General 
Conference to adopt an objective and transparent approach to the draft resolution on IAEA safeguards 
in the Middle East at the current session and to name the only State in the region that was not subject 
to safeguards and was outside the non-proliferation regime. Israel, which pursued a terrorist policy 
against the people of Palestine and the Syrian Golan Heights in violation of all international treaties 
and customs, was concerned only with preserving its own security through a nuclear deterrence 
strategy. 

80. He drew attention to the fact that the list of States belonging to the Middle East region given in 
footnote 1 to the Director GeneralÂs report on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(49)/18) did not reflect the views of States in the region. 
81. His country had joined the consensus on the draft resolution on that issue each year so as not to 
disrupt the proceedings of the Conference. However, Member States should be aware of how 
explosive the situation had become and he called on the Agency to play an effective role in support of 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
82. The Syrian Arab Republic agreed in principle with the idea of convening a forum on the 
creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and would participate on condition that 
Israel acceded to the NPT and placed its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. His country 
had submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council in April 2003 on behalf of the Arab Group 
aimed at ridding the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, but 
the international situation at the time had militated against the success of the initiative. Syria had 
reintroduced the draft resolution in December 2003 and it was still pending before the Security 
Council until such time as the circumstances were more conducive to its adoption. 
83. A number of reports had drawn attention to the danger of a radiation leak from ageing reactors 
in Dimona that the Israeli Government refused to decommission. He urged the international 
community to take speedy action to avert the possible environmental risk to Palestinian territory and 
neighbouring States. In that connection, he expressed the hope that the item on Israeli nuclear 
capabilities and threat which was placed on the ConferenceÂs agenda each year would be given the 
attention it deserved. The international community should support the Arab Group in their attempt to 
have a resolution adopted in that regard in order to put pressure on Israel to accede to the NPT and 
place its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. The Conference had a duty to take action 
against the Israeli nuclear threat, as it had done in the case of South Africa. 
84. He thanked the Department of Technical Cooperation for its work at the national and regional 
level on behalf of developing countries, particularly its initiative aimed at rationalizing the submission 
of project proposals. In 2004 the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria had received 20 trainees from 
Arab countries and had provided the Agency with the services of six cost-free experts. The 
Commission would continue to support the technical cooperation programme through the regional 
centres of excellence. 
85. With the support of the Agency and Damascus University, the Commission continued to run a 
nine-month study course on radiation protection and safety of radioactive sources. To date more than 
100 radiation protection specialists from most Arab countries had completed the course and been 
awarded diplomas. He encouraged the Arab States to continue taking advantage of the opportunity 
thus offered for advanced training based on an internationally recognized curriculum. 
86. ARASIA now had eight member States with the recent accession of Iraq and Qatar. It was 
implementing three regional projects: a comparative assessment of electricity generation options; 

GC(49)/OR.3 
27

13 


strengthening regional training and certification capability in non-destructive testing; and use of 
isotopes and geochemical techniques in the study of groundwater. He trusted that the Agency would 
continue to support ARASIA in its future projects. 

87. Linking of the payment of NPCs to project implementation could lead to delays in the launching 
of national projects. Syria had always sought to pay its contributions to the Agency promptly, but it 
urged the Secretariat to reconsider that move because delays in bank transfers and the determination of 
exchange rates in some countries might waste time that could be spent on project implementation. The 
Secretariat should also submit a report on the advantages and drawbacks of amalgamating West Asia, 
East Asia and the Pacific into a single region. 
88. The INIS Multilingual Thesaurus had been translated into Arabic by the Atomic Energy 
Commission of Syria, a major project that had been completed in only nine months by a team of 
highly competent translators. Moreover, his country had made a voluntary extrabudgetary contribution 
of over $10 000 towards the translation of training materials on registration and verification of 
radiation sources into Arabic. The Commission had also continued for the third year to translate the 
IAEA 
Bulletin 
into Arabic. 
89. Mr. POPOVIC (Serbia and Montenegro) said that the fight against global terrorism was a matter 
of the utmost importance and a common concern of all countries. Recognizing a potential threat, in 
2002 Serbia and Montenegro had completed the removal of the fresh nuclear fuel from the site of the 
Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences to its country of origin, the Russian Federation, for enrichment 
reduction, as part of the Trilateral Initiative of the Agency, the Russian Federation and the United 
States. The assistance of those countries and other actors from the international community would also 
be needed for the removal of the spent nuclear fuel from the RA research reactor and other 
decommissioning activities at the Institute. The work of the Regulatory Commission for Nuclear 
Safety, the temporary regulatory authority established in connection with the Vinca decommissioning 
programme, could not be fully and properly completed without Agency assistance. 
90. Serbia and Montenegro strongly supported a strengthened comprehensive safeguards system 
and the verification role of the Agency, which were essential to prevent the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. His Government had already informed the Secretariat that it had decided to sign an 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. There again, the AgencyÂs assistance was 
indispensable. 
91. 
He expressed satisfaction at the technical cooperation results achieved in the short period since 
Serbia and Montenegro had renewed its membership of the Agency, whose increased support was 
essential to help establish or improve further national infrastructures. He commended the dedicated 
efforts of the Department of Technical Cooperation, particularly the Europe Section. Serbia and 
Montenegro depended on the AgencyÂs assistance to reach its national and international goals in such 
areas as decommissioning activities, the upgrading of the countryÂs regulatory infrastructure for 
nuclear safety and security, and improved health care and environmental protection. 
92. Serbia and Montenegro had received visits from experts in a variety of fields, including nuclear 
security, health, regulatory infrastructure and nuclear safety, and their findings and reports were an 
important tool for assessing national goals and developing plans for their realization. No less 
important was the improvement of professional knowledge and skills. In the past year, a number of 
experts and professionals had received training or taken part in conferences, meetings and workshops, 
where they had been able to compare experience and exchange information. 
93. Agency assistance in implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources, as well as other international instruments, was indispensable. His Government 
fully supported the strengthening of safety and security systems and stressed the important role that 

GC(49)/OR.3

14 


integrated and universal safeguards and verification played in all activities relating to the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. 

94. Mr. AL-JASEM (Kuwait) congratulated the Director General on his re-election. 
95. As Kuwait attached great importance to ensuring the safety and security of radioactive sources, 
it emphasized the need to establish mechanisms and implement guidelines aimed at controlling 
movements of radioactive material. International cooperation and coordination should be promoted 
through national and regional projects with the Agency and other relevant organizations. 
96. To avert the threat of nuclear terrorism, action to place all nuclear material and installations in 
every country without exception under Agency safeguards was a matter of the greatest urgency. 
Kuwait was concerned to learn of cases of smuggling and illegal trafficking in nuclear material, and of 
black-market operators who exploited loopholes in the NPT and other relevant international treaties. A 
secure system was needed to guard against such threats. Kuwait had signed the amended CPPNM and 
the recently adopted International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, since 
it believed that concerted international action was necessary. It approved the action taken by some 
countries to afford protection against nuclear terrorism, provided that such action was intended to back 
up the non-proliferation regime and the AgencyÂs mandate. 
97. Praising the achievements of the technical cooperation programme in promoting the 
development of different sectors of society, he reaffirmed the need for assured and predictable sources 
of financing for the TCF in order to guarantee the success of existing and future projects and avoid 
budget shortfalls owing to the failure of some countries to pay their voluntary contributions. Although 
such contributions were theoretically voluntary, Member States had a political obligation to pay them 
in full and on time. In that connection, he noted that Kuwait always paid its contribution to the TCF 
promptly. 
98. In addition to its development-related projects, the technical cooperation programme should 
seek to improve radiation protection infrastructure. It was also important to continue organizing 
training courses, especially at the regional level, to enhance national expertise in that area. 
99. Kuwait was eager to increase its cooperation with the Agency in promoting peaceful 
applications of nuclear science and technology in the interests of more equitable and sustainable 
development for all countries and peoples. 
100. The safeguards system was a main pillar of the AgencyÂs work and the cornerstone of the 
non-proliferation regime. Kuwait therefore appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen application 
of the NPT, safeguards and the additional protocol. With a view to making verification activities more 
effective, States that had not yet done so should sign a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the 
Agency and States that had already signed an agreement should consider signing an additional 
protocol. Moreover, parties to the NPT should honour their obligations under the Treaty and their 
safeguards agreement and work constructively with the Agency to deal with any queries or 
complaints. 
101. Kuwait was disappointed that the outcome document adopted at the United Nations Millennium 
Review Summit made no mention of disarmament or non-proliferation. It continued to hope, however, 
that the international community would reach a consensus on the need for full and non-selective 
implementation of disarmament treaties, particularly the NPT, and for the elimination of all weapons 
of mass destruction. 
102. Safeguards should be applied to all nuclear activities in the Middle East region, since the 
Agency had the authority and expertise to provide assurances regarding compliance with safeguards 
agreements. Kuwait noted with concern, however, that the AgencyÂs request to some countries with 

GC(49)/OR.3 
27 
September 
2005, 
Page 
15 


advanced nuclear programmes to accede to the NPT and to apply Agency safeguards had gone 
unheeded, a fact that would adversely affect international peace and stability on account of the 
strategic importance of the Middle East region. He urged the Agency to redouble its efforts to achieve 
universal application of the safeguards regime to all nuclear installations and activities in the region as 
a first step towards creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 

103. Kuwait regretted the fact that it had not been possible to convene a forum to discuss the 
experience of other regions with a nuclear-weapon-free zone. In that context, he welcomed the 
outcome of the recent Conference of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish NuclearWeapon-
Free Zones held in Mexico that had stressed the important role of such zones in promoting 
regional and international security and peace. 
104. Security and stability would never be achieved in the Middle East so long as Israel was the only 
country in the region that refused to place its installations under Agency safeguards, impeding the 
universalization of the NPT. The persistence of that unnatural situation, in which one countryÂs 
wayward behaviour was disregarded, would encourage other States to try to obtain nuclear weapons or 
to manufacture them. 
105. It was to be hoped that the countries of the world were standing at the threshold of a new era in 
which they would overcome their differences and join together in ridding the world of weapons of 
mass destruction. 
106. Mr. PANUPONG (Thailand) said that international developments in recent years, whether they 
related to the proliferation of nuclear weapons or to terrorism, had ushered the world into a changed 
security landscape. While many had hoped that 2005 would bring a renewed phase of cooperation in 
addressing those emerging security threats, the distressing failures to strengthen nuclear disarmament 
and non-proliferation at the 2005 NPT Review Conference 2005 and the 2005 World Summit had 
unfortunately put the international community back at a crossroads and had left the world more 
vulnerable than ever to the unprecedented risk of nuclear proliferation. 
107. Thailand attached great importance to the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation regime and it recognized its instrumental utility in promoting the 
three pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses. As a non-nuclear-weapon State, his 
country was firmly committed to a policy of not developing, possessing, acquiring, using or 
transferring nuclear weapons and related material. At the regional level, the establishment of the 
South-East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone in December 1995, in which Thailand and other member 
countries of ASEAN participated, stood as evidence of ThailandÂs commitment to the 
non-proliferation regime. The Bangkok Treaty establishing that nuclear-weapon-free zone had entered 
into force as early as 1997, and it and other nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions of the world 
would contribute significantly to a climate of confidence that would be conducive to reducing 
proliferation risks. 
108. With regard to emerging threats, his country viewed the revelation of a large network of nuclear 
traffickers and clandestine proliferation activities as cause for major concern. He strongly encouraged 
the international community, the United Nations and its relevant agencies to redouble their efforts to 
prevent weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear and radioactive material, from falling into the 
hands of terrorists. Thailand had fully complied with United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 
on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and was reviewing its domestic legislation to 
facilitate more effective control of dual-use equipment. Furthermore, it was strengthening its criminal 
legislation and procedures to counteract terrorism. Against that backdrop, he was pleased to report 
that, on 14 September 2005, during the 60th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New

York, the Prime Minister of Thailand had signed the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 

109. Amid increasingly serious challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, the Agency and 
its Director General had played outstanding roles in verifying compliance of obligations under the 
NPT and safeguards agreements in order to maintain international stability and security. The Agency 
had conducted its work in a professional and impartial manner, fulfilling its mandate in a way that 
enhanced transparency and confidence among Agency Member States. 
110. Thailand reaffirmed its full support for the AgencyÂs safeguards system, and its commitment to 
working with the Agency and other countries to encourage universal adherence to safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols. It had concluded and signed an additional protocol with the 
Agency on 22 September 2005, full implementation of which was envisaged once the constitutional 
requirements for its entry into force were met. He congratulated the two other ASEAN countries, 
Singapore and Malaysia, that had chosen to do the same at the most recent Board meeting, which his 
country saw as a positive contribution by ASEAN to the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. 
111. Another area of great concern to his country was nuclear security. Thailand was strengthening 
its domestic legislation and measures to secure and physically protect nuclear material against theft, 
sabotage or access by unauthorized persons. Thailand commended the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance the 
security of nuclear and radioactive sources and welcomed the outcome of the diplomatic conference 
held in Vienna in July 2005 to consider and adopt proposed amendments to the CPPNM. The Thai 
Government was in the process of reviewing the specific amendments to the Convention with a view 
to acceding to it at the earliest opportunity. 
112. His country placed particular emphasis on cooperative action to ensure the safe transport and 
use of radioactive sources. It highly appreciated the AgencyÂs important role in helping Thailand 
improve its safety standards. Thailand was accelerating the process of acceptance of the AgencyÂs 
Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Guidance on the Import 
and Export of Radioactive Sources with a view to completing that process by the end of 2006. 
113. Thailand was following closely the situation on the Korean Peninsula as it had implications for 
the stability of the entire Asian region. It welcomed the joint statement issued following the fourth 
round of the six-party talks, and was encouraged to note that the issue was being settled peacefully 
through diplomatic means. He congratulated all parties concerned for their commendable efforts and 
expressed the hope that they would fully implement the commitments contained in the joint statement, 
so as to build a strong foundation for the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
114. With respect to the implementation of NPT safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran, his 
country believed in the importance of the inalienable right of States to develop nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes, and in the obligations States accepted under NPT safeguards. In the light of the 
adoption by the Board on 24 September 2005 of the resolution contained in document GOV/2005/77, 
his country hoped that all parties concerned would show the utmost restraint and seek to resolve the 
issue peacefully through dialogue and diplomacy. A confrontational approach would not be 
constructive to the preservation of regional stability and should therefore be avoided in as far possible. 
115. Thailand fully supported the work of the Agency, particularly in the fields of peaceful uses and 
civilian nuclear applications. While the world strove to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, it was within the realm of reason to appeal to all nuclear-weapon States to continue to work 
together to achieve the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. That was an essential step in creating 
an environment conducive to the maintenance of international peace and security.

116. Mr. CHIKANDA (Zimbabwe) said that the AgencyÂs important role in the field of international 
nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and development should be strengthened. The Agency should 
be allowed to execute its mandate, in accordance with its Statute and the NPT, without hindrance, 
prejudice or unwarranted political limitations. It should also promote development and further the 
inalienable right of Member States to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes without discrimination, and should facilitate the fullest possible exchange of 
equipment, material and scientific and technological information between States. 
117. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities played an effective role in combating poverty in 
developing countries and made a significant contribution to the attainment of the Millennium 
Development Goals. His country was pleased at the AgencyÂs continuing focus on reliable food 
supplies, safe and adequate water and sanitation, better remedies for human and animal health 
problems, and sound environmental management. Science and technology should serve to remove 
obstacles facing the poor and to overcome problems resulting from past injustices. 
118. Zimbabwe appreciated its fruitful cooperation with the Agency, which was set to increase in the 
areas of health, water, non-destructive testing and agriculture. The CPF for 2005Â2009, which had just 
been finalized, would further enhance implementation of technical cooperation programmes in 
Zimbabwe. His Government appreciated the assistance and guidance it had received from the Agency 
at the meeting of national consultants held in Vienna from 27 June to 1 July, which had enabled it to 
finalize the CPF. 
119. ZimbabweÂs cooperation with the Agency on nuclear applications in food and agriculture 
focused on animal disease, and desertification and drought issues. The AgencyÂs assistance with 
protection of the environment and sustaining of crop production was essential to ensuring food 
security in Zimbabwe and in southern Africa as a whole. It was also crucial to enhancing ZimbabweÂs 
ability to diagnose animal diseases and to the setting up of quality assurance schemes to help 
veterinary laboratories meet internationally recognized standards and restore the countryÂs livestock 
market. 
120. The Agency was assisting Zimbabwe through the application of stable isotopes to assess the 
efficacy of nutrition programmes for HIV and AIDS patients, pregnant women and children. 
Zimbabwe sought further Agency support for the enhancement of water resource management and 
development capacity through the application of isotope hydrology to assess groundwater aquifers in 
Matabeleland, which would help assure the regionÂs water supply. Continued support was also needed 
in setting up an NDT training and certification centre to improve the quality of services and products. 
121. The Agency was helping Zimbabwe accelerate the process of upgrading its national radiation 
protection infrastructure so that it complied with the Basic Safety Standards, placing special emphasis 
on occupational exposure control (milestone 2) and medical exposure control (milestone 3). 
122. It was also providing assistance through a regional project on the control and eradication of 
major diseases affecting livestock within the Southern African Development Community. 
123. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs proposed area-wide integrated pest management strategy, 
which had an SIT component to eradicate tsetse flies in the Kwando/Zambezi region. Its early 
implementation would be appreciated. 
124. With the help of the WHO, the Agency and other development partners, his Government had 
introduced measures to alleviate the impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Sustained use of nuclear 
applications could have a positive effect on both medical care and industrial performance.

125. Agriculture was the mainstay of ZimbabweÂs economy and he commended the Agency for its 
timely efforts to improve crop varieties, promote nuclear insect control techniques and enhance soil 
nutrition in his country. 
126. Zimbabwe was committed to introducing a legal framework for peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy. Its Radiation Protection Board would be in place by 30 October. Radiation protection 
regulations drafted in line with the requirements of the Basic Safety Standards were awaiting approval 
by the Radiation Protection Board. 
127. Zimbabwe was grateful to the Agency for its specialist training courses, workshops and 
seminars. Many of its national experts underwent regular Agency training. His country sought the 
AgencyÂs support in further addressing shortages in skilled personnel in the nuclear medicine and 
radiotherapy fields. 
128. His country was highly appreciative of the AgencyÂs initiatives in the area of nuclear medicine. 
The expert visit by Professor Ajit Kumar Padhy had led to the establishment of a national advisory 
group on nuclear medicine. 
129. He commended the Agency for the various AFRA projects that Zimbabwe was benefiting from, 
including projects on the maintenance of medical and scientific instruments, strengthening of waste 
management infrastructure, development of improved crop varieties, improvement of radiotherapy, 
tumour markers and non-destructive testing. He urged the Agency to ensure that funding for such 
projects was sufficient, predictable and assured. 
130. Electricity generation had become a major impediment to AfricaÂs development. His 
Government called on the Agency to continue to provide technical advice to Member States so that 
they could explore alternative energy sources, including nuclear power. 
131. Despite the economic challenges that it was current facing, Zimbabwe was committed to 
fulfilling its obligations to the Agency.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(continued) 
(GC(49)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
KINGÂORIAH 
(Kenya) 
said 
that, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
growing 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
the 
Government 
of 
Kenya 
was 
strongly 
committed 
to 
fighting 
all 
forms 
of 
terrorism. 
As 
the 
victim 
of 
recent 
terrorist 
activities, 
his 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
efforts 
in 
the 
war 
against 
terrorism. 
In 
February 
2002, 
Kenya 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
recent 
amendments 
thereto. 
2. 
Two 
scanners 
had 
been 
installed 
at 
the 
seaport 
of 
Mombasa 
to 
detect 
material 
intended 
for 
malevolent 
acts, 
and 
the 
radiation 
protection 
inspectorate 
had 
stepped 
up 
its 
activities 
to 
curb 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radioactive 
material. 
During 
the 
preceding 
three 
years, 
the 
inspectorateÂs 
priorities 
had 
included 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
national 
database 
of 
radioactive 
material 
and 
the 
security 
of 
such 
material. 
Assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
in 
that 
regard 
Â 
for 
example, 
to 
extend 
scanning 
activities 
to 
other 
ports 
of 
entry 
Â 
would 
be 
appreciated. 
3. 
Effective 
and 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
were 
crucial 
components 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
an 
essential 
foundation 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation 
among 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Kenya 
had 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
and 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
that 
TreatyÂs 
global 
verification 
regime. 
In 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
Kenya, 
the 
Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
the 
CTBTO 
had 
established 
a 
seismic 
and 
infrasound 
station 
in 
the 
country 
as 
part 
of 
that 
verification 
regime. 
His 
country 
was 
making 
all 
necessary 
arrangements 
to 
conclude 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
also 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
CTBT 
if 
they 
had 
not 
already 
done 
so. 
4. 
His 
country 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
assistance 
given 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
the 
Institute 
of 
Nuclear 
Science 
established 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Nairobi 
in 
1983. 
The 
InstituteÂs 
main 
research 
activities 
included 
trace 
element 
analysis 
in 
biomedical, 
environmental, 
agricultural, 
geological 
and 
industrial 
samples. 
Several 
MSc 
and 
PhD 
students 
had 
graduated 
from 
the 
Institute 
during 
the 
preceding 
decade, 
making 
use 
of 
laboratory 
facilities 
established 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance, 
and 
a 
nuclear 
instrumentation 
laboratory 
had 
also 
been 
established 
at 
the 
Institute. 
Kenya 
hoped 
the 
Agency 
would 
increase 
its 
training 
and 
equipment 
support 
to 
the 
Institute, 
assisting 
the 
country 
to 
develop 
a 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
culture 
for 
the 
21st 
century 
when 
it 
was 
expected 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
play 
an 
increasing 
role 
in 
development 
and 
nation-building. 
5. 
Kenya 
had 
put 
in 
place 
a 
legal 
and 
institutional 
mechanism 
for 
the 
registration 
and 
licensing 
of 
activities 
involving 
the 
use 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
related 
practices. 
The 
government 
had 
recently 
more 
than 
doubled 
the 
number 
of 
inspectors 
attached 
to 
the 
competent 
authority, 
the 
National 
Radiation 
Protection 
Board, 
and 
had 
doubled 
spending 
on 
the 
Board 
over 
the 
preceding 
two 
years. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
the 
Agency, 
a 
national 
reference 
laboratory 
for 
radiation 
exposure 
of 
persons 
had 
also 
been 
established, 
allowing 
intercomparison 
studies 
to 
be 
conducted 
both 
inside 
and 
outside 
the 
country. 
In 
October 
2005, 
Kenya 
would 
be 
hosting 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
radiation 
protection 
in 
industrial 
radiography. 
The 
country 
placed 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
security 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
especially 
the 
mobile 
sources 
used 
in 
industrial 
radiography. 
6. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
Kenya 
covered 
many 
sectors 
of 
socio-economic 
development, 
including 
agriculture 
and 
livestock, 
human 
health, 
water 
resources 
and 
industrial 
applications. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
refocus 
on 
national 
rather 
than 
regional 
programmes 
through 
financial 
reallocation. 
KenyaÂs 
CPF 
had 
been 
signed 
by 
both 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
national 
competent 
authority.

7. 
In 
the 
agriculture 
sector, 
Kenya 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
national 
project 
on 
crop 
improvement 
and 
management 
through 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
and 
biotechnology 
techniques. 
The 
results 
were 
very 
encouraging 
and 
were 
assisting 
with 
the 
molecular 
characterization 
of 
crops, 
which 
would 
improve 
genetic 
resources 
indexing 
and 
preservation 
of 
crop 
plants 
and, 
in 
turn, 
would 
greatly 
assist 
the 
country 
in 
addressing 
food 
security 
and 
poverty 
alleviation. 
Molecular 
and 
mutation 
techniques 
were 
being 
applied 
to 
develop 
crop 
varieties 
that 
were 
tolerant 
to 
drought 
and 
disease. 
Another 
national 
project 
had 
been 
initiated 
on 
isotope 
techniques 
for 
the 
assessment 
of 
nitrogen 
and 
fertilizer 
use 
efficiency 
in 
cowpea 
and 
maize 
intercropping 
systems 
in 
the 
semi-arid 
parts 
of 
Kenya. 
Environmental 
conditions 
were 
being 
addressed 
through 
a 
project 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
combat 
desertification. 
8. 
In 
October 
2005, 
Kenya 
would 
be 
hosting 
in 
Nairobi 
a 
regional 
workshop 
on 
combating 
land 
degradation 
and 
soil 
infertility 
in 
Africa, 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
International 
Centre 
for 
Research 
in 
Agroforestry. 
It 
also 
planned 
to 
host 
another 
regional 
meeting 
on 
improving 
nutritious 
crops 
through 
mutation 
and 
biotechnology 
techniques. 
9. 
His 
country 
was 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
Model 
Project 
aimed 
at 
the 
eradication 
of 
tsetse 
flies 
in 
the 
Lambwe 
Valley. 
The 
project 
combined 
conventional 
tsetse 
control 
techniques 
with 
the 
SIT 
in 
an 
area-wide 
approach. 
The 
Kenyan 
Government 
had 
earmarked 
US 
$120 
000 
per 
annum 
for 
project 
operations 
and 
significant 
suppression 
of 
field 
tsetse 
populations 
had 
been 
achieved 
along 
with 
a 
significant 
reduction 
of 
disease 
incidence 
in 
livestock. 
Under 
the 
project, 
the 
Government 
had 
also 
continued 
to 
receive 
equipment 
from 
the 
Agency 
for 
upgrading 
insectaries 
to 
enhance 
tsetse 
mass 
rearing, 
along 
with 
expert 
missions 
and 
training 
for 
capacity 
building 
in 
area-wide 
tsetse 
population 
management. 
Kenya 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
donating 
a 
gamma 
irradiator 
as 
part 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
arrangements 
for 
housing 
the 
irradiator 
had 
been 
completed. 
The 
project 
was 
expected 
to 
have 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
PATTEC 
plan 
of 
action. 
10. 
Nuclear 
techniques 
had 
played 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
the 
management 
of 
major 
diseases 
in 
Kenya 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
provided 
substantial 
assistance 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
through 
the 
National 
Council 
for 
Science 
and 
Technology. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
had 
helped 
with 
the 
further 
integration 
of 
isotope 
techniques 
in 
national 
and 
other 
donor-supported 
programmes 
pertaining 
to 
the 
monitoring 
of 
drug 
resistance, 
inter 
alia 
in 
connection 
with 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis. 
HIV/AIDS, 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis 
were 
acute 
problems 
and 
all 
efforts 
were 
being 
focused 
on 
sustaining 
projects 
for 
their 
proper 
diagnosis 
and 
adequate 
treatment. 
His 
country 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
continued 
assistance 
in 
combating 
those 
diseases. 
It 
was 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
two 
regional 
projects: 
one 
on 
the 
use 
of 
isotope 
techniques 
to 
assess 
nutrition 
intervention 
programmes 
related 
to 
HIV/AIDS 
in 
Africa 
and 
another 
on 
HIV-1 
molecular 
epidemiology 
and 
immunology 
in 
support 
of 
the 
UNAIDS-WHO 
African 
AIDS 
vaccine 
programme. 
11. 
Kenya 
had 
only 
one 
public 
radiation 
oncology 
centre, 
at 
the 
Kenyatta 
National 
Hospital 
in 
Nairobi, 
with 
two 
cobalt-60 
units 
serving 
a 
population 
of 
33 
million. 
Agency 
assistance 
with 
upgrading 
the 
centre, 
and 
establishing 
further 
radiotherapy 
treatment 
centres 
in 
Kisumu 
and 
Mombasa, 
would 
be 
appreciated. 
The 
Kenyatta 
National 
Hospital 
Medical 
Training 
Centre 
also 
needed 
help 
with 
facilities 
and 
infrastructure 
to 
train 
radiotherapy 
technicians 
and 
technologists. 
12. 
Since 
water 
was 
scarce 
in 
Kenya, 
it 
appreciated 
the 
important 
role 
isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
were 
playing 
in 
the 
development 
and 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
under 
project 
RAF/8/037, 
Sustainable 
Development 
and 
Equitable 
Utilization 
of 
the 
Common 
Nile 
Basin 
Water 
Resources. 
The 
project 
objective 
was 
to 
enhance 
participating 
Member 
StatesÂ 
capability 
to 
meet 
the 
shared 
vision 
of 
the 
Nile 
Basin 
Initiative. 
Kenya 
had 
initiated 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
national 
project 
concept 
for 
implementation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
2007Â2008 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
cycle.

13. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
scientific 
and 
development 
activities. 
Accordingly, 
in 
October 
2005, 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Government 
of 
Kenya 
would 
be 
hosting 
a 
national 
seminar 
on 
public 
awareness 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
The 
participants, 
who 
would 
include 
policy-makers, 
planners, 
researchers 
and 
representatives 
of 
public 
institutions, 
the 
private 
sector, 
NGOs 
and 
community-based 
organizations, 
would 
discuss 
and 
adopt 
a 
draft 
constitution 
for 
the 
proposed 
Society 
for 
the 
Promotion 
of 
Peaceful 
Applications 
of 
Nuclear 
Science 
in 
Kenya. 
14. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
efforts, 
and 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
its 
implementation 
of 
programmes 
in 
his 
country. 
15. 
Mr. 
TZOTCHEV 
(Bulgaria) 
said 
that 
recent 
developments 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
had 
shown 
the 
need 
for 
greater 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT. 
Bulgaria 
remained 
fully 
committed 
to 
a 
universal 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
backed 
by 
a 
strong 
international 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
should 
become 
a 
verification 
standard 
for 
NPT 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
and 
his 
country 
called 
on 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
16. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
in 
particular 
their 
commitment 
to 
a 
peaceful, 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
peninsula. 
17. 
The 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
would 
be 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Bulgaria 
had 
initiated 
the 
national 
procedure 
for 
ratification 
of 
the 
amendments. 
18. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
significant 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
project 
on 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Bulgaria. 
The 
public 
hearing 
organized 
in 
January 
2005 
had 
shown 
that 
there 
was 
strong 
support 
for 
continuing 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
Bulgaria. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
environmental 
impact 
report 
and 
the 
feasibility 
study 
report, 
in 
April 
2005 
the 
Bulgarian 
Government 
had 
taken 
the 
final 
decision 
to 
build 
the 
Belene 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
The 
pre-qualification 
process 
was 
finished 
and 
the 
tender 
procedure 
for 
the 
engineering, 
procurement 
and 
construction 
contract 
had 
begun. 
The 
bid 
winner 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
announced 
in 
early 
2006. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
support 
they 
had 
given 
the 
Bulgarian 
counterparts 
in 
that 
process. 
19. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
establishing 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
and 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States. 
Considerable 
progress 
had 
been 
achieved 
in 
making 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient. 
Bulgaria 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
and 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy 
for 
their 
assistance 
in 
upgrading 
the 
safety 
of 
its 
nuclear 
facilities, 
in 
developing 
and 
applying 
new 
technologies 
in 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
field 
and 
in 
increasing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
capabilities 
of 
the 
Bulgarian 
nuclear 
safety 
authority. 
His 
country 
participated 
regularly 
and 
actively 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
giving 
high 
priority 
to 
regional 
projects 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
20. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
financial 
support, 
Bulgarian 
specialists 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field 
had 
been 
able 
to 
attend 
international 
conferences, 
symposia 
and 
seminars, 
and 
exchange 
experience 
and 
knowledge 
with 
their 
colleagues 
from 
other 
countries. 
Bulgarian 
research 
institutes 
and 
laboratories 
had 
taken 
part 
in 
the 
research 
programme 
through 
contracts 
and 
agreements 
and 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
relevant 
Agency 
coordinated 
research 
projects. 
21. 
Bulgaria 
also 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
International 
Nuclear 
Information 
System, 
the 
Incident 
Reporting 
System 
and 
the 
Power 
Reactor 
Information 
System. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
initiative 
to 
establish 
a 
World 
Nuclear 
University 
and 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
as 
founding 
supporter.

22. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
proposed 
budget 
for 
2006. 
Bulgaria 
had 
met 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
for 
2004 
in 
full 
and 
had 
paid 
its 
pledged 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF. 
Its 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006 
would 
be 
$12 
400. 
23. 
Mr. 
DRAGO 
(Italy) 
said 
that, 
like 
other 
EU 
Member 
States, 
Italy 
was 
strongly 
committed 
to 
ensuring 
the 
full 
implementation 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
NPT. 
A 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
security, 
including 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
was 
the 
most 
efficient 
way 
maintaining 
order, 
peace 
and 
stability. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
crucial 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
regard. 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
recent 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
disappointing. 
The 
EU 
countries 
had 
a 
common 
position 
on 
the 
NPT 
which 
incorporated, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
following 
points: 
the 
need 
for 
all 
countries 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Treaty; 
suspension 
of 
nuclear 
cooperation 
where 
the 
Agency 
could 
not 
provide 
adequate 
assurances 
that 
a 
StateÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
was 
designed 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes; 
the 
need 
to 
do 
everything 
possible 
to 
prevent 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
need 
to 
comply 
with 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540; 
the 
important 
role 
played 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
terrorism 
by 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative, 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
and 
the 
G8 
Global 
Partnership 
Initiative; 
the 
need 
for 
better 
control 
over 
proliferation-
sensitive 
parts 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
and 
the 
urgent 
need 
to 
examine 
the 
report 
on 
multinational 
approaches 
to 
that 
issue 
produced 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
expert 
group. 
24. 
Italy 
supported 
all 
activities 
performed 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
fulfilment 
of 
its 
statutory 
obligations 
in 
all 
its 
three 
main 
areas 
of 
activity: 
safeguards 
and 
verification, 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
technical 
cooperation. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
conference 
which 
had 
adopted 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
intended 
to 
ratify 
those 
amendments 
quickly. 
Furthermore, 
it 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
all 
fundamental 
activities 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
a 
threat 
which 
pervaded 
every 
sphere 
of 
human 
activity 
and 
constituted 
a 
severe 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
community. 
25. 
Since 
compliance 
with 
multilateral 
standards 
and 
regulations 
was 
essential 
for 
their 
credibility 
and 
efficiency, 
it 
was 
vital 
to 
be 
able 
to 
verify 
compliance 
and 
detect 
violations. 
Optimum 
use 
should 
be 
made 
of 
existing 
verification 
mechanisms 
and 
systems, 
but 
ways 
of 
improving 
them 
should 
also 
be 
sought. 
Italy 
saw 
additional 
protocols 
as 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
was 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
the 
additional 
protocols 
constituted 
the 
verification 
standard 
and 
it 
called 
for 
universal 
adherence 
to 
those 
instruments. 
Having 
followed 
the 
work 
of 
the 
new 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute, 
his 
country 
was 
of 
the 
opinion 
that 
the 
current 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
system 
could 
be 
reviewed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
its 
improvement, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
increased 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
weapon 
proliferation 
in 
the 
modern 
world. 
26. 
In 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident, 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
been 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
political 
debate. 
Following 
a 
referendum 
in 
1987, 
Italy 
had 
begun 
to 
phase 
out 
its 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
was 
now 
planning 
to 
decommission 
them, 
including 
reprocessing 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
abroad 
and 
the 
identification 
of 
a 
national 
repository 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
waste. 
In 
implementing 
decommissioning 
projects, 
particular 
attention 
needed 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
Ânon-technological 
factorsÂ 
such 
as 
involving 
local 
communities 
and 
site 
redevelopers. 
A 
State-run 
company 
had 
been 
entrusted 
with 
the 
decommissioning 
programme. 
27. 
Nonetheless, 
the 
commitment 
to 
research 
into 
and 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
innovative 
nuclear 
power 
reactor 
systems 
had 
to 
be 
maintained. 
His 
country 
was 
considering 
taking 
part 
in 
international 
cooperation 
agreements 
in 
that 
field. 
Public 
opinion 
on 
nuclear 
issues 
was 
changing, 
especially 
among 
the 
younger 
generation. 
While 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
Italy 
was 
not 
on 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
agenda, 
it 
supported 
increased 
cooperation 
and 
participation 
in 
new 
European 
and 
international 
nuclear 
technology 
programmes 
and 
projects.

28. 
Nuclear 
safety 
had 
to 
be 
the 
highest 
priority 
in 
every 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
International 
cooperation 
was 
essential 
in 
that 
field 
and 
all 
countries 
should 
strive 
constantly 
to 
improve 
safety 
standards. 
29. 
The 
safe 
and 
secure 
management 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
was 
an 
international 
issue 
of 
great 
importance 
and 
his 
country 
supported 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
recent 
conference 
on 
that 
issue 
held 
in 
Bordeaux, 
in 
particular 
the 
need 
for 
periodic 
exchange 
of 
information 
on 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2003. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
30. 
Italy 
also 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
the 
Italian 
parliament 
had 
recently 
passed 
a 
bill 
granting 
the 
Government 
the 
necessary 
resources 
to 
fund 
those 
activities 
to 
the 
full 
amount 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
assessed 
share. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
coordination 
that 
had 
been 
pursued 
with 
other 
organizations, 
in 
particular 
the 
World 
Bank 
and 
WHO, 
and 
the 
efforts 
to 
make 
technical 
assistance 
more 
fruitful 
and 
cost-effective. 
That 
trend 
should 
be 
maintained 
and 
recipient 
countries 
should 
be 
encouraged 
to 
make 
a 
strong 
commitment. 
31. 
Through 
UNESCO, 
Italy 
contributed 
more 
than 
80% 
of 
the 
budget 
of 
the 
ICTP, 
whose 
activities 
and 
programmes 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
international 
cooperation 
among 
scientists 
from 
all 
countries. 
It 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
the 
ICTP 
and 
felt 
encouraged 
thereby 
to 
continue 
and 
increase 
its 
support 
for 
the 
Centre, 
and 
to 
enhance 
the 
CentreÂs 
role 
of 
closing 
the 
North-South 
technological 
and 
scientific 
divide. 
32. 
Much 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
budget 
but 
well 
defined 
priorities 
needed 
to 
be 
established 
before 
any 
new 
activities 
were 
undertaken. 
Italy 
supported 
the 
results-based 
approach 
which 
helped 
identify 
deviations 
in 
programme 
implementation 
and 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
learn 
from 
experience. 
With 
regard 
to 
staffing, 
the 
Secretariat 
should 
apply 
strict 
recruitment 
criteria 
based 
on 
competence 
and 
scientific 
and 
technological 
expertise. 
33. 
Mr. 
VIEIRA 
DE 
SOUZA 
(Brazil) 
acknowledged 
the 
AgencyÂs 
outstanding 
work 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
verification, 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
As 
the 
discussions 
on 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
had 
become 
central 
in 
the 
international 
agenda, 
it 
was 
important 
not 
to 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
equally 
pressing 
need 
for 
effective 
action 
aimed 
at 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament 
commitments 
under 
the 
NPT. 
The 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
yet 
to 
show 
real 
readiness 
to 
move 
towards 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
their 
nuclear 
arsenals, 
which 
they 
had 
committed 
themselves 
to 
at 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
The 
lack 
of 
results 
at 
the 
most 
recent 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
consensus 
on 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
at 
the 
2005 
World 
Summit 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
were 
clear 
signs 
of 
the 
current 
negative 
trends, 
and 
cause 
for 
dismay 
for 
countries 
like 
Brazil 
that 
were 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
34. 
Measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
to 
be 
accompanied 
by 
measures 
to 
accelerate 
progress 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
However, 
in 
multilateral 
disarmament 
fora, 
another 
year 
had 
passed 
without 
any 
significant 
developments. 
The 
impasse 
in 
the 
deliberations 
in 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
remained 
and, 
almost 
ten 
years 
after 
its 
adoption, 
the 
CTBT 
had 
yet 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
He 
urged 
all 
Annex 
2 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
CTBT. 
He 
also 
called 
on 
all 
nations 
to 
intensify 
their 
endeavours 
to 
reverse 
the 
current 
negative 
trends 
and 
ensure 
that 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
were 
upheld, 
recalling 
that 
all 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
countries 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty 
establishing 
the 
first 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
a 
densely 
populated 
region 
of 
the 
world. 
35. 
Brazil 
remained 
a 
firm 
supporter 
of 
international 
efforts 
to 
combat 
all 
forms 
of 
terrorism, 
including 
possible 
malicious 
acts 
involving 
nuclear 
material. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Nuclear

Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
stressed 
that 
responsibility 
for 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material 
rested 
entirely 
with 
the 
State, 
and 
that 
adherence 
to 
Agency 
guidelines 
and 
recommendations 
related 
to 
security 
enhancement 
was 
voluntary. 
The 
primacy 
of 
the 
State 
in 
security 
issues 
had 
to 
be 
respected. 
Noting 
that 
the 
activities 
foreseen 
in 
the 
Plan 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
funded 
from 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
and 
that 
funding 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
limited, 
he 
emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
ensure 
that 
any 
additional 
activities 
relating 
to 
protection 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
should 
not 
affect 
the 
priorities 
and 
resources 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 


36. 
Brazil 
had 
actively 
supported 
the 
broadening 
of 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
CPPNM. 
Despite 
some 
concerns 
with 
regard 
to 
certain 
aspects 
of 
the 
amendments 
proposed, 
it 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
on 
them. 
37. 
The 
safeguards 
system 
was 
a 
major 
element 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
His 
delegation 
had 
been 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
discussions 
in 
the 
Board 
which 
had 
led 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
new 
committee 
on 
safeguards 
and 
verification. 
Brazil 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
committee 
would 
have 
advisory 
status 
and 
would 
operate 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
It 
also 
appreciated 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
committee 
would 
comprise 
all 
members 
of 
the 
Board 
and 
that 
other 
Member 
States 
would 
be 
able 
to 
participate 
in 
its 
work. 
38. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
achieved 
in 
the 
cooperation 
between 
ABACC 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement. 
Significant 
improvements 
had 
been 
achieved 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
guidelines 
for 
joint 
safeguards 
activities 
at 
several 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
procedures 
for 
unannounced 
inspections 
and 
for 
common 
use 
of 
safeguards 
equipment. 
Brazil 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
cooperation 
between 
ABACC 
and 
the 
Agency 
and 
urged 
both 
to 
continue 
working 
together, 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
any 
unnecessary 
duplication 
of 
effort 
and 
make 
safeguards 
activities 
more 
cost-effective. 
39. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
resolution 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
Iran 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
on 
24 
September, 
his 
country 
was 
of 
the 
view 
that 
all 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
should 
preferably 
be 
resolved 
through 
dialogue 
and 
cooperation 
and 
that 
the 
issue 
in 
question 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
dealt 
with 
within 
the 
Agency. 
40. 
Brazil 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
continued 
to 
support 
regional 
cooperative 
approaches 
such 
as 
ARCAL. 
The 
development 
of 
a 
strategic 
alliance 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
ARCAL, 
which 
was 
currently 
under 
discussion, 
would 
improve 
the 
outcome 
of 
regional 
projects 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
and 
the 
redesigning 
of 
the 
programme 
cycle 
would 
enhance 
the 
DepartmentÂs 
capacity 
to 
implement 
the 
programme. 
41. 
Nuclear 
safety 
was 
essential 
to 
promote 
public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
other 
nuclear 
applications. 
His 
country 
had 
made 
a 
political 
commitment 
to 
work 
towards 
following 
the 
guidance 
contained 
in 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
number 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
safety 
standards 
and 
guides 
issued 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
2004, 
in 
particular 
those 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
design 
and 
management 
of 
waste 
from 
the 
use 
of 
radioactive 
material 
in 
medicine, 
industry 
and 
research. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
developing 
standards 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
facility 
safety 
was 
to 
be 
commended 
and 
the 
development 
of 
such 
standards 
should 
be 
given 
high 
priority. 
42. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
potential 
risks 
to 
coastal 
populations 
and 
the 
marine 
environment 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
accident 
during 
the 
maritime 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
and 
nuclear 
waste, 
Brazil 
had 
supported 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
the 
progressive 
strengthening 
of 
international 
norms 
on 
the 
issue. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
TranSAS 
mission 
to 
Brazil 
in 
2002 
acknowledged 
that 
Brazil 
already 
had 
a 
sound

transport 
regulatory 
system 
in 
place 
and 
identified 
good 
practices 
that 
could 
be 
used 
as 
a 
model 
for 
other 
competent 
authorities. 


43. 
Brazil 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
with 
regard 
to 
preservation 
of 
knowledge. 
The 
scope 
of 
activities 
in 
that 
area 
should 
be 
enlarged 
to 
cover 
nuclear 
science 
and 
its 
applications 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Ibero-American 
Radiation 
Safety 
Network, 
which 
should 
help 
promote 
the 
sharing 
of 
existing 
knowledge 
and 
expertise 
among 
countries. 
The 
International 
Nuclear 
Information 
System 
was 
also 
an 
important 
tool 
for 
enhancing 
maintenance 
and 
preservation 
of 
knowledge. 
44. 
Mr. 
DINH 
TIEN 
(Vietnam) 
said 
that, 
recognizing 
the 
vital 
role 
nuclear 
energy 
played 
in 
VietnamÂs 
development, 
over 
the 
years 
his 
Government 
had 
implemented 
policies 
on 
promotion 
of 
research 
into, 
and 
development 
and 
the 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
strengthening 
of 
nuclear 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
and 
extension 
of 
international 
cooperation. 
Nuclear 
legislation 
was 
planned 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
National 
Assembly 
by 
2007. 
The 
Vietnamese 
Government 
was 
currently 
reviewing 
for 
approval 
a 
national 
strategy 
on 
development 
and 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
and 
the 
final 
report 
on 
a 
pre-feasibility 
study 
on 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
first 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
45. 
In 
order 
to 
promote 
and 
ensure 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
a 
plan 
was 
being 
implemented 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
nuclear 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
with 
a 
view 
to 
capacity-building 
of 
the 
nuclear 
regulatory 
body 
and 
technical 
support 
institutions. 
Safety 
and 
security 
were 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
an 
effective 
and 
comprehensive 
nuclear 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
and 
thus 
Vietnam 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
over 
the 
preceding 
year. 
In 
April, 
it 
had 
invited 
an 
international 
team 
of 
experts 
to 
visit 
the 
country 
to 
hold 
a 
seminar 
on 
nuclear 
security, 
and 
in 
August, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Safeguards, 
it 
had 
held 
a 
seminar 
on 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
In 
December 
it 
would 
be 
hosting 
an 
IAEA 
meeting 
to 
promote 
the 
ratification 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
Consideration 
was 
also 
being 
given 
to 
such 
issues 
as 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
installations, 
and 
conversion 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU 
research 
reactor 
fuel. 
46. 
Vietnam 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
CPF 
finalized 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
September 
2003 
identified 
six 
ongoing 
projects 
in 
the 
2005Â2006 
cycle 
and 
seven 
new 
or 
extended 
project 
proposals 
for 
the 
next 
cycle. 
His 
country 
had 
fulfilled 
its 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
full, 
including 
providing 
the 
necessary 
resources 
for 
projects, 
payment 
of 
NPCs 
for 
the 
2005Â2006 
cycle, 
Regular 
Budget 
contributions 
and 
payment 
of 
its 
pledged 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2005. 
In 
the 
current 
year, 
Vietnam 
had 
hosted 
two 
non-RCA 
events 
and 
two 
RCA 
events 
and 
in 
October 
it 
would 
be 
hosting 
a 
technical 
meeting 
on 
the 
Asian 
Network 
for 
Education 
in 
Nuclear 
Technology. 
47. 
Through 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Vietnam 
had 
made 
important 
progress 
in 
developing 
human 
resources, 
improving 
the 
national 
radiation 
safety 
infrastructure 
and 
extending 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
to 
such 
areas 
as 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
rice 
varieties, 
food 
preservation, 
production 
of 
radiopharmaceuticals, 
groundwater 
management, 
oil 
and 
gas 
exploration, 
etc. 
48. 
The 
Agency 
was 
VietnamÂs 
most 
important 
source 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
developing 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
in 
strengthening 
its 
nuclear 
regulatory 
capabilities. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
valuable 
assistance 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
would 
be 
run 
even 
more 
effectively, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
socio-economic 
development 
and 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
living 
standards 
of 
people 
in 
all 
Member 
States. 
49. 
Mr. 
DAINIUS 
(Lithuania) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
strongly 
supported 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540, 
had 
improved 
its 
export 
control 
system 
and 
had 
provided 
a 
comprehensive 
report 
pursuant 
to 
the 
resolution. 
It 
urged 
other 
countries 
to 
act 
likewise.

50. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
Conference 
held 
to 
consider 
and 
adopt 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
Lithuania 
was 
preparing 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
amended 
Convention. 
It 
had 
also 
introduced 
new 
physical 
protection 
measures 
at 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
updated 
existing 
ones. 
He 
urged 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Convention 
to 
take 
steps 
ensure 
that 
the 
amendments 
entered 
into 
force 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
51. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
worldwide 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
his 
country 
noted 
the 
significant 
progress 
made 
by 
both 
the 
international 
community 
and 
individual 
States 
in 
improving 
their 
preparedness 
to 
prevent, 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
threats 
to 
society. 
That 
progress 
had 
been 
clearly 
demonstrated 
at 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security 
held 
in 
London 
in 
March 
2005. 
In 
signing 
the 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
on 
16 
September 
2005, 
Lithuania 
had 
taken 
another 
step 
towards 
strengthening 
the 
global 
legal 
framework 
to 
counter 
terrorist 
threats. 
52. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
the 
key 
element 
of 
which 
was 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
Lithuania 
had 
been 
implementing 
the 
additional 
protocol 
for 
five 
years. 
In 
both 
2003 
and 
2004, 
a 
positive 
conclusion 
had 
been 
drawn 
regarding 
the 
absence 
of 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activities. 
That 
provided 
a 
good 
basis 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
integrated 
safeguards, 
which 
it 
was 
expected 
would 
take 
place 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2005 
or 
early 
in 
2006. 
Lithuania 
urged 
other 
States 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
full 
transparency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
53. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
his 
country 
had 
participated 
in 
and 
benefited 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
including 
the 
preparation 
of 
safety 
standards 
and 
other 
documents, 
and 
the 
dissemination 
of 
experience 
through 
the 
AgencyÂs 
services 
and 
numerous 
international 
fora. 
The 
need 
for 
those 
activities 
had 
been 
confirmed 
by 
the 
third 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
held 
in 
April 
2005. 
In 
line 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
that 
Convention 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
standards, 
Lithuania 
continued 
to 
improve 
the 
safety 
level 
of 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
the 
capabilities 
of 
its 
national 
nuclear 
regulator. 
54. 
In 
implementation 
of 
LithuaniaÂs 
international 
obligations 
following 
its 
accession 
to 
the 
European 
Union, 
the 
first 
unit 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
shut 
down. 
The 
safety 
of 
the 
unit 
was 
being 
assured 
via 
the 
usual 
procedures. 
A 
large 
number 
of 
documents 
needed 
to 
be 
prepared 
and 
approved 
for 
the 
decommissioning. 
One 
of 
those 
documents, 
the 
final 
decommissioning 
plan, 
had 
been 
approved 
on 
4 
July 
2005. 
Programmes 
for 
defuelling 
both 
reactors 
and 
the 
unitÂs 
spent 
fuel 
ponds, 
and 
for 
developing 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facilities 
were 
being 
prepared. 
The 
successful 
implementation 
of 
those 
programmes 
in 
the 
years 
to 
come 
would 
enable 
work 
to 
begin 
on 
dismantling 
the 
unit 
equipment 
and 
structure. 
Lithuania 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
support 
it 
had 
provided 
in 
elaborating 
the 
necessary 
documentation. 
The 
safety 
of 
the 
only 
unit 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
still 
in 
operation, 
Unit 
2, 
had 
been 
significantly 
upgraded 
in 
2004. 
To 
ensure 
a 
high 
safety 
level 
Â 
including 
operational 
safety 
Â 
while 
one 
of 
the 
two 
reactors 
was 
being 
decommissioned, 
a 
full-scope 
OSART 
mission 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
2006. 
55. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission, 
his 
country 
was 
devoting 
significant 
resources 
to 
further 
enhancing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
for 
control 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
exposure 
to 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
radiation 
emergencies. 
It 
had 
informed 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
its 
political 
commitment 
to 
supporting 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
56. 
Lithuania 
appreciated 
the 
expert 
missions 
sent 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
2004 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
implementing 
the 
recommendations 
made 
by 
the 
experts 
on 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
national 
strategy 
for

improving 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
including 
orphan 
sources, 
improving 
the 
radiation 
safety 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
and 
occupational 
exposure 
control. 


57. 
His 
country 
was 
making 
every 
effort 
to 
coordinate 
the 
assistance 
it 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
with 
the 
help 
provided 
by 
other 
donors, 
including 
the 
European 
Commission, 
thanks 
to 
which 
a 
quality 
system 
had 
been 
created 
at 
the 
radiation 
protection 
centre 
and 
its 
testing 
laboratory 
had 
been 
accredited. 
58. 
It 
was 
also 
playing 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
Information 
System 
on 
Occupational 
Exposure 
(ISOE). 
The 
effective 
implementation 
of 
radiation 
protection 
optimization 
had 
resulted 
in 
significant 
reduction 
of 
occupational 
exposure 
at 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
59. 
Implementation 
of 
quality 
systems 
in 
hospitals 
was 
important 
for 
control 
of 
medical 
exposure. 
Further 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
needed 
to 
establish 
or 
improve 
substantially 
the 
system 
of 
exposure 
control 
in 
diagnostic 
radiology, 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine, 
through 
the 
development 
of 
appropriate 
quality 
assurance 
and 
quality 
control 
programmes 
and 
optimization 
of 
radiation 
protection 
of 
patients. 
60. 
The 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
was 
attracting 
increasing 
attention 
throughout 
the 
world. 
Several 
international 
initiatives 
were 
under 
way 
to 
develop, 
improve 
and 
harmonize 
approaches 
to 
assessing 
and 
demonstrating 
the 
safety 
of 
waste 
disposal 
facilities. 
The 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
obliged 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
assess 
the 
safety 
of 
waste 
management 
facilities 
prior 
to 
their 
construction 
and 
operation 
and 
to 
review 
the 
safety 
of 
existing 
facilities. 
The 
Lithuanian 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
Agency 
was 
continuing 
with 
the 
selection 
and 
characterization 
of 
a 
site 
for 
construction 
of 
a 
near-surface 
repository 
for 
short-lived 
low-and 
intermediate-level 
waste. 
The 
environmental, 
social 
and 
economic 
consequences 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal 
near 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
were 
being 
considered 
and 
consultations 
with 
neighbouring 
countries 
were 
being 
held. 
Therefore, 
his 
country 
would 
like 
the 
Agency 
to 
organize 
a 
peer 
review 
which 
could 
offer 
advice 
on 
whether 
the 
programme 
was 
consistent 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
good 
practices 
in 
other 
national 
disposal 
programmes. 
61. 
It 
was 
obvious 
that 
no 
global 
goal 
could 
be 
achieved 
without 
close 
cooperation 
among 
States. 
For 
over 
a 
decade, 
Lithuanian 
organizations 
had 
been 
actively 
participating 
in 
and 
benefiting 
from 
Agency 
regional 
and 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
nuclear 
safety, 
physical 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
security, 
radiation 
protection, 
radiotherapy 
and 
waste 
management. 
Six 
national 
projects 
were 
planned 
to 
be 
ongoing 
throughout 
the 
2005Â2006 
biennium. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
forthcoming 
decommissioning 
process 
at 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
his 
country 
had 
a 
particular 
interest 
in 
increasing 
the 
decommissioning 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
of 
Lithuanian 
specialists 
and 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
recently 
initiated 
regional 
project 
on 
that 
subject. 
Enhancement 
of 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
and 
authorities, 
and 
training 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
had 
to 
be 
done 
in 
parallel. 
Lithuania 
looked 
forward 
to 
participating 
in 
projects 
in 
those 
areas 
not 
only 
as 
a 
recipient 
but 
also 
as 
an 
information 
donor. 
It 
appreciated 
the 
active 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
organizing 
fellowships, 
workshops, 
seminars 
and 
training 
courses, 
and 
providing 
other 
technical 
support 
that 
enhanced 
the 
infrastructure 
of 
the 
regulatory 
authorities 
and 
other 
competent 
institutions 
and 
increased 
the 
skills 
and 
knowledge 
of 
Lithuanian 
specialists. 
62. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
grown 
substantially 
in 
size, 
complexity 
and 
the 
number 
of 
participating 
States. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
new, 
more 
transparent 
and 
efficient 
approach 
to 
the 
programme 
cycle 
management 
framework 
and 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
projects 
and 
help 
meet 
Member 
StatesÂ 
needs.

63. 
Mr. 
CARRERA 
DORAL 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
condemned 
the 
fact 
the 
United 
Nations 
was 
no 
longer 
operating 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principles 
and 
objectives 
enshrined 
in 
its 
Charter. 
Today, 
the 
more 
powerful 
nations 
were 
only 
striving 
to 
ensure 
the 
United 
Nations 
could 
be 
controlled 
more 
effectively 
in 
line 
with 
their 
political 
interests, 
without 
recognizing 
the 
right 
to 
peace 
and 
development 
of 
States 
that 
did 
not 
belong 
to 
their 
group. 
To 
that 
end, 
those 
States 
had 
unscrupulously 
turned 
to 
such 
measures 
as 
interventions 
and 
preventive 
wars. 
64. 
CubaÂs 
position 
on 
the 
need 
for 
complete, 
unconditional 
and 
verifiable 
nuclear 
disarmament 
was 
well 
known. 
Many 
States 
that 
shared 
that 
view 
placed 
their 
hopes 
in 
the 
NPT 
but 
Cuba, 
which 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
which 
had 
used 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
uses, 
had 
always 
considered 
the 
NPT 
to 
be 
inadequate 
and 
discriminatory 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
objective 
of 
eliminating 
nuclear 
weapons. 
However, 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
commitment 
to 
multilateralism 
and 
to 
show 
political 
goodwill, 
Cuba 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
ratified 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty 
and, 
since 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol, 
it 
had 
rigorously 
complied 
with 
all 
its 
obligations 
in 
that 
regard. 
65. 
The 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
make 
progress 
on 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament, 
international 
cooperation 
on 
peaceful 
uses 
and 
verification, 
which 
were 
inseparable 
from 
one 
another. 
However, 
the 
Conference 
had 
been 
a 
failure. 
Some 
nuclear-
weapon 
States 
had 
not 
been 
willing 
to 
take 
concrete 
steps 
towards 
disarmament 
and 
had, 
in 
fact, 
moved 
openly 
into 
an 
advanced 
phase 
of 
vertical 
proliferation 
while 
daily 
trying 
to 
impose 
more 
restrictions 
on 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
Aggressive 
acts 
had 
been 
justified 
on 
the 
pretext 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
based 
on 
evidence 
that 
had 
proven 
to 
be 
false. 
Such 
a 
course 
was 
extremely 
dangerous, 
was 
not 
conducive 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
put 
in 
jeopardy 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
verification 
of 
non-proliferation 
commitments. 
66. 
Cuba 
had 
taken 
note 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
reports 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
BoardÂs 
related 
resolutions. 
It 
had 
fully 
supported 
the 
statements 
made 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
NAM 
which 
had 
expressed 
concern 
regarding 
the 
content 
of 
those 
resolutions 
and 
the 
methods 
by 
which 
they 
had 
been 
adopted, 
while 
acknowledging 
the 
professional 
and 
impartial 
attitude 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Secretariat 
and 
welcoming 
the 
progress 
made. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
wished 
to 
reaffirm 
CubaÂs 
position 
on 
several 
issues. 
67. 
First 
of 
all, 
every 
State 
had 
an 
inalienable 
and 
sovereign 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
No 
State 
could 
be 
required 
to 
restrict 
its 
use 
of 
such 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
unless 
it 
had 
been 
demonstrated 
that 
that 
State 
had 
violated 
its 
NPT 
obligations. 
68. 
Secondly, 
only 
the 
Agency 
had 
the 
authority 
and 
mandate 
to 
verify 
a 
StateÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
or 
draw 
conclusions 
on 
its 
nature 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
objective 
and 
accurate 
information. 
69. 
Thirdly, 
Cuba 
denounced 
any 
manipulation 
of 
information 
relating 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
processes. 
Nobody 
had 
the 
right 
to 
prejudge 
a 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
or 
to 
politicize 
the 
issue. 
Neither 
did 
they 
have 
to 
right 
to 
interpret 
the 
Statute 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
create 
a 
supposed 
violation 
of 
NPT 
commitments, 
providing 
a 
basis 
for 
referring 
a 
case 
to 
the 
Security 
Council. 
70. 
Fourthly, 
there 
should 
be 
a 
clear 
distinction 
between 
a 
StateÂs 
legal 
obligations 
and 
voluntary 
political 
commitments 
made 
as 
a 
demonstration 
of 
goodwill. 
Referral 
of 
a 
case 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
in 
connection 
with 
a 
StateÂs 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
voluntary 
commitments 
was 
not 
permissible. 
71. 
Any 
other 
approach 
would 
have 
a 
serious 
negative 
effect 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
authority, 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
Cuba 
hoped 
that 
technical 
issues 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
verification 
would 
not 
become 
a 
political 
issue 
leading 
to 
another 
international 
crisis. 
Furthermore, 
it 
strongly 
supported 
political 
and 
diplomatic 
efforts 
to 
reach 
solutions 
that 
were 

GC(49)/OR.4 
27

11 


acceptable 
to 
all 
parties, 
that 
remained 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
that 
respected 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
all 
States 
and 
the 
objectives 
and 
principles 
of 
the 
Charter 
of 
the 
United 
Nations. 


72. 
Today 
more 
than 
ever 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
and 
achieve 
a 
proper 
balance 
between 
its 
various 
statutory 
activities. 
In 
particular, 
technical 
cooperation 
should 
be 
given 
the 
importance 
and 
support 
it 
deserved. 
That 
activity 
was 
a 
very 
high 
priority 
for 
Cuba, 
as 
was 
shown 
by 
the 
high 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
indicators 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
high 
project 
implementation 
levels, 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
its 
experts 
involved 
in 
cooperation 
with 
other 
countries, 
and 
its 
strict 
compliance 
with 
its 
financial 
obligations 
vis-Ã -vis 
the 
TCF 
and 
its 
NPCs. 
73. 
Cuba 
welcomed 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
the 
ARCAL 
agreement, 
which 
was 
the 
best 
way 
to 
promote 
cooperation 
and 
exchanges 
between 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
74. 
A 
strong 
and 
efficient 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
was 
essential 
to 
implement 
successfully 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
strategy. 
It 
was 
therefore 
important 
to 
finish 
the 
restructuring 
process 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
75. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
pay 
special 
attention 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
activities, 
including 
physical 
protection. 
It 
had 
continued 
to 
strengthen 
its 
infrastructure 
and 
human 
resources 
training 
in 
that 
area. 
In 
2004, 
it 
had 
received 
a 
mission 
to 
review 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
its 
regulatory 
authority, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
had 
confirmed 
that 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
radiation 
sources 
and 
the 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
were 
assured. 
76. 
Cuba 
had 
played 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
process 
to 
amend 
the 
CPPNM. 
That 
Convention 
was 
an 
appropriate 
mechanism 
to 
strengthen 
physical 
protection, 
as 
long 
as 
its 
implementation 
did 
not 
lead 
to 
any 
form 
of 
discrimination 
and 
it 
was 
understood 
that 
the 
exclusion 
of 
armed 
forces 
from 
its 
scope 
could 
under 
no 
circumstances 
be 
used 
as 
a 
pretext 
by 
a 
State 
to 
attack 
nuclear 
facilities 
owned 
by 
another. 
77. 
Mr. 
ALI 
(Bangladesh) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
stood 
ready 
to 
join 
any 
multilateral 
initiative 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
to 
combat 
terrorism. 
It 
had 
recently 
acceded 
to 
eight 
international 
counter-terrorism 
conventions, 
including 
the 
CPPNM. 
It 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1373 
and 
had 
already 
enacted 
national 
laws 
to 
combat 
terrorism, 
including 
laws 
related 
to 
money 
laundering 
and 
financing. 
78. 
Bangladesh 
was 
an 
unequivocal 
supporter 
of 
the 
NPT 
regime. 
It 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
disarmament 
and 
had 
consciously 
renounced 
the 
option 
to 
go 
nuclear. 
As 
a 
signatory 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
CTBT, 
it 
was 
fully 
conscious 
of 
its 
obligations 
to 
maintain 
transparency 
under 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 
He 
urged 
those 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
that 
had 
not 
already 
done 
so 
to 
conclude 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
79. 
The 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
a 
special 
responsibility: 
they 
had 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
rid 
the 
world 
of 
their 
nuclear 
weapons. 
States 
that 
did 
not 
possess 
such 
weapons 
should 
renounce 
them 
completely. 
80. 
His 
country 
had 
a 
longstanding 
association 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
Bangladesh 
made 
a 
modest 
contribution 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
experts 
and 
training 
facilities. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
Bangladesh 
had 
always 
been 
very 
important. 
The 
Agency 
had 
provided 
support 
for 
an 
irradiator 
plant, 
and 
use 
of 
X-rays, 
gamma 
rays 
and 
radioactive 
isotopes 
had 
increased 
in 
medicine, 
industry, 
hydrology 
and 
food 
preservation, 
often 
with 
Agency 
assistance. 
Scientists 
from 
the 
Bangladesh 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
were 
always 
trying 
to 
promote 
and 
ensure 
the 
controlled 
and 
safer 
use 
of 
radioactive 
devices.

81. 
His 
country 
remained 
concerned 
about 
the 
potential 
nuclearization 
of 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
that 
region, 
which 
his 
country 
supported. 
82. 
There 
was 
a 
strong 
link 
between 
disarmament 
and 
development, 
and 
the 
insistence 
on 
retaining 
or 
developing 
nuclear 
weapons 
would 
not 
only 
have 
implications 
for 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
but 
also 
for 
development. 
While 
countries 
should 
have 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
he 
urged 
States 
to 
recommit 
themselves 
to 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
world. 
83. 
Mr. 
POLOZANI 
(The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
signed 
a 
safeguard 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
had 
joined 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
were 
crucial 
instruments 
in 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
both 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
84. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
give 
the 
highest 
priority 
to 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
his 
country 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
security. 
It 
had 
implemented 
protection 
measures 
at 
all 
border 
crossings. 
Further 
upgrading 
of 
equipment 
and 
training 
of 
staff 
would 
be 
required. 
The 
country 
had 
been 
identified 
as 
a 
recipient 
country 
under 
the 
EU 
joint 
action 
in 
support 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
and 
a 
fact-finding 
mission 
was 
to 
be 
dispatched 
soon 
to 
identify 
measures 
for 
further 
upgrading 
of 
the 
security 
of 
sources. 
85. 
The 
Agency 
was 
assisting 
his 
country 
with 
the 
development 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
legal 
framework 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
compliance 
with 
international 
radiation 
safety 
standards. 
An 
independent 
Radiation 
Safety 
Directorate 
had 
been 
established. 
Further 
assistance 
was 
required 
for 
the 
directorate 
to 
become 
operational, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recommendations 
made 
by 
the 
recent 
RaSSIA 
mission. 
86. 
He 
commended 
the 
support 
and 
efficient 
assistance 
the 
Agency 
had 
provided 
through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Proposals 
had 
been 
submitted 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
project 
cycle 
based 
on 
a 
joint 
evaluation 
with 
the 
pre-project 
formulation 
mission 
sent 
by 
the 
Agency. 
The 
selected 
projects 
were 
in 
line 
with 
the 
CPF 
and 
aimed 
at 
upgrading 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
in 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
oncology, 
improving 
food 
safety 
standards 
and 
strengthening 
radiation 
protection 
services. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
simplified 
procedures 
for 
planning 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
Despite 
scarce 
resources, 
his 
country 
had 
paid 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
shared 
costs 
for 
proposed 
national 
projects, 
demonstrating 
its 
commitment. 
It 
also 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
European 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
welcomed 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
regional 
programme 
on 
strengthening 
of 
regulatory 
control, 
from 
which 
it 
had 
benefited 
a 
lot. 
It 
strongly 
supported 
the 
PACT 
initiative. 
Three 
out 
of 
its 
five 
proposed 
national 
projects 
were 
related 
to 
further 
improving 
diagnosis 
and 
radiotherapy 
treatment 
of 
cancer 
patients. 
It 
hoped 
that 
PACT 
would 
address 
many 
issues 
of 
concern 
and 
would 
help 
make 
its 
own 
institute 
a 
centre 
of 
competence. 
87. 
Mr. 
SCHALLER 
(Switzerland), 
speaking 
also 
on 
behalf 
of 
Liechtenstein, 
said 
that, 
since 
the 
preceding 
General 
Conference, 
there 
had 
been 
very 
marked 
development 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
cooperation. 
88. 
The 
recent 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
agree 
on 
a 
substantive 
final 
statement. 
The 
declaration 
of 
the 
Summit 
of 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
convened 
for 
the 
60th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
contained 
no 
reference 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Nevertheless, 
Switzerland 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
declaration 
launched 
at 
the 
latest 
Conference 
held 
pursuant 
to 
Article 
XIV 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
still 
believed 
that 
only 
an 
approach 
that 
took 
account 
of 
the 
security 
interests 
of 
all 
would 
allow 
the 
NPT 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
Those 
interests 
were 
linked, 
for 
some, 
to 
proliferation 
risks 
and, 
for

others, 
to 
fears 
of 
not 
being 
able 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
new 
technologies 
essential 
for 
their 
development 
and 
to 
the 
slow 
pace 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 


89. 
The 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
also 
allowed 
for 
an 
extensive 
exchange 
of 
views 
on 
all 
questions 
concerning 
access 
to 
sensitive 
technologies 
in 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
Switzerland 
particularly 
welcomed 
the 
substantial 
work 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
that 
topic 
and 
felt 
that 
the 
proposals 
in 
the 
report 
of 
the 
expert 
group 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
(document 
INFCIRC/640) 
constituted 
an 
interesting 
basis 
for 
discussion. 
However, 
Switzerland 
could 
not 
agree 
with 
proposals 
that 
fundamentally 
contradicted 
the 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
granted 
by 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT. 
A 
StateÂs 
access 
to 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technologies 
should 
be 
conditional 
on 
its 
adherence 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
compliance 
with 
all 
of 
its 
provisions. 
90. 
Switzerland 
had 
noted 
the 
latest 
Agency 
report 
of 
2 
September 
2005 
on 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
which 
had 
contained 
both 
positive 
elements 
and 
some 
that 
were 
still 
unsatisfactory. 
The 
resumption 
of 
uranium 
conversion 
activities 
by 
Tehran 
was 
not 
conducive 
to 
restoring 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
Suspension 
of 
all 
activity 
considered 
sensitive, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Paris 
agreement, 
was 
a 
temporary 
but 
necessary 
confidence-building 
measure. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
of 
France, 
Germany 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
appeal 
launched 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
on 
24 
September 
to 
pursue 
dialogue 
and 
strengthen 
collaboration 
would 
be 
heeded. 
91. 
His 
country 
was 
glad 
to 
see 
that 
the 
efforts 
of 
States 
engaged 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
aimed 
at 
finding 
a 
solution 
to 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
had 
resulted 
in 
a 
promising 
joint 
statement. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
consensual 
approach 
adopted 
by 
all 
of 
the 
participating 
States 
and 
particularly 
commended 
China 
for 
its 
intense 
diplomatic 
efforts. 
It 
encouraged 
the 
participants 
to 
continue 
in 
that 
spirit 
so 
that 
the 
commitments 
in 
the 
joint 
statement 
could 
be 
implemented 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
92. 
It 
was 
pleasing 
that 
the 
project 
for 
a 
global 
partnership 
between 
India 
and 
the 
United 
States 
might 
help 
overcome 
a 
stalemate 
that 
had 
lasted 
too 
long. 
However, 
that 
project 
could 
seriously 
destabilize 
the 
NPT 
as 
it 
would 
implicitly 
recognize 
an 
additional 
nuclear-weapon 
State, 
creating 
a 
precedent 
which 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
accept 
for 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
had 
accepted 
the 
original 
NPT 
compromise 
and 
the 
subsequent 
restrictive 
development 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Furthermore, 
the 
project 
was 
emerging 
just 
as 
action 
was 
being 
taken 
at 
various 
levels 
to 
get 
more 
restrictive 
measures 
adopted 
regarding 
access 
to 
sensitive 
technologies. 
Before 
evaluating 
whether 
the 
initiative 
involved 
greater 
risk 
of 
destabilization 
than 
potential 
for 
cooperation, 
the 
parties 
involved 
should 
provide 
more 
information, 
particularly 
on 
the 
practical 
implications. 
93. 
The 
decision 
to 
site 
ITER 
in 
France 
opened 
up 
a 
new 
period 
of 
research 
and 
development 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
fusion. 
All 
parties 
to 
the 
project 
had 
expressed 
a 
wish 
to 
conclude 
the 
joint 
implementation 
agreement 
and 
begin 
construction 
of 
the 
reactor 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
EuratomÂs 
fusion 
research 
programme, 
Switzerland 
welcomed 
that 
decision. 
It 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
fusion 
activities 
since 
the 
second 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
Conference 
in 
1958. 
His 
Government 
was 
convinced 
that, 
under 
the 
ITER 
project, 
progress 
would 
be 
made 
toward 
demonstrating 
that 
fusion 
energy 
was 
sustainable 
and 
exploitable. 
It 
was 
thus 
giving 
a 
final 
push 
to 
plans 
for 
an 
extraordinary 
contribution 
running 
to 
tens 
of 
millions 
of 
francs 
to 
accelerate 
construction 
of 
ITER. 
94. 
With 
regard 
to 
events 
relating 
to 
Switzerland, 
a 
new 
law 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
on 
1 
February 
2005. 
It 
opened 
up 
the 
possibility 
of 
constructing 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
without 
limiting 
a 
priori 
the 
lifetime 
of 
existing 
plants. 
It 
also 
introduced 
a 
10-year 
moratorium 
on 
new 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
reprocessing 
contracts 
and 
an 
extension 
of 
the 
peopleÂs 
rights 
to 
submit 
to 
an 
optional 
referendum 
the 
authorization 
to 
construct 
new 
nuclear 
installations.

95. 
The 
Swiss 
authorities 
had 
taken 
advantage 
of 
the 
lawÂs 
entry 
into 
force 
to 
ratify 
the 
countryÂs 
additional 
protocol. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
July, 
Switzerland 
had 
submitted 
its 
initial 
declaration 
allowing 
the 
Agency 
to 
reassess 
all 
of 
its 
nuclear 
activities. 
It 
was 
expecting 
a 
speedy 
introduction 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
and 
a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
monitoring 
expenditures. 
It 
had 
decided 
to 
ratify 
the 
additional 
protocol 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
developing 
a 
system 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
which 
would 
avoid 
the 
useless 
and 
counterproductive 
application 
of 
both 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
additional 
protocol 
measures, 
and 
that 
the 
new 
measures 
would 
not 
be 
applied 
in 
a 
mechanical 
and 
systematic 
way. 
96. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
long-lived 
high-and 
intermediate-level 
radioactive 
waste, 
the 
Swiss 
authorities 
were 
assessing 
the 
documentation 
making 
a 
case 
that 
safe 
storage 
was 
feasible 
and 
that 
a 
site 
where 
such 
waste 
could 
be 
stored 
existed. 
A 
decision 
was 
not 
expected 
before 
2006 
and 
broad 
consultation 
of 
affected 
communities 
was 
envisaged 
before 
then. 
International 
collaboration 
on 
a 
multinational 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste 
storage 
project 
had 
not 
been 
abandoned. 
97. 
During 
the 
preceding 
year, 
the 
five 
reactors 
had 
met 
approximately 
40% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
electricity 
needs 
under 
good 
safety 
and 
security 
conditions. 
98. 
Mr. 
AQRAWI 
(Iraq) 
said 
that 
he 
wished 
to 
present 
an 
optimistic 
picture 
of 
Iraq 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
despite 
the 
difficult 
circumstances 
it 
was 
currently 
experiencing. 
His 
country 
needed 
all 
the 
help 
it 
could 
get 
from 
people 
of 
goodwill 
to 
build 
a 
new 
Iraq. 
Many 
years 
had 
been 
lost 
and 
resources 
wasted 
in 
the 
pursuit 
of 
misguided 
scientific 
goals 
under 
the 
former 
regime 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
genuine 
development. 
The 
regime 
had 
also 
spoiled 
IraqÂs 
relations 
with 
other 
countries, 
leaving 
it 
isolated 
and 
unable 
to 
play 
a 
creative 
role 
in 
the 
international 
community. 
99. 
The 
environment 
in 
Iraq 
was 
plagued 
with 
a 
multitude 
of 
problems. 
International 
assistance 
was 
urgently 
needed 
to 
deal 
with 
contamination 
at 
nuclear 
and 
industrial 
sites. 
Such 
assistance 
should 
include 
expertise, 
equipment 
and 
technical 
training, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
eliminating 
contamination 
from 
radiation 
sources 
once 
and 
for 
all, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
Iraqi 
Ministry 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology 
had 
established 
the 
Iraqi 
Radioactive 
Source 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(IRSRA), 
which 
had 
published 
standards 
and 
regulations 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
guidelines 
to 
protect 
the 
health, 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
the 
Iraqi 
people. 
It 
had 
also 
established 
the 
Iraqi 
Non-Proliferation 
Programs 
Foundation 
(INPF) 
to 
retrain 
former 
scientists 
and 
engineers 
involved 
in 
weapons 
programmes 
for 
participation 
in 
peaceful 
civilian 
activities, 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
in 
Iraq 
as 
required 
by 
various 
Security 
Council 
resolutions, 
and 
to 
implement 
programmes 
aimed 
at 
import 
and 
export 
control, 
border 
security 
and 
prevention 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
non-conventional 
material 
and 
equipment, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540. 
The 
Ministry 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology 
bore 
an 
enormous 
burden 
of 
responsibility. 
In 
addition 
to 
decontaminating 
IraqÂs 
destroyed 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
buildings, 
it 
had 
to 
apply 
itself 
to 
the 
task 
of 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
civilian 
purposes 
and 
provide 
advice 
and 
expertise 
in 
order 
to 
solve 
existing 
problems. 
It 
would 
be 
unable 
to 
succeed 
without 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
the 
speedy 
implementation 
of 
technical 
projects 
to 
address 
the 
following 
needs: 
decontamination 
of 
destroyed 
sites; 
selection 
of 
sites 
for 
the 
burial 
of 
radioactive 
waste; 
safe 
transport 
of 
contaminated 
materials; 
equipment 
for 
monitoring 
the 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
sources; 
joint 
research 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
and 
engineering 
resources 
and 
environment; 
training, 
scientific 
visits 
and 
participation 
in 
Agency 
conferences 
and 
symposia. 
100. 
The 
new 
Iraq 
was 
determined 
to 
turn 
over 
a 
new 
leaf 
and 
to 
forge 
solid 
scientific 
relations 
based 
on 
transparency 
with 
all 
countries 
and 
organizations. 
It 
would 
seek 
to 
strengthen 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
world 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
was 
committed 
to 
implementing 
all 
relevant 
international 
treaties, 
particularly 
the 
NPT 
and 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
take 
action 
to 
rid 
all

regions 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
including 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
that 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
would 
support 
that 
aim, 
urging 
parties 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
do 
so 
with 
a 
view 
to 
supporting 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
region. 


101. 
Mr. 
PILLAY 
(Seychelles) 
said 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
ever 
increasing 
role 
to 
play 
in 
reducing 
the 
threats 
posed 
by 
the 
continued 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
in 
supporting 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
culture 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
should 
retain 
its 
vital 
role 
by 
strengthening 
its 
capabilities 
for 
safeguarding 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continued 
work 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
safeguards 
and 
to 
encourage 
the 
adhesion 
of 
non-Member 
States 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
to 
the 
NPT. 
It 
also 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
initiatives 
addressing 
the 
threats 
of 
proliferation 
and 
terrorism 
by 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
radiation 
sources, 
and 
the 
important 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
moving 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
agenda 
forward. 
The 
Government 
of 
the 
Seychelles 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
efforts. 
The 
National 
Assembly 
had 
passed 
an 
Anti-Terrorism 
Act. 
102. 
Since 
becoming 
a 
Member 
State 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
had 
ratified 
three 
important 
bilateral 
agreements: 
its 
safeguards 
agreement, 
the 
SQP 
and 
its 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
The 
Seychelles 
had 
also 
ratified 
a 
number 
of 
relevant 
international 
treaties 
including 
the 
NPT, 
the 
CPPNM, 
the 
CTBT, 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Prohibition 
of 
the 
Emplacement 
of 
Nuclear 
Weapons 
and 
Other 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
on 
the 
Seabed 
and 
the 
Ocean 
Floor 
and 
in 
the 
Subsoil 
Thereof, 
and 
the 
International 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
Against 
Ballistic 
Missile 
Proliferation. 
It 
was 
currently 
reviewing 
ratification 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
103. 
His 
country 
endorsed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regional 
programmes 
on 
strengthening 
of 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
for 
the 
control 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
development 
of 
technical 
capabilities 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
workers 
exposed 
to 
ionizing 
radiation, 
and 
education 
and 
training 
in 
support 
of 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
receiving 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
its 
participation 
in 
those 
programmes. 
104. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
one 
of 
the 
main 
instruments 
for 
transferring 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
Member 
States 
to 
promote 
social 
and 
economic 
development. 
When 
tailored 
to 
recipient 
StatesÂ 
needs 
and 
priorities, 
those 
initiatives 
helped 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
poverty, 
in 
improving 
health 
and 
in 
supporting 
sustainable 
development. 
Such 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
could 
contribute 
to 
addressing 
problems 
such 
as 
the 
management 
of 
drinking 
water 
supplies, 
the 
production 
of 
crops 
with 
an 
improved 
yield 
or 
greater 
salt 
tolerance 
in 
arid 
climates, 
the 
eradication 
of 
disease-bearing 
and 
other 
harmful 
pests 
in 
an 
environmentally 
beneficial 
way, 
and 
the 
effective 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
diseases, 
in 
particular 
radiation 
oncology 
and 
therapy. 
105. 
The 
number 
of 
cancer 
patients 
was 
soaring, 
yet 
the 
resources 
and 
equipment 
to 
diagnose 
and 
treat 
the 
disease 
were 
very 
limited 
or 
even 
lacking 
in 
developing 
countries 
such 
as 
the 
Seychelles. 
Nearly 
13 
% 
of 
all 
deaths 
worldwide 
were 
caused 
by 
cancer 
and 
the 
greatest 
increase 
over 
the 
coming 
decade 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
in 
developing 
countries, 
as 
had 
become 
increasingly 
evident 
in 
his 
country 
which 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
the 
Agency, 
in 
particular 
to 
develop 
much 
needed 
radiotherapy 
facilities 
and 
to 
train 
technicians 
in 
the 
provision 
of 
radiotherapy, 
dosimetry 
and 
monitoring. 
Those 
services 
were 
currently 
unavailable 
in 
the 
country 
and 
offering 
patients 
treatment 
abroad 
added 
to 
costs. 
106. 
He 
thanked 
the 
members 
of 
both 
missions 
sent 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
his 
country 
in 
2005 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
development 
of 
project 
proposals, 
to 
develop 
essential 
dosimetry 
and 
medical 
radiation 
programmes 
and 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
assessment 
of 
radiation

safety 
and 
security 
and 
water 
management 
needs. 
The 
Seychelles 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
cooperation, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
a 
CPF 
which 
it 
hoped 
to 
finalize 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 


107. 
It 
was 
also 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
provided 
to 
enable 
a 
number 
of 
technicians 
to 
receive 
training 
in 
safeguards 
and 
monitoring, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
expanding 
that 
assistance 
as 
it 
put 
in 
place 
the 
appropriate 
safeguard 
mechanisms 
and 
legislative 
framework. 
108. 
Mr. 
CRISTEA 
(Republic 
of 
Moldova) 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Agency 
remaining 
an 
authoritative 
and 
independent 
source 
of 
quality 
information, 
knowledge, 
capacity-building 
and 
expert 
resources 
to 
support 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
technologies 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
allowed 
his 
country, 
which 
was 
relatively 
small 
and 
had 
limited 
capacity, 
to 
access 
new 
innovative 
technologies 
in 
various 
fields, 
which 
it 
would 
not 
have 
been 
able 
to 
accomplish 
on 
its 
own 
even 
over 
several 
decades. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
had 
signed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
at 
the 
end 
of 
1997, 
but 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
begun 
in 
1994 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
UNDP 
project 
aimed 
at 
creating 
a 
national 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
infrastructure. 
Technical 
cooperation 
had 
begun 
in 
mid-1998. 
109. 
In 
his 
country, 
consensus 
between 
the 
ruling 
party 
and 
the 
opposition 
had 
been 
achieved 
in 
parliament 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since 
independence. 
It 
was 
based 
on 
the 
acceptance 
of 
a 
declaration 
on 
subsequent 
integration 
into 
the 
European 
Community 
and 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue 
of 
reintegrating 
the 
country 
exclusively 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
constitution 
in 
force. 
Both 
the 
political 
parties 
and 
the 
public 
were 
aware 
that 
the 
countryÂs 
future 
lay 
solely 
in 
the 
EC. 
Therefore, 
the 
country 
was 
using 
EC 
legislation 
as 
a 
model 
in 
developing 
national 
legislation. 
Membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
adherence 
to 
major 
conventions 
and 
agreements 
were 
regarded 
as 
legitimate 
conditions 
for 
the 
countryÂs 
subsequent 
integration 
into 
the 
European 
and 
world 
communities. 
110. 
The 
structural 
changes 
in 
the 
country 
also 
affected 
regulatory 
bodies 
for 
activities 
involving 
radiation 
sources 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
President 
Voronin 
had 
initiated 
a 
full-scale 
reform 
of 
high-level 
national 
authorities 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
EC 
experts 
on 
reducing 
bureaucracy 
and 
increasing 
the 
accountability 
of 
civil 
servants 
to 
the 
public, 
and 
of 
recommendations 
by 
Agency 
experts 
on 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
regulatory 
bodies. 
In 
introducing 
those 
changes, 
account 
would 
be 
taken 
of 
the 
achievements 
realized 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
help 
in 
creating 
an 
infrastructure 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
source 
safety. 
A 
new 
draft 
law 
on 
safe 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
activities 
involving 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
in 
July 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
expert 
review. 
Suggestions 
for 
its 
improvement 
would 
be 
appreciated. 
111. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
had 
signed 
an 
agreement 
on 
technical 
assistance 
in 
1998 
and 
a 
framework 
programme 
for 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
2005. 
Its 
participation 
in 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
over 
the 
preceding 
seven 
years 
had 
contributed 
to 
improving 
its 
national 
legislative 
and 
standardization 
infrastructure 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
regulation. 
Up-to-date 
experience 
had 
been 
obtained 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
programmes 
on 
radiation 
safety, 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
development 
of 
normative 
documents 
and 
solving 
of 
licensing 
problems, 
and 
on 
the 
development 
of 
training 
programmes 
on 
radiation 
protection, 
radiation 
safety, 
emergency 
response 
and 
inspection 
practices. 
112. 
With 
the 
Agency's 
assistance, 
the 
quality 
of 
diagnostic 
radiology 
and 
radiotherapy 
for 
cancer 
patients 
had 
been 
improved. 
Work 
was 
continuing 
on 
quality 
assurance 
and 
control 
in 
those 
areas, 
and 
efforts 
to 
upgrade 
equipment 
in 
national 
nuclear 
medicine 
centres 
and 
maternal 
and 
child 
health 
centres 
were 
ongoing. 
113. 
The 
country 
had 
mastered 
isotope 
technology 
for 
assessing 
the 
quality 
of 
dams 
to 
prevent 
accidents. 
That 
methodology 
should, 
in 
future, 
allow 
underground 
drinking 
water 
reserves, 
their 
recharge 
sources 
and 
contamination 
to 
be 
assessed. 
The 
country 
was 
working 
on 
transferring 
radiation

technologies 
to 
industry, 
in 
particular 
the 
medical 
industry, 
for 
sterilization 
of 
parapharmaceutical 
products 
and 
cosmetics 
and 
surgical 
instruments. 
The 
same 
technology 
could 
be 
used 
in 
the 
future 
to 
treat 
seeds 
and 
seedlings 
before 
planting. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
United 
States 
Government 
for 
the 
support 
it 
had 
received 
with 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
of 
powerful 
radiation 
sources. 
That 
work 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
source 
storage 
met 
international 
standards. 


114. 
Changes 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
world 
as 
regards 
international 
terrorism 
and 
separatism 
which, 
if 
those 
involved 
were 
to 
obtain 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
or 
weapons, 
could 
alter 
life 
in 
ways 
that 
could 
not 
be 
foreseen. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
initiative 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
at 
the 
60th 
session 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
regarding 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
his 
country 
had 
signed. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
was 
participating 
in 
all 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regional 
projects 
on 
the 
prevention 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material. 
Assistance 
had 
been 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
countries, 
including 
through 
other 
international 
projects 
on 
strengthening 
border 
controls. 
The 
radiation 
safety 
situation 
in 
the 
region 
near 
the 
Dniester 
river, 
where 
there 
had 
been 
radiation 
incidents, 
was 
cause 
for 
concern. 
That 
part 
of 
the 
border 
was 
not 
controlled 
by 
the 
countryÂs 
central 
authorities 
and 
that 
situation 
favoured 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
strategic 
material, 
equipment, 
narcotics, 
etc. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
called 
upon 
the 
international 
community 
to 
support 
his 
countryÂs 
reintegration 
efforts 
and 
thanked 
the 
EC 
for 
its 
readiness 
to 
begin 
monitoring 
the 
Moldovan-Ukrainian 
border 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
That 
step 
should 
help 
resolve 
the 
conflict 
in 
the 
Dniester 
region 
and 
enhance 
safety. 
115. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Strategy 
for 
2006Â2011. 
Its 
own 
priorities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
were 
medicine, 
radiation 
technologies 
in 
industry, 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
agriculture, 
radiation 
safety, 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste, 
and 
emergency 
response. 
It 
felt 
that 
nuclear 
safety, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
scientific 
support 
should 
be 
incorporated 
in 
all 
projects. 
116. 
Mr. 
ERTAY 
(Turkey) 
said 
that 
the 
international 
security 
environment 
had 
changed 
dramatically 
in 
recent 
years: 
non-State 
actors, 
terrorists 
and 
States 
in 
violation 
of 
non-proliferation 
obligations, 
together 
with 
insufficient 
progress 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
posed 
challenges 
to 
the 
delicate 
balance 
struck 
by 
the 
treaties 
system 
over 
the 
preceding 
four 
decades. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
remained 
an 
indispensable 
component 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
the 
success 
of 
which 
depended 
not 
only 
on 
the 
adoption 
of 
treaties 
but 
also 
on 
their 
effective 
implementation. 
Turkey 
therefore 
recognized 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
further 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
supported 
the 
idea 
that 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
should 
be 
adopted 
as 
the 
universal 
norm 
to 
verify 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT. 
117. 
Peaceful 
nuclear 
technology, 
in 
particular 
know-how 
related 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
could 
be 
used 
to 
initiate 
a 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme. 
Diversion 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
material 
to 
covert 
and 
illegal 
weapons 
programmes 
should 
be 
prevented 
by 
all 
legal 
means 
available. 
However, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
parties 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
as 
enshrined 
in 
the 
NPT, 
did 
not 
fall 
victim. 
The 
issue 
needed 
to 
be 
urgently 
addressed 
with 
a 
view 
to 
finding 
acceptable 
ways 
of 
meeting 
both 
objectives. 
Turkey 
took 
note 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
proposals 
for 
multilateral 
controls 
on 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
118. 
His 
country 
was 
concerned 
that 
the 
problem 
over 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
remained 
unresolved. 
Having 
supported 
the 
negotiations 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
three 
European 
countries, 
it 
had 
been 
disappointed 
when 
the 
talks 
had 
been 
suspended. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Board 
resolution 
adopted 
on 
24 
September 
2005 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
dialogue 
and 
an 
early 
settlement 
of 
the 
issue.

119. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
statement 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
early 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
commitments 
they 
had 
made. 
120. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
by 
consensus 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
Those 
amendments 
would 
further 
strengthen 
international 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities, 
thus 
helping 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Their 
adoption 
was 
a 
clear 
demonstration 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
solidarity 
and 
its 
resolve 
to 
address 
new 
threats 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
His 
country 
also 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
Board 
decision 
approving 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
proposal 
to 
extend 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
another 
four 
years. 
121. 
Nuclear 
powerÂs 
share 
of 
world 
electricity 
production 
had 
remained 
stable 
in 
recent 
years, 
yet 
world 
demand 
for 
energy 
was 
constantly 
rising. 
Developing 
countries, 
striving 
to 
raise 
the 
living 
standards 
of 
their 
growing 
populations, 
would 
account 
for 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
the 
increased 
demand. 
With 
fossil 
fuel 
prices 
constantly 
rising 
and 
the 
call 
for 
cleaner 
and 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
becoming 
ever 
stronger, 
nuclear 
power 
stood 
a 
better 
chance 
of 
capturing 
a 
greater 
share 
in 
meeting 
energy 
needs. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Turkey 
welcomed 
the 
findings 
of 
the 
international 
ministerial 
conference 
on 
nuclear 
power 
held 
in 
Paris 
in 
March 
2005. 
122. 
Increased 
energy 
demand 
stimulated 
by 
fast 
economic 
growth 
and 
the 
rising 
level 
of 
welfare 
had 
made 
energy 
supply 
security 
ever 
more 
important 
for 
Turkey. 
Securing 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
supplies 
required 
not 
only 
the 
use 
of 
domestic 
resources 
to 
the 
greatest 
possible 
extent, 
but 
also 
diversification 
of 
imports 
in 
terms 
of 
source 
and 
variety. 
Plans 
were 
already 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage 
to 
make 
nuclear 
power 
a 
major 
component 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
supply 
mix 
in 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
also 
expected 
to 
enhance 
TurkeyÂs 
strategies 
for 
reducing 
environmental 
emissions 
from 
the 
power 
sector. 
A 
long-term 
nuclear 
power 
programme 
had 
been 
developed 
to 
put 
in 
place 
a 
legal, 
institutional, 
industrial 
and 
manpower 
infrastructure, 
to 
foster 
research 
and 
development 
and 
to 
encourage 
private 
sector 
participation 
in 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
projects. 
Those 
measures 
were 
in 
line 
with 
TurkeyÂs 
efforts 
to 
liberalize 
the 
electricity 
market. 
Recognizing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
pivotal 
role 
in 
facilitating 
the 
development 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
peaceful 
use 
undertakings, 
assisting 
States 
to 
maintain 
high 
levels 
of 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
informing 
the 
public 
about 
the 
merits 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
Turkey 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
those 
fields. 
123. 
Safety 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
remained 
a 
priority 
for 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
very 
much 
depended 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
safety 
measures. 
Turkey 
therefore 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
continue 
to 
step 
up 
its 
efforts 
relating 
to 
nuclear, 
radiation, 
transport 
and 
waste 
safety, 
with 
special 
focus 
on 
mandatory 
activities 
and 
technical 
areas, 
and 
on 
regions 
where 
improvement 
was 
most 
needed. 
It 
also 
requested 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
the 
current 
programme 
of 
legislative 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
to 
help 
them 
improve 
their 
national 
infrastructures 
for 
nuclear 
installation, 
radiation, 
transport 
and 
waste 
safety. 
124. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
results 
of 
the 
third 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
including 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
rules 
and 
guidelines 
and 
the 
recommendations 
adopted 
by 
the 
Contracting 
Parties. 
The 
large 
number 
of 
participants 
and 
quality 
of 
the 
national 
reports 
indicated 
the 
interest 
in 
and 
importance 
attached 
to 
achieving 
and 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide. 
125. 
Nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
applications 
addressed 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
basic 
socio-economic 
human 
development 
needs 
of 
Member 
States 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
energy, 
industry, 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
human 
health 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
facilitating 

GC(49)/OR.4

September 
2005, 
Page 
19 


the 
implementation 
of 
effective 
programmes 
in 
all 
those 
areas. 
Turkey 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
continue 
its 
efforts 
which 
contributed 
to 
a 
greater 
understanding 
and 
a 
well-balanced 
picture 
of 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
in 
a 
global, 
sustainable 
development 
perspective. 


126. 
Preserving 
and 
enhancing 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
ensuring 
the 
availability 
of 
qualified 
personnel 
were 
vital 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
all 
nuclear 
technologies 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
the 
future. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
seek 
creative 
methods 
and 
approaches 
in 
education 
and 
training 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
knowledge, 
skills 
and 
abilities 
of 
the 
current 
generation 
of 
experienced 
nuclear 
professionals 
were 
effectively 
transferred 
to 
the 
workforce 
of 
the 
future. 
127. 
His 
country 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
which 
were 
an 
important 
element 
in 
the 
process 
of 
sustainable 
economic 
development. 
There 
was 
a 
continuing 
need 
to 
provide 
adequate 
financing 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
to 
maintain 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
and 
its 
other 
statutory 
functions. 
Since 
technical 
cooperation 
should 
be 
funded 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
shared 
responsibility, 
all 
Members 
should 
strive 
to 
make 
just 
contributions 
to 
financing 
and 
enhancing 
those 
activities. 
Though 
it 
was 
voluntary, 
financial 
support 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
was 
a 
political 
responsibility 
of 
Member 
States. 
Turkey 
was 
working 
to 
increase 
its 
2006 
TCF 
contribution 
above 
its 
assessed 
share. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
activities 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
programmes 
by 
adapting 
them 
to 
meet 
the 
requests 
and 
needs 
of 
Member 
States. 
It 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
together 
with 
all 
parties, 
including 
the 
competent 
agencies 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
system, 
multilateral 
financial 
institutions 
and 
other 
relevant 
intergovernmental 
and 
non-
governmental 
bodies. 
128. 
Mr. 
DAOUAS 
(Tunisia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
closer 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing 
the 
science 
and 
technology 
sector 
and 
supporting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
development. 
Commending 
the 
many 
achievements 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
recent 
years, 
he 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
offer 
it 
unstinting 
support 
so 
as 
to 
enhance 
its 
performance 
still 
further. 
The 
Agency 
had 
funded 
a 
number 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
training 
projects 
in 
Tunisia 
under 
national, 
regional 
and 
international 
programmes. 
He 
trusted 
that 
it 
would 
also 
extend 
full 
support 
to 
his 
countryÂs 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
2007Â2008. 
129. 
TunisiaÂs 
foreign 
policy 
was 
based 
on 
a 
commitment 
to 
dialogue 
and 
interaction. 
It 
worked 
hard 
to 
strengthen 
scientific 
and 
technological 
cooperation 
with 
other 
Arab 
countries 
bilaterally 
and 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Arab 
Maghreb 
Union 
and 
the 
League 
of 
Arab 
States. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
build 
up 
a 
strong 
partnership 
with 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
based 
in 
Tunis 
and 
to 
assist 
it 
in 
implementing 
its 
programmes. 
130. 
Tunisia 
was 
the 
first 
country 
to 
ratify 
the 
AFRA 
agreement. 
It 
hosted 
AFRA 
scientific 
meetings 
and 
training 
courses 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
made 
its 
expertise 
available 
in 
support 
of 
the 
AFRA 
programme 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
South-South 
cooperation. 
He 
urged 
donor 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
support 
AFRA, 
whose 
membership 
included 
30 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
34 
African 
Member 
States. 
His 
country 
had 
hosted 
five 
workshops 
in 
2005 
and 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
18 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
131. 
Tunisia 
had 
paid 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Regular 
Budget 
for 
the 
current 
year 
and 
its 
arrears 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
He 
urged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
so 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
discharge 
its 
mandate 
to 
the 
full. 
His 
country 
also 
requested 
assistance 
in 
honouring 
its 
commitments 
under 
its 
additional 
protocol 
once 
it 
entered 
into 
force. 
132. 
All 
States 
should 
accede 
to 
and 
comply 
with 
international 
instruments 
pertaining 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
take 
action 
against 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material. 
Tunisia 
strongly 

GC(49)/OR.4

supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
area. 
It 
had 
also 
called 
on 
many 
occasions 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
international 
mechanisms 
to 
prevent 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
from 
peaceful 
to 
unlawful 
uses 
and 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
His 
country 
had 
joined 
in 
all 
international 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
consolidating 
the 
safeguards 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Tunisia 
had 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
and 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement. 
It 
was 
also 
involved 
in 
international 
efforts 
to 
counter 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


133. 
His 
country 
was 
concerned 
at 
IsraelÂs 
continued 
refusal 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
supported 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
have 
Israeli 
nuclear 
installations 
placed 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
as 
a 
confidence-building 
measure 
and 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
peace 
process 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
region. 
134. 
The 
President 
of 
Tunisia 
had 
decided 
gradually 
to 
increase 
spending 
on 
scientific 
research, 
technological 
development 
and 
the 
development 
of 
expertise 
from 
1% 
of 
GDP 
in 
2004 
to 
1.25% 
in 
2009. 
His 
countryÂs 
proposal 
in 
1998 
to 
convene 
a 
World 
Summit 
on 
the 
Information 
Society, 
and 
its 
decision 
to 
host 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
that 
Summit 
in 
Tunis 
in 
November 
2005, 
reflected 
its 
commitment 
to 
working 
for 
a 
global 
community 
in 
which 
everyone 
had 
access 
to 
knowledge, 
particularly 
in 
the 
area 
of 
science 
and 
technology, 
thereby 
bridging 
the 
divide 
between 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
North 
and 
South. 
135. 
The 
Agency 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
play 
a 
major 
role 
in 
promoting 
cooperation 
and 
combating 
extremism 
and 
terrorism 
by 
spreading 
knowledge, 
promoting 
the 
transfer 
of 
technology 
and 
training 
specialists 
in 
developing 
countries, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
food 
security, 
water 
resources 
management, 
health 
care 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
136. 
Mr. 
DE 
VISSER 
(Netherlands) 
expressed 
concern 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
outcome 
of 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
It 
was 
also 
unfortunate 
that 
no 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
at 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit 
on 
disarmament 
or 
measures 
to 
counter 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
essential 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
An 
opportunity 
had 
been 
missed 
to 
create 
a 
more 
positive 
climate 
in 
which 
further 
steps 
could 
have 
been 
taken 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty, 
the 
CTBT, 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
multilateral 
nuclear 
approach. 
137. 
In 
the 
preceding 
week, 
his 
countryÂs 
delegation 
to 
the 
CTBT 
Article 
XIV 
Conference 
in 
New 
York 
had 
reiterated 
its 
strong 
commitment 
to 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
that 
Treaty. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
very 
disappointed 
that 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
materialized. 
Those 
States 
that 
had 
ratified 
or 
signed 
the 
Treaty 
should 
do 
their 
utmost 
to 
keep 
it 
alive 
and 
allow 
for 
completion 
of 
the 
international 
verification 
network. 
138. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
international 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
Netherlands 
favoured 
a 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
system 
and 
advocated 
its 
universal 
adoption 
and 
implementation. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
conclude 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols, 
which 
constituted 
the 
verification 
standard. 
The 
Netherlands 
also 
agreed 
to 
the 
modification 
of 
the 
standardized 
text 
of 
the 
SQP 
and 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
address 
that 
issue 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
To 
guarantee 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspection 
regime, 
and 
ensure 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
a 
strong 
policy 
was 
needed 
on 
non-compliance. 
If 
necessary, 
cases 
of 
non-compliance 
should 
be 
referred 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council. 
139. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
expert 
group 
on 
a 
multilateral 
nuclear 
approach 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
begin 
discussions 
on 
them.

140. 
The 
Netherlands 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
Adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
were 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
executing 
those 
activities 
efficiently 
and 
effectively. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
TCF 
on 
time 
in 
accordance 
with 
their 
target 
shares. 
His 
country 
was 
pledging 
its 
full 
target 
share 
for 
2006 
and 
hoped 
that 
other 
Member 
States 
would 
follow 
suit. 
141. 
He 
complimented 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
the 
excellent 
work 
it 
had 
done 
in 
revising 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
cycle 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
it 
would 
soon 
bear 
fruit, 
and 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
TCF 
would 
reach 
a 
level 
considerably 
higher 
than 
in 
the 
preceding 
year. 
142. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
question 
the 
increasing 
practice 
of 
attaching 
conditions 
to 
voluntary 
contributions. 
Unconditionality 
should 
remain 
the 
rule 
and 
under 
no 
circumstances 
should 
conditions 
be 
accepted 
that 
impeded 
the 
AgencyÂs 
integrity 
and 
impartiality. 
Activities 
financed 
from 
the 
TCF 
should 
also 
remain 
demand-driven. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
therefore 
reluctant 
to 
accept 
a 
de 
facto 
ceiling 
for 
financing 
of 
activities 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
That 
was 
both 
detrimental 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
potentially 
damaging 
to 
its 
functioning. 
143. 
The 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
was 
a 
very 
useful 
instrument 
through 
which 
nuclear 
safety 
could 
be 
improved 
worldwide. 
His 
country 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
a 
financing 
mechanism 
via 
which 
NSF 
activities 
were 
financed 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
However, 
it 
accepted 
that 
voluntary 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
remained 
necessary 
for 
the 
time 
being, 
calling 
upon 
all 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
NSF 
unconditionally, 
since 
practice 
in 
the 
current 
year 
had 
shown 
that 
implementation 
had 
been 
hampered 
by 
the 
conditions 
attached 
to 
some 
contributions. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
been 
willing 
to 
donate 
to 
the 
NSF 
generously 
and 
without 
conditions 
in 
the 
past, 
and 
would 
consider 
making 
similar 
contributions 
in 
the 
future. 
144. 
He 
looked 
back 
with 
satisfaction 
at 
the 
successful 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
in 
April. 
Peer 
review 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
main 
goal 
of 
those 
meetings. 
The 
same 
applied 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management, 
with 
respect 
to 
which 
his 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
an 
equally 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
in 
May 
2006. 
145. 
His 
Government 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
at 
the 
CPPNM 
amendment 
conference 
to 
improve 
the 
Convention 
by 
extending 
its 
scope 
to 
cover 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
domestic 
transport, 
storage 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
Conference 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
and 
implementing 
the 
amendment. 
All 
States 
should 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
without 
delay 
to 
ensure 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendment. 
146. 
On 
8 
July 
2003, 
the 
Minister 
for 
Economic 
Affairs 
of 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
submitted 
the 
Energy 
Report 
2005 
to 
parliament. 
The 
report 
focused 
on 
two 
major 
challenges 
the 
Netherlands 
faced 
together 
with 
many 
other 
countries, 
namely 
how 
to 
guarantee 
the 
security 
of 
energy 
supply 
and 
how 
to 
address 
global 
climate 
change. 
It 
suggested 
a 
number 
of 
measures 
for 
dealing 
with 
those 
challenges, 
such 
as 
striving 
for 
an 
energy 
efficiency 
rate 
of 
1.5% 
per 
year, 
establishing 
a 
share 
of 
renewable 
energy 
sources 
of 
10% 
by 
2020 
and 
continuing 
to 
promote 
fuel 
diversification. 
A 
greater 
reliance 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
not 
be 
ruled 
out. 
Investments 
in 
new 
nuclear 
power 
stations 
were 
unlikely, 
but 
the 
Government 
would 
review 
national 
laws 
and 
regulations 
to 
ensure 
that 
there 
was 
clarity 
about 
the 
conditions 
under 
which 
nuclear 
power 
stations 
could 
be 
built 
in 
the 
future. 
Special 
consideration 
would 
be 
given 
to 
the 
question 
of 
responsibility 
for 
and 
financial 
consequences 
of 
waste, 
as 
well 
as 
measures 
needed 
to 
prevent 
terrorist 
attacks 
on 
nuclear 
installations. 
In 
order 
to 
maintain 
and 
promote 
further 
existing 
nuclear 
expertise, 
his 
country 
would 
also 
continue 
to 
support 
nuclear 
energy 
research 
at 
EU 
level.

147. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
already 
decided 
to 
postpone 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Borssele 
until 
the 
end 
of 
2013. 
Recently, 
negotiations 
had 
started 
between 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
Borssele 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
to 
look 
into 
the 
possibility 
of 
yet 
another 
extension 
of 
the 
facilityÂs 
operating 
life, 
in 
exchange 
for 
investments 
by 
the 
owner 
in 
the 
field 
of 
renewable 
energies, 
energy 
conservation 
and 
clean 
fossil 
fuels. 
148. 
The 
Netherlands 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
strengthening 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
and 
advancing 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all, 
and 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General. 
149. 
Mr. 
ELAMIN 
(Sudan) 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contribution 
to 
the 
development 
of 
cooperation 
among 
African 
countries 
through 
the 
Model 
Project 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
enhancement 
of 
capacities 
through 
coordination 
of 
legislation 
and 
human 
resources 
development. 
150. 
He 
urged 
the 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
honour 
their 
obligations 
under 
that 
Treaty 
and 
to 
enhance 
awareness 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
articles 
on 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
His 
country 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
IranÂs 
constructive 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
reassure 
the 
international 
community 
regarding 
the 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
strongly 
supported 
its 
right 
to 
acquire 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Both 
Iran 
and 
the 
EU 
should 
demonstrate 
the 
sincerity 
of 
their 
intentions 
by 
continuing 
to 
engage 
in 
dialogue 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme 
did 
not 
deviate 
from 
its 
peaceful 
course. 
151. 
Sudan 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
necessary 
step 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
and 
the 
prevention 
of 
a 
dangerous 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
fact 
that 
Israel, 
the 
only 
State 
in 
the 
region 
with 
nuclear 
weapons, 
refused 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
was 
a 
major 
threat 
to 
regional 
security. 
Sudan 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
at 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
failure 
to 
respond 
to 
Arab 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
creating 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
152. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
partnerships 
with 
international 
and 
regional 
development 
organizations 
to 
promote 
African 
development, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
trade, 
human 
resources 
development, 
and 
the 
fight 
against 
malaria, 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
and 
AIDS. 
Fighting 
malaria 
was 
a 
priority 
health 
policy 
goal 
in 
Sudan. 
Isotope 
techniques 
had 
been 
used 
successfully 
for 
early 
detection 
of 
disease 
vectors, 
reducing 
the 
incidence 
of 
malaria 
during 
the 
dry 
season 
by 
63.3% 
in 
a 
village 
where 
a 
study 
was 
carried 
out. 
African 
countries 
needed 
additional 
financial 
assistance 
and 
technical 
expertise 
to 
ensure 
coordinated 
and 
effective 
action 
against 
the 
disease. 
If 
the 
AgencyÂs 
experiments 
in 
the 
application 
of 
the 
SIT 
proved 
successful, 
the 
disease 
could 
perhaps 
be 
eradicated 
once 
and 
for 
all. 
153. 
Trypanosomosis 
was 
a 
major 
impediment 
to 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
in 
Africa. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
scientific 
and 
technical 
assistance 
to 
African 
countries 
under 
an 
action 
plan 
aimed 
at 
eradicating 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
was 
therefore 
highly 
appreciated. 
In 
particular, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
sponsorship 
of 
the 
bilateral 
agreement 
on 
tsetse 
fly 
eradication 
between 
Sudan 
and 
Ethiopia. 
With 
the 
advent 
of 
peace 
and 
reconciliation 
in 
southern 
Sudan, 
steps 
would 
be 
taken 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
carry 
out 
studies 
aimed 
at 
eradicating 
the 
pest 
in 
that 
part 
of 
the 
country. 
154. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
partnership 
between 
the 
Agency, 
the 
UNDP 
and 
the 
GEF 
in 
support 
of 
the 
countries 
that 
shared 
the 
strategic 
Nubian 
sandstone 
aquifer, 
i.e. 
Sudan, 
Egypt, 
Chad 
and 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
those 
joint 
efforts 
would 
result 
in 
a 
rationalization 
of 
the 
use 
of 
water 
resources 
in 
the 
Nubian 
basin.

155. 
The 
AFRA 
agreement 
had 
proved 
immensely 
successful 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
particularly 
human 
resource 
development, 
food 
security, 
health, 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Sudan 
strongly 
supported 
AFRAÂs 
plan 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
programmes. 
156. 
The 
Agency 
had 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
regional 
programmes 
and 
the 
collection 
of 
data 
that 
would 
have 
been 
difficult 
to 
access 
without 
its 
assistance. 
Referring 
to 
the 
Asian 
Network 
for 
Education 
in 
Nuclear 
Technology, 
he 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
set 
up 
additional 
education 
and 
training 
networks 
and 
to 
assist 
countries 
with 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management. 
Sudan 
had 
set 
up 
an 
Academy 
of 
Sciences 
specializing, 
inter 
alia, 
in 
nuclear 
science. 
Its 
recently 
developed 
curriculum 
for 
a 
masterÂs 
degree 
in 
medical 
physics 
would 
constitute 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
services. 
There 
were 
also 
courses 
leading 
to 
bachelorÂs, 
masterÂs 
and 
doctoral 
degrees 
in 
nuclear 
science. 
Newly 
qualified 
scientists 
would 
thus 
be 
trained 
to 
take 
the 
place 
of 
those 
who 
retired, 
and 
to 
assist 
in 
planning 
for 
the 
wider 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
development 
programmes. 
157. 
Mr. 
SHANGULA 
(Namibia) 
commended 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
in 
pursuit 
of 
the 
objectives 
articulated 
in 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
1540, 
which 
would 
assist 
Member 
States 
still 
lacking 
capacity 
and 
resources 
to 
respond 
effectively 
to 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
to 
prevent 
such 
material 
from 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
non-State 
actors. 
158. 
The 
Namibian 
Government 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
well-being 
of 
its 
citizens 
and 
that 
commitment 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
Namibia 
Vision 
2030, 
the 
Second 
National 
Development 
Plan 
and 
the 
countryÂs 
CPF. 
Using 
those 
instruments, 
Namibia 
hoped 
to 
achieve 
the 
targets 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals, 
to 
reduce 
poverty, 
to 
provide 
quality 
health 
care 
and 
to 
empower 
the 
Namibian 
people 
economically, 
inter 
alia. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
and 
remained 
a 
reliable 
partner 
in 
those 
endeavours 
through 
technology 
transfer 
relating 
to 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques. 
In 
particular, 
it 
supported 
national 
projects 
on 
human 
resources 
development 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
support 
which 
strengthened 
capacity 
and 
had 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
ongoing 
and 
future 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
159. 
Livestock 
farmers 
in 
northern 
Namibia 
did 
not 
have 
access 
to 
international 
meat 
export 
markets 
owing 
to 
periodic 
occurrences 
of 
animal 
diseases 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
Government 
had 
instituted 
measures 
that 
would 
eventually 
open 
up 
international 
meat 
markets 
to 
those 
farmers. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
diagnostic 
services 
for 
control 
of 
animal 
diseases 
at 
the 
Central 
Veterinary 
Laboratory 
was 
welcome 
and 
appreciated. 
160. 
Food 
self-sufficiency 
was 
critical 
for 
any 
country 
to 
achieve 
meaningful 
socio-economic 
development. 
The 
soil 
in 
northern 
communal 
areas 
was 
of 
low 
quality 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
project 
on 
increasing 
crop 
productivity 
aimed 
to 
improve 
soil 
nutrients 
and 
water 
management 
in 
that 
millet/sorghum-based 
farming 
system. 
161. 
The 
Agency 
was 
collaborating 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Social 
Services 
to 
expand 
nuclear 
medicine 
capability 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear 
medicine 
facility 
at 
Oshakati 
State 
Hospital, 
and 
to 
upgrade 
the 
nuclear 
medicine 
capacity 
at 
Windhoek 
Central 
Hospital. 
A 
highly 
sophisticated 
tele-linked 
system 
was 
planned 
to 
connect 
those 
two 
hospitals 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
services 
and 
convenience 
for 
patients. 
162. 
Namibia 
was 
the 
driest 
country 
in 
Sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
Thus 
it 
was 
logical 
that 
it 
should 
explore 
other 
ways 
of 
supplementing 
water 
resources, 
as 
water 
was 
indispensable 
for 
socio-economic 
development. 
The 
Agency 
had 
provided 
technology 
to 
facilitate 
a 
better 
understanding 
of 
underground 
water 
quality 
and 
the 
recharge 
and 
flow 
mechanisms 
of 
NamibiaÂs 
aquifers. 
Such 
a 
comprehensive 
understanding 
would 
enhance 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
capacity 
to 
manage 
underground 
water 
resources 
and 
to 
provide 
clean 
and 
safe 
water 
for 
human 
consumption. 
He 
took 
note 
with 
satisfaction 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
seawater 
desalination, 
which 
would 
increase 
understanding 
of 
the 
technical 
and

economic 
potential 
of 
using 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
produce 
potable 
water 
from 
seawater. 
Namibia 
would 
study 
the 
viability 
of 
that 
technology 
further. 


163. 
His 
country 
was 
following 
developments 
in 
the 
possible 
use 
of 
the 
SIT 
to 
control 
the 
vectors 
responsible 
for 
malaria 
and 
trypanosomosis, 
and 
it 
was 
eager 
to 
see 
nuclear 
techniques 
applied 
in 
the 
early 
identification 
of 
drug-resistant 
malaria. 
164. 
Regional 
and 
interregional 
projects, 
such 
as 
those 
under 
AFRA, 
made 
an 
immense 
contribution 
and 
Namibia 
continued 
to 
benefit 
from 
them. 
The 
success 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
depended 
on 
the 
availability 
of 
sufficient 
human 
and 
financial 
resources. 
That 
called 
for 
an 
increase 
in 
funding 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
budget. 
The 
TCF 
made 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
sustainable 
development 
in 
developing 
countries 
and 
he 
urged 
the 
donor 
community 
to 
support 
and 
increase 
contributions 
to 
the 
Fund. 
Namibia 
would 
continue 
to 
honour 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006. 
165. 
When 
implementing 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
employing 
nuclear 
energy, 
attention 
had 
to 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management, 
and 
to 
guarding 
against 
any 
detrimental 
effects 
on 
humans 
and 
the 
environment. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
reports 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
supported 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
also 
welcomed 
the 
projects 
aimed 
at 
upgrading 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
in 
Member 
States. 
Those 
projects 
offered 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
to 
address 
Member 
StatesÂ 
common 
needs 
with 
regard 
to 
meeting 
the 
principal 
requirements 
of 
the 
Basic 
Safety 
Standards. 
166. 
In 
addition, 
attention 
should 
also 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material, 
which 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
global 
concern. 
Namibia 
had 
put 
in 
place 
stringent 
measures 
to 
control 
the 
movement 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
material, 
which 
had 
been 
strengthened 
by 
the 
Atomic 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Act 
2005. 
167. 
His 
country 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
honouring 
its 
obligations 
under 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
would 
be 
ratified 
when 
the 
statutory 
requirements 
were 
in 
place. 
A 
national 
system 
for 
nuclear 
material 
accounting 
and 
control 
was 
being 
set 
up. 
168. 
Finally, 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
did 
not 
contribute 
to 
world 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
should 
only 
be 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Those 
States 
that 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons 
should 
submit 
to 
a 
rigorous 
verification 
process, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
NPT. 
169. 
Mr. 
KERIMOV 
(Azerbaijan) 
said 
that 
the 
events 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
over 
the 
preceding 
year 
demonstrated 
fully 
the 
complexities 
of 
the 
process 
of 
ensuring 
nuclear 
security 
and 
reducing 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
around 
the 
world. 
They 
had 
reconfirmed 
the 
need 
to 
create 
a 
legal, 
political 
and 
technological 
basis 
that 
would 
help 
achieve 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
goals. 
Although 
the 
NPT 
was 
an 
essential 
instrument, 
its 
effectiveness 
depended 
on 
the 
willingness 
of 
all 
States 
without 
exception 
to 
cooperate 
constructively 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
in 
strengthening 
the 
nuclear 
security 
regime. 
170. 
Azerbaijan 
was 
taking 
all 
necessary 
measures 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
in 
order 
to 
combat 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
It 
had 
had 
some 
success 
in 
developing 
and 
strengthening 
its 
physical 
protection 
system, 
introducing 
guidelines 
for 
the 
handling 
of 
radioactive 
material 
and 
organizing 
measures 
for 
the 
detection, 
accounting 
and 
storage 
of 
radiation 
sources 
and 
prevention 
of 
illicit 
trafficking. 
171. 
His 
country 
was 
concerned 
that 
Armenia 
occupied 
20% 
of 
its 
territory. 
Azerbaijan 
had 
repeatedly 
called 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
uncontrolled 
territories. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
aggression 
and 
the 
illegal 
occupation 
of 
AzerbaijanÂs 
territory, 
a 
significant

section 
of 
the 
StateÂs 
borders 
with 
Iran 
and 
Armenia 
were 
not 
under 
governmental 
or 
international 
control, 
which 
posed 
a 
serious 
global 
security 
threat. 
Azerbaijan 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
take 
a 
more 
active 
position 
on 
the 
strengthening 
of 
measures 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
technologies. 


172. 
Azerbaijan 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
valued 
the 
results 
achieved 
in 
recent 
years. 
It 
was 
interested 
in 
increasing 
further 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
level 
of 
cooperation. 
173. 
Technical 
cooperation 
between 
Azerbaijan 
and 
the 
Agency 
was 
linked 
in 
many 
ways 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
effective 
and 
reliable 
radiation 
safety 
system. 
Ongoing 
work 
in 
that 
direction 
helped 
strengthen 
the 
national 
infrastructure 
for 
control, 
accounting 
and 
storage 
of 
radioactive 
material. 
Azerbaijan 
was 
interested 
in 
developing 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
mechanism 
further 
in 
the 
field 
of 
protection 
and 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
However 
that 
could 
only 
be 
achieved 
if 
all 
countries 
adhered 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
The 
Agency 
was 
also 
providing 
valuable 
assistance 
under 
regional 
projects 
related 
to 
orphan 
sources 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
radiation 
risk 
early 
warning 
system. 
174. 
Another 
regional 
project 
his 
country 
valued 
was 
the 
one 
on 
sustainable 
energy 
options 
and 
energy 
supply 
security. 
Azerbaijan 
was 
entirely 
dependent 
on 
natural 
oil 
and 
gas 
reserves 
and 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
long-term 
prospects 
was 
highly 
important. 
175. 
Preventing 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
was 
one 
of 
the 
main 
areas 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
between 
Azerbaijan 
and 
the 
Agency. 
The 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
provide 
border 
and 
customs 
control 
points 
with 
up-to-date 
monitoring 
equipment 
and 
to 
train 
the 
staff 
working 
there. 
176. 
He 
noted 
with 
appreciation 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
in 
modernizing 
the 
National 
Oncology 
Centre 
and 
providing 
essential 
therapeutic 
equipment. 
177. 
Clearly, 
one 
major 
factor 
in 
ensuring 
nuclear 
safety 
was 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
the 
preservation 
and 
enhancement 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
which 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
development 
of 
safe 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
the 
further 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
projects 
aimed 
at 
preserving 
and 
enhancing 
intellectual 
potential 
and 
improving 
nuclear 
education 
in 
its 
Member 
States. 
It 
was 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
such 
projects, 
as 
shown 
by 
its 
successful 
work 
with 
INIS. 
178. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
regulatory 
bodies 
for 
the 
safe 
management 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
was 
dependent 
on 
the 
training 
and 
constant 
retraining 
of 
appropriate 
specialists. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Azerbaijan 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
develop 
a 
strategic 
approach 
to 
education 
and 
training 
in 
radiation 
and 
waste 
safety. 
However 
the 
education 
and 
training 
courses 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
needed 
to 
be 
more 
practical 
in 
emphasis. 
179. 
Azerbaijan 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
technical 
cooperation 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
projects. 
Since 
joining 
the 
Agency, 
it 
had 
fulfilled 
all 
its 
commitments, 
including 
the 
financial 
commitments 
upon 
which 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
depended. 
It 
was 
committed 
to 
paying 
its 
TCF 
contributions 
in 
the 
future 
and 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
provide 
the 
necessary 
financial 
resources 
for 
the 
Fund. 
180. 
Mr. 
BRAUN 
(Luxembourg) 
said 
that 
the 
role 
given 
to 
the 
Agency 
by 
the 
NPT, 
which 
rested 
on 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
development 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
was 
of 
major 
importance 
and 
should 
be 
further 
developed. 
It 
was 
in 
that 
spirit 
that, 
at 

GC(49)/OR.4 
27

26 


the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
the 
EU, 
under 
the 
presidency 
of 
Luxembourg, 
had 
suggested 
that 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
meeting 
in 
2007 
could 
be 
held 
in 
Vienna. 


181. 
On 
25 
April 
2005, 
the 
EU 
Ministers 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs 
had 
adopted 
a 
common 
position 
on 
balanced 
and 
concrete 
proposals 
to 
strengthen 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
Regrettably, 
the 
Conference 
had 
not 
been 
successful, 
despite 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
a 
large 
number 
of 
State 
Parties 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus 
on 
fundamental 
matters 
of 
substance. 
182. 
An 
efficient 
safeguards 
system 
had 
existed 
since 
1997 
combining 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
In 
the 
past, 
some 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
managed 
to 
develop 
clandestine 
weapons 
programmes 
that 
had 
not 
been 
detectable 
by 
inspections 
under 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
alone. 
Only 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
could 
the 
Agency 
provide 
credible 
assurances 
that 
no 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
being 
carried 
out. 
183. 
Eight 
years 
after 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol, 
despite 
the 
agreement 
reached 
at 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
appeals 
made 
at 
Agency 
General 
Conferences, 
123 
State 
Parties 
had 
still 
not 
implemented 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
184. 
The 
universal 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols 
would 
strengthen 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament 
regime 
and 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
security 
of 
all 
States. 
A 
credible 
safeguards 
regime 
would 
promote 
the 
mutual 
trust 
crucial 
to 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Luxembourg 
supported 
the 
relevant 
recommendations 
made 
in 
the 
report 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
High-Level 
Panel 
on 
Threats, 
Challenges 
and 
Change. 
The 
Board 
should 
recognize 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
as 
the 
current 
Agency 
safeguards 
standard. 
Luxembourg 
hoped 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
accept 
a 
recommendation 
and 
adopt 
a 
draft 
resolution 
on 
that 
issue. 
In 
that 
connection, 
the 
Government 
of 
Luxembourg 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
EU 
had 
decided 
to 
take 
concerted 
action 
to 
promote 
the 
universal 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols. 
185. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
37 
States 
Party 
to 
the 
NPT 
still 
had 
no 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Agency 
could 
not 
provide 
assurances 
for 
such 
States. 
He 
called 
on 
those 
States 
to 
act 
promptly 
to 
remedy 
that 
situation. 
186. 
Finally, 
Luxembourg, 
along 
with 
other 
members 
of 
the 
EU, 
fully 
supported 
the 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
to 
ensure 
that 
safeguards 
inspections 
in 
the 
25 
countries 
of 
the 
EU 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
exemplary 
efficiency 
and 
credibility. 
The 
meeting 
rose 
at 
7.05 
p.m.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(continued) 
(GC(49)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
STRITAR 
(Slovenia) 
said 
that 
the 
existence 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
represented 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
threats 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
and 
all 
States 
should 
play 
an 
active 
role 
against 
their 
further 
spread. 
Nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
could 
not 
be 
considered 
separately 
and 
all 
efforts 
should 
be 
put 
into 
pursuing 
the 
primary 
goal, 
which 
was 
to 
reduce 
the 
nuclear 
threat. 
2. 
Despite 
high 
expectations, 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
produce 
a 
consensus 
document. 
He 
shared 
the 
view 
that 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
to 
be 
held 
in 
May 
2007 
should 
take 
place 
in 
Vienna. 
That 
would 
coincide 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
celebrations 
and 
would 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
universal 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
embodied 
in 
the 
NPT. 
3. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
should 
not 
be 
the 
only 
means 
of 
nuclear 
material 
control. 
A 
thorough 
analysis 
should 
be 
undertaken 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
the 
safeguards 
system 
met 
current 
needs, 
and, 
in 
particular, 
how 
it 
could 
be 
improved. 
With 
more 
countries 
demanding 
to 
have 
access 
to 
the 
complete 
fuel 
cycle, 
including 
enrichment, 
the 
task 
of 
safeguarding 
nuclear 
material 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
complex. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
was 
a 
crucial 
instrument 
for 
strengthening 
non-proliferation, 
and 
should 
become 
the 
universal 
verification 
standard 
for 
all 
countries 
wishing 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
adherence 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
transparency 
of 
their 
nuclear 
programmes, 
and 
to 
assure 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
4. 
Recent 
events 
had 
illustrated 
that 
nuclear 
terrorism 
should 
be 
considered 
as 
a 
global 
threat. 
Slovenia 
had 
already 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
called 
on 
all 
other 
States 
to 
do 
likewise. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006-2009, 
which 
Slovenia 
supported, 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
reducing 
the 
risk 
of 
a 
successful 
act 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Although 
it 
deserved 
the 
highest 
priority, 
its 
implementation 
was 
dependent 
on 
voluntary 
contributions. 
Slovenia 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
consider 
contributing 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
5. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
non-proliferation, 
there 
were 
regional 
organizations 
whose 
role 
was 
complementary 
to 
that 
of 
the 
Agency. 
In 
that 
regard, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
OSCE, 
which 
was 
currently 
under 
SloveniaÂs 
chairmanship 
and 
was 
promoting 
among 
its 
members 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
6. 
Slovenia 
had 
supported 
the 
call 
for 
a 
diplomatic 
conference 
to 
consider 
proposed 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
had 
actively 
participated 
at 
an 
expert 
level 
in 
the 
preparatory 
work. 
Internal 
legal 
procedures 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
had 
already 
been 
initiated. 
7. 
Slovenia 
remained 
interested 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
and 
five 
of 
its 
institutions 
had 
expressed 
their 
intention 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
cycle. 
The 
CPF 
had 
recently 
been 
updated 
to 
provide 
guidelines 
that 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
identifying 
suitable 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
It 
had 
provided 
a 
fresh 
and 
new 
perspective 
on 
Slovenia's 
participation 
in 
the 
programme, 
and 
all 
potential 
participants 
were 
aware 
of 
the 
shift 
from 
a 
technology-driven 
to 
a 
demand-driven 
programme.

8. 
The 
TCF 
should 
be 
sufficient 
and 
predictable 
to 
ensure 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Slovenia, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006, 
and 
was 
concerned 
about 
those 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
paid 
their 
shares 
in 
full 
or 
at 
all. 
All 
Member 
States 
should 
be 
aware 
of 
their 
responsibility 
for 
financing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
The 
NPCs 
introduced 
in 
2005, 
and 
their 
advance 
payment, 
could 
be 
understood 
as 
recipient 
country 
commitment 
and 
shared 
responsibility, 
but 
should 
not 
be 
an 
instrument 
for 
ensuring 
the 
financial 
stability 
of 
the 
TCF. 
9. 
The 
4% 
decrease 
in 
the 
implementation 
rate 
from 
2003 
to 
2004 
was 
a 
concern; 
that 
trend 
should 
be 
reversed 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
as 
it 
could 
jeopardize 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
as 
a 
whole. 
10. 
Slovenia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
international 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
emergency 
preparedness, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
new 
programme 
on 
incident 
and 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response, 
which 
was 
expected 
to 
contribute 
substantially 
to 
the 
unified 
response 
system 
for 
incidents 
and 
emergencies 
involving 
nuclear 
facilities 
or 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
11. 
Slovenia 
had 
been 
active 
through 
its 
experts 
in 
conceiving 
the 
International 
Action 
Plan 
for 
Strengthening 
the 
International 
Preparedness 
and 
Response 
System 
for 
Nuclear 
and 
Radiological 
Emergencies, 
and 
had 
acted 
as 
a 
coordinating 
body 
between 
the 
two 
meetings 
of 
national 
competent 
authorities 
for 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
Assistance 
Convention. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
Member 
States 
decide 
to 
join 
the 
AgencyÂs 
emergency 
response 
network 
ERNET, 
and 
that 
the 
current 
mechanisms 
for 
reporting 
and 
sharing 
information 
about 
incidents 
and 
emergencies 
were 
thoroughly 
investigated 
and 
optimized. 
12. 
Slovenia 
was 
expecting 
to 
host 
a 
follow-up 
OSART 
mission 
in 
November 
2005. 
The 
three 
OSART 
missions 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
Slovenia 
in 
the 
twenty-year 
period 
since 
the 
start-up 
of 
the 
KrÂko 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
not 
only 
provided 
an 
insight 
into 
the 
evolution 
of 
working 
practices 
and 
equipment 
status 
at 
that 
plant, 
but 
had 
also 
shown 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
OSART 
process. 
Slovenia 
sincerely 
hoped 
that 
all 
three 
OSART 
reports, 
which 
had 
been 
made 
public, 
had 
also 
been 
of 
benefit 
to 
those 
in 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
who 
were 
willing 
to 
learn 
from 
the 
experiences 
of 
others. 
13. 
The 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
had 
been 
extremely 
positive 
for 
Slovenia; 
the 
review 
process 
had 
matured 
and 
the 
reporting 
procedures 
for 
the 
national 
report 
and 
for 
the 
rapporteurs 
had 
been 
established 
in 
advance 
of 
the 
meeting. 
Increased 
transparency 
for 
the 
next 
review 
meeting 
would 
be 
achieved 
if 
the 
open-ended 
working 
group 
were 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus 
to 
relax 
access 
to 
country 
group 
sessions 
and 
to 
have 
working 
documents 
more 
widely 
available 
to 
Contracting 
Parties 
during 
the 
review 
meeting. 
There 
was 
a 
danger 
that 
the 
review 
process 
for 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Convention 
might 
cover 
issues 
already 
discussed, 
and 
it 
should 
therefore 
remain 
open 
to 
new 
ideas 
and 
topics 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
momentum. 
Observations 
of 
particular 
interest 
were 
continuing 
economic 
deregulation 
of 
energy 
markets, 
which 
brought 
significant 
changes 
in 
ownership 
and 
operating 
arrangements; 
and 
challenges 
to 
be 
faced 
because 
of 
the 
retirement 
of 
experienced 
staff 
and 
the 
ageing 
of 
equipment. 
Knowledge 
preservation 
was 
a 
key 
factor 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
reliable 
future 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
particularly 
as 
almost 
65% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
operating 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
were 
over 
twenty 
years 
old. 
14. 
Slovenia 
had 
prepared 
its 
second 
national 
report 
under 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
The 
Slovenian 
initiative 
on 
a 
regional 
repository 
for 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste, 
which 
had 
been 
presented 
and 
discussed 
during 
the 
first 
review 
meeting, 
was 
still 
on 
the 
table 
as 
the 
most 
economically 
viable 
option 
for 
countries 
with 
small 
nuclear 
programmes. 
The 
regional 
repository 
was 
a 
technically 
demanding 
project 
which 
required 
widespread 
public 
and 
political 
acceptance, 
and 
also 
raised 
questions 
with 

GC(49)/OR.5

regard 
to 
physical 
protection, 
nuclear 
security 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
materials. 
Slovenia 
hoped 
that 
interested 
parties 
would 
keep 
the 
initiative 
alive 
and 
proceed 
with 
an 
action 
plan 
that 
would 
address 
all 
the 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
the 
project 
in 
order 
to 
produce 
a 
feasibility 
study. 


15. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
selection 
of 
a 
site 
in 
Slovenia 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
low-and 
intermediate-level 
radioactive 
waste, 
he 
said 
that 
following 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
detailed 
plan 
of 
national 
importance 
for 
the 
repository 
preparation 
in 
November 
2004, 
the 
Agency 
for 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
had 
invited 
local 
communities 
to 
offer 
their 
territory, 
at 
first 
for 
terrain 
exploration 
and 
later 
for 
a 
repository. 
Offers 
from 
interested 
communities 
had 
been 
received 
and 
were 
being 
evaluated. 
The 
adoption 
of 
the 
decree 
concerning 
measures 
for 
determining 
the 
amount 
of 
indemnities 
for 
limited 
land 
use 
because 
of 
a 
nuclear 
facility 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance. 
16. 
In 
conclusion, 
the 
resolution 
on 
the 
national 
energy 
programme, 
which 
set 
out 
the 
policy 
for 
the 
long-term 
production 
of 
electric 
energy 
in 
the 
KrÂko 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
considered 
nuclear 
energy 
a 
viable 
option 
in 
the 
context 
of 
environmental 
impact, 
diversification 
of 
energy 
resources, 
reliability 
of 
supply 
and 
economical 
use 
of 
energy. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
continuous 
implementation 
of 
measures 
for 
assuring 
nuclear 
safety, 
independent 
surveillance 
of 
operations 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
adequate 
public 
information. 
17. 
Mr. 
VEJONIS 
(Latvia) 
said 
that 
two 
most 
important 
developments 
that 
had 
occurred 
the 
previous 
year 
in 
the 
field 
of 
security 
were 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
Latvia, 
as 
a 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
Conference 
to 
Consider 
and 
Adopt 
Proposed 
Amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
had 
already 
signed 
the 
new 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
18. 
There 
had 
been 
a 
large-scale 
discussion 
over 
the 
preceding 
months 
of 
possibilities 
for 
international 
organizations 
to 
adapt 
to 
the 
new 
situation 
in 
international 
affairs 
and 
to 
meet 
new 
security 
challenges. 
The 
topic 
had 
been 
addressed 
during 
the 
60th 
session 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly. 
As 
the 
Latvian 
President 
had 
pointed 
out 
in 
her 
speech, 
rapid 
progress 
needed 
to 
be 
achieved 
on 
concluding 
a 
comprehensive 
convention 
on 
international 
terrorism. 
It 
was 
very 
important 
that 
all 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly 
were 
aware 
of 
the 
necessity 
of 
reforms 
in 
order 
to 
increase 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
to 
meet 
new 
security 
challenges. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
final 
resolution 
had 
not 
included 
all 
the 
recommendations 
initially 
drafted. 
However, 
the 
willingness 
to 
improve 
performance 
was 
a 
signal 
for 
future 
reforms. 
The 
Agency, 
by 
improving 
its 
capabilities 
to 
meet 
new 
challenges, 
was 
well 
in 
pace 
within 
the 
reform 
process 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
system. 
19. 
It 
was 
also 
important 
that 
the 
Agency 
continued 
to 
preserve 
its 
credibility 
and 
remained 
neutral 
on 
politically 
sensitive 
issues. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
his 
efforts 
to 
respond 
in 
a 
balanced 
and 
measured 
way 
to 
the 
demands 
placed 
upon 
him. 
20. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
the 
previous 
year. 
The 
growing 
number 
of 
projects 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
TCF 
proved 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
on 
the 
right 
track 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ensuring 
the 
availability 
of 
human 
and 
financial 
resources 
to 
help 
countries 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
was 
proud 
that 
Latvia 
was 
moving 
towards 
increasing 
its 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
and 
away 
from 
being 
purely 
a 
recipient 
country. 
As 
he 
had 
previously 
predicted, 
its 
contributions 
could 
gradually 
exceed 
direct 
support 
received 
from 
the 
Agency. 
Latvia 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
countriesÂ 
arrears 
had 
lessened 
during 
the 
past 
year, 
and 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time 
for 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Latvia 
had 
already 
used 
the 
new 
simplified 
procedure 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
when 
submitting 
new 
national 
projects 
and 
had 
found 
it 
to 
be 
a 
rational 
and 
comprehensive 
approach.

21. 
Knowledge 
management 
was 
an 
important 
issue, 
and 
his 
Government 
had 
planned 
to 
implement 
several 
activities 
to 
ensure 
the 
international 
transfer 
of 
knowledge 
between 
generations. 
22. 
The 
biggest 
national 
cooperation 
project 
for 
Latvia 
was 
closely 
related 
to 
human 
health 
care 
and 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
for 
diagnostics 
and 
treatment. 
The 
multi-purpose 
cyclotron 
centre 
would 
serve 
for 
medical 
purposes 
and 
open 
possibilities 
for 
participation 
in 
scientific 
research 
projects, 
ensuring 
new 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
for 
scientists 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
international 
activities. 
Implementation, 
which 
was 
already 
underway, 
was 
a 
challenging 
task 
for 
Latvia 
due 
to 
the 
scale 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
cyclotron 
facility 
demanded 
considerable 
human 
and 
financial 
resources, 
and 
his 
Government 
had 
therefore 
included 
the 
project 
in 
the 
priority 
list 
of 
activities 
to 
be 
implemented. 
Without 
the 
AgencyÂs 
expertise 
and 
shared 
experience, 
which 
his 
country 
appreciated, 
Latvia 
would 
be 
unlikely 
to 
reach 
the 
goal 
it 
had 
set. 
23. 
Latvia 
regarded 
a 
universal 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
supported 
by 
a 
strong 
system 
of 
safeguards, 
as 
essential 
for 
collective 
security. 
The 
importance 
of 
the 
NPT 
lay 
in 
three 
pillars: 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
was 
therefore 
regrettable 
that 
several 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
still 
had 
to 
fulfil 
their 
basic 
obligation 
of 
ratifying 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Latvia 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
fulfil 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
as 
those 
two 
instruments 
constituted 
the 
modern 
verification 
standard. 
24. 
The 
situation 
with 
respect 
to 
other 
international 
instruments 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
and 
development 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
needed 
to 
be 
improved. 
Only 
a 
few 
dozen 
countries 
participated 
in 
regimes 
for 
the 
import, 
export 
and 
transit 
control 
of 
dual-use 
nuclear 
items. 
25. 
Latvia 
was 
implementing 
the 
decision 
made 
several 
years 
previously 
on 
decommissioning 
its 
only 
research 
reactor 
at 
Salaspils. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
of 
all 
parties 
involved 
in 
the 
removal 
of 
fresh 
fuel 
from 
the 
reactor 
premises 
and 
its 
transport 
to 
the 
country 
of 
origin, 
which 
had 
occurred 
in 
May. 
His 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
return 
of 
spent 
fuel. 
26. 
Latvia 
was 
facing 
the 
difficult 
task 
of 
extending 
the 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal 
site 
at 
Baldone. 
It 
had 
received 
a 
positive 
conclusion 
from 
environmental 
impact 
analysts, 
yet 
was 
facing 
resistance 
from 
the 
municipality 
and 
local 
community. 
Cooperation 
and 
dialogue 
between 
the 
central 
government 
and 
municipalities 
was 
essential 
to 
reach 
mutual 
understanding. 
His 
Government 
considered 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
to 
be 
highly 
important 
and 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
bring 
the 
issue 
to 
a 
close. 
27. 
Mr. 
PRAH 
(Croatia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
non-proliferation 
efforts, 
and 
had 
recently 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
It 
had 
been 
extremely 
pleased 
with 
the 
acceptance 
of 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
which 
all 
countries 
should 
ratify, 
accept 
or 
approve. 
Croatia, 
however, 
regretted 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
not 
been 
successful 
in 
reaching 
common 
conclusions 
enabling 
a 
consensus 
document 
to 
be 
adopted. 
28. 
It 
was 
the 
obligation 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
give 
the 
necessary 
support 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
implementing 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
Croatia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
countries 
where 
an 
additional 
protocol 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
and 
been 
implemented, 
and 
called 
upon 
those 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
or 
ratified 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
to 
do 
so. 
Accepting 
the 
view 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
that 
SQPs, 
as 
they 
stood, 
represented 
a 
weakness 
in 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
Croatia 
welcomed 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision 
for 
changes 
in 
the 
Protocol, 
while 
keeping 
it 
as 
a 
part 
of 
the 
system.

29. 
Croatia 
had 
already 
completed 
the 
internal 
legal 
procedure 
for 
acceptance 
of 
the 
amendment 
of 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
and 
invited 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accelerate 
their 
internal 
procedures 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
its 
early 
entry 
into 
force. 
His 
country 
had 
also 
established 
its 
own 
independent 
regulatory 
body 
for 
nuclear 
safety, 
and 
had 
recently 
become 
a 
member 
of 
the 
NSG. 
30. 
Croatia 
attached 
equal 
importance 
to 
all 
other 
non-safeguards 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Its 
close 
and 
successful 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
reflected 
in 
particular 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
played 
an 
extremely 
important 
role 
in 
facilitating 
the 
transfer 
and 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
practice. 
Five 
project 
proposals 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
project 
cycle 
had 
been 
prepared 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
priorities 
set 
out 
in 
the 
CPF. 
Croatia 
gave 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
regional 
cooperation 
and 
exchange 
of 
knowledge 
through 
regional 
projects. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
large 
and 
growing 
number 
of 
foreign 
experts 
under 
Agency 
fellowships 
in 
Croatian 
research 
institutions, 
and 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
use 
Croatian 
capacities 
to 
a 
larger 
extent. 
31. 
Although 
it 
was 
a 
net 
recipient 
country, 
Croatia 
was 
continuously 
fulfilling 
its 
financial 
obligations, 
having 
paid 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
and 
fulfilled 
its 
NPC 
obligations 
in 
advance. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
cost-sharing 
in 
order 
to 
confirm 
its 
full 
commitment 
to 
ongoing 
cooperation 
and 
to 
facilitate 
implementation 
of 
the 
approved 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
32. 
Mr. 
KAKODKAR 
(India) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
an 
important 
and 
inevitable 
option 
for 
his 
country, 
which 
was 
pursuing 
a 
self-reliant 
indigenous 
programme 
using 
its 
own 
vast 
thorium 
resources. 
While 
the 
energy 
potential 
available 
from 
those 
resources 
was 
immense, 
India 
remained 
committed 
to 
the 
three-stage 
programme 
consisting 
of 
PHWRs 
in 
the 
first 
stage, 
FBRs 
in 
the 
second, 
and 
thorium 
reactors 
in 
the 
third. 
Nuclear 
energy 
had 
to 
play 
an 
increasing 
role 
in 
IndiaÂs 
electricity 
generation 
plans, 
and 
there 
was 
an 
urgent 
need 
for 
India 
to 
enhance 
its 
nuclear 
power 
production 
rapidly. 
Its 
desire 
was 
to 
attain 
energy 
security 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
leapfrog 
stages 
of 
economic 
development 
at 
the 
least 
possible 
cost. 
For 
that 
purpose, 
it 
would 
be 
very 
useful 
if 
India 
could 
gain 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
as 
well 
as 
nuclear 
reactors 
from 
the 
international 
market, 
but 
at 
present 
that 
was 
not 
possible 
because 
of 
the 
nuclear 
technology 
restrictive 
regimes 
in 
operation. 
33. 
IndiaÂs 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
stated 
in 
October 
2004 
that 
India 
was 
a 
responsible 
nuclear 
power, 
determined 
to 
utilize 
its 
indigenous 
resources 
and 
capabilities 
to 
fulfil 
its 
national 
interests 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
was 
not 
contrary 
to 
the 
larger 
goals 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
He 
had 
said 
that 
India 
would 
not 
be 
the 
source 
of 
proliferation 
of 
sensitive 
technologies 
and 
would 
ensure 
that 
those 
it 
already 
possessed 
were 
safeguarded. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
remain 
faithful 
to 
that 
approach 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
well-known 
glaring 
examples 
of 
proliferation 
that 
had 
directly 
affected 
IndiaÂs 
security 
interests. 
The 
limitations 
of 
the 
present 
non-proliferation 
regime 
should 
not 
be 
further 
accentuated 
by 
artificial 
restrictions 
on 
genuine 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications. 
The 
denial 
of 
technology 
and 
the 
closure 
of 
avenues 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
such 
an 
important 
field 
were 
tantamount 
to 
the 
denial 
of 
developmental 
benefits 
to 
millions 
of 
people 
whose 
lives 
could 
be 
transformed 
by 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
relevant 
technologies. 
34. 
The 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
called 
upon 
other 
advanced 
nuclear 
powers, 
and 
all 
who 
had 
a 
stake 
in 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
constructive 
dialogue 
to 
develop 
more 
effective 
measures 
that 
would 
stem 
the 
tide 
of 
proliferation 
without 
unduly 
constraining 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
had 
said 
that 
constraining 
those 
who 
were 
responsible 
amounted 
in 
effect 
to 
rewarding 
those 
who 
were 
irresponsible, 
and 
the 
international 
community 
must 
face 
up 
to 
the 
implications 
of 
that 
choice. 
India 
was 
willing 
to 
shoulder 
its 
share 
of 
international 
obligations 
provided 
that 
its 
legitimate 
interests 
were 
met. 
It 
had 
actively 
embraced 
globalization, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
reason 
why 
nuclear 
energy 
production 
should 
be 
an 
exception.

Noting 
the 
statements 
made 
by 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
France, 
and 
the 
positive 
and 
cooperative 
approach 
of 
a 
number 
of 
key 
countries, 
he 
said 
that 
India 
was 
now 
feeling 
the 
winds 
of 
change, 
and 
hoped 
that 
all 
the 
restrictions 
it 
faced 
would 
soon 
be 
lifted. 
Predicated 
on 
its 
obtaining 
the 
same 
benefits 
and 
advantages 
as 
other 
nuclear 
Powers, 
India 
would 
be 
prepared 
to 
take 
reciprocal 
steps 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
full 
civilian 
nuclear 
energy 
cooperation 
with 
international 
partners, 
including 
safeguards 
on 
facilities 
of 
a 
civilian 
nature, 
selected 
by 
India 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis, 
with 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
Agency. 
36. 
India 
wanted 
to 
see 
a 
rapid 
increase 
in 
its 
nuclear 
power 
generating 
capacity 
well 
beyond 
the 
planned 
20 
000 
MW(e) 
by 
2020. 
That 
capacity 
could 
consist 
of 
imported 
LWRs 
running 
on 
imported 
fuel, 
domestic 
PHWRs 
running 
on 
domestic 
fuel 
and 
FBRs. 
Progressively, 
reactors 
running 
on 
thorium 
would 
be 
added 
to 
the 
list. 
37. 
India 
had 
embarked 
on 
the 
development 
of 
the 
FBR-based 
second 
stage 
of 
its 
programme 
with 
the 
start 
of 
construction 
in 
October 
2004 
of 
the 
500 
MW(e) 
prototype 
FBR. 
The 
first 
540 
MW(e) 
PHWR 
unit 
at 
Tarapur 
had 
begun 
commercial 
operations 
some 
seven 
months 
ahead 
of 
schedule 
and 
the 
first 
unit 
of 
the 
Kakrapar 
Atomic 
Power 
Station 
had 
been 
operating 
continuously 
for 
more 
than 
a 
year. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
achievements 
during 
2005 
had 
been 
the 
closing 
of 
the 
fuel 
cycle 
of 
the 
fast 
breeder 
test 
reactor, 
and 
the 
successful 
reprocessing 
of 
its 
plutonium-rich 
carbide 
fuel. 
The 
construction 
of 
five 
PHWRs 
was 
on 
schedule, 
along 
with 
two 
1000 
MW(e) 
WWERs 
that 
were 
under 
construction 
at 
Kudankulam 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Russian 
Federation. 
Sites 
for 
new 
nuclear 
power 
units 
were 
being 
developed, 
and 
work 
had 
begun 
to 
identify 
additional 
sites. 
38. 
The 
challenge 
before 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
particular, 
was 
to 
channel 
the 
enormous 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
world 
peace 
and 
prosperity 
while 
preventing 
its 
destructive 
use 
by 
irresponsible 
State 
and 
non-State 
actors. 
Addressing 
that 
challenge 
successfully 
would 
change 
that 
perception 
of 
the 
Agency 
from 
just 
a 
Ânuclear 
watchdogÂ 
to 
a 
Ânuclear 
kamadhenuÂ, 
the 
Indian 
mythological 
cow 
symbolizing 
an 
inexhaustible 
provider 
of 
sustenance 
for 
the 
welfare 
of 
humanity. 
39. 
Mr. 
RAMZY 
(Egypt) 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
enhance 
support 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
which 
had 
suffered 
setbacks 
at 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
the 
Millennium 
Review 
Summit, 
the 
recent 
meeting 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
at 
which 
the 
consensus 
approach 
had 
been 
undermined 
by 
selectivity 
and 
double 
standards, 
and 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
nuclear 
States 
to 
honour 
the 
commitments 
they 
had 
entered 
into 
at 
the 
previous 
Review 
Conference. 
Responsibility 
for 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
should 
not 
be 
laid 
at 
the 
door 
of 
a 
single 
group 
of 
countries. 
The 
extent 
of 
a 
countryÂs 
responsibility 
depended, 
in 
particular, 
on 
its 
technical, 
scientific 
and 
financial 
resources. 
The 
developed 
countries, 
especially 
the 
nuclear 
States, 
therefore 
had 
a 
greater 
burden 
of 
responsibility 
to 
bear. 
Moreover, 
the 
Agency 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
provide 
Member 
States 
with 
technical 
and 
financial 
support 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
the 
development 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
so 
that 
it 
could 
reassure 
the 
international 
community 
that 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
not 
being 
diverted 
to 
military 
programmes. 
The 
developing 
countries 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
to 
state 
their 
needs 
in 
that 
regard. 
40. 
Egypt 
approved 
the 
AgencyÂs 
strategy 
of 
focusing 
on 
projects 
under 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
that 
yielded 
tangible 
economic 
benefits 
and 
of 
consulting 
Member 
States 
at 
an 
early 
stage 
on 
the 
details 
of 
proposed 
projects. 
His 
country 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
plans 
to 
use 
its 
second 
nuclear 
research 
reactor 
for 
the 
production 
of 
radioisotopes 
for 
medical, 
agricultural 
and 
industrial 
purposes; 
for 
operation 
of 
the 
cyclotron, 
which 
would 
be 
used, 
inter 
alia, 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
medicine; 
for 
pest 
control, 
yield 
enhancement, 
arid 
zone, 
groundwater 
and 
seawater 
desalination 
projects; 
and 
for 
the 
training 
of 
human 
resources. 
Egypt 
would 
appreciate 
additional

cooperation 
in 
using 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
the 
detection 
of 
landmines 
dating 
from 
the 
Second 
World 
War, 
which 
impeded 
economic 
development 
in 
large 
areas 
of 
the 
country, 
and 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 


41. 
Egypt 
had 
engaged 
in 
constructive 
cooperation 
the 
previous 
year 
with 
Agency 
experts 
and 
inspectors 
under 
its 
safeguards 
agreement. 
It 
had 
also 
benefited 
greatly 
from 
the 
symposium 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
Cairo 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
international 
agreements 
and 
obligations 
in 
that 
regard. 
Such 
cooperation 
enhanced 
the 
AgencyÂs 
credibility 
and 
its 
ability 
to 
offer 
reassurances 
to 
the 
international 
community 
regarding 
Member 
StatesÂ 
nuclear 
programmes. 
42. 
A 
sound 
approach 
to 
safeguards 
required, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
an 
initial 
assessment 
of 
a 
countryÂs 
technical 
and 
regulatory 
capacity 
with 
a 
view 
to 
its 
gradual 
enhancement, 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
avoidance 
of 
political 
signals 
that 
denoted 
the 
application 
of 
double 
standards, 
which 
adversely 
affected 
cooperation 
and 
undermined 
credibility. 
To 
ensure 
that 
such 
standards 
were 
not 
applied 
in 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
established 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
its 
mandate 
should 
be 
carefully 
balanced 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
and 
the 
General 
Conference. 
Double 
standards 
were 
also 
discernible 
in 
the 
decision 
to 
amend 
SQPs 
and 
in 
attempts 
to 
universalize 
additional 
protocols. 
Account 
should 
be 
taken 
of 
a 
countryÂs 
ability 
to 
implement 
certain 
measures 
before 
requiring 
it 
to 
assume 
increasingly 
complex 
obligations 
under 
the 
safeguards 
regime. 
43. 
In 
the 
Middle 
East 
it 
was 
unreasonable 
to 
require 
all 
States 
not 
only 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
implement 
safeguards 
agreements 
but 
also 
to 
assume 
additional 
and 
ever-increasing 
voluntary 
commitments, 
while 
Israel 
remained 
outside 
the 
non-proliferation, 
safeguards 
and 
disarmament 
regime 
and 
indulged 
in 
sterile 
arguments 
regarding 
the 
need 
for 
confidence-building 
measures 
and 
a 
different 
attitude 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
region 
as 
a 
precondition 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
44. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
Egypt 
was 
eager 
to 
assist 
the 
Director 
General 
in 
fulfilling 
the 
mandate 
assigned 
to 
him 
in 
successive 
General 
Conference 
resolutions, 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
convening 
of 
an 
international 
forum 
to 
draw 
on 
the 
expertise 
of 
other 
regions 
in 
creating 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
provided 
that 
the 
forum 
focused 
on 
practical 
means 
of 
establishing 
such 
a 
zone 
and 
was 
not 
a 
mere 
theoretical 
exercise 
dealing 
solely 
with 
the 
advantages 
of 
and 
justifications 
for 
such 
a 
project. 
He 
urged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
pursue 
his 
efforts 
to 
persuade 
the 
party 
that 
was 
preventing 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
goodwill 
by 
complying 
with 
international 
resolutions 
that 
concurred 
in 
the 
view 
that 
such 
a 
zone 
would 
consolidate 
world 
peace 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Egypt 
would 
continue 
to 
submit 
a 
resolution 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
consensus 
regarding 
its 
content 
would 
be 
translated 
into 
practical 
action. 
The 
first 
step 
towards 
confidence-building 
and 
the 
achievement 
of 
a 
comprehensive 
peace 
consisted 
in 
renouncing 
nuclear 
weapons, 
ridding 
the 
region 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
placing 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
all 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
under 
Agency 
safeguards, 
especially 
since 
the 
lack 
of 
international 
verification 
of 
the 
safety 
of 
many 
such 
activities 
and 
of 
the 
safe 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste 
could 
result 
in 
an 
environmental 
disaster. 
45. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
called 
on 
States 
with 
nuclear 
activities 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
principle 
that 
radioactive 
waste 
should 
be 
managed 
in 
such 
a 
way 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
possible 
effects 
on 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment 
beyond 
national 
borders 
were 
taken 
into 
account, 
and 
by 
all 
other 
Agency 
principles 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
Safety 
Requirements 
publication 
on 
the 
geological 
disposal 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
46. 
Egypt 
had 
just 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
would 
immediately 
initiate 
procedures 
leading 
to 
its 
ratification.

47. 
His 
country 
undertook 
to 
pay 
all 
its 
financial 
contributions 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
would 
also 
endeavour 
to 
make 
available 
its 
expertise 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
African 
and 
Arab 
countries 
either 
under 
the 
AFRA 
programme 
or 
through 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency. 
48. 
Mr. 
BUTT 
(Pakistan) 
said 
that 
in 
the 
fifty 
years 
since 
it 
had 
realized 
the 
enormous 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development, 
Pakistan 
had 
developed 
numerous 
facilities 
for 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
fields, 
including 
power 
generation, 
health 
and 
agriculture. 
It 
had 
benefited 
a 
great 
deal 
from 
Agency 
activities, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
cooperation. 
49. 
The 
overall 
implementation 
rate 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
Pakistan 
had 
reached 
a 
record 
high 
of 
75.8% 
in 
2004, 
and 
his 
country 
was 
one 
of 
the 
top 
beneficiaries 
of 
Agency 
assistance. 
Pakistan, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
made 
a 
modest 
contribution 
by 
providing 
experts, 
lecturers 
and 
training. 
It 
was 
prepared 
to 
offer 
its 
experience 
and 
expertise 
to 
other 
developing 
Member 
States 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
TCDC 
programme, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
advisory 
role 
of 
SAGTAC 
in 
strengthening 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
were 
vital, 
and 
he 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
appreciation 
to 
those 
countries 
that 
honoured 
their 
commitments 
to 
support 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
Having 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time, 
he 
pledged 
PakistanÂs 
full 
share 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2006. 
50. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
were 
just 
as 
important 
as 
its 
safeguards 
and 
non-proliferation 
activities, 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
to 
be 
careful 
in 
maintaining 
a 
balance 
between 
those 
areas 
of 
its 
work. 
The 
public 
perception 
of 
the 
Agency 
simply 
as 
a 
Ânuclear 
watchdogÂ 
needed 
to 
be 
corrected, 
and 
its 
increasing 
role 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
re-emphasized. 
51. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
a 
promising 
option 
to 
help 
prevent 
the 
escalating 
generation 
of 
CO2 
and 
resulting 
global 
warming. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
supplier 
countries 
would 
have 
the 
vision 
not 
to 
confine 
the 
flow 
of 
nuclear 
power 
technology 
to 
selected 
countries 
only, 
since 
CO2 
avoided 
anywhere 
was 
CO2 
avoided 
everywhere. 
52. 
Pakistan 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
carrying 
out 
modifications 
and 
replacements 
to 
the 
KANUPP 
plant 
under 
an 
Agency-assisted 
re-lifing 
programme. 
Unit 
1 
of 
the 
CHASNUPP 
plant 
was 
operating 
very 
well, 
and 
in 
the 
one 
and 
a 
half 
years 
since 
its 
previous 
refuelling 
outage, 
it 
had 
achieved 
an 
availability 
factor 
of 
96.3% 
and 
a 
capacity 
factor 
of 
93.3%. 
Good 
progress 
was 
being 
made 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
CHASNUPP 
Unit 
2, 
and 
Pakistan 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Chinese 
Government 
for 
having 
supplied 
the 
power 
plants 
as 
a 
demonstration 
of 
South-South 
cooperation. 
53. 
PakistanÂs 
economy 
was 
showing 
a 
remarkable 
growth 
rate, 
reaching 
8.4% 
the 
previous 
year. 
In 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
ever-increasing 
demand 
for 
electricity, 
his 
Government 
had 
launched 
an 
energy 
security 
plan 
envisaging 
an 
increase 
in 
nuclear 
electricity 
generation 
from 
425 
MW(e) 
to 
8800 
MW(e) 
by 
2030. 
In 
order 
to 
meet 
that 
target, 
Pakistan 
needed 
to 
import 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
and 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
benefit 
from 
the 
recent 
liberal 
trend 
of 
export 
and 
exchange 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
In 
order 
to 
address 
proliferation 
concerns, 
Pakistan 
had 
been 
proposing 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear 
power 
parks 
whereby 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
would 
be 
constructed 
in 
specified 
areas, 
and 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
other 
security 
controls 
made 
applicable. 
Pakistan 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
was 
participating 
in 
INPRO 
activities. 
54. 
A 
much 
expanded 
role 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
foreseen 
in 
Pakistan. 
The 
Agency-assisted 
programme 
to 
set 
up 
a 
nuclear 
desalination 
plant 
at 
the 
KANUPP 
plant 
was 
progressing 
well; 
it 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
operational 
by 
2007.

55. 
Pakistan 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
achieving 
and 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
and 
had 
established 
mechanisms 
for 
effective 
and 
continuous 
regulatory 
control. 
It 
had 
been 
among 
the 
first 
to 
ratify 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
had 
been 
subject 
to 
peer 
review. 
PakistanÂs 
independent 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
was 
now 
well 
established 
and 
had 
developed 
an 
aggressive 
plan 
to 
address 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
IRRT 
and 
RaSSIA 
missions. 
The 
Regulatory 
Authority, 
together 
with 
the 
Pakistan 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission, 
was 
endeavouring 
to 
apply 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
in 
the 
licensing 
of 
CHASNUPP 
Unit 
2. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
supply 
of 
safety 
equipment 
would 
not 
be 
restricted. 
56. 
PakistanÂs 
four 
nuclear 
agriculture 
centres 
were 
helping 
farmers 
to 
grow 
and 
harvest 
more 
and 
better 
crops. 
The 
countryÂs 
first 
commercial 
food 
irradiation 
plant 
was 
under 
construction 
and 
was 
due 
to 
be 
operational 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
following 
year. 
The 
13 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
oncology 
centres 
operated 
by 
the 
Pakistan 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
continued 
to 
provide 
facilities 
for 
more 
than 
a 
third 
of 
a 
million 
patients 
a 
year. 
Work 
on 
as 
many 
as 
five 
more 
nuclear 
medicine 
centres 
was 
in 
progress. 
The 
Government 
had 
already 
approved 
a 
plan 
to 
set 
up 
PakistanÂs 
first 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
facility, 
and 
Pakistan 
welcomed 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
those 
areas. 
57. 
Reaching 
agreement 
on 
amendment 
of 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute 
had 
been 
a 
landmark 
achievement. 
However, 
the 
mechanism 
formulated 
to 
expand 
the 
representation 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
not 
yet 
been 
implemented 
due 
to 
the 
lack 
of 
the 
required 
number 
of 
ratifications. 
Pakistan 
hoped 
that 
the 
situation 
would 
be 
rectified, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
the 
efficiency 
and 
representative 
character 
of 
the 
Board, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
its 
next 
term 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Mr. 
WU 
Hailong 
(China), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


58. 
Ms. 
KELLY 
(Argentina) 
said 
that 
States 
should 
have 
the 
right 
to 
develop 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
with 
respect 
to 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
in 
compliance 
with 
related 
international 
obligations. 
Any 
attempt 
to 
alter 
the 
delicate 
balance 
of 
the 
obligations 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
NPT, 
calling 
into 
question 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
develop 
technologies 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes, 
could 
undermine 
the 
widely-accepted 
NPT 
regime. 
Any 
proposal 
for 
modification 
that 
was 
not 
seen 
to 
be 
fair 
and 
was 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
universal 
rights 
and 
obligations 
ran 
the 
risk 
of 
weakening 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
that 
Argentina 
strongly 
supported. 
That 
would 
include 
any 
initiative 
that 
sought 
to 
limit 
State 
sovereignty 
and 
the 
independent 
ownership 
and 
control 
of 
a 
key 
technological 
sector, 
such 
as 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
restricting 
the 
potential 
commercial 
benefits 
of 
those 
activities 
and 
technologies 
to 
a 
small 
number 
of 
countries. 
59. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
concluded 
without 
a 
substantive 
outcome. 
There 
were 
serious 
risks 
associated 
with 
failure 
to 
reach 
agreement, 
and 
specific 
measures 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
rectify 
the 
situation. 
60. 
The 
peaceful 
development 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
required 
a 
climate 
of 
unequivocal 
mutual 
trust, 
which 
could 
be 
built 
only 
through 
complete 
transparency 
in 
all 
actions. 
The 
Agency 
had 
an 
obligation 
to 
continue 
seek 
solutions 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
proliferation 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
peoples 
were 
able 
to 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
power. 
In 
that 
connection, 
she 
welcomed 
the 
new 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
that 
had 
been 
signed 
during 
the 
previous 
year. 
61. 
Nuclear 
energy 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
development 
and, 
in 
particular, 
in 
electricity 
generation 
since 
it 
did 
not 
produce 
greenhouse 
gases. 
A 
number 
of 
States 
had 
taken 
decisions 
to 
extend 
the 
operating 
lifetime 
of 
power 
plants, 
restart 
plants 
that 
had 
been 
out 
of 
service, 
begin 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
plants, 
and 
make 
joint 
international 
efforts 
to 
develop 
new 
generation 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
with 
greater 
operational 
safety 
that 
produced 
much 
less 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
ensured 
that 
there 
was 
no 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation. 
Argentina 
supported 
and 
participated 
in 
such

international 
initiatives, 
and 
had 
provided 
cost-free 
experts 
and 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
for 
INPRO. 


62. 
Her 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
complete, 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
Atucha-2 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
which 
had 
been 
delayed 
for 
a 
decade 
for 
financial 
reasons. 
The 
original 
contract 
had 
been 
renegotiated, 
the 
Arroyito 
Heavy 
Water 
Production 
Plant 
had 
been 
requested 
to 
provide 
the 
initial 
inventory, 
and 
a 
fiduciary 
fund 
had 
been 
set 
up 
to 
guarantee 
funding 
for 
the 
project. 
In 
addition, 
it 
had 
been 
decided 
to 
extend 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Embalse 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
and 
to 
take 
steps 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacities 
of 
power 
reactor 
engineers, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
their 
active 
involvement 
in 
the 
design 
of 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
63. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
2004 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
International 
PartnersÂ 
Conference, 
Argentina 
was 
converting 
the 
core 
of 
the 
RA-6 
reactor 
Â 
the 
only 
HEU 
research 
reactor 
in 
operation 
in 
Argentina 
Â 
to 
LEU, 
and 
had 
negotiated 
the 
return 
to 
the 
State 
of 
origin 
of 
almost 
all 
uranium 
enriched 
to 
90%. 
64. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
medicine, 
a 
new 
centre 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
complex 
therapy 
that 
used 
the 
latest 
equipment, 
including 
a 
positron 
emission 
tomograph, 
had 
been 
established. 
New 
experimental 
treatment 
applications 
for 
cancer 
treatment 
using 
boron 
neutron 
capture 
therapy 
had 
been 
developed. 
65. 
Progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
ArgentinaÂs 
six 
science 
and 
technology 
programmes 
that 
made 
up 
the 
national 
strategic 
plan 
and 
covered 
projects 
and 
developments 
with 
respect 
to 
power 
and 
research 
reactors, 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
spent 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
nuclear 
energy 
applications, 
as 
well 
as 
relevant 
research 
and 
development. 
66. 
Argentina 
remained 
open 
to 
establishing 
and 
strengthening 
cooperation 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
both 
multilaterally 
and 
through 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
ARCAL; 
it 
had 
specific 
bilateral 
cooperation 
agreements 
with 
31 
States. 
The 
joint 
efforts 
of 
Latin 
American 
countries 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
optimize 
the 
use 
of 
existing 
research 
reactors 
were 
commendable. 
67. 
Argentina 
placed 
great 
importance 
on 
efforts 
by 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
with 
respect 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
and 
the 
safe 
transport 
and 
management 
of 
waste. 
She 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
steps 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
concerning 
the 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
and 
information 
and 
communication 
networks 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
in 
particular 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Nuclear 
Regulators. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
physical 
security 
helped 
to 
promote 
coordination 
of 
relevant 
national 
and 
international 
efforts. 
In 
implementing 
those 
activities, 
however, 
the 
Agency 
should 
bear 
in 
mind 
the 
different 
treatment 
to 
be 
given 
to 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
radioactive 
material, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
dealing 
with 
that 
issue 
in 
a 
balanced 
manner 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
any 
negative 
impact 
on 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activity. 
68. 
Argentina 
welcomed 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
which 
would 
strengthen 
the 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
on 
a 
global 
scale. 
Her 
country 
had 
taken 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
amendment 
process 
and 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
amendments 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
69. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system 
was 
a 
mechanism 
to 
provide 
assurances 
of 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
programmes. 
Argentina 
would 
encourage 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
strive 
for 
greater 
efficiency 
in 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards, 
and 
noted 
that 
a 
profound 
cultural 
change 
was 
required 
for 
the 
adequate 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
She 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Argentine-
Brazilian 
Common 
System 
of 
Accounting 
and 
Control 
of 
Nuclear 
Materials, 
noting 
that 
cooperation 
between 
ABACC 
and 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
consolidated 
for 
the 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement.

70. 
Lastly, 
Argentina 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
Member 
States 
concerning 
education 
and 
training, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
Argentina 
had 
continued 
to 
develop 
its 
role 
as 
a 
regional 
centre 
in 
that 
regard, 
through 
the 
postgraduate 
course 
that 
it 
had 
run 
for 
over 
two 
decades. 
71. 
Mr. 
SKOKNIC 
(Chile) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
country 
that 
supported 
global 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
Chile 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
all 
the 
instruments 
relating 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
shared 
the 
views 
of 
other 
States 
in 
the 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
region 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
agreed 
that 
the 
NPT, 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty 
and 
the 
CTBT 
should 
provide 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
the 
action 
of 
all 
peacefully-minded 
States. 
Countries 
that 
had 
renounced 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
non-peaceful 
purposes 
should 
not 
be 
prevented 
from 
conducting 
research 
and 
development 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
which 
remained 
the 
right 
of 
all 
States, 
without 
exception. 
72. 
Chile 
was 
also 
party 
to 
a 
number 
of 
international 
instruments 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
assistance 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
emergency, 
civil 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage, 
and 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
It 
had 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
Conference 
to 
Consider 
and 
Adopt 
Proposed 
Amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
The 
consensus 
text 
adopted 
sent 
a 
clear 
signal 
to 
the 
international 
community 
at 
a 
time 
when 
setbacks 
with 
respect 
to 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
had 
occurred. 
He 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
ratification 
process 
and 
noted 
that 
steps 
were 
already 
being 
taken 
in 
Chile 
to 
modify 
the 
law 
on 
nuclear 
security 
with 
a 
view 
to 
incorporating 
the 
amendments 
approved 
at 
the 
Conference. 
73. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
safeguards, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
more 
countries 
signed 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
Chile 
would 
assist 
those 
efforts 
in 
any 
way 
it 
could 
in 
line 
with 
the 
relevant 
action 
plan. 
Since 
its 
additional 
protocol 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
April 
2004, 
Chile 
had 
submitted 
all 
of 
the 
relevant 
declarations. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
the 
annual 
safeguards 
inspection 
visit 
to 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
undertaken 
in 
December 
2004 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
protocol 
had 
yielded 
satisfactory 
results. 
74. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
DPRK, 
Chile 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
recently 
by 
the 
participants 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
It 
commended 
the 
PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
China 
for 
its 
tireless 
efforts 
and 
thanked 
the 
other 
parties 
to 
the 
talks 
for 
the 
flexibility 
they 
had 
shown. 
75. 
On 
24 
September, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
calling 
on 
one 
Member 
State 
to 
return 
to 
the 
negotiating 
process 
and 
to 
implement 
transparency 
measures 
in 
its 
consultations 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Chile 
trusted 
that 
the 
desired 
results 
could 
be 
achieved 
through 
cooperation 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
76. 
Chile 
agreed 
that 
strengthened 
safeguards 
should 
also 
cover 
SQPs, 
which, 
as 
they 
currently 
stood, 
were 
not 
an 
effective 
instrument. 
The 
Agency 
should 
be 
given 
greater 
authority 
for 
its 
verification 
activities. 
77. 
No 
State 
was 
immune 
to 
the 
threat 
of 
terrorism, 
and 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
some 
of 
the 
most 
vulnerable. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
national 
steps 
taken, 
international 
agreements 
were 
of 
immense 
value 
for 
promoting 
international 
cooperation. 
Chile, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
recently 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
78. 
Chile 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
had 
insisted 
that 
the 
subject 
remain 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
agenda. 
Any 
framework 
for 
such 
transport 
should 
include 
clear 
legislation 
covering 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
marine 
environment 
and 
setting 
out 
clear 
guidelines 
to 
prevent 
contamination; 
appropriate 
information 
on 
maritime 
routes, 
including 
the 
frequency 
of 
their 
use 
and 
the 
amount 
of 
cargo. 
Chile 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Transport

of 
Radioactive 
Material 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2004 
had 
addressed 
some 
of 
those 
areas. 


79. 
The 
dialogue 
between 
representatives 
of 
coastal 
and 
transporting 
States 
that 
had 
been 
taking 
place 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
proving 
very 
useful, 
and 
he 
trusted 
that 
it 
would 
continue. 
80. 
Consideration 
had 
to 
be 
given 
to 
the 
resources 
to 
be 
used 
to 
satisfy 
the 
demand 
for 
electricity 
generation 
in 
Chile, 
and 
nuclear 
power 
was 
one 
of 
the 
options 
being 
considered. 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
a 
seminar 
involving 
international 
experts 
was 
being 
organized, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
providing 
the 
authorities 
with 
the 
opportunity 
to 
consider 
the 
advantages 
and 
disadvantages 
of 
different 
energy 
sources. 
81. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
a 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
the 
agricultural 
sector, 
including 
land 
reclamation 
and 
the 
use 
and 
management 
of 
pesticides. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
export 
of 
agricultural 
products, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
priority 
was 
to 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
exporting 
market 
in 
terms 
of 
product 
quality 
and 
safety, 
in 
particular 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
use 
of 
chemicals. 
Those 
areas 
were 
of 
increasing 
importance 
given 
the 
free 
trade 
agreements 
that 
Chile 
had 
signed 
with 
a 
number 
of 
countries. 
Furthermore, 
new 
methods 
were 
being 
used 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
SIT 
to 
keep 
the 
country 
free 
of 
the 
medfly. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
health, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
project 
for 
new 
cyclotron-
produced 
radiopharmaceuticals 
that 
were 
to 
be 
used 
primarily 
in 
the 
early 
diagnosis 
of 
breast 
cancer. 
82. 
Turning 
to 
regional 
cooperation, 
he 
said 
that 
Chile 
participated 
actively 
in 
ARCAL 
projects, 
not 
only 
as 
a 
country 
transferring 
technology 
through 
the 
education 
and 
training 
of 
fellowship 
students, 
but 
also 
as 
a 
recipient 
country. 
Through 
ARCAL, 
regional 
groups 
of 
experts 
in 
different 
fields 
and 
designated 
centres 
had 
been 
established. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
relationship 
between 
the 
Agreement 
and 
the 
Agency 
within 
the 
existing 
legal 
framework, 
a 
strategic 
alliance 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
being 
established 
in 
order 
to 
define, 
with 
Agency 
assistance, 
the 
needs 
and 
priorities 
of 
the 
members 
of 
ARCAL 
with 
respect 
to 
cooperation. 
83. 
Lastly, 
with 
regard 
to 
horizontal 
regional 
cooperation, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
initiative 
aiming 
at 
better 
use 
of 
research 
reactors 
in 
the 
Latin 
America 
and 
Caribbean 
region. 
84. 
Ms. 
KAUPPI 
(Finland) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation, 
including 
potential 
proliferation 
to 
non-State 
actors, 
was 
a 
serious 
concern: 
hence 
the 
importance 
of 
full 
compliance 
with 
all 
NPT 
provisions 
and 
the 
relevant 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
take 
the 
appropriate 
measures 
in 
cases 
of 
non-compliance 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
integrity 
and 
authority 
of 
the 
system. 
85. 
The 
past 
year 
had 
again 
shown 
that 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
facing 
a 
number 
of 
difficult 
challenges. 
Finland 
regretted 
that 
the 
NPT 
States 
Parties 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
agree 
on 
any 
substantive 
outcome 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
Similarly, 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit 
had 
fallen 
short 
of 
addressing 
issues 
related 
to 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation: 
a 
disappointing 
result. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Finland 
would 
continue 
to 
promote 
universalization 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system, 
strengthening 
of 
export 
controls, 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
the 
immediate 
start 
of 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty 
and 
its 
early 
conclusion. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Agency's 
expert 
group 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
discussing 
it. 
86. 
Finland 
strongly 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
capability 
and 
legal 
authority 
to 
assure 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities 
needed 
to 
be 
reinforced. 
All 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
promptly 
conclude 
and 
bring 
into

force 
additional 
protocols. 
The 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
together 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
was 
the 
current 
verification 
standard. 


87. 
The 
implementation 
of 
FinlandÂs 
additional 
protocol 
had 
started 
in 
2004 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
Euratom. 
The 
relationship 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Euratom 
was 
of 
vital 
importance, 
since 
the 
new 
safeguards 
approaches 
of 
Euratom 
had 
also 
to 
meet 
the 
Agency's 
inspection 
needs. 
In 
order 
to 
test 
their 
practical 
implementation, 
Finland 
had 
offered 
to 
carry 
out 
a 
field 
trial 
at 
a 
Finnish 
nuclear 
facility. 
88. 
The 
Finnish 
programme 
of 
support 
to 
the 
Agency's 
safeguards 
activities 
contributed 
to 
the 
training 
of 
safeguards 
inspectors 
and 
carried 
out 
exercises 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
In 
addition, 
the 
programme 
was 
developing 
new 
verification 
tools 
for 
the 
Agency's 
use. 
89. 
Finland 
welcomed 
the 
considerable 
progress 
achieved 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security 
in 
2005. 
Finland 
had 
been 
among 
the 
first 
States 
to 
sign 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
to 
ensure 
the 
early 
ratification 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
It 
welcomed 
measures 
taken 
against 
illicit 
trafficking, 
most 
notably 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
90. 
Finland 
welcomed 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
that 
had 
just 
been 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board. 
Her 
country 
had 
provided 
in-kind 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
was 
pleased 
to 
announce 
another 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
NSF. 
Like 
many 
other 
States, 
Finland 
had 
written 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
expressing 
full 
support 
for 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
91. 
A 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
was 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to 
her 
country, 
which 
was 
a 
party 
to 
all 
international 
safety 
conventions 
and 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
recent 
review 
meetings. 
Finland 
called 
upon 
all 
countries 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
safety 
conventions 
and 
apply 
the 
resulting 
obligations 
in 
full. 
92. 
Finland 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
work 
the 
Agency 
had 
done 
in 
setting 
up 
modern 
safety 
standards. 
The 
preparatory 
process 
was 
valuable 
and 
beneficial 
to 
many 
other 
governments 
as 
well. 
When 
developing 
standards, 
it 
should 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
safety, 
security 
and 
safeguards 
formed 
an 
increasingly 
interwoven 
system, 
each 
element 
of 
which 
was 
essential 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
93. 
Finland 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
agreed 
that 
the 
funding 
of 
those 
activities 
should 
be 
the 
responsibility 
of 
all 
Member 
States. 
Finland 
had 
always 
paid 
its 
share 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time, 
both 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
to 
the 
TCF. 
Technical 
cooperation 
projects 
should 
be 
fully 
within 
the 
AgencyÂs 
terms 
of 
reference 
and 
based 
on 
national 
development 
strategies. 
94. 
Nuclear 
energy 
had 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
Finnish 
electricity 
production 
since 
the 
early 
1980s, 
and 
25% 
of 
the 
total 
electricity 
consumed 
was 
produced 
with 
nuclear 
power. 
Currently, 
there 
were 
four 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
units 
in 
operation 
in 
Finland. 
The 
fifth 
reactor 
had 
been 
approved 
by 
Parliament 
in 
2002 
after 
a 
thorough 
preparatory 
process 
and 
discussion. 
Increased 
nuclear 
power 
production 
promoted 
long-term 
energy 
supply 
and 
enhanced 
FinlandÂs 
possibilities 
in 
meeting 
the 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
target 
of 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol. 
The 
construction 
licence 
for 
the 
fifth 
reactor 
had 
been 
granted 
by 
the 
Finnish 
Government 
in 
February 
2005, 
and 
the 
construction 
work 
was 
now 
under 
way. 
95. 
According 
to 
the 
plans 
of 
the 
national 
utility 
company, 
operation 
of 
the 
1600 
MW 
unit 
would 
begin 
in 
2009. 
The 
project 
was 
the 
largest 
industrial 
investment 
of 
all 
time 
in 
Finland, 
and 
the 
biggest 
ongoing 
investment 
in 
Europe 
in 
that 
field. 
So 
far 
contracts 
had 
been 
concluded 
with 
more 
than 
600 
suppliers 
and 
subcontractors. 
The 
main 
components 
were 
manufactured 
in 
several 
countries. 
The 

GC(49)/OR.5 
28 
September 
2005,

14 


Finnish 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Authority 
was 
closely 
supervising 
the 
project 
as 
an 
independent 
regulatory 
agency. 
The 
safety 
objectives 
were 
higher 
than 
in 
the 
current 
generation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
the 
vendor 
had 
developed 
many 
novel 
technical 
solutions. 


96. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
required 
a 
robust 
and 
reliable 
solution 
for 
the 
final 
disposal 
of 
highly 
active 
and 
long-lived 
nuclear 
waste. 
In 
2001, 
the 
Finnish 
Parliament 
had 
ratified 
the 
Government's 
landmark 
decision 
on 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
final 
repository 
site 
in 
Finnish 
bedrock. 
That 
meant 
that 
all 
nuclear 
waste 
generated 
in 
Finland 
would 
be 
handled, 
stored 
and 
permanently 
disposed 
of 
in 
Finnish 
territory. 
The 
excavation 
of 
a 
deep 
underground 
facility 
had 
started 
in 
2004. 
The 
facility 
was 
likely 
to 
form 
part 
of 
the 
final 
underground 
repository 
for 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel. 
A 
depth 
of 
520 
metres 
should 
be 
reached 
in 
2009 
and 
the 
repository 
should 
be 
operational 
in 
2020. 
97. 
The 
final 
disposal 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
making 
nuclear 
materials 
permanently 
inaccessible 
represented 
a 
new 
challenge 
for 
the 
Agency's 
safeguards, 
and 
a 
completely 
new 
type 
of 
safeguards 
approach 
was 
needed 
for 
geological 
disposal 
sites. 
Finland 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
continuing 
support 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
appropriate 
safeguards 
measures 
for 
the 
facility 
under 
construction. 
The 
deep 
underground 
facility 
in 
Finland 
was 
the 
first 
of 
its 
kind 
in 
the 
world. 
Similar 
projects 
would 
follow 
in 
other 
countries, 
and 
the 
Agency 
needed 
to 
be 
involved. 
Hence 
the 
importance 
of 
allocating 
adequate 
resources 
from 
the 
Agency, 
both 
human 
and 
financial, 
to 
safeguards 
implementation 
and 
to 
safeguards 
approach 
development. 
Enhanced 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
national 
safeguards 
systems 
and 
early 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
would 
lead 
to 
greater 
efficiency 
and 
cost 
effectiveness. 
98. 
Mr. 
KONATE 
(Burkina 
Faso), 
noting 
that 
the 
world 
was 
afflicted 
by 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
threats, 
particularly 
the 
proliferation 
of 
various 
types 
of 
weapons, 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
deplored 
the 
breakdown 
in 
negotiations 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
99. 
Extensive 
accession 
by 
States 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
strengthened 
safeguards 
system 
would 
heighten 
the 
level 
of 
trust 
between 
States 
and 
the 
Agency, 
as 
well 
as 
among 
States 
themselves. 
Such 
an 
atmosphere 
would 
undoubtedly 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
100. 
Burkina 
Faso 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
and 
had 
always 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
peace 
and 
security. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
of 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
which 
gave 
the 
Convention 
a 
wider 
scope, 
including 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
installations 
used 
in 
activities 
domestically. 
International 
cooperation 
under 
the 
Convention 
had 
likewise 
been 
strengthened. 
His 
country 
had 
begun 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
amended 
Convention 
and 
encouraged 
other 
countries 
to 
ratify 
or 
accede 
to 
it. 
101. 
Burkina 
Faso 
also 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
his 
country 
had 
just 
signed. 
The 
Agency 
could 
provide 
technical 
support 
within 
that 
framework. 
102. 
On 
13 
and 
14 
September 
2005, 
his 
country 
had 
hosted 
an 
Agency 
meeting 
to 
promote 
in 
Africa 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
Although 
his 
country 
had 
no 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
it 
was 
making 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
efforts 
to 
find 
an 
appropriate 
legal 
framework, 
and 
remained 
convinced 
that 
the 
meetingÂs 
objectives 
would 
soon 
be 
met. 
103. 
In 
April 
2005, 
Burkina 
Faso 
had 
adopted 
legislation 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
protection 
against 
ionizing 
radiation. 
It 
now 
looked 
forward 
to 
Agency 
support 
with 
a 
view 
to 
facilitating 
the 
functioning 
of 
the 
national 
regulatory 
body 
responsible 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
considerable 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
help 
it 
achieve 
sustainable 
development.

Technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
were 
currently 
under 
way 
in 
Burkina 
Faso 
in 
areas 
including 
agriculture, 
human 
and 
animal 
health, 
capacity 
building, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
fight 
against 
tsetse 
fly 
and 
malaria. 


104. 
With 
a 
population 
bordering 
on 
12 
million, 
Burkina 
Faso 
still 
lacked 
facilities 
for 
radiotherapy. 
Cancer 
treatment 
was 
thus 
one 
of 
the 
main 
reasons 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
patients 
to 
Europe. 
Despite 
a 
lack 
of 
reliable 
national 
statistics, 
the 
Yalgado 
OuÃ©draogo 
University 
Hospital 
Centre 
at 
Ouagadougou 
was 
cataloguing 
a 
steady 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
new 
cases 
of 
cancers 
for 
which 
radiotherapy 
represented 
the 
best 
form 
of 
treatment. 
Despite 
the 
steady 
increase 
in 
cancer 
prevalence, 
provision 
of 
treatment 
remained 
weak 
and 
inconsistent, 
for 
a 
number 
of 
reasons, 
including 
insufficient 
knowledge 
among 
general 
practitioners; 
lack 
of 
multidisciplinary 
teams 
capable 
of 
providing 
comprehensive 
treatment; 
lack 
of 
future 
vision 
about 
a 
disease 
for 
which 
the 
risk 
factors 
were 
steadily 
growing; 
and 
lack 
of 
national 
technical 
structures 
that 
were 
well 
enough 
equipped. 
Burkina 
Faso 
therefore 
supported 
PACT, 
which 
would 
help 
to 
promote 
public 
awareness, 
training 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
technical 
capacity, 
and 
ultimately 
result 
in 
a 
favourable 
framework 
for 
radiotherapy. 
105. 
With 
regard 
to 
animal 
health, 
his 
delegation 
noted 
the 
progress 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
in 
conformity 
with 
resolution 
GC(48)/RES/13.B 
concerning 
support 
to 
the 
African 
UnionÂs 
Pan 
African 
Tsetse 
and 
Trypanosomosis 
Eradication 
Campaign. 
Heavily 
hit 
by 
trypanosomosis, 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
actions 
in 
the 
struggle 
against 
that 
scourge 
and 
encouraged 
it 
to 
keep 
up 
its 
support. 
For 
its 
part, 
Burkina 
Faso 
had 
already 
taken 
the 
necessary 
steps 
to 
mobilize 
resources 
for 
carrying 
out 
its 
programme. 
106. 
Efforts 
remained 
to 
be 
made 
in 
terms 
of 
strengthening 
national 
capacity 
for 
energy 
analysis 
and 
planning. 
His 
countryÂs 
poor 
electricity 
coverage 
was 
due 
to 
some 
extent 
to 
the 
high 
cost 
of 
electricity 
production 
at 
thermal 
power 
plants. 
Burkina 
Faso 
therefore 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
incorporate 
within 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
efforts 
to 
support 
countries 
in 
the 
acquisition 
of 
infrastructure 
for 
electricity 
production 
and 
supply. 
107. 
Mr. 
FRANK 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
the 
possession 
of 
advanced 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
increasingly 
recognized 
as 
carrying 
with 
it 
an 
especially 
heavy 
burden 
of 
accountability 
to 
new 
internationally 
promulgated 
norms, 
which 
had 
been 
motivating 
the 
action 
of 
all 
responsible 
States. 
For 
its 
part, 
Israel 
had 
intensified 
its 
efforts 
in 
recent 
years 
to 
bring 
its 
traditionally 
stringent 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
policy, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
standards 
of 
safety 
and 
security, 
into 
conformity 
with 
the 
evolving 
global 
arrangements, 
treaties 
and 
norms. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
striving 
to 
meet 
the 
growing 
national 
and 
international 
expectations 
of 
it, 
as 
of 
every 
democratic 
country, 
to 
meet 
the 
ever-increasing 
exacting 
standards 
of 
good 
practice 
in 
the 
nuclear 
domain. 
108. 
IsraelÂs 
efforts 
had 
manifested 
themselves 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas. 
It 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
norms 
and 
policies 
of 
the 
NSG 
by 
putting 
in 
place 
new 
export 
control 
legislation 
and 
by 
adopting 
the 
NSG 
control 
lists. 
It 
supported 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
capabilities, 
and 
in 
that 
context 
welcomed 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
expert 
group 
to 
explore 
multilateral 
approaches 
in 
that 
area. 
Israel 
welcomed 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
which 
was 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
proliferation, 
especially 
to 
terrorists, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
submitting 
a 
report 
on 
the 
steps 
it 
had 
taken 
in 
that 
area. 
Israel 
had 
also 
endorsed 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources; 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors; 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism; 
the 
amended 
CPPNM; 
and 
would 
be 
making 
a 
modest 
contribution 
to 
the 
Agency's 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
early 
in 
2006. 
Israel 
was 
also 
launching 
an 
effort 
to 
upgrade 
the 
security 
of 
its 
international 
border 
crossings 
against 
the 
smuggling 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials, 
and 
that 
effort 
had 
been 
greatly 
facilitated 
through 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy. 
His 
country 
also 
endorsed 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
and 
had 
been 
explored 
ways 
of 
participating 
in 
specific 
projects 
under 
that 
Initiative, 
including 
discussing

the 
return 
of 
spent 
fuel 
from 
the 
Soreq 
Research 
Reactor 
to 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
Finally, 
Israel 
was 
supporting 
and 
actively 
working 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
CTBTO 
PrepCom, 
and 
called 
upon 
other 
States 
not 
to 
carry 
out 
nuclear 
test 
explosions, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Treaty's 
basic 
obligations, 
pending 
its 
entry 
into 
force. 


109. 
Israel 
had 
long 
supported 
strengthening 
the 
Agency 
to 
allow 
it 
to 
focus 
on 
proliferation 
challenges, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification, 
which 
could 
provide 
a 
good 
example 
of 
constructive 
activity. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
same 
could 
not 
be 
said 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
agenda 
item 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat. 
There 
had 
been 
many 
alarming 
proliferation 
developments 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
recent 
years, 
but 
none 
of 
them 
had 
involved 
Israel, 
though 
all 
of 
them 
challenged 
its 
security. 
There 
was 
no 
basis 
for 
the 
agenda 
item, 
whose 
sponsors 
were 
motivated 
by 
extraneous 
considerations 
that 
were 
also 
evident 
in 
their 
efforts 
to 
challenge 
IsraelÂs 
credentials. 
Both 
actions 
were 
politically 
and 
cynically 
motivated, 
and 
had 
little 
to 
do 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives 
or 
mandate. 
They 
inevitably 
cast 
serious 
doubt 
on 
the 
sincerity 
of 
the 
sponsors 
and 
their 
willingness 
to 
make 
any 
real 
progress 
towards 
cooperative 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Israel 
therefore 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
reject 
such 
proposals 
outright. 
If 
any 
action 
were 
taken 
on 
that 
item, 
Israel 
would 
not 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
support 
the 
agenda 
item 
on 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
110. 
Israel 
supported 
the 
principle 
of 
converting 
the 
Middle 
East 
into 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
kinds 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
ballistic 
missiles, 
but 
had 
taken 
issue 
with 
the 
modalities 
of 
the 
preceding 
yearÂs 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
its 
portrayal 
as 
an 
end 
in 
itself 
rather 
than 
as 
a 
desirable 
outcome 
of 
a 
fundamental 
regional 
political 
transformation 
of 
relations. 
However, 
Israel 
had 
been 
willing 
to 
join 
the 
consensus 
on 
the 
resolution, 
while 
recognizing 
that 
there 
was 
no 
substitute 
for 
reconciliation, 
leading 
to 
direct 
negotiations 
and 
freely 
reached 
agreements 
among 
all 
States 
of 
the 
region. 
111. 
Furthermore, 
as 
a 
gesture 
of 
goodwill, 
Israel 
had 
proposed 
to 
the 
Director 
General, 
during 
his 
visit 
to 
Israel 
in 
July 
2004, 
that 
a 
forum 
be 
convened 
to 
learn 
from 
the 
experience 
of 
other 
regions 
in 
establishing 
an 
NWFZ. 
A 
framework 
for 
that 
forum 
had 
been 
agreed 
by 
key 
Middle 
Eastern 
parties. 
Regrettably 
the 
agenda 
been 
rejected 
by 
another 
State 
in 
the 
region. 
112. 
The 
Agency 
deserved 
much 
credit 
for 
its 
outstanding 
activities 
in 
another 
crucial 
area 
of 
its 
remit 
Â 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
mankind 
Â 
and 
Israel 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
in 
that 
regard. 
The 
interregional 
project 
on 
insect 
pest 
control 
using 
the 
SIT 
had 
created 
a 
good 
platform 
for 
productive 
and 
continuing 
collaboration 
in 
the 
region 
that 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
model 
for 
additional 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
radiotherapy. 
Recently, 
Israel 
had 
launched 
an 
effort 
to 
promote 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
training 
at 
the 
Augusta 
Victoria 
Hospital 
in 
Jerusalem, 
which 
treated 
mainly 
Palestinian 
patients 
from 
the 
West 
Bank. 
113. 
Israel 
worked 
to 
promote 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
industry, 
and 
had 
recently 
hosted 
an 
Agency 
mission 
to 
discuss 
its 
CPF. 
It 
had 
modestly 
increased 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF, 
and 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
sustain 
that 
trend 
in 
the 
future. 
114. 
Ms. 
ÂIAKOVÃ 
(Slovakia) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
develop 
integrated 
safeguards, 
and 
had, 
in 
April 
2005, 
deposited 
its 
instrument 
of 
ratification 
of 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
urged 
the 
significant 
number 
of 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
to 
sign 
and 
bring 
them 
into 
force 
without 
further 
delay. 
Slovakia 
welcomed 
the 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
diplomatic 
conference 
to 
amend 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
had 
begun 
the 
internal 
process 
of 
approving 
the 
amendments.

115. 
More 
than 
half 
of 
Slovakia's 
electricity 
production 
was 
from 
nuclear 
power, 
which 
would 
remain 
an 
important 
source 
of 
energy 
for 
the 
country 
in 
the 
medium 
term. 
The 
security 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
meeting 
Slovakia's 
increasing 
electricity 
demand 
and 
maintaining 
economic 
growth, 
and 
in 
that 
connection 
Slovakia 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
facilitate 
a 
discussion 
on 
the 
report 
of 
the 
expert 
group 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
in 
order 
to 
find 
acceptable 
solutions 
that 
would 
be 
of 
benefit 
to 
all. 
In 
recent 
years, 
regulators 
and 
operators 
had 
been 
exchanging 
experience 
and 
technical 
information 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
related 
matters 
in 
a 
number 
of 
forums. 
The 
Agency, 
as 
the 
competent 
body 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
safety 
standards, 
had 
a 
crucial 
role 
to 
play 
in 
supporting 
those 
activities 
and 
making 
its 
services 
available 
to 
Member 
States. 
It 
was 
the 
responsibility 
of 
the 
entire 
nuclear 
community 
to 
promote 
global 
nuclear 
safety. 
Slovakia's 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
considered 
the 
operation 
of 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
country 
to 
be 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
within 
the 
national 
legal 
framework 
Â 
a 
view 
confirmed 
by 
the 
outcomes 
of 
the 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
The 
review 
of 
Slovakia's 
national 
report 
had 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
good 
practices. 
116. 
Technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
important 
for 
Slovakia, 
which 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
dozens 
of 
national, 
regional 
and 
interregional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
One 
important 
area 
of 
activity 
had 
been 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
tsetse 
research 
and 
mass 
rearing 
facility 
at 
the 
Slovak 
Academy 
of 
Sciences, 
and 
Slovakia 
was 
ready 
to 
offer 
its 
expertise 
in 
that 
field 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
interested 
Member 
States. 
It 
was 
also 
willing 
to 
continue 
providing 
its 
experts 
and 
training 
facilities 
and 
would 
continue 
pursuing 
its 
general 
policy 
of 
accepting 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Agency. 
117. 
Technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
regard 
to 
human 
resources 
development, 
safe 
long-
term 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
were 
important 
areas 
for 
the 
future 
transfer 
and 
exchange 
of 
information. 
The 
expert 
services 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
an 
essential 
element 
of 
international 
cooperation 
and 
assisted 
the 
national 
regulatory 
decision-making 
process. 
Slovakia 
had 
fulfilled 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
TCF, 
and 
had 
taken 
measures 
to 
do 
likewise 
in 
2007. 
118. 
Mr. 
TOTH 
(Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty 
Organization) 
said 
that 
the 
CTBT 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
universal 
in 
its 
status, 
having 
been 
signed 
by 
176 
States 
and 
ratified 
by 
125. 
The 
ratifiers 
included 
33 
of 
the 
44 
States 
whose 
ratification 
was 
required 
for 
the 
Treaty 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
119. 
The 
Treaty 
provided 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
unique 
global 
verification 
regime, 
consisting 
of 
an 
international 
monitoring 
system, 
a 
consultation 
and 
clarification 
process, 
on-site 
inspections 
and 
confidence-building 
measures. 
Data 
from 
monitoring 
stations 
around 
the 
world 
were 
processed 
and 
analysed 
by 
the 
International 
Data 
Centre 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
all 
data 
and 
products 
from 
the 
International 
Data 
Centre 
were 
made 
available 
to 
Member 
States. 
That 
information 
was 
also 
useful 
for 
civil 
and 
scientific 
purposes 
such 
as 
rapid 
notification 
of 
the 
size 
and 
location 
of 
earthquakes, 
scientific 
studies 
of 
the 
earth 
and 
early 
detection 
of 
volcanic 
eruptions. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
July 
2005, 
89 
secure 
signatory 
accounts 
had 
been 
established, 
with 
a 
total 
of 
712 
users 
authorized 
to 
access 
data 
and 
products 
and 
receive 
technical 
support. 
120. 
The 
Preparatory 
Commission 
and 
its 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
preparing 
for 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
The 
building 
of 
monitoring 
stations 
and 
other 
elements 
of 
the 
verification 
system 
had 
continued, 
and 
coordination 
of 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
further 
developed. 
An 
operations 
centre 
had 
been 
established 
to 
supervise 
the 
entire 
data 
acquisition 
process. 
Installations 
for 
210 
monitoring 
stations 
had 
been 
completed, 
with 
over 
half 
already 
involved 
in 
International 
Data 
Centre 
operations. 
The 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
was 

GC(49)/OR.5 
28 
September 
2005,

18 


building 
up 
a 
complete 
and 
accurate 
set 
of 
minimum 
information 
for 
each 
monitoring 
station, 
which 
was 
stored 
in 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
database 
and 
made 
available 
using 
the 
experts 
communication 
system. 


121. 
The 
performance 
testing 
phase 
of 
the 
first 
progressive 
system-wide 
performance 
test 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
April-June 
2005, 
covering 
approximately 
half 
of 
the 
complete 
monitoring 
system. 
The 
test 
had 
provided 
a 
framework 
and 
data 
for 
further 
evaluation 
and 
assessment 
of 
the 
verification 
system. 
122. 
An 
alternative 
programme 
for 
the 
development 
of 
on-site 
inspection 
awareness 
was 
being 
developed 
as 
a 
high 
priority 
at 
the 
level 
of 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat. 
The 
related 
integrated 
field 
exercise 
would 
help 
to 
improve 
operational 
awareness 
and 
future 
inspection 
capabilities 
after 
the 
TreatyÂs 
entry 
into 
force. 
123. 
The 
provision 
of 
training 
courses 
was 
an 
important 
activity. 
A 
total 
of 
55 
station 
operators 
from 
32 
signatory 
States, 
mostly 
developing 
countries, 
had 
attended 
training 
courses. 
The 
Preparatory 
Commission 
also 
promoted 
cooperation 
among 
signatory 
States 
to 
facilitate 
exchanges 
concerning 
the 
technologies 
used 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
CTBT 
and 
national 
capacity 
for 
its 
implementation. 
124. 
Currently, 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
had 
approximately 
270 
staff 
members 
from 
70 
countries, 
some 
175 
of 
them 
in 
the 
Professional 
category. 
It 
was

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(continued) 
1. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) said that the Philippines was one of only a few countries that had a 
constitutional provision forbidding the presence of nuclear weapons on its territory, hence its strong 
advocacy of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. The international non-proliferation regime 
was currently facing new challenges and there was a need to redouble efforts to strengthen the NPTÂs 
institutional framework. At the NPT Review Conference held in May, the Philippines had called for 
the universal adoption of the Model Additional Protocol to strengthen the AgencyÂs verification 
authority. It was regrettable that the NPT Review Conference had failed to achieve consensus on 
substantive issues and that the United Nations World Summit had yielded no agreement on 
disarmament or non-proliferation. 
2. The Philippines was committed to the fight against terrorism in all its manifestations. It 
applauded the adoption of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism and called on Member States to accede to it. 
3. His country supported the consensus agreement to amend the CPPNM and his Government 
would work for the early ratification of the amendment. 
4. He reiterated his countryÂs call for shipping States to continue the openness they had 
demonstrated in recent months in discussing with coastal States important issues relating to 
communication concerning and notification of shipments. Shipping States should avail themselves of 
the AgencyÂs TranSAS missions in order to promote transparency. 
5. The Philippines welcomed the recent breakthrough in the six-party talks on the DPRK nuclear 
issue. Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was crucial to the security of the region and to its 
continued and sustained economic development. He called on the DPRK to uphold its pledge to shut 
down and dismantle its nuclear weapons programme, to rejoin the NPT and to allow the Agency to 
return to the country and resume its inspection and verification activities. 
6. With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, the Philippines joined NAM in urging the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany and Iran to return to the negotiating table. Iran should continue to work 
closely with the Agency and the international community to provide assurances that its nuclear 
programme was exclusively for peaceful purposes. 
7. Technical cooperation continued to contribute significantly to the sustainable development 
goals of the Philippines and the Agency played an important role in helping Member States meet the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
8. The Philippines was happy to be participating in a new Agency strategy, the collaborating 
centre scheme, which was designed to make the implementation of Agency programmes even more 
effective. The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had been designated as a collaborating centre in 
the field of harmful algal blooms and his country looked forward to the implementation of the 
three-year work plan on that problem developed by the AgencyÂs Marine Environment Laboratory in 
Monaco together with the Institute. 
9. The Agency-funded project on air quality management was gaining recognition among 
Philippine policymakers. The data were being used by the Department of Environment and National 
Resources in preparing its annual national air quality report. They were also being used as a reference 
for the formulation of the Philippine air quality standard for PM2.5. The Philippine Nuclear Research 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
2 


Institute was currently negotiating the establishment of an air monitoring station at Davao City. The 
project would generate the first PM10 particulate mass and composition data for use in pollutant 
source identification. 

10. The Agency was collaborating with the Philippines on the development of salt-tolerant rice 
varieties. The national expert group on food irradiation had submitted its recommendation that the 
Department of Agriculture adopt irradiation as a phytosanitary treatment for Philippine fruit for the 
export market. Technical assistance from the Agency, coupled with bilateral assistance with the 
upgrading of the countryÂs cobalt-60 irradiation facility, would contribute significantly to addressing 
product sterilization needs in Philippine industry and provide impetus for the development of new 
products. The Philippines had recently paid the Agency its cost-sharing funds for that project 
amounting to US $100 000. The approval of the use of irradiation to treat food and food products 
augured well for food irradiation in the country. 
11. The Agency-funded project on the use of isotope applications to improve water resources 
management and protection was gaining recognition in local water districts in the country. 
12. Closer collaboration by the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute with relevant stakeholders and 
end-users was promoting the assimilation of non-power applications of nuclear technology. In 
partnership with the Philippine Society for Non-Destructive Testing, the Institute continued to serve 
the needs of industry by conducting NDT training courses and providing expert services. The 
graduates from those training courses found employment both locally and abroad. Filipino workers 
overseas availed themselves of the training courses and had reported that the certificates issued by the 
Institute were accepted by their employers. 
13. The Philippines was the lead country in the RCA project on radiation technology for the 
development of advanced materials and the protection of health and the environment. Under the 
project, it had used radiation technology to devise new products from carrageenan (one of the 
countryÂs major natural resources) which had applications in health, agriculture and the environment. 
The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had also established new linkages with universities for the 
development of biocompatible/biodegradable injectable gels for tissue grafts, the development of 
nanomaterials and the application of radiation processing to industrial waste water treatment. 
14. Together with the Group of 77 and China, the Philippines was working with the Secretariat to 
improve the AgencyÂs recruitment practices and ensure they reflected appropriately the balance of its 
membership. It also closely followed gender mainstreaming in the Secretariat. Women had made 
outstanding contributions in the nuclear field and that should be reflected in the AgencyÂs staffing 
patterns. In that connection, he noted with pleasure that the World Nuclear Association had cited 
Dr. Alumanda Dela Rosa, Director of the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, for her distinguished 
contribution in the nuclear field. 
15. Ms. MELIN (Sweden), recalling that the recent United Nations World Summit had failed to 
address the issues of disarmament and non-proliferation, said that the worldÂs leaders had remained 
silent on the threats Â both old and new Â to international security and how to deal with them. The 
NPT Review Conference in May 2005 had also failed to take any substantive decisions. Such failures 
were serious because the threats and challenges were grave and the need for joint and concerted action 
strong. No country could tackle common threats alone, and without an international legal framework 
there were insufficient tools to cope with the problems at hand. 
16. Despite the recent political setbacks, the NPT, with its delicately balanced obligations, was still 
legally binding and the Agency played an indispensable role in the implementation of NPT safeguards. 
Full implementation meant that additional protocols should be in force in all States and Sweden called 
upon all States that had not yet done so to conclude and bring into force additional protocols.

17. The most proliferation-sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, enrichment and reprocessing, 
were again attracting increased international attention. Sweden welcomed the report of the expert 
group on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and noted that interesting options had been 
put forward, such as international supply guarantees with Agency participation. The time had come to 
begin consultations involving the Agency, Member States and industry with the aim of presenting 
concrete proposals to the Board. 
18. The outcome of the latest round of the six-party talks process was encouraging, and her country 
looked forward to rapid implementation of the commitments made by the DPRK in the joint statement 
issued after the talks. It also supported the continuing professional, impartial and dedicated efforts of 
the Director General and his staff to verify the safeguards commitments of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and reconstruct the history and nature of all aspects of that countryÂs past nuclear activities, and 
welcomed the resolution on that issue adopted recently by the Board and contained in document 
GOV/2005/77. 
19. In line with SwedenÂs energy policy of phasing out nuclear power and transferring to an 
environmentally sustainable system, a second power reactor had been permanently closed down in 
May 2005. However, the changeover process would take a long time and it was important that the 
remaining reactors could be run in an effective and safe manner. Therefore, a number of 
modernization programmes had been announced for the remaining reactors and the safety authority 
had issued new regulations on retrofitting of ageing reactors to meet modern standards. Agency safety 
standards and international cooperation had been a major source of knowledge in formulating the new 
regulations. 
20. Physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear material had been part of Swedish 
licensing conditions since the 1970s, but national regulations for nuclear facilities had recently been 
improved, with new binding requirements for industry some of which required significant investments. 
The new regulations had been drafted to comply with the amendments to the CPPNM, so that Sweden 
would be able to ratify the amendments speedily. She urged all Member States to adhere to that 
Convention and to ratify the amendments as soon as possible. 
21. Sweden strongly supported the AgencyÂs safety standards programme. With regard to the safety 
requirements for geological disposal of radioactive waste recently approved by the Board, in her 
countryÂs experience finding and agreeing on sites for disposal facilities, and subsequent licensing, 
required the strong and continuing involvement of all stakeholders Â the public as well as regulatory 
bodies. SwedenÂs nuclear industry was expected soon to forward licence applications for the 
construction of an encapsulation plant and a final repository for spent fuel. The AgencyÂs efforts to 
complete the safeguards approach for back-end facilities in a timely manner were crucial for Member 
States like Sweden with advanced repository programmes. 
22. Her country recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and the 
contribution they made to sustainable development. As such, it was a faithful contributor to the TCF 
and had pledged its full share for 2006. 
23. Finally, Sweden would be hosting the Summer Institute of the World Nuclear University in the 
coming year. 
24. Mr. NGANDAJINA (Angola) thanked the Agency for supporting the promotion and 
development of nuclear science and technology in the areas of agriculture, health and the environment. 
Since joining the Agency, Angola had received substantial assistance, in particular with training of 
staff and the elaboration of legislation and regulations. Despite the progress made, his country was still 
in great need of assistance and he appealed to Member States to support the development of peaceful 

GC(49)/OR.6

applications of nuclear energy in the fields of health, nutrition, industry, agriculture and the 
environment in his country. 

25. As part of the regular technical cooperation programme for the 2005Â2006 biennium, Angola 
was involved in two regional projects: one on strengthening of the infrastructure of regulatory bodies 
and one on protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to ionizing radiation. Angola had 
joined AFRA in 2004. 
26. Inspired by the devotion of the AgencyÂs staff, Angola had prepared new projects for the 
2007-2008 biennium which it hoped would contribute to combating hunger and reducing poverty, the 
two main challenges facing the country. Those projects related to the use of ionizing radiation in food 
production and the effect on animal consumption, improvements in food production through the 
application of mutation and biotechnology techniques, assessment of nuclear medicine techniques, 
management of the most widespread form of cancer in Angola, fighting malaria, and the use of 
inorganic biofertilizers in the cultivation and production of maize and beans in war-affected areas. 
27. The Angolan State was fully committed to those projects and was making every effort to 
establish an atomic energy regulatory authority in the current year. For technical reasons, the updating 
of legislation and regulations had been delayed but it was hoped that it would be completed in 2006. 
28. Monsignor BOCCARDI (Holy See) said that disarmament was an issue close to the Holy SeeÂs 
heart. It was committed to pursuing general and total disarmament through the promotion of a culture 
of peace based on the dignity of the human person and the rule of law, and a culture of multilateralism 
based on dialogue and honest, consistent and responsible cooperation on the part of all members of the 
international community. 
29. The arms race and the dramatic increase in military spending worldwide had to give way to a 
renewed global effort to mobilize resources in support of the objectives of peace and authentic human, 
social and economic development. The international community had to avoid a short-sighted approach 
to problems relating to national and international security, adopting instead a holistic vision, and 
acknowledge the benefits deriving from the correct implementation of a genuine international 
disarmament process. 
30. It was important to recognize the link between security and development, which formed the 
foundation of the NPT. Absence of development, poor living standards, and lack of education and 
good governance often constituted a fertile breeding ground for insecurity and tensions and should be 
urgently addressed. It was distressing to note that, while $900 billion were spent every year on 
armaments, only $60 billion were spent on development assistance to the developing countries. 
31. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme recognized the essential role of nuclear science 
in promoting development. Its initiatives helped fight poverty and contributed to the more peaceful 
solution of the serious problems facing mankind. The research activities and projects carried out in 
recent years continued to yield good results and brought to light innovative ways of tackling problems 
that affected a great number of people. Higher-yield disease-resistant crops were being produced and 
harmful pests eradicated, and the role of radionuclides in the diagnosis and treatment of malignant 
diseases was particularly important. The Holy See appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in the area of 
nuclear medicine and radiotherapy to expand the availability of cancer treatment facilities in the 
developing world and monitor factors that affected nutrition, particularly in children in developing 
countries. 
32. Nuclear arms control and global security went hand in hand and had to be addressed in parallel. 
It was important to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards system, integrating verification, effective 
export controls, physical protection and mechanisms for dealing with non-compliance. The Director 

GC(49)/OR.6

General had recently declared that measures to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime had to 
be accompanied by measures to accelerate progress towards nuclear disarmament. The outcome of the 
2005 NPT Review Conference had been disappointing and was indicative of a hardening of the 
positions of those States focusing on the slow progress achieved in the field of nuclear disarmament 
and those whose priority was to prevent any other State from acquiring the capability of 
manufacturing nuclear weapons. In the interests of international peace, security and stability, it was 
important to progress simultaneously on both issues. That would require all world leaders and 
statesmen to be open-minded, to acknowledge the legitimate development and security concerns of 
other nations, and to have the courage to take politically difficult measures. 

33. All non-nuclear weapons States party to the NPT should support the strengthening of the 
AgencyÂs verification system, including by ratifying an additional protocol. States should not use the 
fact that the NPT was not yet universal, or that nuclear disarmament was not progressing fast enough, 
as an excuse not to do so. Similarly, all nuclear-weapon States and States not party to the NPT should 
sign and ratify the CTBT as a clear indication that nuclear weapons would not be further developed 
and tested. 
34. It would only be possible to increase the production of electricity from nuclear power plants to 
help meet the growing needs of the world population if the international community was confident that 
such a step could be taken without increasing the risk of nuclear proliferation. 
35. Ms. HALL (Canada) said that the preceding year had been particularly difficult and challenging 
for the non-proliferation and disarmament regime, of which the NPT was the cornerstone. The failure 
of the 2005 NPT Review Conference to reach consensus on a final document, and the lack of any 
reference to non-proliferation and disarmament in the final document of the recent United Nations 
Summit, was cause for sadness. Those unfortunate developments placed even more importance on 
institutions like the Agency performing their roles and fulfilling their responsibilities as effectively 
and credibly as possible. 
36. Canada called on all States party to the NPT that had not yet done so to conclude a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol with the Agency, and urged India, 
Israel and Pakistan to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States and to place all their nuclear 
activities under Agency safeguards. It welcomed IndiaÂs recent expression of support for international 
nuclear non-proliferation goals and looked forward to learning more about how India intended to put 
in place national measures to advance those goals, and to working with India on the development of 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in a manner consistent with its own international commitments. 
37. Her country welcomed the BoardÂs adoption on 24 September 2005 of a resolution finding the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations, a long overdue and 
necessary step under the AgencyÂs Statute. It in no way disputed IranÂs right to the peaceful use of 
nuclear power as enshrined in Article IV of the NPT, but regarded the enjoyment of the benefits of 
nuclear energy as conditional on the fulfilment of obligations under Articles I, II and III of the Treaty, 
in particular where proliferation-sensitive activities such as enrichment and reprocessing were 
involved. She urged Iran to heed the BoardÂs call to re-establish a full suspension of all 
enrichment-related activities, including uranium conversion, and to provide the full transparency and 
access sought by the Agency. 
38. The announcement by the DPRK that it would abandon all its nuclear weapons and existing 
nuclear programmes and return to the NPT and the Agency was an important and positive step, and 
she called upon the DPRK to make good on those commitments. The outcome of the fourth round of 
the six-party talks had demonstrated again that difficult and complex non-proliferation challenges 
could be successfully addressed when there was the political will to do so.

39. The preceding year had seen several important initiatives aimed at strengthening the integrity of 
the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. Canada welcomed the recent decisions by the Board to establish a 
committee to consider how to strengthen the safeguards system, and to modify the SQP, thereby 
correcting a weakness in the safeguards system. A strong, effective and adaptable safeguards regime 
should be viewed as but one element of a broader non-proliferation and international security agenda, 
which also included an effective international export control regime as well as investigation and 
interdiction of clandestine nuclear supply networks. The Director GeneralÂs reflections regarding the 
desirability of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, and the report of the expert group on 
that subject, were noteworthy, as were the practical proposals announced by the United States of 
America at the current session. Her country looked forward to the Director GeneralÂs report on the 
AgencyÂs investigation of the clandestine nuclear supply network centred around Dr. A.Q. Khan. 
40. Canada welcomed the Director GeneralÂs announcement that the Agency had been able to reach 
the broader safeguards conclusion on the non-diversion of declared material and the absence of 
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Canada. That conclusion was the result of significant 
efforts by the Agency, Canada and the Canadian nuclear industry, which should be sustained through 
ongoing openness and transparency. As a next step, Canada looked forward to working with the 
Agency on the development and implementation of a State-level integrated safeguards approach. The 
announcement of that conclusion underscored the seriousness with which Canada took its obligations 
under its comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, and more broadly under the 
NPT. It expected nothing less from other States that had accepted those same commitments. 
41. With respect to nuclear safety and security, Canada was pleased to be the second largest donor 
to the Nuclear Security Fund. The AgencyÂs nuclear security activities were an integral part of efforts 
to strengthen nuclear security worldwide. The AgencyÂs role and CanadaÂs progress in that area had 
been highlighted at the March 2005 International Conference on Nuclear Security in London, and in 
the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan for 2006Â2009. Over the preceding two years, Canada had worked 
closely with the Agency to implement projects under the earlier Nuclear Security Plan and looked 
forward to continued cooperation under the next Plan. It would like to see more nuclear security 
activities funded out of the Regular Budget. 
42. Her country welcomed the amendment of the CPPNM and the adoption by the United Nations 
General Assembly of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
It urged all States to sign and ratify both. 
43. Canada had chaired the third review meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety held in April 2005. The Convention was a cornerstone of the global nuclear safety 
regime and its review meetings offered an important opportunity for peer review of countriesÂ nuclear 
power reactor safety performance. Her country welcomed IndiaÂs ratification of the Convention and its 
participation in the meeting. Canada had made progress in all areas covered by the Convention. The 
acceptance by the Contracting Parties of the voluntary use of the AgencyÂs safety standards was a 
welcome step. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission had already committed itself to using 
international safety standards in the effective regulation of nuclear activities in Canada, and to 
establishing a corporate-wide quality management programme in accordance with the AgencyÂs safety 
standards. An IAEA IRRT mission would be visiting Canada in the future. 
44. Her country also affirmed the importance of the safe and secure management of radioactive 
waste and looked forward to participating in the peer review process of the second review meeting 
under the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management scheduled for May 2006. The Government of Canada was making good progress 
on that issue and a milestone decision was expected in 2006.

45. Canada welcomed the successful outcome of the 2005 International Conference on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources and was continuing to work towards implementation of the Code 
of Conduct on that subject and the associated Guidance on the Export and Import of Radioactive 
Sources. She called on all Member States that had not yet done so to commit to both those guidelines 
as soon as possible and to their transparent and well-harmonized implementation. Canada also 
appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to address the problem of denial of shipment of medical isotopes and 
looked forward to continued efforts in that regard. 
46. With respect to the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, one of the three pillars of 
the AgencyÂs mandate, there had been much talk of a renaissance of nuclear power, a notion that had 
been given prominence by the international conference on nuclear power for the 21st Century held in 
Paris in March 2005. It was hard to envisage any viable, environmentally sound strategy to meet the 
increasing energy demands of the 21st century that did not include a major role for nuclear power. 
Nuclear power should also make a key contribution to addressing growing concerns over security of 
energy supplies. However, there had been recent changes in the uranium market and Canada 
encouraged the Agency to continue its leadership in the field of uranium resources, in particular its 
collaboration with the OECD/NEA on the publication of the Red Book on uranium resources, 
production and demand. 
47. Canada intended to remain a global leader in promoting nuclear power, which supplied more 
than 15% of national electricity requirements. In the preceding year, two laid-up reactors had been 
returned to service and the decision had been made to refurbish a third. The Government of Canada, in 
association with Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, was developing the Advanced CANDU Reactor, 
a new design with many significant advantages. 
48. Canada had been pleased to sign the Generation IV International Forum framework R&D 
agreement in 2005 and continued to participate in INPRO. It was one of the few countries that was a 
member of both initiatives and welcomed the ongoing collaboration between the two, and the 
announcement by the United States that it was going to join INPRO. 
49. Her country remained a major contributor to the TCF and commended the Department of 
Technical Cooperation on its continuing efforts to improve the technical cooperation programme. It 
noted in particular the changes to the CPF model and the benchmarking of technical cooperation 
projects against the Millennium Development Goals, as well as efforts to develop partnerships with 
other organizations and processes like NEPAD. It supported the introduction of NPCs and believed the 
TCF should remain voluntary and not be linked to changes in the Regular Budget. 
50. Canada would be hosting the Women in Nuclear Global conference in May 2006, 
demonstrating its commitment to the role of women in the nuclear industry and the Secretariat. PACT 
was another important initiative it supported. 
51. Mr. NGÂWANDU (United Republic of Tanzania) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme and the cordial relationship between Tanzania and the Agency. The 
country was in the process of finalizing its second CPF, on which its technical cooperation programme 
would be based. The CPF would also aim at implementing the recently promulgated Atomic Energy 
Act 2003, which established a firm foundation and framework for peaceful and safe applications of 
nuclear technology for socio-economic development and poverty reduction. Tanzania appreciated the 
CPF mechanism, as it enabled limited resources to be focused on a few areas of development of high 
priority to the Member State where nuclear technology available through the Agency could make a 
significant contribution. The CPF also stimulated better communication among all parties involved. 
TanzaniaÂs new CPF would focus on human resource development as its highest priority, as that was 
considered to be a prerequisite for the effective utilization of nuclear technologies. Other key areas

included human health, agriculture and food security, livestock and water resources development, 
energy and mining, industry and construction, and environmental radioactivity management. 

52. To build and maintain capacity in nuclear science and technology in LDCs, a more formal and 
strategic human resource development programme would be required. In that regard, Tanzania 
appealed to the Agency to continue and intensify its efforts to support Member States, particularly 
LDCs, in line with the resolutions and decisions of the forty-eighth regular session of the General 
Conference on capacity-building, human resource development and nuclear knowledge management. 
53. His country had always followed with keen interest the Director GeneralÂs informative and 
illuminating statements on the potential benefits of nuclear technology and atomic energy, and how 
nuclear technology could be used in association with conventional technologies for economic growth 
and poverty alleviation. Peace and development could not coexist with abject poverty nor could 
democracy and good governance grow amidst poverty, disease and deprivation. Poverty was a 
breeding ground for world insecurity and terrorism. It was time that the international community, 
particularly the developed world, realized that the security of the world depended on the total 
eradication of poverty. Unfortunately, as the World Development Report 2005 showed, poor countries 
were becoming poorer and developed nations were less willing to help. Tanzania called on the Agency 
and the international community to intensify technical cooperation programmes, in particular with 
LDCs, in targeted areas such as the eradication of malaria and HIV/AIDS, the improvement of food 
production, water resources and sanitation and the opening up of trade opportunities. 
54. It was a declared policy of his country that agriculture was the backbone of the economy. 
Unfortunately the benefits of using nuclear techniques in agriculture and food production remained 
largely unknown, sometimes even to the countryÂs scientific community and decision-makers. Nuclear 
techniques such as the SIT, livestock improvement through efficient monitoring and management of 
diseases, artificial insemination, improved nutrition through the use of isotope tracers to study 
fertilizer uptake, and crop improvement using mutation in plant breeding could all have a very positive 
and significant impact on the food security and economies of LDCs. A clear demonstration of such 
benefits leading to poverty alleviation was Zanzibar where the SIT had been applied to create tsetsefree 
areas, followed by the implementation of livestock improvement programmes. Since tsetse 
eradication, areas where livestock rearing had previously been impossible had increased milk 
production, thanks to the introduction of cross-bred animals, changing Zanzibar from an importer of 
milk, meat and animal food products to an exporter of those products. The challenge facing the 
Agency and the international community was how to create more tsetse-free areas in Africa to 
alleviate poverty. 
55. Malaria was now the top killer disease in LDCs and water resources were a rare commodity, 
particularly in the African region. Such major constraints on poverty alleviation efforts made the 
economies of African countries weaker by the day. Unfortunately, few people knew that isotope 
techniques could perform wonders in controlling diseases such as malaria, cancer and HIV/AIDS, and 
in the management of water resources. Perhaps the Agency could develop those applications further in 
the interests of faster economic growth and poverty eradication in Africa. 
56. With regard to the potential of nuclear power to solve energy constraints, Tanzania strongly 
urged the Agency and the international community to help LDCs, particularly in Africa, to build 
capacity for the utilization of nuclear energy for socio-economic development. An international 
consensus seemed to be growing regarding the control and ultimate prohibition of nuclear weapons. 
That should be strengthened further, along with monitoring mechanisms, to ensure nuclear safety and 
security. The growing challenges in the areas of proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear 
terrorism should not be allowed to impede the peaceful and safe uses of nuclear energy.

57. The Government of Tanzania remained committed to supporting to the Agency in its efforts to 
achieve its statutory objectives of accelerating the safe, peaceful and secure application of nuclear 
technology for sustainable socio-economic development. In conclusion, he called for increased and 
assured funding for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. Tanzania pledged its full share of 
the TCF and would honour its obligations to the Regular Budget. 
58. Mr. ZNIBER (Morocco) said that the Agency could contribute, within its area of competence, to 
world peace and security, sustainable development and environmental protection. It should receive the 
financial and other resources it needed and the political and moral support of all Member States, and 
its integrity should be respected. 
59. The international community had given the Agency a key role in the preservation of world 
peace and security through its verification activities. His country was disappointed at the lack of 
progress at the 2005 NPT Review Conference on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. The 
international community had to work to ensure that the next NPT Review Conference fulfilled the 
legitimate aspirations of all peoples to be free from the nuclear threat and to enjoy the full benefits of 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
60. Morocco supported the AgencyÂs verification activities and the strengthening of the safeguards 
system, which was intended to provided the international community with the necessary assurances 
that nuclear material had not been diverted and nuclear installations had not been used for nonpeaceful 
purposes. It welcomed the fact that more countries had concluded safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols. Morocco was to host a seminar on the additional protocol for African safeguards 
officials in October. The credibility of the safeguards system depended on its universal, transparent 
and equitable implementation, as well as on its capacity to detect illicit activities. He therefore called 
upon all States to accede to the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
61. His country had been one of the first States to ratify the NPT and conclude a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. In 2000, it had ratified the CTBT and the CPPNM. It had also 
signed the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. During the 48th session of the General 
Conference, it had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. 
62. He expressed disappointment that General Conference resolution GC(48)/RES/16 on the 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East had brought no substantive progress. Israel 
continued to refuse to join the non-proliferation regime and submit its nuclear activities and facilities 
to Agency safeguards, which was a serious obstacle to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East, and peace and security. In his countryÂs opinion, IsraelÂs submission of all its 
nuclear activities and facilities to safeguards was the main confidence-building measure needed to 
promote the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 
63. The threat of nuclear terrorism had to be taken extremely seriously. All States should receive the 
assistance they needed to put in place the required nuclear security infrastructure, and should 
cooperate fully with the Agency in the physical protection of nuclear material and equipment, 
combating of illicit trafficking and prevention of misuse of nuclear energy. Morocco welcomed the 
amendments to the CPPNM, which would increase nuclear security and promote the safe use of 
nuclear material. He called upon the Secretariat to continue providing assistance to developing 
countries in that field. 
64. Morocco was developing a national nuclear strategy, with the AgencyÂs assistance, which aimed 
to improve the legislative and regulatory infrastructure required for the safe and peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. It welcomed the activities undertaken since the preceding General Conference to 
develop the concept of a safety culture. Training and exchange of information played an important part 
in those efforts. MoroccoÂs fourth postgraduate course in radiation protection for experts from 

GC(49)/OR.6

10 


francophone African countries would begin in October 2005. He called upon the Secretariat to 
increase its financial and technical support for postgraduate training in that area. 

65. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had enabled Morocco to make considerable 
progress in nuclear applications, particularly in human resources capacity-building, and to become a 
centre of excellence for training in radiation protection and nuclear medicine. His country had also 
participated in the international conference on nuclear power for the 21st century held in Paris and was 
considering introducing a nuclear energy programme to help to meet its growing energy needs. 
66. Finally, he expressed regret over the slow rate of ratification of the amendment to Article VI of 
the AgencyÂs Statute, which was intended to increase the representativeness and legitimacy of the 
Board, and called upon all Member States that had not yet done so to ratify the amendment as soon as 
possible. 
67. Ms. STOKES (Australia) said that the Australian Foreign Minister had presided over the recent 
conference in New York to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT, held pursuant to Article XIV of 
the Treaty. The Treaty had been signed by 176 States and ratified by 125 States. The conference had 
strongly encouraged the 11 Annex 2 States to ratify it as soon as possible, since the Treaty could not 
enter into force until those ratifications were received. Australia was encouraged by the work done by 
the CTBTO Preparatory Commission to establish the verification regime and recognized the potential 
for the International Monitoring System to contribute to disaster alert efforts. 
68. The AgencyÂs work had enabled a great many countries to derive benefit from peaceful nuclear 
energy in a wide range of areas, from food and agriculture and human health to industry and resource 
management. Australia had large uranium resources and a significant scientific base in nuclear 
technology, including the state-of-the-art Open Pool Australian Light-water (OPAL) research reactor 
and associated neutron beam facilities now nearing completion in Sydney. 
69. Australia was a significant contributor to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget, paid its pledge of 
2 million Australian dollars to the TCF in full, contributed significant extrabudgetary funding to the 
RCA and was involved in a range of bilateral nuclear cooperation activities. 
70. Her country supported the AgencyÂs initiatives aimed at increasing the numbers of women 
working in the Secretariat, and in nuclear affairs more generally. 
71. A key factor in the successful development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was 
adherence to internationally accepted standards of nuclear safety and security, such as the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management, the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources, and the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. Australia looked forward to the 
continued development of Agency standards as the global benchmarks for nuclear safety. 
72. Effective physical protection of nuclear material was a powerful counter-terrorism measure. 
Australia welcomed the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan for 2006Â2009. A representative of her 
country had chaired the main committee at the diplomatic conference in July to amend the CPPNM. 
She called upon all States to adhere to the strengthened Convention and to apply the AgencyÂs 
physical protection recommendations and other relevant standards. 
73. Australia placed a high priority on the security of radioactive sources. She called upon all States 
to implement the revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the 
supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
Australia was working to 
strengthen its own regulatory controls on radioactive sources. It was also funding a three-year project 
on improving radiological safety in the Asia-Pacific region, which aimed to increase the capacity to 
respond to aquatic environmental radiological risks and radiological emergencies.

74. Her country had been one of the first States to sign the Convention for the Suppression of Acts 
of Nuclear Terrorism, had hosted the Asia-Pacific Nuclear Safeguards and Security Conference in 
November 2004, and had contributed to the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Fund and the G8 Global 
Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. 
75. Australia welcomed United Nations Security Council resolution 1540, which required all States 
to establish controls over materials related to nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. It also 
supported the United States Proliferation Security Initiative which had developed quickly as a valuable 
means of preventing illicit flows of weapons of mass destruction and missile-related items to and from 
States of concern and non-State actors. 
76. The world was taking a renewed interest in nuclear power, which was capable of producing 
baseload electricity with virtually no greenhouse gas emissions. As demand for nuclear power grew, 
so would the demand for uranium. Australia possessed large uranium reserves and would supply 
nuclear material to other States only if it was satisfied that it would not be used for any military 
purpose. 
77. The AgencyÂs nuclear safeguards system enabled States to demonstrate their commitment to the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and to have confidence in the peaceful intentions of other States. 
Safeguards underpinned long-term stability in international trade in nuclear material and technology. 
All nuclear suppliers should ensure that a receiving State had a strong national system of nuclear 
security comprising Agency safeguards, physical protection, measures to combat illicit trafficking and 
rules and regulations for appropriate export controls. 
78. The current standard for safeguards was a combination of a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and an additional protocol. Since an additional protocol improved the AgencyÂs capacity to 
detect undeclared nuclear material and activities, it was important that it be implemented by all States. 
Australia intended to make the conclusion of an additional protocol a condition for the supply of 
Australian uranium to States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. She called upon all States to 
sign and ratify an additional protocol promptly. As the first State to conclude an additional protocol, 
Australia had gained much experience in strengthened safeguards and would continue to offer 
technical assistance to States that required it, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia and the 
Agency jointly conducted regional training seminars on national safeguards, as well as a wide variety 
of ad hoc safeguards training activities. 
79. The Board of Governors had recently revised the SQP to comprehensive safeguards agreements 
for States with limited holdings of nuclear material. Australia called upon all SQP States to adopt the 
revised protocol without delay and to conclude an additional protocol. 
80. Australia welcomed the BoardÂs decision to set up the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and 
Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute which, with the Board of Governors, was 
intended to ensure the Agency had access to the full range of technical, administrative, diplomatic and 
political measures it needed to fulfil its verification mandate. The work of the Committee would 
complement the important work of SAGSI. 
81. A number of deeply troubling incidents had revealed the weaknesses of the non-proliferation 
regime. Some estimates suggested that as many as 35 to 40 countries could produce nuclear weapons 
if they chose to do so, and terrorist organizations were known to be interested in weapons of mass 
destruction. The parties to the NPT had missed a key opportunity to adopt stronger measures at the 
2005 NPT Review Conference, but the nuclear non-proliferation regime established by the NPT had 
lost none of its value. 

GC(49)/OR.6

82. The spread of sensitive technologies and the lowering of technical and economic barriers to 
their acquisition increased the potential for States to flout safeguards commitments and increased the 
risk of illicit transfer of technology. Enrichment and reprocessing technologies could be used both for 
peaceful purposes and for the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Uranium enrichment 
facilities required special controls and should not be situated where they might pose a security risk. 
States which wanted to engage in enrichment should demonstrate exemplary transparency and 
cooperation with Agency safeguards. 
83. Approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle had assumed unprecedented relevance. Australia 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to commission a report by an independent expert group. 
That report had contributed usefully to the search for new ways to limit the spread of sensitive nuclear 
technology. 
84. The AgencyÂs investigative work was important for stamping out the nuclear black market and 
for addressing changing proliferation threats. Deliberate violations of safeguards obligations and 
substandard security and safety practices had to be met with a firm response. States that wilfully 
violated safeguards obligations potentially cut themselves off from the benefits of peaceful nuclear 
cooperation. 
85. The claim by the DPRK in February 2005 that it possessed nuclear weapons posed a grave 
challenge to international security. The joint statement of principles agreed at the fourth round of the 
six-party talks was a welcome step by the DPRK towards its stated commitment to a denuclearized 
Korean Peninsula. The DPRK should grasp the opportunity to reintegrate itself into the international 
community by abandoning its nuclear weapons programmes in a verifiable manner. 
86. The Islamic Republic of Iran was seeking to establish a full nuclear fuel cycle without 
convincing justification. Key questions about the nature and intentions of IranÂs nuclear programme 
remained unanswered. Australia commended France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European 
Union for their constructive contribution to resolving the issue. The Board had repeatedly called upon 
Iran to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including uranium conversion. It 
was deeply regrettable that Iran had chosen to ignore those demands. Australia strongly urged Iran to 
reinstate its suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities fully and without 
preconditions or delay, and to comply with requirements of successive Board resolutions. She urged 
Iran to give the Agency the necessary access and cooperation so that the many remaining questions 
about IranÂs nuclear programme could be resolved. 
87. Ms. QUINTERO CORREA (Colombia) said that disarmament and non-proliferation were 
fundamental principles of ColombiaÂs foreign policy and the country had actively participated in 
initiatives in that area. A multilateral approach which fully respected the rights and obligations of 
States and allowed for the participation of the international community as a whole was essential to 
such efforts, which were crucial to global peace and security. Colombia had long supported 
international legal instruments and institutions, was committed to the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, 
was a member of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone, complied with its safeguards obligations 
and supported multilateral initiatives aimed at freeing the world from the nuclear threat posed by the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the possible terrorist use of nuclear energy. To 
further demonstrate its commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear technology and international 
security, it had signed an additional protocol in May 2005 for which the ratification process was under 
way. 
88. The NPT and the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime were facing serious 
challenges, and the outcome of the 2005 NPT Review Conference was regrettable. As the cornerstone 
of the non-proliferation and disarmament regime, the NPT established a collective security system 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
13 


based on the three mutually indispensable pillars of disarmament, non-proliferation and the right to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology. As a party to the Treaty, Colombia held to the position that the 
international community should not allow the so-called nuclear club to grow and that vertical 
proliferation as well as horizontal proliferation should be controlled. For the disarmament and 
non-proliferation regime to be effective, all States had to demonstrate their support and commitment. 
Colombia called for renewed efforts to strengthen the NPT and supported international efforts to 
achieve the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons and the establishment of more nuclearweapon-
free zones. 

89. Her country had been a member of the Agency since 1960 and recognized the fundamental role 
it played in its three main areas of activity: verification, technical cooperation and nuclear safety. A 
balance had to be maintained between those pillars for the Agency to fulfil its statutory objectives. 
That was particularly important in the current situation where developing countries were facing 
immense challenges, in many cases exceeding their technical and financial capacities. The AgencyÂs 
importance continued to grow, owing to the many possible nuclear applications in areas of 
fundamental importance for development. She urged the international community to support the 
Agency and provide the resources it needed to contribute to the achievement of sustainable 
development goals. 
90. Colombia was benefiting from the technical cooperation programme and was grateful to the 
Department of Technical Cooperation for its work. It had complied fully with the central criterion and 
was working with the Agency to update its CPF. Furthermore, it had paid all its APCs in full and its 
NPCs for 2005. In the past, it had cost-shared with the Agency and was making further requests in that 
regard. Under the 2005Â2006 programme cycle, a project on humanitarian demining activities was 
being implemented in Colombia. Work was also currently under way to reopen and start up the only 
research reactor in Colombia. 
91. She thanked the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security for the support it was giving to the 
regional initiative relating to the safety and use of research reactors in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, in which Colombia was taking an active part. An important regional workshop on that 
subject had been held in Lima in August 2005. Colombia welcomed all activities related to 
strengthening of regional cooperation in the area of nuclear knowledge. 
92. Her country also welcomed the PACT initiative which it fully supported. 
93. Project concepts were being formulated for the 2007Â2008 biennium. The Colombian 
authorities welcomed the new format for project submission, which should facilitate evaluation of 
compliance with the central criterion and expedite the project evaluation process. They also 
appreciated the proposed Programme Cycle Management Framework. 
94. At regional level, ARCAL had promoted and strengthened cooperation between developing 
countries during the 21 years it had been in existence. She thanked the Agency for the support it gave 
to ARCAL, and all the donors that had provided financial support to its projects and activities, and 
expressed the hope that that collaboration would continue. She also welcomed the strategic alliance 
between ARCAL and the Agency which would be implemented through an action plan to be drawn up 
in the coming months. 
95. Transport of radioactive waste was issue of special importance for Colombia, in particular 
international cooperation and exchange of information between shippers and coastal States, in which 
areas the Agency played a significant role. It was important to maintain dialogue and consultations to 
achieve better mutual understanding, build trust and improve communications with respect to the safe 
maritime transport of radioactive waste. At the same time, a binding legal instrument was needed to 
which all coastal and shipping States adhered. She emphasized the importance of the International 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
14 


Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material and the 2005 Regulations for the Safe 
Transport of Radioactive Material and stressed that they should be kept up to date. The work carried 
out by INLEX should continue. 

96. The safety and security of radioactive sources was a priority. Colombia shared the concerns 
over safety and believed that mechanisms, national standards and international cooperation 
arrangements should be strengthened to reduce the risks of using radioactive sources and the dangers 
of illicit trafficking in radioactive material and its potential terrorist use. Colombia had recently joined 
the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. It had 
also been participating in the programme on illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radioactive 
sources since 2004 and was concerned over the existence of a network for the illicit trafficking in 
radioactive material, equipment and components. The Agency should continue its investigations to 
discover the membership and structure of that network, with the support of all Member States. 
97. The threat of proliferation and terrorism required a joint effort at all levels. Any collective 
security system should not only be based on respect for the rights of all States and their legal equality, 
but should also take into account the needs of the developing world. That, together with a firm 
commitment to disarmament, would help build a future free from nuclear threat where the legitimate 
development aspirations of the majority of countries would be fulfilled. 
Ms. 
Wijewardane 
(Sri 
Lanka), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


98. Mr. AAS (Norway) said that the failure of the 2005 NPT Review Conference and the lack of 
any agreement on disarmament and non-proliferation issues at the United Nations World Summit had 
shaken the foundations of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. The hard-won 
consensus on the balance between non-proliferation, disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
Â the three pillars on which the NPT was based Â was in danger of unravelling, which was 
particularly unfortunate in view of the pressing security challenges, such as the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons to new States and groups, illicit trafficking in nuclear technology, the existence of a large 
amount of unsecured nuclear material, the growing fear that nuclear weapons might be given a more 
prominent and additional role in security policies, and insufficient progress in nuclear disarmament. 
Norway, together with six other countries from different regions of the world, had tabled texts for the 
Summit outcome document, an initiative which had been generally well received. Regrettably, the 
proposal had not commanded the required consensus. Norway would take up the challenge issued by 
the United Nations Secretary-General and would continue to seek consensus and concrete results 
together with Australia, Chile, Indonesia, Romania, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and all the 
other countries that had supported its efforts. A new global consensus on nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation needed to be fostered and the Agency needed to be a part of that process. 
99. Compliance with arms control treaties was vital for collective security. Difficult compliance 
matters needed to be dealt with in a credible manner. The Agency had a key role in verifying that 
States party to the NPT honoured their non-proliferation obligations. 
100. Since October 2003, good progress had been made in correcting the breaches of IranÂs 
obligations under its safeguards agreement. However, in view of its history of concealment and 
disinformation, there remained a confidence deficit that hampered a political solution. He therefore 
urged Iran to heed the AgencyÂs plea for transparency measures that went beyond the formal 
requirements of the additional protocol in order to bring the investigations to a conclusion as soon as 
possible. It was up to Iran to allow diplomacy to do its job in removing justified concerns about its 
nuclear programme. Steps that could escalate the situation needed to be avoided. It should be in the 
interest of all parties to pave the way for resumption of negotiations.

101. Norway welcomed the agreement reached in the six-party talks concerning the denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula. It expected all parties to live up to their commitments and take coordinated 
steps in line with the principle of commitment for commitment, action for action, with the aim of 
implementing the 1992 Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
102. The AgencyÂs verification programme was essential for maintaining the confidence needed for 
the NPT to be credible and to function well. The additional protocol would give the Agency a broader 
basis on which to draw conclusions regarding safeguards. It was encouraging that an increasing 
number of countries were concluding additional protocols, but progress was too slow and it was 
important to work towards universal implementation. The General Conference should state that the 
comprehensive safeguards together with the additional protocol should be considered the verification 
standard and a condition for taking part in peaceful nuclear cooperation. 
103. His country welcomed the establishment of the new Advisory Committee on Safeguards and 
Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute and was ready to share its own experience of 
integrated safeguards arrangements with the Agency. It encouraged the Agency to continue and 
expand its technical support to Member States in implementing Agency safeguards and to continue to 
strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the verification programme. Norway would 
promote further steps to enhance the regimeÂs effectiveness. 
104. Norway welcomed additional voluntary-offer arrangements by the nuclear-weapon States for 
improved protection and control of nuclear material. It also urged the nuclear-weapon States to 
provide greater security and transparency with respect to their fissile material holdings, which would 
be an important confidence-building measure, would serve non-proliferation efforts and would 
contribute substantially to disarmament efforts. 
105. Full implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 was vital in order to prevent terrorist 
groups from acquiring nuclear material and technology. He called upon all States to adopt and enforce 
effective laws prohibiting non-State actors from pursuing activities related to weapons of mass 
destruction. With its substantial base of technical competence and information, the Agency was well 
positioned to assist States in fulfilling the obligations set out in resolution 1540. Norway would 
contribute to that end and explore possible cooperation with the Agency. As the current Chair of the 
Nuclear Suppliers Group, Norway was satisfied that recognition of the GroupÂs control measures as an 
international benchmark had grown. Norway had signed the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and considered it an important instrument which should 
enter into force as soon as possible. 
106. A proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel cycle was in the interest of all States and would favour the 
right to benefit from nuclear energy and technology enshrined in the NPT. Norway welcomed the 
recommendations of the expert group on multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, which 
should inspire efforts to elaborate a mechanism whereby States were assured supplies of nuclear fuel 
provided they refrained from developing their capacity to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium. It 
could take time to achieve that. In the meantime, he called for a moratorium on the construction of 
facilities incorporating sensitive technologies. 
107. Curbing the use of HEU was another measure which could reduce the risk of nuclear 
proliferation. A long-term target should therefore be set for reaching agreement on prohibition of 
civilian uses. Member States should commit themselves to converting civilian nuclear installations 
from HEU to LEU as soon as was technically feasible and the Agency should support that process. 
Norway would encourage the Agency to organize a seminar on the technical challenges. It was equally 
important to implement international initiatives currently under way, such as the G8 Global 
Partnership and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. All Member States should increase the level of 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
16 


transparency for HEU holdings and the Agency should develop guidelines for the management of 
HEU in the civilian sector along the lines of those for reporting plutonium. 

108. The Agency had a clear mandate in relation to a wide range of nuclear activities. International 
Agency standards and norms relating to nuclear safety and security were actively utilized. Norway 
welcomed in particular the amendments to the CPPNM agreed on in July 2005. Global adherence to 
the strengthened Convention should now be the goal. Ever since it had joined the G8 Global 
Partnership, the security of nuclear installations and nuclear materials had been a core element of 
NorwayÂs cooperation efforts. It would continue to play a leading role in efforts to improve 
international cooperation to ensure that adequate standard tools and mechanisms for responding to 
nuclear and radiological emergencies were in place, and would promote full implementation of the 
international action plan for strengthening the international emergency preparedness and response 
system. Adequate funding for the action plan and the allocation of resources through the Regular 
Budget were essential. His country also supported efforts to examine and improve international 
regulations relating to maritime transport and dialogue between shipping and coastal States. It 
expected concrete and speedy results in the coming year from INLEX. 
109. Peaceful use of nuclear energy and technology should not be allowed to harm the environment 
and the international community should intensify its efforts to protect the environment against the 
harmful effects of radiation. The 2nd International Conference on Radioactivity in the Environment, to 
be held in the coming week, should produce a concrete outcome. 
110. Norway welcomed the increased support for and adherence to the Convention on Nuclear Safety 
and the positive outcome of the third review meeting held in April. The forthcoming meeting in 
December on the application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors should 
contribute to enhanced focus on research reactor safety and international transparency. 
111. Good national control of radioactive sources was one of the most important tools for preventing 
incidents and accidents, including malicious uses. The Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources was an important tool to achieve that end. All countries should adopt the 
standards set by the Code and supply the Agency with sufficient resources to assist countries in 
implementing it. 
112. Everyone should contribute to strengthening the AgencyÂs capacity, and provide it with the 
necessary resources. Norway also encouraged the Secretariat to look into ways of recruiting more 
women. 
113. The proliferation challenges facing the world were serious. Disappointment with the NPT 
Review Conference and the World Summit had to be overcome and efforts to forge a new global 
non-proliferation consensus had to become even more determined. A strong and credible Agency was 
vital to achieve that. 
114. Mr. MOHAMAD (Malaysia) said it was regrettable that the 2005 NPT Review Conference had 
been unable to adopt a final consensus document. The NPT regime and its review process should be 
strengthened and universalized. If nuclear-weapon States party to the Treaty did not take steps to 
dismantle and eliminate nuclear weapons, the relevance of the NPT would be called into question. The 
indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 had not been a carte blanche for the nuclear-weapon States to 
retain nuclear weapons indefinitely. Non-proliferation activities would not succeed without 
disarmament. Furthermore, the nuclear-weapon States should not ignore nuclear arsenals in States not 
party to the NPT and such States should be brought into the regime for it to become truly universal. 
115. Speaking on behalf of NAM, he noted that the Board had recognized that the SQP in its present 
form constituted a weakness in the safeguards system and had requested the Agency to assist SQP

States in making a smooth transition to new arrangements by organizing comprehensive training 
programmes and providing technical assistance for capacity building, whatever option was chosen on 
how to proceed. 

116. NAM recognized the inalienable right of all States to develop atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes. While fully supporting efforts to ensure the non-proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, it maintained that non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear technology should be 
addressed in a balanced and non-discriminatory manner. A clear distinction had to be made between 
Member StatesÂ legal obligations pursuant to their safeguards agreements and voluntary commitments. 
Voluntary commitments could not be turned into legal safeguards obligations and Member States 
should not be penalized for not adhering to their voluntary commitments. 
117. The Agency was the sole competent authority for verification and NAM had full confidence in 
its professionalism and impartiality. All safeguards and verification issues, including those relating to 
Iran, should be resolved within the framework of the Agency based on technical grounds. The Agency 
had the legal authority to pursue verification of possible nuclear weapons, but any request for 
additional legal authority should be negotiated by Member States. It was therefore important to 
promote and strengthen the multilateral process. 
118. Speaking on behalf of Malaysia, he said that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East would enhance global and regional peace and security, strengthen the nonproliferation 
regime and contribute to nuclear disarmament. He reaffirmed the need for the prompt 
establishment of such a zone in the region, in accordance with relevant United Nations Security 
Council and General Assembly resolutions. Every nuclear-weapon-free zone was a critical piece of 
what would eventually become a nuclear-weapon-free world. Malaysia had played an important role in 
establishing the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone through the Bangkok Treaty in 1995 and 
remained concerned that the majority of nuclear-weapon States had been unwilling to sign the 
Protocol to that Treaty. 
119. His country remained fully committed to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction, as a step towards general and complete nuclear disarmament, and fully 
condemned all acts of terrorism, including nuclear terrorism, regardless of the motivation of 
perpetrators. In that spirit, it had joined other States in signing the International Convention on the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and had expressed its intention to conclude an additional 
protocol. Given the link between nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear terrorism, it was reviewing and 
strengthening its national export control laws and regulations. 
120. The Director General had advocated multilateral approaches to the front and back ends of the 
nuclear fuel cycle as a means of addressing current proliferation and security challenges arising from 
proliferation-sensitive fuel cycle operations. Any such multilateral approach should not adversely 
affect the fundamental inalienable right of NPT State Parties to develop atomic energy for peaceful 
purposes, either by imposing a mandatory permanent suspension of any part of that right as a 
pre-condition for the participation by any State Party in a multilateral approach, or otherwise. 
However, a temporary voluntary waiver for the duration of a multilateral arrangement, subject to a 
continued assurance of supply and with appropriate guarantees, including guaranteed financial and 
other relevant compensation for failure to supply for reasons other than a violation or breach of 
nuclear non-proliferation commitments, could contribute to the larger objective of strengthening the 
non-proliferation regime. 
121. Non-politicized, rationalized nuclear non-proliferation export control regimes needed to be 
established independently from the NPT for multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle to 
succeed. Any denial of nuclear export should be based solely on a breach of non-proliferation

18 


commitments by the importing State verified by the Agency. Given the proliferation significance of 
nuclear fuel cycle technology, his country could also support the requirement to sign and implement 
fully an additional protocol as a condition to participate in such multilateral arrangements. 

122. Preferential treatment in the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology should be given to all 
developing non-nuclear-weapon States that had consistently honoured their non-proliferation 
commitment under the NPT as a measure to restore confidence in the Treaty, particularly in the 
context of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. Malaysia was concerned over the 
partnership between an NPT nuclear-weapon State and a non-NPT State with nuclear capability which 
implied that the NPT State would work to achieve full civil nuclear energy cooperation with the non-
NPT State as the latter realized its goals of promoting nuclear power and achieving energy security. In 
addition, it had been reported that the NPT State would adjust its laws and policies and work to adjust 
international regimes to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation and trade with the non-NPT State, 
including, but not limited to, expeditious consideration of nuclear fuel supplies for safeguarded 
nuclear reactors. 
123. Malaysia had hosted the Regional Meeting of Policy Makers on Overcoming Barriers to the 
Sustainability of National Institutions, which had been held under the framework of a regional project 
on support towards self-reliance and sustainability of national nuclear institutions. That regional 
project had been initiated during the 2001Â2002 cycle of the technical cooperation programme as a 
response to the recommendations of a regional Agency seminar on strategies and approaches towards 
self-reliance and sustainability of national nuclear institutions held in Kuala Lumpur in 2000. 
124. His country hoped that a long-term agreement could be reached on the postgraduate courses in 
radiation protection that were being hosted by Malaysia and other Member States, in view of the 
significant benefits from those courses and the substantial investments made thus far by host States. 
That would be in line with the AgencyÂs long-term strategy for sustainability of training and education 
in all Member States. 
125. Mr. SANZ OLIVA (Spain) said that issues relating to nuclear non-proliferation were becoming 
the subject of growing concern within the international community and the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system had accordingly become a focus of international attention. The Agency and the international 
community could best respond to the threat of nuclear proliferation by pressing for the early 
universalization of additional protocols, which should become the new standard of the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system. Although Spain welcomed the increase in the number of Member States with 
additional protocols in force, it was concerned at the fact that, eight years after adoption of the Model 
Additional Protocol, 16 States with significant nuclear activities had still not concluded an additional 
protocol. 
126. Since the entry into force of the European UnionÂs additional protocol in 2004, Spain had, 
through the European Commission, been punctually providing the Agency with all relevant 
information regarding its nuclear activities and the Department of Safeguards knew that it could count 
on the full cooperation of the Spanish authorities. 
127. His country welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts in the verification field and was following 
with interest the initiative relating to possible multilateral approaches to the front and back ends of the 
nuclear fuel cycle, although it appreciated that account would have to be taken of both the technical 
and the economic implications. 
128. With regard to the security of nuclear material and facilities and high-activity radiation sources, 
his country greatly appreciated the work being done by the Agency in that field and particularly 
welcomed the adoption by consensus in July of amendments which would broaden the scope of the 

GC(49)/OR.6

19 


CPPNM. It hoped that all countries party to the CPPNM would do their utmost to ensure that those 
amendments entered into force soon. Spain had already initiated its ratification procedure. 

129. In the nuclear safety and radiation protection field, Spain was looking forward to cooperating 
still more closely with the Secretariat. It welcomed the progress made by the Secretariat in preparing 
safety standards and promoting their application with a view to the establishment of an internationally 
harmonized safety regime. 
130. His country had participated in the third review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and considered the meeting to have been a success. It commended the 
work done by the Secretariat in that connection. At the same time, in the interests of the ConventionÂs 
sustainability it would like the Secretariat to draw on the lessons learned from the meeting when 
planning future activities relating to the Convention. It attached great importance to all of the services 
offered by the Agency in the field of nuclear safety and would, in particular, like the Secretariat to 
increase the number of IRRT missions organized each year, providing Member States regularly with 
information about them and coordinating them with activities relating to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety. Earlier that year, the Spanish authorities had requested the Secretariat to organize an IRRT 
mission to Spain and it was expected that the mission would take place in 2007. 
131. As had been emphasized by INSAG, safety culture was of great importance for the safety of 
nuclear facilities. Spain would therefore like the Secretariat to continue working on the development 
of methods for promoting safety culture in the management if nuclear facilities, a field in which the 
Department of Nuclear Safety and Security had assisted Spain greatly during 2005. 
132. His country attached great important to INES, which its Nuclear Safety Council had been using 
since 1990. It had been participating since 2002 in a study by the INES Advisory Committee on the 
feasibility of expanding the scope of INES to cover radiological and transport events. It welcomed the 
efforts of the Secretariat to promote the use of a single event scale by all Member States. 
133. The Secretariat was to be commended on the results of the International Symposium on 
Disposal of Low Activity Radioactive Waste that had been held in Cordoba, Spain, in December 2004 
with the extensive involvement of SpainÂs Nuclear Safety Council and of ENRESA, SpainÂs national 
radioactive waste management company. Among the issues considered in Cordoba had been the 
problems associated with disused radiation sources, the existing large volumes of very low-level 
radioactive waste, and radioactive waste from the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The results of 
the symposium would serve as the point of departure for the International Conference on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Disposal due to take place in Tokyo at the beginning of October 2005. 
134. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management was the most valuable instrument available to the international community in its 
efforts to achieve the highest possible levels of safety in the management of radioactive waste and 
worldwide harmonization in the area of low-level radioactive waste disposal. Spain would like to see 
many more countries acceding to the Convention and was preparing a national report for presentation 
at the second review meeting of the Contracting Parties, which was due to take place in Vienna 
in 2006. 
135. With respect to the AgencyÂs activities relating to radiation safety, including radiation safety 
infrastructures, education and training, and knowledge management, Spain had made an 
extrabudgetary contribution of Â380 000 through its Nuclear Safety Council in support of an 
Ibero-American radiation safety project. Within the framework of that project, which was an initiative 
of the Ibero-American Forum of Nuclear Regulators, experts from Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico 
and Spain were working with the AgencyÂs Secretariat on the development of a prototype network for 

GC(49)/OR.6

20 


the management of radiation safety knowledge in the Ibero-American region. Spain intended to 
continue supporting the project through such extrabudgetary contributions in the years ahead. 

136. In the area of technical cooperation, his country was pleased with the current financial 
implementation rate. It was also pleased with the encouraging rate of attainment situation which it had 
helped bring about as one of the eight largest contributors to the TCF since 2003. In 2005 it had 
completed the process of gradually bringing its contributions to the TCF fully into line with its TCF 
target share. 
137. While welcoming the improvements which had been made in the area of technical cooperation 
programme management with a view to optimizing use of the resources available for technical 
cooperation, his country felt that equipment procurement should decrease relative to training. 
138. Besides contributing to the TCF, Spain was supporting the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
activities by receiving fellows and scientific visitors and providing experts for Agency-organized 
missions, in particular through CIEMAT, its Research Centre for Energy, Environment and 
Technology, which was already supporting various ARCAL projects and was planning to support 
projects also in countries in the Mediterranean region. 
139. His country was participating very actively in INPRO and would like to see further countries 
joining that project. At the same time, it would also like to see maximum use being made of the 
opportunities for coordinating INPRO activities with activities under way within the framework of 
similar initiatives. 
140. A decision had finally been taken regarding the siting of ITER, which was to be built at 
Cadarache in France. For its part, Spain would host the European legal entity responsible for 
coordinating European participation in the ITER project, which it would do its utmost to support. 
141. During 2004, SpainÂs nine power reactors had accounted for 23.2% of the electricity generated 
in the country. Given the commitments entered into by Spain with regard to environmental protection, 
the countryÂs growing demand for electricity was creating a major challenge, accentuated by the 
tensions affecting the world energy market. Consequently, although the current governmental focus 
was on increasing the use of renewable forms of energy and on drastically improving efficiency in the 
use of energy, in the long run, since it had very little in the way of indigenous conventional energy 
sources, Spain would need nuclear power to reduce its dependence on foreign energy supplies. 
142. The Spanish Government had decided to review in the near future SpainÂs general radioactive 
waste plan, inter alia in view of the fact that the JosÃ© Cabrera nuclear power plant was to cease 
operating in April 2006, after which there would be a need for a facility for the temporary storage of 
its spent fuel, and in view of the envisaged construction of a facility for the storage of very low-level 
radioactive waste at the El Cabril site. 
143. As regards the decommissioning of the VandellÃ³s 1 nuclear power plant, a large part of the site 
had been released following level 2 dismantling. The reactor pressure vessel had been sealed off and 
would be dismantled only after the radioactivity level had declined significantly in 25 yearsÂ time. On 
the site, SpainÂs radioactive waste management company, ENRESA, had established a centre for R&D 
in areas such as dismantling, decontamination and volume reduction. The centre had already hosted an 
Agency-organized course on dismantling for participants from Central Europe. In March 2005, 
ENRESA and the Agency had signed a memorandum of understanding on joint activities in the area of 
nuclear facility decommissioning. In addition, under an earlier memorandum of understanding on 
support for Agency technical cooperation projects in the Ibero-American region, ENRESA was 
involved in the planning of radioactive waste management projects to be implemented in various

Ibero-American countries and was participating in a project on the management of institutional waste 
in Brazil. 

144. Spain attached great importance to the AgencyÂs verification activities, its efforts to promote 
various nuclear applications in developing countries and its work on nuclear safety worldwide. It 
would continue supporting the Agency in all three areas. 
145. Ms. GARCÃA DE PÃREZ (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that, as a developing 
country, Venezuela accorded special importance to technical cooperation with the Agency, since 
development and technological innovation were key to socio-economic development. A series of 
projects were being implemented in the 2005Â2006 cycle and two large projects were being 
considered for the 2007Â2008 cycle. 
146. In the health sector, which had been of great concern to her country, a programme for early 
diagnosis of breast cancer was being successfully implemented, optimizing diagnostic imaging 
techniques. An agreement with Argentina was planned, in line with the AgencyÂs central criterion for 
cooperation and the principle of TCDC. Another important project related to sustainable water 
resources management in Lake Maracaibo and Cumana. 
147. There was regional cooperation within the Caribbean subregion, with an emphasis on less 
developed countries such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Venezuela was also participating in 
various regional projects under ARCAL. 
148. Venezuela was revising its legislation and national regulations on the control of radiation 
sources in order to make them compatible with international standards and the Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Agreements not yet signed or ratified were also being 
studied with a view to joining them soon. 
149. Though her country had not yet developed nuclear energy, the Government had submitted a 
proposal to the Agency for work, within the context of a regional project, on energy planning and the 
feasibility of incorporating nuclear power. 
150. Venezuela would be hosting a regional workshop in October on the management of technical 
cooperation projects, to be attended by seven countries from the region. It was continuing to 
implement cooperation projects through fellowships, scientific visits, expert missions and equipment 
purchases, as well as the training of professionals from other Member States through training courses, 
such as the one on isotope hydrology currently under way at the University of the Andes. 
151. As a demonstration of the importance her country accorded to the nuclear field, the General 
Directorate for Atomic Energy had recently been set up to regulate nuclear activities. A programme 
was also being developed to respond to the challenges posed by the increase in peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. Significant resources were being invested to train qualified personnel to join the regulatory 
authority. 
152. She thanked the Agency and its staff for the progress that had been made in implementing new 
projects. It was for that reason that Venezuela had striven to meet its financial obligations to the 
Agency, paying in full its NPCs and normalizing its payments to the TCF and the Regular Budget. 
153. In the field of safety and security, her country had begun to prepare a plan which would require 
support from the Agency and donor countries to solve the problem of radioactive waste, strengthening 
of regulatory capacity, radiological emergencies and improvement of the radioactive materials 
registry.

154. Venezuela shared other delegationsÂ concern over the failure to reach a consensus at the NPT 
Review Conference in New York. Her country had demonstrated its love of peace and its faithful 
fulfilment of its international obligations. It was proud to belong to a region free of nuclear weapons 
by unanimous decision of all the countries therein and had signed and acceded to all of the agreements 
aimed at achieving that end. 
155. In the preceding week, the Board of Governors had adopted by a majority vote a resolution on 
the implementation of safeguards in Iran, declaring that country to be in non-compliance with its 
obligations. Venezuela believed that the problem needed to be analysed from a more objective 
perspective on the basis of the Director GeneralÂs report. Consensus on the resolution could perhaps 
have been reached by including language which reflected objectively the need for dialogue, ongoing 
negotiations and the systematic intervention of Agency safeguards inspectors. She thanked the three 
European countries for all their efforts in that regard and their willingness to contribute to a dialogue 
to clarify the subject and urged them to spare no effort to find a solution within the Agency. 
156. It was time to build a world at peace. The NPT provided the opportunity to do so, aided by the 
AgencyÂs years of experience. All countries should make an equal commitment to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, to promote disarmament and to develop nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
157. Thus, Venezuela supported the NPT and all regulations and measures stemming from it. It 
commended the Agency and the Secretariat for its efforts in the field of international cooperation. It 
supported the AgencyÂs efforts to guarantee the inalienable right of all members of the international 
community to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It rejected unilateral and discriminatory 
attitudes regarding the nuclear threat. It remained firmly convinced that multilateralism and 
international cooperation needed to be strengthened in order to make progress towards complete 
disarmament. It firmly supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the three fundamental pillars of its 
activities. It supported all steps the Agency was taking to eliminate the threat posed by nuclear 
arsenals, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and possible diversion of radioactive material for such 
ends. It welcomed the return of the DPRK to the NPT and congratulated those who had made it 
possible, especially the PeopleÂs Republic of China. It urged all nuclear-weapon States to begin or 
continue the process of disarmament and, finally, it urged those States that had not yet done so to sign 
and ratify the NPT. 
158. Ms. BRIDGE (New Zealand) said that the non-proliferation regime was facing unprecedented 
challenges. Global security was a global concern. It was therefore imperative that the international 
community work together to agree on and coordinate effective responses to those challenges. The 
Agency had an increasingly vital role in that collective response, working with Member States to 
safeguard and secure nuclear material for exclusively peaceful purposes. The risk of weapons of mass 
destruction falling into the hands of terrorists, or States not fully complying with international treaties, 
was a priority issue. The threat of nuclear terrorism and other malicious acts involving nuclear 
material remained real, transnational and multifaceted. New Zealand therefore welcomed the Nuclear 
Security Plan for 2006Â2009 and had demonstrated its support for that area of the AgencyÂs work by 
contributing to the Nuclear Security Fund each year since it had been established, including a 
contribution of NZ $25 000 for 2005. It welcomed the successful outcome of the conference to amend 
the CPPNM in July 2005. The amendments that had been adopted broadened the scope of the 
Convention and made it more effective in guarding against terrorist attacks on nuclear material. 
159. Preventing the spread of nuclear weapons through the implementation of NPT safeguards was a 
fundamental pillar of the AgencyÂs work. New Zealand had been disappointed at the lack of an 
outcome at the 2005 NPT Review Conference. The disarmament commitment given by the 
nuclear-weapon States, and reaffirmed unequivocally at the 2000 NPT Review Conference had to be 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
23 


honoured, just as the non-proliferation objectives of the Treaty had to be adhered to. One of the 13 
practical steps to disarmament agreed that the 2000 NPT Review Conference had been the early entry 
into force of the CTBT. It was disappointing that that had yet to be achieved. 

160. It had been an additional disappointment that the United Nations Summit outcome document 
had failed to include a reference to disarmament and non-proliferation, despite shared concerns in that 
regard. As a result, the road ahead for proponents of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament would 
be challenging. It was therefore important that all States returned to the disarmament and 
non-proliferation regime with renewed vigour. 
161. One of the AgencyÂs key roles was verifying that nuclear material was not being diverted from 
peaceful uses. The Director General should have the necessary tools to fulfil that mandate, including 
the additional protocol. The additional protocol was the contemporary verification standard and should 
be a condition of nuclear supply. She urged those States that had not yet done so to conclude an 
additional protocol as soon as possible. New Zealand welcomed both the BoardÂs decision to modify 
SQPs in order to address the weakness identified in the safeguards system, and the AgencyÂs offer of 
assistance to SQP States with the implementation of that decision. 
162. Her country was concerned that the Agency had been unable to reach any conclusions regarding 
the DPRKÂs nuclear activities. The DPRKÂs withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, and its declaration that 
it possessed nuclear weapons, had created a serious challenge to the non-proliferation regime and the 
stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region. She welcomed the agreement that had been reached at 
the six-party talks in Beijing, in particular the DPRKÂs commitment to abandon all nuclear weapons 
and existing nuclear programmes and to return to the NPT and Agency safeguards at an early date. She 
encouraged all parties to work to ensure that the opportunity created by those talks would produce an 
enduring and comprehensive outcome. 
163. New Zealand recognized IranÂs right, under Article IV of the NPT, to develop nuclear energy 
for peaceful purposes in conformity with Article II. At the same time, it supported the BoardÂs 
resolutions that had called on Iran to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as a 
voluntary confidence-building measure, which was essential to addressing outstanding questions 
relating to IranÂs nuclear programme. Iran needed to demonstrate additional transparency, beyond its 
legal obligations, in order to assist the verification of its nuclear programme and address the 
confidence deficit. The BoardÂs resolution of 24 September 2005 had given Iran more time before its 
non-compliance was reported to the Security Council. She called on Iran to cooperate with the Agency 
in a fully transparent manner, to respect all its commitments, and to continue negotiations on 
long-term arrangements. 
164. Nuclear safety was another important pillar of the AgencyÂs work. New Zealand was committed 
to the principles and objectives of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
165. The safety of transport of radioactive material was of considerable importance to her country. 
Large shipments of spent fuel and radioactive waste were shipped past New Zealand and it was 
essential that adequate safety measures were in place to prevent accidents or incidents, or to protect 
the population of New Zealand should such an event occur. In that regard, she welcomed the TranSAS 
mission to Japan scheduled for December 2005. Since shipments past New Zealand were primarily 
between Japan and Europe, her country welcomed JapanÂs willingness to accept that mission. 
166. At the 2005 United Nations Summit, leaders had agreed that States should maintain dialogue 
and consultations, in particular under the auspices of the Agency and the International Maritime 
Organization with the aim of improving mutual understanding, confidence building, and enhanced 
communications in relation to the safe maritime transport of radioactive material. In that connection,

24 


progress had been made on two issues of particular concern. INLEX had been working on clarifying 
the application and scope of the existing liability regime and any serious gaps, and her country looked 
forward to the continuation of its work. Countries in the region remained concerned about the 
possibility of an incident that could cause serious environmental damage and, even without an actual 
release of radiation, significant economic loss. It was important that innocent victims, such as New 
Zealand or other coastal States with no nuclear industries, were not left to bear any such loss. Any 
effective global liability regime should therefore cover the provision of adequate compensation in such 
a situation. 

167. It was also important, given the potential harm that might be sustained should there be an 
incident involving a vessel carrying radioactive material, that coastal States were provided with 
adequate advance information concerning such shipments. Such information exchange could 
contribute toward the safety of such shipments and the effectiveness and timeliness of any response to 
an incident. Informal discussions had been held between coastal States and shipping States in 
July 2005, with Agency involvement, to build confidence and a better understanding of each otherÂs 
concerns, and to explore how those communication issues could be taken forward and procedures for 
the exchange of information improved. It had been agreed that those discussions would continue and 
she expressed the hope that States might work towards an understanding of future practice which met 
the concerns of both sides. 
168. As a strong supporter of the NPT, New Zealand supported the principle that States should have 
access to nuclear technology for peaceful uses, in conformity with Article II of the Treaty, in particular 
the many civilian applications not related to nuclear power generation which could enhance the lives 
of millions of people worldwide. New Zealand had rejected the use of nuclear power and did not 
believe that nuclear power was compatible with the concept of sustainable development, given the 
long-term financial and ecological costs and the problems associated with the disposal of nuclear 
waste. It was aware of its commitment under the AgencyÂs Statute to support all pillars of the 
AgencyÂs mandate. However, there was currently no mechanism available to ensure that any 
contribution to the AgencyÂs main technical cooperation programme did not go towards projects 
which promoted the use of nuclear power as an energy option. Therefore New Zealand had contributed 
instead to specific extrabudgetary technical cooperation projects. Building on its first-time 
contribution to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in support of malaria research in 2004, 
New Zealand had made a contribution to PACT in 2005. That project would help developing countries 
gain access to radiotherapy equipment and address all aspects of cancer control. 
169. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland) expressed regret that the States party to the NPT had been 
unable to agree on how to strengthen implementation of the Treaty at the recent NPT Review 
Conference in New York. That lack of substantive agreement was even more disappointing given the 
urgent challenges the world was facing. An international and universal nuclear non-proliferation 
regime supported by a strong international safeguards system that required States to account for and 
control nuclear material was an essential basis for universal efforts to pursue nuclear disarmament and 
maintain collective security. The Agency was an integral part of that system, playing a vital role in 
verifying non-proliferation commitments. The universal adoption and implementation of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols was a prerequisite for a credible and 
effective safeguards system. Poland had nearly completed ratification of the trilateral safeguards 
agreement and additional protocol it had been obliged to conclude on its accession to the European 
Union, replacing the former bilateral agreement and protocol. 
170. His country was proud to have contributed to the adoption by the Board in September of the 
Director GeneralÂs proposals for strengthening safeguards implementation in States with SQPs and he 
called upon all States concerned to conduct exchanges of letters with the Agency as soon as possible 
to implement that decision.

171. Poland was committed to the entry into force of the CTBT, had ratified the Treaty and was 
confident that the regular conferences to facilitate the entry into force of the Treaty would contribute 
to the completion of that process. 
172. Challenges to the global security environment had continued to dominate the international 
agenda over the preceding year. In seeking ways to improve safety and security, it was imperative that 
the international community present a united front and work together for nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament. The Agency constituted a central point in the chain of collective response, working with 
Member States to safeguard and secure nuclear material for exclusively peaceful purposes and making 
a significant contribution to efforts to guard against nuclear terrorism. One such contribution had been 
the adoption of the amendment to the CPPNM in July, widening the scope of the Convention and 
making it more universal. Poland had been one of 25 co-authors of the basic proposal prepared for the 
conference and it had already started the internal ratification procedure for the amendment. It hoped 
that other States party to the Convention had done the same. It had also supported the adoption by the 
United Nations of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and 
had signed it in New York in the middle of September. Another activity which underlined the need to 
maintain the highest safety and security conditions for high-risk nuclear and other radioactive material 
was the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Within the framework of that initiative, Poland would try 
to replace the fuel in its nuclear research reactor with low-enriched fuel. 
173. A key nuclear security initiative was the Nuclear Security Fund, which had been established to 
expand and build upon the AgencyÂs activities to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism. He was glad 
to report that Poland, in addition to its in-kind contribution to support the organization of the national 
training course for Polish border guards and customs officers, had recently made a financial 
contribution to the Fund. He thanked the Agency for its assistance with the above-mentioned course. 
174. Nuclear security was closely linked to nuclear safety. International legal instruments like the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management were key components of the global nuclear safety 
regime. Poland, a Contracting Party to all the international legal instruments developed under the 
auspices of the Agency in that field, was fully convinced of their importance and their essential role in 
keeping nuclear facilities and materials safe and secure. The review mechanisms of both Conventions 
constituted an essential factor mobilizing and stimulating progress in the field of nuclear safety in the 
world. His country also strongly supported the non-binding executive tools developed by the Agency 
to strengthen nuclear and radiation safety, such as internationally agreed safety standards, action plans 
and codes of conduct, in particular the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. In August, Poland had officially 
informed the Agency of its full support for and its decision to follow the provisions contained in the 
first-mentioned Code and the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. It also 
appreciated the progress made on the safety of transport of radioactive material and welcomed the 
strengthening of international response to nuclear and radiological emergencies. The AgencyÂs role in 
education and training initiatives in that area also could not be ignored. 
175. A high level of nuclear security and nuclear and radiation safety was being achieved not only on 
the basis of properly implemented international treaties and conventions and well-established 
governmental structures and competent national regulatory bodies, but also via regional cooperation in 
the field. That very week, on behalf of the Polish Government, he had signed an agreement with the 
Czech Republic on early notification of a nuclear accident and on cooperation in the field of nuclear 
safety and radiological protection. Similar high-level intergovernmental agreements had been signed 
and implemented with PolandÂs other neighbours, apart from Germany, thus creating an important 
safety and cooperation system in the region which enhanced significantly both the safety and the

26 


confidence of those countriesÂ populations with regard to nuclear power and other nuclear 
technologies. 

176. The role of the Agency in ensuring global nuclear peace could not be overestimated. However, 
the Agency had traditionally been a source of new ideas and initiatives in various applications of 
nuclear technology in such areas as medicine, human nutrition, agriculture or hydrology, and even in 
pure science. He expressed the hope that the Agency would pursue its activities in that field and 
further develop that part of its mission, which was so essential especially for less developed Member 
States. 
177. The ageing of the workforce in the nuclear sector was a serious concern for many Member 
States, including countries without nuclear power like Poland. However, the development of nuclear 
power was under consideration in Poland. It therefore found all activities relating to nuclear 
knowledge management, whether carried out or coordinated by the Agency, worth supporting. Sharing 
experience among Member States and establishing regional programmes played an essential role. He 
commended the Agency for its plans in that area, which consisted of expanding educational network 
and training opportunities, providing more comprehensive guidance to Member States on the 
establishment of nuclear knowledge management programmes and increasing the scope and 
accessibility of information provided. 
178. Particularly thanks to regional cooperation programmes, of which the European region provided 
a good and very successful example, the Agency had made considerable progress toward increasing 
the effectiveness and efficiency of its technical cooperation programme, which had established itself 
as a well-functioning mechanism for the transfer of nuclear technology to developing Member States. 
Poland, like other new members of the European Union, was still very interested in continuing its 
participation in that programme, both at national and regional level. It had signed a CPF in June. That 
tool, and the new Programme Cycle Management Framework, should facilitate programme planning 
and implementation. He thanked the Agency and the Russian Federation for providing Poland with the 
nuclear fuel for its research reactor. His country was aware of the importance of the TCF and pledged 
and paid its contribution every year on time and in full. 
179. Finally, he underscored the importance for the AgencyÂs proper functioning of Member States 
ratifying the amendment to Article XIV.A of the Statute. Poland had already done so. 
180. Mr. MOREJÃN-ALMEIDA (Ecuador) said that his country shared the general perception of the 
AgencyÂs important role in the control of nuclear material and highly radioactive sources and in the 
transfer of nuclear technology. For that reason, it had attached great importance to participating in the 
conference held in Vienna in July 2005 to consider and approve amendments to the CPPNM aimed at 
strengthening the existing legal framework and preventing and combating related offences. The 
international community had a shared responsibility when it came to controlling nuclear and 
radioactive material and preventing it from becoming a threat to collective security. His country 
welcomed the steps taken to establish a legal framework in that regard based on the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of Nuclear Accident or Radiological 
Emergency and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. It also welcomed the progress made with respect to the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors, the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources and other recently developed safety standards. 
181. Notwithstanding the deplorable acts of terrorism in a number of Member States in the past five 
years, it was the duty of all countries to work to promote peaceful coexistence and the international 
principles of equality and human solidarity. Multilateralism was the only possible option in 
international relations. Ecuador had recently concluded an agreement with the Agency to hold a 

GC(49)/OR.6

27 


pan-American meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs on nuclear and radiological security in Quito 
on 3 and 4 April 2006, to seek ways of strengthening the legal framework in the Americas in order to 
develop effective strategies to protect against the improper use of nuclear material. 

182. Any international regime for the safe transport of nuclear material had to make provision for the 
principle of liability in the event of an accident or an incident for harm to human health and the 
environment and for economic loss. Transparent and smooth communications between States on the 
movement of radioactive material, especially by sea, was also important. New mechanisms for 
dialogue with shipping States should be promoted and the AgencyÂs monitoring role should be 
strengthened. 
183. His country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs verification and safeguards activities and 
had worked actively on strengthening the safeguards system. In that connection, SQPs, which were a 
weakness in the safeguards system, should be amended to eliminate existing limitations. 
184. All States party to the NPT had an inalienable right to develop research, production and use of 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, provided they complied with their 
obligations stemming from the Treaty in full, with complete transparency and without delay. 
185. Ecuador shared the concerns of many States regarding the need to clarify matters relating to the 
nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The resolution approved by the Board 
on 24 September on the implementation of safeguards in Iran aimed at strengthening the BoardÂs 
decisions on that issue. His country was convinced that the dialogue pursuant to the Paris agreement 
would resume soon, so that a negotiated solution could be reached. It urged Iran to contribute 
positively to the objectives of transparency and confidence-building so that it could soon receive the 
benefits of nuclear power under terms established in the negotiations and in keeping with 
non-proliferation objectives. 
186. His country welcomed the agreement reached in Beijing in the six-party talks. It hoped that a 
definitive comprehensive settlement could be reached and that the DPRK would abandon its military 
nuclear programme, return to the NPT regime and accept Agency safeguards. 
187. Ecuador was committed to security, safeguards and verification, but all efforts to establish a 
legal and institutional framework would be in vain without international cooperation on development. 
The Agency made an important contribution in such areas as sustainable development, health, 
nutrition, agriculture, energy, environmental protection, water resources management and the fight 
against poverty and disease, but greater efforts and more resources were needed. 
188. He thanked the Agency for the support it was giving to projects in Ecuador, which were 
contributing to sustainable growth. In the next biennium, Ecuador hoped it would receive significantly 
increased assistance in such priority areas as radiological safety, nuclear medicine, applications in the 
petroleum industry, equipment and its maintenance, and training. 
189. His country had made every effort to meet its NPCs on time and to pay off its arrears to the 
technical cooperation programme and the Regular Budget. It had contributed $150 000 to the TCF for 
a project in the area of health care and the fight against cancer. 
190. The Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission was working to bring national legislation on the 
handling of radioactive material into line with Agency standards and to strengthen its regulatory 
capacity in such areas as radiological protection, security, safe transport of material and sources, and 
the management of radioactive waste. Those initiatives clearly demonstrated EcuadorÂs commitment 
to all Agency activities, which should be taken into account when approving cooperation projects for 
the next biennium.

191. Mr. BALZAN (Malta), noting the many challenges the international community was facing, 
said that the NPT remained the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime, with 
disarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy at its foundation. It was 
therefore regrettable that the 2005 NPT Review Conference had been unable to achieve the desired 
outcome. Malta fully subscribed to the need for a strong system of international safeguards to promote 
collective security. To that end, the Government of Malta had signed and ratified an additional 
protocol to its safeguards agreement in July 2005. It encouraged States that had not yet done so to 
conclude safeguards agreements and additional protocols. 
192. At a time when the international community had intensified its efforts to combat the scourge of 
terrorism, including nuclear terrorism, the role of the Agency in promoting nuclear safety and security 
had assumed greater importance. Efforts to strengthen the physical protection of nuclear material, in 
particular through the successful conference to amend the CPPNM, were most welcome. The 
Government of Malta had been one of the first countries to sign the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in September 2005. With the continued support, enhanced 
cooperation and goodwill of its Member States, the Agency should continue to make its vital 
contribution to international peace and security. 
193. He had listened with attention to the statement made by the Director General on the Agency's 
achievements in the preceding year. In that statement, he had emphasized, inter alia, the AgencyÂs 
concerted efforts to develop non-power nuclear applications related to human health, agriculture and 
the environment. That was of particular interest to countries such as Malta that did not use nuclear 
power. 
194. Thanks to the support and cooperation it had received from the Agency, Malta had enacted the 
necessary legislation on radiation protection and nuclear safety and had established a national 
regulatory authority, the Radiation Protection Board. 
195. As a small island state with limited natural resources, investment in human resources 
constituted a vital dimension of the countryÂs economic and social development. The assistance Malta 
was receiving from the Agency in the field of medical uses of radiation, environmental protection, 
strengthening of regulatory capabilities, preservation of cultural heritage and national preparedness in 
the event of a radiological accident were most welcome additions to that investment. 
196. Malta was participating in a number of national and regional projects within the framework of 
the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. Those activities provided excellent opportunities for a 
number of dedicated personnel to participate in training courses as well as in international conferences 
related to their professional work. 
197. Malta noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the effectiveness of the technical 
cooperation programme through greater dialogue with Member States and higher quality projects. 
Increased cooperation with other institutions would also contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of 
technical cooperation programmes. In that connection, he mentioned the Mediterranean initiative 
which had been proposed by Malta and had received support from a substantial number of 
Mediterranean States. Under that initiative, a programme of activities had been developed aimed at 
assisting Member States to coordinate at regional level national activities for the assessment of 
radionuclides in the marine environment, application of tracer techniques to environmental pollution 
assessment, preservation of cultural heritage and strengthening of national capabilities in radiation, 
waste and transport safety in the Mediterranean region. 
198. Mr. KODAH (Jordan) said that the AgencyÂs achievements in harnessing the potential of 
nuclear energy and radiation technology for the benefit of the individual, society and the environment 
had allayed the fears generated by nuclear energy and led to the use of nuclear technology in such key 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
29 


areas as water resources management, agricultural and industrial production, health care, combating 
desertification, desalination of seawater, and electricity generation. 

199. Jordan made a point of paying all its contributions both to the Regular Budget and to the TCF. It 
also hosted regional activities organized by the Agency to the extent that its resources permitted. 
200. His country was implementing a large number of national projects in cooperation with the 
Agency in the areas of nuclear medicine, agricultural pest control and yield enhancement, and training 
of human resources in the use of radioactive sources and in radiation safety and security. It was also 
involved in regional projects aimed at strengthening the infrastructure for radiation protection and the 
safety and security of radioactive sources. 
201. Under its regulatory programme, Jordan had established an independent task force and had 
provided it with the requisite equipment and facilities. It had enacted legislation regulating the use of 
nuclear energy and radiation technology and had promulgated regulations and guidelines on radiation 
protection, transport safety, waste management and the safety and security of radioactive sources 
based on Agency safety standards and the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources. 
202. The comprehensive safeguards regime was a main pillar of the AgencyÂs work and the 
cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, which enjoyed virtually universal support. He 
commended States that had signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency and urged 
those which had not yet done so to remedy the omission. His own country had consistently honoured 
its obligations in that regard. Jordan attached great importance to the application of safeguards to all 
nuclear activities in the Middle East, since the Agency was the sole authority capable of providing 
assurances regarding compliance with safeguards agreements in the region. His Government was of 
the view that Israel should accede to the NPT and sign and implement a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and additional protocol with the Agency. Jordan had always expressed strong support for 
the creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East in order to build mutual 
confidence and achieve peace, stability and development in the region and the world as a whole. 
203. Mr. LEKUNI (Botswana) said that his country believed in the peaceful uses of atomic energy 
for all mankind and would uphold the principles of the NPT safeguards regime, including the 
additional protocol. Efforts by any nation or group to divert atomic energy to military uses, whether 
directly or indirectly, should be discouraged at all costs. 
204. Since becoming a Member State in January 2002, Botswana had continued to pursue efforts 
aimed at meeting its obligations in that regard. It had become abundantly clear that, in the face of 
natural calamities, diseases, security threats and economic downturns, the AgencyÂs programmes were 
increasingly being recognized as providing viable and sustainable solutions. The peaceful application 
of nuclear technology provided a glimmer of hope in the face of those increasing hardships, especially 
where it could provide solutions in the area of agricultural production to reduce or eliminate hunger 
and poverty, where it could improve health care or provide access to safe drinking water, or where it 
could be used in industrial development or environmental protection. 
205. The Government of Botswana was anxious to fulfil its obligations. Efforts to establish a 
legislative framework and regulatory infrastructure were at an advanced stage, with a draft atomic 
energy bill ready for submission to the cabinet and parliament for approval. Furthermore, the 
Government had approved appropriate resources, including staff, to ensure the regulatory bodyÂs 
effective establishment. 
206. The cabinet had also approved the signing of an NPT safeguards agreement and additional 
protocol with the Agency, although the date for the signing had yet to be set, and Botswana was ready 

GC(49)/OR.6 
28 
September 
2005, 
Page 
30 


to sign the Revised Supplementary Agreement Concerning the Provision of Technical Assistance by 
the IAEA. 

207. BotswanaÂs Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology continued to register all 
radioactive sources and generators in the country. Site inspections, albeit on a smaller scale, had begun 
to assess compliance with the Basic Safety Standards. The Agency had provided purposeful and 
invaluable support in the form of expert advice and staff training, for which his country was grateful. 
There was still, however, much to be done to meet the milestones set by the Agency. 
208. The agricultural sector in Botswana could contribute significantly to addressing the crucial 
development challenges of food security, poverty alleviation, employment creation, economic 
diversification and environmental management. Agriculture currently provided approximately 20% of 
the employment within the country and most of the population depended on the sector for their 
livelihood. The Government of Botswana therefore attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programmes aimed at increasing agricultural production using nuclear science 
and technology. Potential areas of cooperation included, but were not limited to, plant pest control 
using the SIT, improvement of crop yield through induced mutation and nutrient uptake, improving 
the productivity of livestock with respect to both milk and meat using assisted reproduction techniques 
such as artificial insemination and multiple ovulation, and improved diagnosis of animal diseases. 
209. Botswana continued to experience difficulties in establishing facilities for brachytherapy, 
largely owing to a lack of functional infrastructure. Thus, patients were still sent to treatment facilities 
outside the country, which involved financial hardship and compromised patient comfort and 
well-being. There was also a lack of diagnostic equipment to detect metastases. His country hoped that 
the Agency would continue to provide expert advice and assistance in that regard. 
210. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continued to create untold hardships in BotswanaÂs health care 
system. Efforts were therefore under way to carry out research using stable isotopes, with the 
AgencyÂs assistance, on food and nutrition intervention techniques. It was hoped that would provide 
crucial information on the effectiveness of food baskets and feeding programmes, facilitating 
HIV/AIDS management. 
211. In conclusion he expressed sincere gratitude to the Agency for its continued support and 
assistance and reaffirmed BotswanaÂs support for the AgencyÂs ideals and objectives and its readiness 
to cooperate with the organization in every possible way. 
212. Mr. ZHANTIKIN (Kazakhstan) said that the events of the preceding year had once again 
demonstrated the complexity of creating an atmosphere of mutual trust in the world. 
213. The NPT was the key instrument of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the successful 
implementation of its provisions had stimulated the further development of international control 
regimes for other types of weapons of mass destruction. It was therefore very important to maintain 
the effectiveness of the NPT and all measures aimed at strengthening the regime for the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. First and foremost, that meant absolute compliance with the 
obligations assumed by all parties to the NPT. 
214. Kazakhstan was an active participant in practically all of the initiatives to reduce the nuclear 
threat: the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, 
the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. It had also recently 
signed the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism at the United 
Nations General Assembly in New York.

215. His country was taking measures to strengthen radiation control at its borders and to improve 
further the system for combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. It fully 
supported Security Council resolution 1540. 
216. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources understood the danger of high-enriched material 
and had adopted a five-year programme to convert the WWR-K research reactor to low-enriched 
nuclear fuel. Work was continuing on the safe decommissioning of the BN-350 fast breeder reactor at 
Aktau. At the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk, work had begun to blend down highly 
enriched uranium. A production line launch ceremony would be held there the following month. 
217. Kazakhstan had begun implementing the provisions of the new Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources. Projects were being successfully implemented on strengthening 
the system for control of ionizing radiation sources and on the safe and secure management of 
high-power sources. Instruments had been prepared for the creation of a national register of ionizing 
radiation sources and an inventory was being taken of radioactive sources in the country. Kazakhstan 
was grateful for the support and effective assistance of the Agency and of the countries participating in 
those and other similar programmes. 
218. With the support of the Government of Kazakhstan, a nuclear technology company had recently 
been registered in the city of Kurchatov which was to become a base for developing peaceful 
applications of atomic energy, including the development of nuclear power in the country. The 
Government was also supporting large projects such as the construction of a heavy ion accelerator in 
Astana and a materials science research tokamak. Both projects had reached the stage of manufacture 
and assembly of the main equipment. In Almaty, a large nuclear medicine centre was being planned. 
Its construction was also being supported by the Government. 
219. Kazakhstan recognized every countryÂs right to develop peaceful nuclear technologies and the 
Agency should provide every possible assistance with such activities in accordance with its Statute. 
Ways needed be found to solve conflict situations that had recently arisen which, without infringing on 
the rights of countries to technological development and access to knowledge, would restore the world 
communityÂs confidence in the peaceful nature of the activities in question. It was a very complex 
task, but the experience of the Agency and its Director General gave room for hope that it could be 
achieved successfully. 
220. His country fully adhered to all generally accepted norms in its export control policy. As a 
member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, it was taking effective measures to fulfil its obligations with 
regard to strengthening of the nuclear weapons non-proliferation regime. A system for combating 
illicit trafficking in nuclear material and technology had been created and was being constantly 
improved upon. At the same time, careful consideration was needed with respect to the introduction of 
new restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology in order not to create unreasonable barriers to 
the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
221. Mr. ESTEVES DOS SANTOS (ABACC) said that 2005 had marked the 20th anniversary of the 
Declaration of IguaÃ§u, when the Presidents of Argentina and Brazil had declared their understanding 
that nuclear technology and science would play a fundamental role in the economic and social 
development of both countries. In that spirit, in 1985, the Governments of Argentina and Brazil had 
taken many decisions aimed at integration, including setting up a working group to analyse and 
evaluate both countriesÂ nuclear programmes, which had laid the bases for the creation of ABACC. A 
number of activities had been carried out in both countries to design a common system of accounting 
for and control of nuclear material as a clear demonstration of transparency. ABACC had been created 
in 1991, the first regional nuclear accounting and control organization in South America. Regional

nuclear organizations were a creative way to address important technical issues while respecting 
cultural and local values and not losing sight of the ultimate objective of nuclear control. 

222. It was 14 years since ABACC had been created, the culmination of a long historical process of 
confidence building and the forging of a strategic alliance between Argentina and Brazil in the nuclear 
sector. Since that time, many efforts had been undertaken to develop a safeguards organization with 
international credibility in the non-proliferation field. ABACCÂs activities included the verification of 
the completeness and correctness of the nuclear inventories of both countries, the development of a 
unique safeguards approach for sensitive uranium enrichment facilities, the training of highly qualified 
staff, the implementation of joint procedures with the Agency for equipment use and inspection, 
participation in most international technical groups on non-proliferation and safeguards, and the 
implementation of safeguards approaches for all nuclear installations in both countries. 
223. ABACC had helped to assure the international community that Argentina and Brazil had 
accomplished their non-proliferation goals and that their nuclear programmes were for peaceful 
purposes. Even when ABACC completed the negotiation of the Facility Attachments for all 76 nuclear 
installations in the two countries, its mission would be far from complete. The implementation of 
safeguards was a long path, the most important part of which was to keep all facilities safeguarded. 
Over the period 2004Â2005, all nuclear material and other items placed under safeguards in Argentina 
and Brazil had been used exclusively for peaceful purposes or had been appropriately accounted for. 
ABACC had found no indication of the existence of undeclared nuclear material in either country. 
224. With regard to its technical activities, ABACC had recently been focusing on the safeguards 
approach for the first commercial uranium enrichment plant in Brazil. That safeguards approach had 
been the fruit of a partnership between ABACC, the Agency and the National Nuclear Energy 
Commission of Brazil. Originally, the approach had been based on permanent perimeter control 
employing containment and surveillance techniques. Later, it had evolved into a more pragmatic 
concept based on the same principle as the so-called Hexapartite Project, with improvements in 
surveillance and containment at certain points in the plant. Furthermore, a unique implementation of 
design information verification methodology gave the Agency and ABACC tools to meet their 
obligations. The main idea behind the safeguards approach had been to apply effective safeguards 
while at the same time protecting the technological secrets of the facility. The protection of such 
secrets was an important goal to be pursued in the non-proliferation field. 
225. In Argentina, ABACC had updated and installed new and important surveillance and 
containment systems which allowed for more efficient inspection. The updating and enhancement of 
verification equipment was essential for effective and efficient safeguards implementation. The 
Agency relied on the contributions of both countries to keep technological instrumentation up to date. 
226. The Governments of Argentina and Brazil had requested that ABACC and the Agency continue 
to pursue coordination as a permanent goal, in order to achieve cost-effectiveness in safeguards 
activities and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort. A common book auditing procedure had been 
officially approved and successfully implemented, and the number of joint inspections and joint 
equipment use procedures had increased. 
227. With regard to information technology and training, ABACC and the Agency had initiated a 
number of activities during the preceding three years to improve safe communication. Measures had 
been taken to increase and reinforce the security of safeguards information on electronic media. The 
use of encrypted data transmission between both organizations had been successfully implemented in 
some areas and was expected to be enhanced in the near future. 
228. The implementation of effective safeguards required well trained personnel. Thus, ABACC 
continued to promote training events, support workshops on intercomparison of data, and encourage

33 


the participation of its officials in the most important safeguards events. Ongoing training was an 
essential tool for good safeguards application. 

229. Owing to the growing discussions of non-proliferation issues in the media, it was necessary to 
provide better information to the public about ABACCÂs activities. For that reason, ABACC had 
improved its website. As well as presenting the history of the organization, it provided information on 
safeguards and links to the most important organizations in the nuclear field. The ABACC news 
bulletin had been modernized, which was an additional source of safeguards and non-proliferation 
information for the public. Ongoing education was a way to ensure that new generations were 
informed about nuclear proliferation risks. 
230. In conclusion, he thanked Dr. Elias Palacios, who was leaving ABACC and had contributed 
greatly to the enhancement of the organization, and he wished him well in his new post. ABACC was 
committed to improving the effectiveness of safeguards application, and to the nuclear partnership 
between Argentina and Brazil.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(continued) 
(GC(49)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
NIEUWENHUYS 
(Belgium) 
said 
that 
recent 
years 
had 
been 
marked 
by 
major 
challenges 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
which 
demonstrated 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT. 
His 
country 
had 
shown 
full 
support 
for 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
all 
its 
provisions, 
whether 
they 
related 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
or 
to 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
He 
regretted 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
achieve 
a 
substantive 
final 
document, 
and 
was 
disappointed 
that 
the 
very 
real 
challenges 
concerning 
non-proliferation 
and 
arms 
control 
had 
not 
been 
broached 
in 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
World 
Summit 
of 
September 
2005. 
In 
the 
name 
of 
the 
efficient 
multilateralism 
that 
his 
country 
promoted, 
the 
Agency's 
authority 
in 
its 
areas 
of 
competence 
should 
be 
confirmed. 
2. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
tool 
in 
preventing 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
Belgium 
urged 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
conclude 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
implement 
safeguards 
agreements, 
as 
they 
were 
obliged 
to 
do 
by 
joining 
the 
NPT. 
The 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
adopted 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
more 
than 
eight 
years 
previously, 
but 
it 
was 
still 
not 
applicable 
in 
a 
large 
number 
of 
States. 
For 
the 
Belgian 
Government, 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
constituted 
the 
current 
verification 
standard. 
3. 
Belgium 
welcomed 
the 
decision2 
taken 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
SQPs, 
which 
promised 
to 
overcome 
a 
weakness 
in 
the 
current 
safeguards 
system. 
Belgium 
called 
on 
all 
States 
having 
such 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
proceed 
to 
an 
exchange 
of 
letters 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
so 
as 
to 
implement 
the 
standardized 
text 
and 
modified 
criteria. 
4. 
Belgium 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
upcoming 
first 
meeting 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
and 
would 
participate 
actively 
and 
constructively 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Committee, 
which 
he 
trusted 
would 
help 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
to 
respond 
to 
challenges 
related 
to 
verifying 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
take 
into 
account 
in 
a 
realistic 
manner 
the 
needs 
to 
be 
met, 
the 
progress 
already 
made 
and 
the 
work 
which 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
5. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
expert 
group 
report 
on 
Multilateral 
Approaches 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Cycle 
reproduced 
in 
document 
INFCIRC/640, 
the 
Belgian 
Government 
believed 
that 
further 
discussions 
open 
to 
all 
States 
concerned 
should 
consider 
how 
such 
approaches 
could 
contribute 
effectively 
to 
strengthening 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
6. 
Non-traditional 
security 
problems, 
the 
most 
prominent 
of 
which 
was 
international 
terrorism, 
had 
increased 
in 
number 
over 
the 
preceding 
years. 
The 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
required 
an 
adequate 
response. 
In 
that 
context, 
Belgium 
welcomed 
the 
unanimous 
adoption 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
was 
preparing 
its 
ratification.

7. 
Belgium 
had 
participated 
in 
a 
constructive 
way 
in 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
CPPNM. 
The 
Government 
would 
submit 
the 
amendment 
to 
Parliament 
for 
ratification 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
would 
establish 
the 
necessary 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
frameworks. 
The 
amended 
Convention 
would 
make 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
and 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
8. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
problems 
posed 
by 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
ambitions, 
Belgium 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
made 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
the 
progress 
that 
had 
been 
achieved 
already. 
The 
implementation 
of 
all 
the 
measures 
announced 
would 
contribute 
to 
normalizing 
the 
DPRKÂs 
status 
within 
the 
Agency 
and 
beyond. 
ChinaÂs 
key 
role 
in 
the 
progress 
was 
appreciated. 
9. 
Nuclear 
developments 
in 
Iran 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
concern 
and 
the 
Agency's 
operational 
and 
specific 
work 
in 
that 
area 
remained 
essential. 
Belgium 
believed 
that 
the 
principal 
merit 
of 
the 
resolution3 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
on 
24 
September 
2005 
was 
that 
it 
confirmed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
authority 
in 
that 
regard. 
Belgium 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
the 
resolution, 
and 
on 
Iran 
to 
take 
the 
opportunity 
to 
respond 
favourably 
to 
the 
appeals 
made 
by 
the 
international 
community 
through 
that 
Board 
resolution 
and 
others. 
A 
return 
to 
full 
suspension 
of 
all 
enrichment-
related 
activities, 
including 
conversion 
and 
processing, 
was 
required 
as 
an 
essential 
confidence-
building 
measure, 
and 
long-term 
arrangements 
needed 
to 
be 
sought. 
Belgium 
wished 
to 
underline 
the 
importance, 
broad 
scope 
and 
progressive 
nature 
of 
the 
proposals 
that 
had 
been 
made 
to 
Iran 
through 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
and 
it 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
resume 
dialogue 
and 
negotiations 
as 
foreseen 
in 
the 
Paris 
Agreement4 
. 
10. 
IranÂs 
compliance 
with 
its 
international 
safeguards 
obligations 
concerned 
all 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
equally. 
The 
content 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
last 
report5 
on 
the 
matter 
left 
Member 
States 
with 
shared 
responsibilities. 
Was 
not 
the 
central 
issue 
of 
the 
debate 
in 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
how 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
honouring 
of 
commitments 
when 
trust 
in 
the 
willingness 
to 
honour 
them 
had 
been 
compromised? 
The 
importance 
of 
that 
issue 
was 
obvious. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
therefore 
be 
able 
to 
act 
in 
the 
matter 
on 
the 
political 
and 
legal 
levels. 
11. 
The 
development 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
the 
atom 
implied 
for 
each 
State 
the 
absolute 
obligation 
to 
protect 
its 
people 
and 
the 
environment 
from 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
radioactive 
contamination 
risks. 
The 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Convention, 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
contributed 
greatly 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
safety 
culture 
everywhere 
in 
the 
world, 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
safety 
in 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
that 
safety 
at 
a 
high 
level. 
12. 
The 
Belgian 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
was 
continuing 
its 
nuclear 
safety 
related 
activities 
and 
its 
work 
on 
the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Several 
contracts 
and 
agreements 
for 
international 
collaboration 
had 
been 
signed. 
13. 
The 
research 
and 
development 
programme, 
principally 
the 
BR2 
reactor 
and 
the 
HADES 
underground 
research 
facility, 
had 
been 
operating 
successfully. 
Attention 
had 
been 
given 
to 
research 
into 
transmutation 
by 
an 
accelerator-driven 
subcritical 
system 
Â 
the 
MYRRHA 
project. 
14. 
The 
integration 
of 
social 
aspects, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
participation 
of 
citizens 
in 
making 
decisions 
related 
to 
nuclear 
matters, 
were 
being 
examined 
in 
close 
collaboration 
with 
universities 
and 
concerned 
parties.

15. 
Since 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
the 
Belgian 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
had 
been 
designated 
by 
the 
Agency 
as 
a 
collaborating 
centre. 
Belgium 
much 
appreciated 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
CentreÂs 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme. 
16. 
Nuclear 
technology 
helped 
to 
save 
thousands 
of 
lives 
daily, 
through 
medical 
diagnoses 
and 
treatment. 
It 
also 
provided 
a 
basis 
for 
industrial 
applications, 
improving 
the 
quality 
and 
reliability 
of 
products 
and 
services 
and 
contributing 
to 
the 
sustainable 
development 
and 
prosperity 
of 
humanity. 
Industrial 
isotopes 
occupied 
an 
essential 
niche 
in 
modern 
technology. 
Belgium 
was 
a 
major 
producer 
of 
radioisotopes 
for 
medical 
and 
industrial 
uses. 
The 
decreasing 
number 
of 
research 
reactors 
available 
to 
produce 
isotopes 
was 
a 
cause 
for 
concern. 
In 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
future 
benefits 
for 
society 
of 
medical 
and 
industrial 
radioisotopes, 
Belgium 
was 
looking 
at 
the 
potential 
of 
a 
regional 
approach 
for 
the 
production 
and 
supply 
of 
radioisotopes 
in 
a 
multilateral 
or 
international 
context. 
17. 
Mr. 
ABDOULAHI 
(Niger) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
recently 
established 
a 
Directorate 
for 
the 
Peaceful 
Use 
of 
Nuclear 
Technology 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Mines 
and 
Energy, 
thereby 
reaffirming 
its 
complete 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
goals 
and 
objectives 
and 
demonstrating 
its 
willingness 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
and 
in 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
international 
legal 
framework. 
18. 
His 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
working 
in 
solidarity 
with 
the 
entire 
international 
community 
to 
establish 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity 
in 
the 
world. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
Government 
had 
initiated 
the 
process 
for 
ratification 
of 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention 
and 
acceptance 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
adopted 
on 
8 
July 
2005 
in 
Vienna. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
the 
national 
legal 
framework, 
steps 
to 
accelerate 
NigerÂs 
ratification 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
had 
also 
been 
taken. 
19. 
Niger 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
active 
role 
in 
facilitating 
development 
through 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
energy, 
agriculture 
and 
stockbreeding, 
human 
and 
animal 
health, 
water 
resource 
management, 
the 
environment, 
and 
others. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
results 
obtained 
through 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
20. 
Under 
its 
new 
CPF 
(2003-2007), 
Niger 
had 
opted 
to 
implement 
cooperation 
activities 
related 
to 
the 
national 
anti-poverty 
strategy, 
the 
principal 
areas 
of 
which 
were 
education, 
health, 
water 
and 
sanitation, 
population 
policy 
and 
human 
and 
technical 
capacity-building. 
Niger 
was 
very 
glad 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
responded 
favourably 
to 
the 
requests 
it 
had 
submitted, 
establishing 
six 
national 
projects 
in 
line 
with 
the 
countryÂs 
priority 
needs. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
new 
project 
ideas 
it 
was 
submitting 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
programme 
cycle 
would 
also 
be 
approved. 
21. 
Wishing 
to 
put 
in 
place 
the 
social, 
economic 
and 
environmental 
conditions 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
health 
system 
and 
in 
view 
of 
the 
rapidly 
rising 
incidence 
of 
cancer 
in 
Niger, 
the 
Government 
had 
made 
plans 
to 
establish 
a 
national 
radiotherapy 
capacity 
for 
cancer 
treatment 
by 
setting 
up 
a 
National 
Radiotherapy 
Centre 
at 
Niamey 
which 
would 
provide 
curative 
and 
palliative 
treatment 
for 
all 
radiosensitive 
cancers, 
particularly 
those 
found 
in 
women, 
and 
thus 
improve 
patients' 
quality 
of 
life. 
The 
feasibility 
study 
had 
been 
completed, 
but 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
national 
capacity 
still 
required 
the 
support 
of 
sponsors, 
for 
which 
he 
launched 
a 
solemn 
appeal. 
22. 
Niger 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiation 
safety 
and 
waste 
management, 
especially 
to 
the 
management 
of 
mining 
waste. 
Niger 
was 
committed 
to 
improving 
the 
human 
health 
and 
environmental 
aspects 
of 
its 
mining 
sector. 
It 
was 
also 
interested 
in 
sustainable 
energy 
development, 
specifically 
energy 
planning 
and 
evaluation 
of 
environmental 
impacts.

23. 
Niger 
appreciated 
the 
regional 
programme 
against 
desertification 
but 
would 
wish 
it 
to 
receive 
greater 
attention 
and 
particularly 
more 
financing 
so 
that 
Member 
States 
could 
take 
full 
advantage 
of 
it. 
24. 
Niger 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
considerable 
support 
for 
sustainable 
development, 
notably 
through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
and 
the 
assistance 
provided 
through 
its 
regional 
and 
subregional 
programmes. 
It 
approved 
of 
the 
third 
extension 
of 
AFRA 
for 
2005Â2010 
and 
intended 
to 
participate 
more 
fully 
in 
its 
activities. 
25. 
His 
country 
wished 
to 
revitalize 
its 
national 
infrastructure 
by 
strengthening 
the 
Directorate 
for 
the 
Peaceful 
Use 
of 
Nuclear 
Technology 
and 
the 
National 
Radiation 
Protection 
Centre 
to 
allow 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
be 
used 
in 
a 
safe 
framework. 
26. 
Mr. 
RÃNAKY 
(Hungary), 
after 
welcoming 
Belize 
as 
a 
new 
Member 
State, 
said 
his 
country 
was 
seriously 
concerned 
about 
the 
alarming 
proliferation 
trends 
which 
were 
putting 
the 
multilateral 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
to 
the 
test. 
The 
compliance 
challenges 
of 
recent 
years 
threatened 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
regime. 
HungaryÂs 
efforts 
on 
its 
own 
and 
together 
with 
its 
partners 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
EU 
Strategy 
against 
the 
Proliferation 
of 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
were 
aimed 
at 
upholding 
the 
NPT's 
authority. 
Hungary 
deeply 
regretted 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
failed 
to 
adopt 
a 
substantive 
final 
document 
setting 
out 
measures 
to 
meet 
the 
new 
challenges. 
27. 
Against 
the 
background 
of 
intense 
international 
concerns 
about 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation, 
Hungary 
attributed 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
During 
its 
past 
two 
years 
of 
service 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
Hungary 
had 
advocated 
equipping 
the 
Agency 
with 
new 
tools 
that 
would 
enable 
it 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
verification 
activities 
more 
effectively. 
Hungary 
believed 
that 
the 
additional 
protocol 
represented 
the 
current 
verification 
standard 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
promote 
its 
universalization. 
28. 
The 
adoption 
of 
the 
modified 
SQP 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
a 
major 
weakness 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
Hungary 
was 
also 
ready 
to 
contribute 
actively 
to 
other 
initiatives, 
including 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification, 
and 
it 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
widening 
application 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
It 
had 
been 
among 
the 
first 
countries 
with 
major 
nuclear 
industries 
to 
start 
applying 
the 
new 
system, 
which 
had 
been 
officially 
introduced 
on 
15 
November 
2004, 
making 
Hungary 
the 
first 
Member 
State 
of 
the 
EU 
where 
the 
new 
inspection 
regime 
had 
entered 
into 
force. 
It 
had 
shared 
its 
experience 
in 
that 
field 
with 
experts 
from 
12 
EU 
Member 
States 
during 
a 
three-day 
workshop 
in 
Budapest 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Hungarian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority. 
29. 
Hungary 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
in 
which 
the 
DPRK 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
abandon 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes. 
That 
represented 
a 
major 
positive 
development 
in 
the 
years-long 
pursuit 
of 
the 
Korean 
PeninsulaÂs 
denuclearization. 
He 
hoped 
that 
all 
parties 
would 
expeditiously 
proceed 
to 
honour 
their 
commitments 
under 
the 
agreement. 
30. 
Hungary 
was 
seriously 
concerned 
that 
IranÂs 
policy 
of 
concealment 
over 
an 
extended 
period 
had 
resulted 
in 
non-compliance 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
its 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement. 
It 
strongly 
supported 
the 
steps 
envisaged 
in 
the 
recent 
Board 
of 
Governors 
resolution 
(GOV/2005/77), 
which 
it 
believed 
would 
facilitate 
further 
diplomatic 
efforts 
to 
re-establish 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
character 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
abide 
by 
that 
and 
all 
previous 
relevant 
Board 
resolutions, 
to 
reverse 
its 
decision 
to 
resume 
uranium 
conversion, 
and 
to 
return 
to 
negotiations 
with 
the 
E3/EU 
in 
the 
framework 
established 
by 
the 
Paris 
Agreement.

31. 
In 
the 
aftermath 
of 
terrorist 
attacks 
in 
different 
regions 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
had 
become 
a 
high 
priority. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
coordinating 
international 
efforts 
in 
that 
field 
and 
helping 
Member 
States 
to 
meet 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
physical 
protection. 
32. 
The 
recent 
diplomatic 
conference 
which 
had 
successfully 
amended 
the 
CPPNM 
had 
been 
the 
result 
of 
many 
years 
of 
work 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Hungary 
strongly 
supported 
the 
Austrian 
initiatives 
which 
had 
made 
the 
timely 
convening 
of 
the 
conference 
possible 
and 
welcomed 
the 
amendments 
which 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
and 
would 
serve 
to 
establish 
a 
more 
stringent 
international 
regime 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
33. 
The 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security 
held 
in 
London 
in 
March 
2005 
had 
noted 
that 
nuclear 
terrorism 
was 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
threats 
to 
society 
and 
had 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
leading 
role 
in 
global 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
world 
nuclear 
security 
framework. 
Hungary 
was 
ready 
to 
strengthen 
its 
national 
system 
further 
in 
order 
to 
contribute 
actively 
to 
global 
efforts. 
An 
important 
step 
towards 
strengthening 
the 
global 
legal 
framework 
to 
counter 
the 
terrorist 
threat 
had 
been 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly 
in 
April 
2005. 
He 
was 
proud 
to 
announce 
that 
Hungary 
had 
recently 
signed 
it. 
34. 
The 
Agency 
also 
deserved 
commendation 
for 
having 
organized 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
held 
in 
Bordeaux, 
which 
had 
been 
a 
great 
step 
towards 
improving 
overall 
understanding 
of 
and 
preparation 
against 
the 
risks 
posed 
by 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
case 
of 
malevolent 
use. 
35. 
The 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
had 
addressed 
issues 
of 
great 
importance 
to 
Hungary. 
One 
message 
had 
been 
that 
without 
nuclear 
energy, 
the 
world's 
growing 
demand 
for 
electricity 
would 
be 
much 
less 
likely 
to 
be 
met. 
In 
Hungary, 
it 
was 
uncontested 
that 
the 
security 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
supply 
could 
not 
be 
maintained 
without 
nuclear 
power, 
which 
fortunately 
had 
high 
public 
acceptance, 
but 
it 
was 
not 
unconditional 
and 
would 
need 
to 
continue 
being 
earned. 
36. 
Operational 
safety 
was 
the 
alpha 
and 
omega 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
and 
neither 
licensee 
nor 
regulator 
could 
afford 
to 
take 
it 
for 
granted, 
a 
fact 
of 
which 
Hungary 
had 
been 
reminded 
by 
a 
fuel-
cleaning 
incident 
in 
2003. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
recommendations 
of 
an 
Agency 
expert 
mission 
and 
of 
self-evaluation, 
a 
number 
of 
changes 
had 
been 
made 
at 
the 
Paks 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
at 
HungaryÂs 
regulatory 
body 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
plant 
safety 
and 
improving 
the 
safety 
culture. 
There 
had 
been 
organizational 
changes 
and 
the 
legal 
environment 
had 
been 
modified, 
including 
the 
revision 
of 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
codes 
and 
related 
guidelines. 
Every 
effort 
had 
been 
made 
to 
eliminate 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
2003 
incident. 
After 
considerable 
preparatory 
work 
by 
the 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
evaluation 
by 
the 
regulator, 
a 
licence 
had 
been 
granted 
with 
some 
50 
conditions 
and 
requirements. 
37. 
The 
results 
of 
the 
measures 
taken 
had 
been 
acknowledged 
by 
the 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
by 
the 
very 
successful 
follow-up 
expert 
mission 
conducted 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
2005. 
The 
expert 
team 
had 
determined 
that 
the 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Paks 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
the 
regulatory 
authority 
had 
brought 
tangible 
progress 
and 
concluded 
that 
all 
issues 
were 
either 
fully 
resolved 
or 
progressing 
satisfactorily. 
The 
Hungarian 
Government 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
and 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
achievements, 
while 
remaining 
well 
aware 
that 
complacency 
was 
unfounded. 
38. 
While 
the 
Government 
was 
ready 
to 
provide 
the 
necessary 
political 
support 
for 
ensuring 
the 
long-term 
operation 
of 
the 
plant, 
it 
also 
recognized 
that 
waste 
disposal 
remained 
a 
major 
issue. 
Following 
a 
very 
successful 
referendum 
at 
the 
proposed 
site 
for 
disposal 
of 
low-and 
intermediate-level 
waste 
from 
the 
Paks 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
ParliamentÂs 
preliminary 
approval 
was

awaited 
to 
initiate 
activities 
for 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal 
facility 
there. 
Hungary 
would 
be 
presenting 
a 
more 
detailed 
report 
at 
the 
Second 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
in 
May 
2006, 
at 
which 
it 
hoped 
to 
welcome 
new 
countries 
with 
broad 
experience 
in 
the 
field. 


39. 
Technical 
cooperation, 
one 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
had 
been 
greatly 
enhanced 
in 
Europe 
by 
regular 
consultation 
meetings 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency. 
The 
spirit 
of 
partnership, 
participation 
and 
strong 
personal 
relationships 
between 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
was 
the 
backbone 
of 
successful 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
Europe, 
which 
was 
worth 
mentioning 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
was 
undergoing 
a 
reorganization. 
Hungary 
had 
strongly 
supported 
the 
streamlining 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
while 
also 
underlining 
the 
importance 
of 
stability 
and 
the 
preservation 
of 
past 
values. 
40. 
He 
was 
convinced 
that 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
would 
gradually 
be 
phased 
out 
in 
Europe 
and 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
accordingly 
focus 
mainly 
on 
regional 
cooperation, 
which 
promoted 
the 
self-reliance 
and 
sustainability 
of 
nuclear 
institutions 
as 
well 
as 
encouraging 
mutual 
assistance, 
an 
example 
being 
HungaryÂs 
recent 
offer 
of 
US 
$50 
000 
to 
the 
national 
programmes 
of 
two 
countries 
in 
its 
region. 
41. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
announce 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
decision 
to 
pledge 
its 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006 
in 
an 
amount 
corresponding 
to 
its 
share 
of 
the 
target. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
assistance 
programme 
and 
its 
timely 
implementation, 
Hungary 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
share 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
Mr. 
Skoknic 
(Chile), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


42. 
Mr. 
MIRANDA 
(Bolivia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
belonged 
to 
a 
nuclear-weapons-free 
region 
but, 
in 
seeking 
sustainable 
development 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
its 
population, 
wished 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
It 
accordingly 
endorsed 
the 
phrase 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
motto 
and 
as 
a 
reflection 
of 
its 
objectives. 
It 
also 
attached 
importance 
to 
preserving 
the 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
functions 
while 
using 
all 
available 
media 
to 
increase 
public 
awareness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
its 
different 
areas 
of 
activity. 
43. 
Bolivia 
highly 
valued 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
received 
through 
the 
Agency 
in 
sectors 
which 
were 
important 
for 
its 
peopleÂs 
well-being, 
such 
as 
agriculture, 
water 
treatment, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
safety, 
and 
above 
all 
health. 
He 
thanked 
those 
countries 
that 
contributed 
to 
the 
availability 
of 
appropriate 
techniques 
through 
the 
Agency 
and 
encouraged 
them 
to 
continue 
in 
that 
spirit, 
as 
there 
was 
no 
better 
answer 
to 
conflict 
and 
troubles 
than 
a 
community 
whose 
basic 
needs 
had 
been 
satisfied 
and 
which 
could 
look 
forward 
to 
growth 
and 
equitable 
human 
development. 
44. 
The 
countries 
of 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean, 
including 
Bolivia, 
aware 
that 
they 
must 
take 
the 
initiative 
to 
meet 
their 
own 
needs, 
had 
signed 
the 
ARCAL 
agreement 
more 
than 
twenty 
years 
previously 
with 
a 
view 
to 
cooperating 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
That 
agreement 
had 
been 
of 
benefit 
to 
all 
its 
members. 
Bolivia 
had 
recently 
assumed 
the 
presidency 
of 
ARCAL 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
drawing 
up 
with 
the 
Agency, 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2006, 
an 
action 
plan 
to 
implement 
the 
strategic 
alliance 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
deepen 
the 
traditional 
relationship 
between 
the 
two 
bodies. 
45. 
A 
pioneering 
initiative 
of 
the 
Agency 
which 
Bolivia 
particularly 
welcomed 
was 
PACT, 
for 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
promote 
better 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
cancer 
treatment. 
Bolivia 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
assistance 
in 
that 
regard. 
46. 
Bolivia 
shared 
the 
views 
expressed 
repeatedly 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
regarding 
the 
reformulation 
of 
small 
quantities 
protocols 
to 
improve 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
accordance 
with 
the 
decision 
on 
that 
matter 
taken 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
Bolivia 
awaited 
the 
Secretariat's 
proposals,

hoping 
that 
the 
required 
modifications 
would 
have 
no 
financial 
implications 
for 
Member 
States 
at 
the 
present 
time 
or 
in 
the 
future. 


47. 
U 
Tin 
WIN 
(Myanmar), 
having 
welcomed 
Belize 
to 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency, 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
safeguards, 
nuclear 
radiation 
and 
waste 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
nuclear 
applications 
for 
global 
sustainable 
development. 
48. 
He 
noted 
that 
the 
number 
of 
additional 
protocols 
in 
force 
had 
increased 
from 
41 
in 
2003 
to 
64 
in 
2004, 
including 
19 
States 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
activities, 
while 
the 
number 
of 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
conclude 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
had 
decreased 
from 
45 
to 
40. 
49. 
Myanmar 
had 
signed 
the 
CTBT 
in 
1996, 
and 
at 
the 
Fifth 
ASEAN 
Summit 
held 
in 
Bangkok 
in 
December 
1995 
it 
had 
signed 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zone, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
1997 
and 
was 
aimed 
at 
general 
and 
complete 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
in 
various 
regions 
of 
the 
world 
were 
effective 
measures 
in 
preventing 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
and 
contributing 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
50. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
were 
important 
in 
achieving 
sustainable 
development 
in 
many 
countries, 
as 
nuclear 
techniques 
were 
environment-friendly 
and 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
did 
not 
emit 
pollutants. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
had 
contributed 
in 
Myanmar 
to 
national 
development 
efforts 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
stockbreeding, 
food, 
agriculture 
and 
health. 
51. 
Technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
form 
of 
equipment, 
experts 
and 
training 
ensured 
the 
availability 
of 
nuclear 
medicines, 
radiotherapy, 
nuclear 
diagnostic 
methods 
and 
other 
nuclear 
techniques 
for 
medical 
research 
and 
industry 
in 
Myanmar. 
In 
implementing 
its 
programme 
to 
promote 
and 
develop 
nuclear 
applications, 
Myanmar 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
an 
adequate 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructure 
and 
was 
drawing 
up 
regulations 
for 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
radiation 
and 
atomic 
energy. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
that 
had 
been 
provided 
through 
the 
interregional 
Model 
Projects 
on 
upgrading 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructures 
and 
noted 
that 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2004, 
more 
than 
90 
Member 
States 
had 
been 
participating 
in 
such 
Model 
Projects. 
52. 
All 
developing 
countries 
possessing 
a 
level 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
development 
comparable 
to 
MyanmarÂs 
deserved 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance. 
He 
urged 
the 
Conference, 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
take 
further 
steps 
in 
support 
of 
a 
policy 
of 
prioritizing 
technical 
assistance 
programmes 
in 
less 
developed 
Member 
States. 
53. 
Recalling 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mediating 
role 
in 
regional 
cooperation 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
RCA 
(the 
Agency's 
first 
regional 
agreement), 
AFRA 
and 
ARCAL 
were 
doing 
well 
in 
their 
respective 
regions 
with 
effective 
Agency 
involvement. 
54. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
would 
continue 
in 
their 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
international 
stability 
and 
peace, 
and 
assured 
the 
Agency 
of 
Myanmar's 
continued 
support 
for 
its 
activities. 
55. 
Mr. 
NEZAM 
(Afghanistan) 
said 
that 
of 
the 
many 
challenges 
facing 
the 
Agency, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
was 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
which 
posed 
a 
real 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
was 
therefore 
a 
source 
of 
deep 
concern 
for 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Government 
of 
Afghanistan 
condemned 
any 
attempt 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
non-peaceful 
or 
terrorist 
purposes 
and 
accordingly 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
In 
order 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts, 
Afghanistan 
had 
already 
ratified 
its 
safeguards 
agreement, 
and 
its 
additional 
protocol 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
on 
19 
July 
2005.

56. 
While 
underlining 
the 
importance 
of 
universal 
adhesion 
to 
all 
international 
non-proliferation 
instruments, 
particularly 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field, 
his 
country 
reaffirmed 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes, 
as 
laid 
down 
in 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Respecting 
that 
right 
would 
further 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
as 
well 
as 
allowing 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
make 
its 
essential 
contribution 
to 
development. 
57. 
Over 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
Afghanistan 
had 
undergone 
a 
political 
transformation 
which 
bore 
witness 
to 
the 
courage 
of 
its 
people 
and 
the 
devotion 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
That 
process 
had 
been 
followed 
by 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
new 
constitution 
and 
by 
presidential 
and 
parliamentary 
elections. 
Afghanistan 
had 
also 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
reconstruction. 
Unfortunately 
it 
still 
remained 
one 
of 
the 
poorest 
countries 
in 
the 
world. 
It 
accordingly 
would 
like 
to 
see 
more 
assistance 
given 
to 
the 
least 
developed 
countries, 
so 
as 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
catch 
up 
with 
other 
countries 
in 
terms 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
benefit 
from 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
58. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
major 
component 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
of 
crucial 
importance 
to 
the 
developing 
world. 
Afghanistan 
particularly 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Afghanistan 
was 
conscious 
of 
the 
need 
for 
an 
adequate 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructure 
and 
was 
preparing 
radiation 
protection 
legislation 
that 
would 
give 
it 
efficient 
regulations 
as 
well 
as 
promoting 
nuclear 
technology. 
59. 
Two 
years 
previously, 
active 
cooperation 
had 
begun 
between 
Afghanistan 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
including 
training 
programmes 
and 
international 
conferences 
related 
to 
different 
professional 
activities. 
The 
collaboration 
helped 
Afghanistan 
to 
acquire 
expertise 
and 
enabled 
it 
to 
use 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
its 
development 
strategy 
to 
fight 
poverty. 
To 
that 
end, 
Afghanistan 
had 
established 
priorities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiotherapy, 
agriculture 
and 
isotope 
hydrology. 
60. 
For 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle, 
his 
Government 
envisaged 
integrating 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
the 
health 
sector, 
specifically 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine. 
Particular 
attention 
would 
also 
be 
paid 
to 
agriculture, 
through 
projects 
on 
soil 
fertility 
and 
increasing 
agricultural 
production, 
and 
to 
training 
and 
management 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
isotope 
hydrology 
for 
water 
resource 
management. 
61. 
Such 
activities 
would 
allow 
the 
Government 
to 
draw 
up 
and 
apply 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
a 
real 
policy 
for 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management. 
The 
Government 
had 
invited 
Agency 
experts 
to 
Afghanistan 
to 
help 
its 
authorities 
identify 
and 
formulate 
the 
countryÂs 
urgent 
needs 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
preparing 
a 
CPF 
as 
a 
short-and 
medium-term 
planning 
instrument 
which 
could 
broaden 
the 
scope 
of 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Afghanistan. 
62. 
In 
that 
context, 
Afghanistan 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
take 
appropriate 
measures 
to 
supply 
the 
necessary 
financial 
resources 
for 
theoretical 
and 
practical 
training 
in 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
to 
facilitate 
the 
acquisition 
of 
equipment 
under 
technology 
transfer 
programmes. 
63. 
Afghanistan 
had 
undertaken 
to 
honour 
its 
financial 
commitments 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
already 
settled 
some 
of 
its 
arrears 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
payment 
schedule 
agreed 
by 
both 
parties. 
That 
demonstrated 
AfghanistanÂs 
firm 
support 
for 
the 
Agency 
in 
accomplishing 
its 
valuable 
tasks. 
64. 
Mr. 
CABELLO 
SARUBBI 
(Paraguay) 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
proud 
to 
be 
part 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
inhabited 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, 
firmly 
opposed 
any 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
and 
therefore 
demanded 
the 
cessation 
of 
all 
nuclear 
testing 
and 
the 
reduction 
of 
existing 
arsenals. 
Full 
adherence 
to 
existing 
treaties 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
an 
essential 
contribution 
to 
global 
peace 
and 
security. 
As 
United 
Nations 
Secretary-General 
Kofi 
Annan 
had 
recognized, 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
biggest 
failing 
was 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
it 
should 
reflect 
upon 
past 
errors 
and 
show 
a 
strong 
political 
will 
to 
correct 
them.

65. 
Paraguay 
supported 
the 
decision 
on 
SQPs 
taken 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
to 
eliminate 
loopholes 
that 
weakened 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
Paraguay 
would 
take 
steps 
to 
adopt 
the 
necessary 
amendments 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
through 
the 
recommended 
mechanism. 
66. 
The 
CPPNM 
had 
been 
strengthened 
by 
the 
amendments 
adopted 
by 
the 
diplomatic 
conference 
in 
July 
2005, 
and 
Paraguay 
would 
ratify 
those 
amendments 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
as 
a 
further 
indication 
of 
its 
firm 
commitment 
to 
international 
security. 
67. 
At 
that 
conference, 
Paraguay 
had 
proposed 
extending 
the 
CPPNM 
to 
apply, 
mutatis 
mutandis, 
to 
all 
radioactive 
material 
and 
associated 
facilities, 
since 
national 
and 
international 
security 
demanded 
clear 
standards 
for 
the 
protection 
and 
custody 
of 
such 
material 
and 
facilities. 
Although 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
was 
an 
important 
tool, 
it 
was 
not 
legally 
binding, 
which 
was 
a 
weakness 
that 
should 
be 
borne 
in 
mind. 
68. 
Paraguay, 
like 
many 
other 
countries, 
did 
not 
have 
nuclear 
reactors, 
but 
it 
was 
aware 
that 
many 
radiological 
accidents 
had 
occurred 
in 
the 
past. 
Furthermore, 
it 
considered 
it 
important 
to 
guard 
against 
the 
possible 
criminal 
uses 
of 
radioactive 
materials, 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
disastrous 
consequences. 
Of 
course 
not 
all 
radioactive 
material 
required 
special 
security 
measures; 
however, 
it 
would 
be 
a 
valuable 
exercise 
to 
identify 
those 
materials 
that 
could 
be 
used 
harmfully, 
in 
particular 
for 
terrorist 
purposes, 
and 
to 
take 
preventive 
measures 
against 
such 
use. 
69. 
In 
view 
of 
its 
concerns 
regarding 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
Paraguay 
had 
organized 
and 
financed 
a 
national 
day 
on 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radioactive 
material 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
the 
national 
institutions 
responsible 
for 
the 
control 
and 
safety 
of 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material 
within 
and 
outside 
the 
country. 
70. 
Turning 
to 
international 
safeguards 
issues, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
results 
of 
the 
last 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
in 
which 
the 
DPRK 
had 
agreed 
to 
abandon 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
any 
related 
nuclear 
programmes 
with 
a 
view 
to 
its 
return 
to 
the 
NPT 
regime 
and 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
71. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
interrupted 
negotiations 
between 
the 
European 
countries 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
would 
be 
resumed 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
interests 
of 
both 
parties 
that 
would 
allow 
Iran 
sufficient 
technology 
and 
inputs 
to 
develop 
a 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programme 
while 
also 
generating 
sufficient 
confidence 
that 
there 
was 
no 
diversion 
to 
activities 
prohibited 
by 
current 
international 
legislation. 
72. 
Paraguay 
continued 
to 
benefit 
from 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
increasing 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
global 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity. 
73. 
In 
October 
2005, 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
sending 
a 
mission 
to 
Paraguay 
to 
evaluate 
its 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
safety 
needs. 
Based 
on 
the 
results 
of 
that 
mission, 
a 
national 
integrated 
nuclear 
safety 
plan 
would 
be 
drawn 
up 
to 
help 
the 
authorities 
work 
more 
effectively 
for 
national 
and 
international 
safety. 
Moreover, 
with 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency, 
a 
national 
course 
had 
been 
held 
in 
2004 
on 
preparedness 
for 
and 
response 
to 
radiological 
emergencies. 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
technical 
team 
had 
been 
formed 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
national 
response 
plan 
for 
such 
emergencies 
which 
was 
currently 
being 
implemented. 
Advice 
from 
the 
Agency 
had 
also 
aided 
the 
formulation 
of 
a 
draft 
law 
to 
create 
a 
single 
regulatory 
authority 
which 
was 
being 
considered 
by 
Congress. 
That 
would 
facilitate 
inter-institutional 
cooperation 
and 
efficiency 
in 
applying 
the 
Agency's 
recommendations. 
The 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
2004 
in 
the 
form 
of 
fellowships, 
scientific 
visits 
and 
expert 
missions, 
and 
of 
equipment, 
spare 
parts 
and 
accessories, 
had 
been 
invaluable 
as 
well. 
74. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
ARCAL 
regional 
agreement, 
which 
had 
provided 
another 
opportunity 
for 
cooperation 
between 
the 
countries 
of 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 

GC(49)/OR.7 
29 
September 
2005,

Caribbean. 
Since 
ARCAL 
had 
been 
established 
in 
1984, 
Paraguay 
had 
benefited 
from 
many 
projects, 
including 
seven 
in 
2004 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
cancer 
treatment, 
atmospheric 
pollution 
studies, 
quality 
control 
for 
mammography, 
nuclear 
telemedicine 
and 
the 
purchase 
of 
laboratory 
equipment. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
strategic 
alliance 
between 
ARCAL 
and 
the 
Agency, 
and 
also 
with 
specialized 
institutions 
in 
developed 
countries, 
to 
ensure 
increased 
benefits 
for 
Member 
States 
from 
nuclear 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development. 


75. 
His 
country 
supported 
enlargement 
of 
the 
Board 
to 
provide 
greater 
and 
more 
democratic 
participation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
policy-making 
organs, 
for 
despite 
a 
significant 
increase 
in 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Board 
had 
not 
been 
enlarged 
since 
1989. 
76. 
Welcome 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
with 
respect 
to 
equitable 
and 
balanced 
geographical 
representation 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
staff, 
especially 
for 
developing 
countries. 
However, 
the 
low 
percentage 
of 
women 
working 
in 
the 
Agency, 
particularly 
at 
the 
Professional 
level, 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
concern. 
The 
Secretariat's 
initiatives 
to 
remedy 
that 
situation 
were 
welcome 
and 
he 
looked 
forward 
to 
seeing 
positive 
steps 
in 
that 
regard. 
77. 
Mr. 
MAZI 
(Albania) 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
continuing 
support 
for 
the 
Agency 
and 
said 
the 
scope 
of 
its 
activities 
had 
continued 
to 
expand 
and 
it 
had 
responded 
efficiently 
to 
challenges 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
work. 
78. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
were 
priorities 
of 
Albanian 
foreign 
policy 
and 
his 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
meeting 
all 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
related 
international 
treaties. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
not 
produced 
any 
substantive 
results. 
Albania 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
all 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
in 
particular 
those 
aimed 
at 
ensuring 
an 
effective, 
efficient 
and 
universal 
international 
safeguards 
system. 
79. 
Albania 
had 
signed 
its 
additional 
protocol 
and 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
bring 
it 
to 
parliamentary 
ratification 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
80. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
significance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime, 
Albania 
attached 
equal 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
non-safeguards 
activities. 
It 
considered 
that 
nuclear 
techniques 
could 
make 
substantial 
contributions 
to 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development 
and 
to 
national 
programmes. 
AlbaniaÂs 
policy 
was 
to 
revitalize 
non-power 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
assure 
radiation 
protection 
and 
safety, 
further 
improve 
and 
consolidate 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
infrastructure 
in 
line 
with 
international 
obligations, 
and 
harmonize 
the 
legal 
basis 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
with 
international 
legal 
requirements. 
The 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
benefit 
from 
technical 
cooperation 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
while 
still 
fulfilling 
the 
national 
commitments 
and 
obligations 
that 
such 
cooperation 
entailed. 
81. 
As 
a 
recipient 
country, 
Albania 
had 
benefited 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
and 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
that 
assistance, 
which 
had 
had 
a 
positive 
impact 
in 
various 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications. 
82. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
visited 
Albania 
in 
April 
2005 
and 
had 
met 
the 
President, 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
and 
the 
Minister 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs. 
He 
had 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Albanian 
institutions 
in 
human 
health, 
through 
national 
projects 
and 
PACT, 
and 
in 
nuclear 
security, 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radioactive 
material 
and 
terrorist 
acts 
and 
to 
reduce 
radiological 
threats. 
83. 
Albania 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
radiation 
therapy 
and 
cancer 
control 
and 
considered 
that 
it 
should 
be 
pursued 
and 
strengthened. 
Human 
health 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
a 
priority 
for 
Albania 
in 
the 
coming 
years 
and 
assistance 
in 
that 
area 
had 
a 
positive 
direct 
impact 
on 
its 
people.

84. 
The 
seriousness 
with 
which 
Albania 
viewed 
technical 
cooperation 
was 
reflected 
by 
its 
full 
payment 
of 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
obligations 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full, 
in 
order 
to 
receive 
continued 
and 
sustained 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency. 
85. 
In 
September 
2005, 
Albania 
had 
signed 
an 
updated 
CPF 
for 
subsequent 
technical 
cooperation 
cycles. 
Human 
health 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
main 
priority; 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
had 
also 
been 
signed 
in 
2005 
to 
formalize 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radiotherapy 
and 
to 
facilitate 
the 
submission 
of 
funding 
requests 
for 
joint 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
for 
consideration 
within 
the 
Albanian 
budget. 
The 
Agency 
had 
developed 
a 
long-term 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
radiotherapy, 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
had 
agreed 
to 
share 
the 
cost 
of 
that 
programme. 
A 
plan 
to 
upgrade 
nuclear 
medicine 
services 
was 
under 
consideration. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
that 
area, 
including 
providing 
an 
emergency 
radiotherapy 
machine, 
training 
and 
expert 
services 
to 
the 
Mother 
Teresa 
Hospital, 
was 
appreciated 
and, 
he 
hoped, 
sustainable. 
86. 
Albania 
had 
been 
the 
first 
country 
to 
receive 
a 
team 
from 
PACT 
to 
review 
its 
cancer 
management 
infrastructure. 
PACT 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
maximize 
the 
public 
health 
value 
derived 
from 
radiotherapy 
projects 
aimed 
at 
fully 
meeting 
treatment 
needs 
within 
a 
broad-based 
cancer 
capacity-
building 
plan. 
The 
integration 
of 
all 
cancer-related 
efforts 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
systematic 
and 
global 
approach 
would 
give 
the 
country 
a 
solid 
base 
for 
fund-raising. 
87. 
Mr. 
BEKOE 
(Ghana), 
welcoming 
Belize 
to 
the 
Agency, 
said 
that 
the 
expanding 
membership 
showed 
that 
Member 
States 
had 
confidence 
in 
the 
Agency 
as 
a 
body 
responsible 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
safe 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
impartial 
nuclear 
verification, 
nuclear 
security 
and 
the 
prosperity 
of 
countries. 
88. 
Ghana 
believed 
strongly 
that 
peace 
was 
essential 
for 
social 
and 
economic 
development. 
Therefore 
atomic 
energy 
and 
any 
other 
technological 
advancement 
must 
be 
used 
only 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
improving 
human 
conditions 
and 
enhancing 
harmony 
among 
all 
nations. 
89. 
The 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
world 
peace 
and 
should 
not 
be 
tolerated 
by 
peace-loving 
people. 
That 
was 
why 
Ghana 
fully 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
create 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones. 
The 
fact 
that 
Ghana 
had 
been 
a 
signatory 
to 
an 
additional 
protocol 
since 
1998 
showed 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
regime. 
Ghana 
urged 
all 
Member 
States, 
particularly 
those 
in 
Africa, 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
without 
delay 
additional 
protocols 
and 
other 
treaties 
and 
conventions 
of 
the 
Agency. 
90. 
Ghana 
was 
deeply 
satisfied 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
its 
work 
to 
advance 
nuclear 
power 
through 
the 
development 
of 
innovative 
reactor 
and 
fuel 
cycle 
technologies, 
and 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management. 
91. 
The 
Government 
of 
Ghana 
acknowledged 
with 
gratitude 
the 
cordial 
relationship, 
cooperation 
and 
strong 
partnership 
that 
existed 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Ghana 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission. 
92. 
Nuclear 
technology 
played 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
Ghana, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
human 
health. 
The 
country 
had 
a 
good 
safety 
record 
in 
radiation 
protection, 
which 
covered 
the 
operation 
of 
its 
research 
reactor, 
two 
radiotherapy 
installations 
for 
cancer 
treatment, 
applications 
in 
industry 
for 
the 
detection 
of 
faults 
in 
welds, 
and 
the 
sterilization 
of 
surgical 
and 
other 
medical 
instruments 
and 
supplies. 
93. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
human 
health, 
successful 
cooperation 
between 
Ghana 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
led 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
second 
national 
centre 
for 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
Kumasi. 
The 
centre 
had 
been 
commissioned 
by 
President 
Kufuor 
in 
January 
2005 
in 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
presence. 
Both 
the 
new 
centre 
and 
the 
older 
one 
would 
fulfil 
important 
functions 
in 
the 

GC(49)/OR.7

diagnosis 
of 
cancer 
and 
the 
treatment 
of 
cancer 
patients 
from 
Ghana 
and 
neighbouring 
West 
African 
countries. 


94. 
He 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
particularly 
of 
the 
Africa 
Section, 
for 
the 
significant 
role 
they 
had 
played 
in 
preparing 
the 
CPF 
for 
2005Â2010, 
which 
would 
be 
most 
useful 
in 
planning 
and 
implementing 
projects 
to 
address 
national 
priority 
areas 
for 
development. 
Ghana 
was 
planning 
to 
embark 
on 
programmes 
to 
promote 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner. 
95. 
Ghana 
believed 
that 
preservation, 
maintenance 
and 
enhancement 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
played 
a 
central 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
sustainable 
and 
safe 
operation 
and 
effective 
use 
of 
nuclear 
facilities. 
The 
Ghana 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Ghana, 
was 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
establishing 
a 
graduate 
school 
of 
nuclear 
and 
allied 
sciences. 
The 
Government 
of 
Ghana 
wished 
to 
place 
emphasis 
on 
strengthening 
the 
national 
capacity 
for 
postgraduate 
teaching 
and 
research 
and 
would 
appreciate 
technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency, 
its 
Member 
States 
and 
other 
international 
organizations 
to 
promote 
networking 
among 
institutions 
providing 
education 
and 
training 
in 
the 
same 
area. 
96. 
Mr. 
CLEUTINX 
(European 
Commission) 
recalled 
that 
five 
years 
previously 
the 
Commission 
had 
started 
a 
strategic 
debate 
on 
energy 
supply 
inside 
the 
European 
Union, 
mindful 
that 
security 
of 
supply 
and 
energy 
efficiency 
were 
prerequisites 
for 
economic 
growth 
and 
welfare, 
and 
therefore 
high-priority 
issues. 
The 
European 
Union 
did 
not 
rule 
out 
any 
of 
the 
choices 
of 
energy 
sources. 
Currently, 
nuclear 
power 
accounted 
for 
more 
than 
one 
third 
of 
the 
electricity 
produced 
in 
the 
European 
Union. 
It 
was 
a 
stable 
source 
of 
energy 
largely 
shielded 
from 
the 
price 
fluctuations 
that 
were 
currently 
affecting 
the 
oil 
and 
gas 
markets. 
97. 
The 
option 
of 
generating 
nuclear 
energy 
belonged 
to 
each 
individual 
Member 
State. 
The 
Euratom 
Treaty 
provided 
a 
comprehensive 
framework 
for 
the 
civilian 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
entrusted 
the 
Commission 
with 
the 
task 
of 
ensuring 
that 
the 
objectives 
and 
standards 
it 
set 
were 
observed 
across 
the 
Union. 
Only 
by 
adhering 
to 
the 
conditions 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Euratom 
Treaty, 
including 
with 
respect 
to 
operation, 
decommissioning, 
and 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel, 
could 
the 
States 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
hope 
to 
make 
the 
nuclear 
option 
a 
politically 
and 
environmentally 
acceptable 
one. 
Public 
acceptance 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
further 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
as 
an 
energy 
source. 
98. 
In 
2003, 
the 
Commission 
had 
adopted 
two 
proposals 
for 
directives 
concerning 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
They 
had 
been 
modified 
in 
2004 
to 
take 
into 
account 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
European 
Parliament 
and 
the 
results 
of 
discussions 
within 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers. 
Consultations 
with 
national 
authorities 
and 
representatives 
of 
industry 
had 
been 
held, 
and 
although 
support 
had 
been 
accumulated, 
it 
was 
not 
yet 
sufficient 
to 
obtain 
the 
qualified 
majority 
in 
the 
Council 
needed 
for 
adoption 
of 
the 
proposals. 
The 
Commission 
remained 
convinced, 
however, 
that 
common 
rules 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
were 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
EU 
citizens. 
99. 
The 
sustainable 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel 
was 
the 
one 
issue 
which 
posed 
the 
greatest 
problem 
to 
public 
acceptance. 
The 
Commission 
was 
considering 
a 
number 
of 
initiatives 
to 
support 
Member 
States 
in 
tackling 
the 
significant 
scientific 
and 
technical 
challenges 
posed 
by 
the 
management 
of 
such 
waste, 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
joint 
undertaking 
Â 
a 
public 
body 
to 
pool 
resources 
to 
that 
end 
with 
private 
actors. 
100. 
The 
safe 
closure 
and 
decommissioning 
of 
reactors 
that 
had 
reached 
the 
end 
of 
their 
lifetime 
or 
that 
could 
not 
be 
upgraded 
at 
reasonable 
cost 
had 
to 
be 
ensured. 
Detailed 
provisions 
for 
a 
number 
of 
installations 
had 
been 
negotiated 
before 
the 
recent 
enlargement 
of 
the 
Community. 
The 
Commission 
was 
continuing 
to 
invest 
substantial 
financial 
assistance 
to 
ensure 
the 
timely 
closure 
and

decommissioning 
of 
the 
installations 
concerned. 
The 
latest 
Community 
safety 
programme 
allocated 
significant 
financial 
assistance 
to 
priority 
nuclear 
safety 
projects 
in 
the 
acceding 
countries 
of 
Bulgaria 
and 
Romania, 
and 
provisions 
on 
specific 
installations 
would 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
accession 
agreement 
for 
the 
next 
enlargement 
of 
the 
Union. 


101. 
Having 
highlighted 
the 
CommissionÂs 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
maintaining 
safety 
levels 
at 
all 
stages 
from 
operation 
to 
decommissioning, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
Community 
was 
increasing 
its 
participation 
in 
IAEA 
conventions. 
The 
Commission 
had 
taken 
part 
in 
the 
latest 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
had 
found 
its 
objectives 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
European 
Union 
supported 
a 
nuclear 
safety 
programme 
in 
the 
Newly 
Independent 
States 
aimed 
at 
improving 
safety 
and 
promoting 
an 
effective 
safety 
culture. 
It 
also 
supported 
international 
projects 
and 
actions 
such 
as 
the 
Chernobyl 
Shelter 
Fund, 
the 
G7/EU 
initiative 
on 
the 
closure 
of 
Chernobyl, 
and 
the 
Northern 
Dimension 
Environmental 
Partnership. 
102. 
The 
European 
Union 
continued 
to 
streamline 
its 
policies 
and 
action 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism. 
Tackling 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
improving 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
dual-use 
items 
were 
top 
priorities 
on 
the 
CommissionÂs 
agenda. 
The 
Community 
was 
a 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
welcomed 
its 
revision 
to 
extend 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism. 
The 
Community 
had 
also 
passed 
an 
internally 
binding 
legislative 
act 
as 
a 
follow-up 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
on 
the 
control 
of 
high-activity 
sealed 
sources 
and 
orphan 
sources. 
103. 
For 
more 
than 
45 
years, 
the 
Commission 
had 
been 
exercising 
safeguards 
controls 
in 
European 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
the 
Euratom 
Treaty. 
Its 
common 
multilateral 
system 
for 
safeguarding 
nuclear 
materials 
was 
unique 
in 
the 
world, 
since 
its 
nuclear 
material 
control 
activities 
applied 
fully 
without 
any 
differentiation 
or 
discrimination 
to 
all 
civil 
nuclear 
installations, 
whether 
located 
in 
nuclear-weapon 
or 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
in 
the 
European 
Union. 
Two 
hundred 
Euratom 
inspectors 
helped 
to 
ensure 
that 
EU 
Member 
States 
complied 
with 
their 
international 
safeguards 
obligations. 
The 
high 
level 
of 
expertise 
accumulated 
by 
the 
Commission 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safeguards 
contributed 
to 
a 
climate 
of 
confidence 
not 
only 
among 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Union, 
but 
throughout 
the 
world. 
Euratom 
safeguards 
represented 
the 
most 
intensive 
aspect 
of 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Community 
and 
the 
Agency, 
and 
he 
welcomed 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
improve 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
that 
area. 
104. 
After 
expressing 
regret 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
substantive 
progress 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
Commission 
had 
taken 
the 
necessary 
steps 
for 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols 
in 
the 
Community. 
The 
new 
Euratom 
regulation 
on 
the 
application 
of 
Euratom 
safeguards, 
setting 
out 
the 
reporting 
standards 
necessary 
to 
implement 
the 
provisions 
of 
additional 
protocols 
in 
the 
European 
Union, 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
earlier 
in 
the 
year. 
The 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
in 
the 
EU 
Member 
States 
would 
help 
to 
promote 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
establish 
it 
as 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
standard. 
105. 
The 
underlying 
aim 
of 
the 
Euratom 
treaty 
was 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
by 
developing 
the 
knowledge 
and 
means 
to 
exploit 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
civilian 
purposes, 
inter 
alia 
through 
research 
and 
the 
dissemination 
of 
technical 
know-how. 
The 
Commission 
was 
accordingly 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
for 
the 
ITER 
project, 
and 
in 
particular 
to 
the 
Agency 
staff 
for 
its 
role 
in 
resolving 
the 
ITER 
site 
issue. 
The 
Commission 
looked 
forward 
to 
a 
continuing 
fruitful 
relationship 
between 
ITER 
parties 
and 
the 
Agency.

106. 
The 
Commission 
had 
launched 
internal 
consultations 
within 
the 
Community 
to 
provide 
for 
possible 
accession 
to 
the 
international 
framework 
agreement 
among 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
107. 
The 
Commission 
had 
a 
long 
history 
of 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
should 
be 
maintained 
and 
strengthened. 
Recalling 
that 
Euratom 
only 
had 
the 
status 
of 
observer 
at 
the 
Agency, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
Community 
was 
examining 
legal 
tools 
for 
its 
more 
effective 
integration 
and 
participation 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
promoting 
and 
ensuring 
safe 
and 
responsible 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
12.15 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
12.25 
p.m. 


Mr. 
Bazoberry 
(Bolivia), 
President, 
resumed 
the 
Chair. 


13. 
Appointment 
of 
the 
External 
Auditor 
108. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
tenure 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
current 
External 
Auditor 
would 
end 
with 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
the 
financial 
year 
2005. 
It 
would 
therefore 
be 
necessary 
to 
appoint 
an 
External 
Auditor 
to 
audit 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
2006 
and 
2007. 
109. 
At 
its 
June 
meetings6 
, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
agreed 
to 
recommend 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
the 
appointment 
of 
the 
Vice-President 
of 
the 
German 
Supreme 
Audit 
Institution 
as 
the 
External 
Auditor 
to 
audit 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
the 
financial 
years 
2006 
and 
2007. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
follow 
the 
BoardÂs 
recommendation. 
110. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
Â 
Request 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
(GC(49)/INF/13) 


111. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
had 
before 
it 
a 
request 
from 
Iraq 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
its 
voting 
rights. 
It 
had 
recommended 
that 
IraqÂs 
right 
to 
vote 
be 
restored 
during 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
Conference 
for 
a 
period 
of 
one 
year 
ending 
prior 
to 
the 
commencement 
of 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
because 
it 
was 
of 
the 
view 
that 
IraqÂs 
failure 
to 
pay 
the 
amount 
necessary 
was 
due 
to 
conditions 
beyond 
its 
control. 
112. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
accepted 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
General 
Committee. 
113. 
It 
was 
so 
decided.

26. 
Examination 
of 
delegatesÂ 
credentials 
(GC(49)/27) 


114. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
met 
earlier 
in 
the 
day 
to 
examine 
to 
credentials 
of 
all 
delegates, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
Rule 
28 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
The 
report 
of 
the 
Committee 
was 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/27. 
Since 
the 
report 
had 
been 
issued, 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
received 
credentials 
in 
due 
form 
from 
the 
delegates 
of 
Qatar 
and 
Serbia 
and 
Montenegro. 
After 
discussion, 
the 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Conference 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
7 
of 
its 
report, 
with 
the 
reservations 
and 
positions 
expressed 
in 
the 
report. 
115. 
Ms. 
ABDEL-MEGIED 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
EgyptÂs 
acceptance 
of 
the 
credentials 
submitted 
by 
the 
delegation 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Israel 
should 
on 
no 
account 
be 
understood 
as 
covering 
any 
occupied 
Arab 
territories, 
but 
only 
the 
area 
within 
the 
borders 
of 
4 
June 
1967. 
116. 
Mr. 
HOSSEINI 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
wished 
to 
express 
its 
reservations 
regarding 
the 
credentials 
of 
the 
delegation 
of 
Israel. 
In 
accordance 
with 
its 
position 
of 
principle 
his 
country 
continued 
not 
to 
recognize 
Israel 
as 
a 
State. 
117. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
prepared 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
7 
of 
document 
GC(49)/27. 
118. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
9. 
Election 
of 
members 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
(GC(49)/6 
and 
22) 
119. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
that 
in 
1989 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
approved 
a 
procedure 


whereby, 
when 
there 
was 
agreement 
regarding 
the 
candidate 
or 
candidates 
from 
a 
particular 
area, 
no 
secret 
ballot 
would 
be 
held; 
balloting 
would 
only 
take 
place 
for 
those 
areas 
where 
no 
list 
of 
candidates 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon. 
That 
procedure 
considerably 
facilitated 
the 
rational 
use 
of 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
time. 
Accordingly, 
he 
proposed 
that 
Rule 
79 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
which 
provided 
that 
elections 
to 
the 
Board 
should 
be 
by 
secret 
ballot, 
be 
suspended 
in 
respect 
of 
those 
areas 
for 
which 
there 
was 
agreement. 


120. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
121. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
he 
was 
happy 
to 
report 
that 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
in 
all 
area 
groups 
on 
their 
candidates 
for 
the 
vacancies 
to 
be 
filled. 
He 
expressed 
his 
sincere 
appreciation 
to 
all 
groups 
for 
their 
efforts 
to 
reach 
agreement, 
which 
had 
expedited 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
work. 
122. 
Drawing 
attention 
to 
document 
GC(49)/6, 
containing 
a 
list 
of 
the 
Agency 
Member 
States 
designated 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
Board 
from 
the 
end 
of 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
current 
session 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fiftieth 
(2006) 
regular 
session, 
he 
recalled 
that, 
under 
Rule 
83 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
he 
had 
to 
inform 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
elective 
places 
on 
the 
Board 
that 
had 
to 
be 
filled. 
To 
that 
end, 
document 
GC(49)/22 
had 
been 
prepared; 
it 
indicated 
that 
the 
Conference 
had 
to 
elect 
eleven 
members 
of 
the 
Board 
from 
the 
seven 
categories 
listed. 
123. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
elect 
Colombia 
and 
Cuba 
to 
the 
two 
vacant 
seats 
for 
Latin 
America.

Emeritus

Mr. 
President, 


As 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
8th 
Scientific 
Forum, 
it 
is 
my 
privilege 
to 
report 
to 
you 
and 
the 
Plenary 
the 
main 
points 
from 
the 
presentations 
and 
debates 
of 
the 
Forum. 
The 
Forum 
took 
place 
in 
an 
excellent 
and 
constructive 
spirit 
under 
the 
title 
ÂNuclear 
Science: 
Physics 
Helping 
the 
WorldÂ. 
The 
four 
sessions 
of 
the 
Forum focused 
on: 
Meeting 
Energy 
Needs; 
Developing 
Advanced 
Materials 
and 
Technologies; 
Advancing 
Radiation 
Medicine 
and 
Supporting 
Nuclear 
Safety. 


This 
Forum 
took 
place 
in 
the 
U.N.Âs 
World 
Year 
of 
Physics. 
This 
is 
the 
100th 
anniversary 
of 
Albert 
EinsteinÂs 
revolutionary 
year 
-perhaps 
the 
greatest 
single 
year 
of 
innovation 
by 
any 
one 
scientist. 
In 
1905 
Einstein 
wrote 
on 
Relativity, 
the 
Photoelectric 
Effect, 
and 
Brownian 
motion. 
None 
of 
these 
papers 
was 
as 
mathematically 
complex 
as 
were 
his 
later 
papers 
on 
general 
relativity, 
but 
all 
showed 
new 
ways 
of 
looking 
at 
nature. 
The 
impact 
of 
all 
of 
them 
has 
been 
profound. 


Looking 
backward 
in 
time, 
there 
is 
no 
problem in 
demonstrating 
that 
physics 
not 
only 
has 
helped 
the 
world, 
but 
is 
fundamental 
to 
the 
world 
of 
today. 
It 
is 
not 
an 
exaggeration 
to 
say 
that 
the 
foundation 
of 
almost 
all 
of 
todayÂs 
technology 
rests 
on 
the 
physics 
of 
the 
20th 
century. 
There 
are 
new 
things 
in 
the 
laboratories 
of 
the 
21st 
century 
that 
are 
not 
yet 
fully 
understood, 
ranging 
in 
scale 
from the 
cosmic 
to 
the 
sub-nuclear. 
Some 
are 
already 
at 
the 
threshold 
of 
application. 
For 
example, 
carbon 
nanotubes 
can 
make 
transistors 
or 
strengthen 
materials. 
Others 
are 
at 
an 
earlier 
stage. 
For 
example, 
quantum 
computing 
may 
or 
may 
not 
ever 
work, 
but 
if 
it 
does 
it 
promises 
speed 
ups 
of 
a 
factor 
of 
a 
million 
or 
more 
for 
certain 
classes 
of 
problems. 


The 
physics 
of 
the 
21st 
century 
will 
surely 
bring 
great 
practical 
benefits. 


The 
four 
sessions 
of 
the 
Forum 
focused 
on 
the 
future 
in 
areas 
related 
to 
critical 
needs 
of 
society, 
and 
that 
are 
related 
to 
the 
mission 
of 
the 
IAEA. 


Session 
1 
presented 
how 
nuclear 
science 
is 
helping 
meet 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
needs. 
Keynote 
lectures, 
panellistsÂ 
remarks, 
and 
the 
panel 
discussion 
illustrated 
the 
tangible 
benefits 
of 
fundamental 
physics 
by 
drawing 
the 
big 
arch 
from EinsteinÂs 
mass-energy 
equivalence 
formula 
to 
the 
R&D 
and 
the 
engineering 
applications 
in 
the 
various 
fields 
that 
form 
the 
basis 
for 
both 
fission 
and 
fusion 
energy. 


Demographics 
and 
economic 
development 
worldwide, 
especially 
in 
developing 
countries, 
are 
projected 
to 
lead 
to 
a 
doubling 
of 
primary 
energy 
demand 
by 
2050. 
This 
trend, 
coupled 
with 
rising 
concerns 
about 
global 
warming, 
has 
brought 
the 
nuclear 
option 
to 
the 
forefront 
of 
attention 
and 
has 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
innovation 
in 
this 
area. 
Nuclear 
energy 
cannot 
solve 
all 
energy 
problems 
but 
it 
can 
be 
an 
important 
contributor.

The 
Session 
presented 
the 
status 
of 
both 
fission 
and 
fusion 
energy, 
addressing 
major 
issues 
and 
prospects, 
discussed 
novel 
approaches, 
and 
identified 
the 
way 
forward 
and 
the 
potential 
role 
that 
IAEA 
could 
play. 


As 
far 
as 
fission 
is 
concerned, 
it 
was 
noted 
that 
a 
big 
expansion 
of 
fission 
energy 
requires 
closing 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
from 
both 
a 
waste 
management 
and 
proliferation 
point 
of 
view. 
Hence, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
fast 
reactor, 
which 
provides 
the 
flexibility 
to 
either 
breed 
or 
incinerate 
minor 
actinides, 
was 
highlighted. 
By 
2010 
only 
two 
high-power 
fast 
reactors 
will 
be 
available 
for 
R 
& 
D 
work. 
Therefore, 
it 
was 
suggested 
that 
coherent 
international 
programmes 
be 
set 
up 
to 
maximize 
the 
use 
of 
these 
fast 
reactors. 


With 
regard 
to 
the 
proliferation 
issue, 
once-through 
fuel 
cycles 
do 
not 
seem to 
be 
that 
much 
more 
beneficial 
than 
recycle 
strategies. 
The 
importance 
of 
research 
and 
technology 
development 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
safeguards 
was 
stressed. 


The 
idea 
of 
internationalising 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
was 
discussed. 
It 
was 
recognized 
that 
this 
option 
could 
offer 
substantial 
benefits 
to 
smaller 
countries. 
However, 
the 
realization 
of 
such 
an 
idea 
presupposes 
that 
solutions 
to 
many 
political, 
legal 
and 
administrative 
issues 
are 
found. 
As 
a 
possible 
way 
forward, 
it 
was 
suggested 
that 
IAEA 
start 
working 
on 
such 
strategies. 


As 
far 
as 
fusion 
is 
concerned, 
the 
decision 
to 
build 
ITER 
at 
Cadarache, 
France 
is 
a 
very 
positive 
development. 
ITER 
must 
succeed 
in 
demonstrating 
a 
burning 
plasma 
for 
fusion 
energy 
to 
become 
practical. 
Even 
if 
it 
does, 
the 
earliest 
commercial 
deployment 
of 
fusion 
is 
anticipated 
around 
2040 
to 
2050, 
setting 
fusion 
development 
into 
the 
same 
timeframe 
as 
Generation 
IV 
Reactors. 


The 
SessionÂs 
highlights 
can 
be 
summarized 
as 
follows: 


There 
is 
no 
single 
solution 
to 
the 
problem 
of 
Âmeeting 
energy 
needsÂ. 
All 
options 
will 
be 
needed, 
including 
conservation 
and 
increased 
efficiency. 


The 
energy 
debate 
has 
to 
involve 
all 
players 
Â 
developed 
as 
well 
as 
developing 
countries. 
In 
this 
context, 
international 
collaboration 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
organizations 
like 
the 
IAEA 
has 
a 
crucial 
role 
to 
play. 
Initiatives 
like 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
project 
and 
also 
Generation 
IV 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
mechanism 
for 
such 
collaboration. 
Such 
initiatives 
could 
also 
extend 
their 
scope 
to 
include 
new 
ideas 
that 
ongoing 
R&D 
will 
produce, 
and 
address 
issues 
such 
as 
development 
of 
infrastructure 
in 
developing 
countries 
to 
enhance 
the 
efficiency 
of 
energy 
use. 


For 
post-Kyoto 
(after 
2012), 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
include 
the 
nuclear 
option 
in 
the 
clean 
development 
mechanism 
and 
to 
bring 
in 
the 
developing 
countries 
as 
participants. 


As 
far 
as 
proliferation 
resistance 
is 
concerned, 
science 
can 
play 
a 
role 
but 
alone 
cannot 
solve 
the 
problem. 
Politicians 
must 
be 
called 
upon 
to 
produce 
and 
enforce 
binding 
agreements 
to 
address 
this 
issue. 
IAEAÂs 
safeguards 
at 
their 
present 
size 
cannot 
cope 
with 
a 
considerable 
increase 
in 
nuclear 
power 
production 
worldwide. 


The 
objective 
of 
Session 
2 
was 
to 
discuss 
how 
the 
principles 
of 
nuclear 
science 
have 
helped 
in 
the 
analysis 
and 
understanding 
of 
various 
materials. 


Advanced 
materials 
and 
technologies 
are 
a 
direct 
result 
of 
basic 
science. 
The 
improved 
performance 
of 
the 
present 
generation 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
is 
an 
outcome 
of 
advances 
in 
materials. 
More 
will 
have 
to 
be 
done 
since 
some 
advanced 
Generation 
IV 
reactors 
are 
beyond 
the 
capabilities 
of 
current 
materials. 
Higher 
operating 
temperature, 
higher 
fuel 
burn-up 
and 
structural 
integrity 
at 
higher 
fluence 
all 
require 
development 
of 
new 
materials 
in 
meeting 
the 
exacting 
requirements 
of 
nuclear 
systems 
comprising 
fuels, 
structural 
materials, 
moderators 
and 
coolants.

The 
development 
of 
new 
fuels 
that 
can 
contain 
the 
minor 
actinides, 
which 
create 
the 
biggest 
waste 
disposal 
problems, 
is 
of 
the 
highest 
priority. 
A 
closed 
fuel 
cycle 
will 
enable 
a 
considerable 
reduction 
of 
the 
burden 
of 
long 
lived 
radioactive 
waste. 


Radiation 
sources, 
including 
accelerators, 
are 
important 
in 
such 
diverse 
fields 
as 
industrial 
processes, 
agriculture 
and 
health 
care. 
Many 
technologies 
in 
these 
fields, 
such 
as 
the 
sterile 
insect 
technology 
and 
mutation 
plant 
breeding, 
are 
supported 
by 
the 
IAEA. 
New 
radiation 
applications 
are 
being 
developed 
based 
on 
reliable 
accelerators 
that 
are 
commercially 
available 
at 
reasonable 
prices. 


Charged 
particle 
accelerators 
are 
playing 
an 
increasing 
role 
in 
industry 
and 
medicine. 
Neutrons 
produced 
with 
a 
high 
power 
proton 
accelerator 
are 
used 
for 
basic 
research 
and 
industrial 
radiography. 
They 
may 
also 
play 
a 
role 
in 
transmutation 
of 
highly 
radioactive 
fission 
products. 
Neutron 
radiography 
is 
complementary 
to 
x-ray 
tomography 
as 
neutrons 
can 
penetrate 
deeper 
into 
heavy 
materials. 


Accelerator 
Mass 
Spectroscopy 
is 
an 
extremely 
sensitive 
method 
to 
detect 
trace 
materials 
and 
has 
applications 
in 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
climate 
research, 
archaeology 
and 
even 
in 
the 
food 
industry. 


Nuclear 
measurements 
are 
essential 
for 
IAEA 
safeguards 
programme. 
The 
science 
and 
technology 
have 
made 
considerable 
progress, 
and 
this 
area 
is 
an 
attractive 
field 
for 
young 
scientists 
and 
engineers. 
The 
trend 
in 
nuclear 
measurements 
is 
towards 
higher 
detection 
efficiency 
and 
capability 
to 
measure 
short-lived 
isotopes 
in 
very 
low 
quantities. 
Specific 
methods 
like 
laser 
technology 
open 
new 
and 
innovative 
areas 
of 
fundamental 
science 
and 
applications 
within 
this 
realm. 


For 
long-term 
benefits 
to 
IAEA 
programs, 
cooperation 
with 
universities 
and 
research 
institutes 
should 
be 
strengthened. 
Collaboration 
of 
nuclear 
centres 
with 
universities 
also 
increases 
the 
potential 
for 
collaboration 
with 
students 
from developing 
countries. 


This 
session 
concluded 
with 
a 
presentation 
on 
the 
International 
Nuclear 
information 
System 
(INIS). 


The 
third 
session 
on 
Radiation 
Medicine 
discussed 
the 
use 
of 
ionising 
radiation 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
diseases 
such 
as 
cancer. 
There 
have 
been 
significant 
advances 
in 
diagnostic 
imaging 
to 
visualise 
tumours 
in 
3-dimensions 
and 
more 
recently, 
in 
functional 
imaging 
to 
localise 
the 
disease 
more 
precisely. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
there 
have 
been 
advances 
in 
cancer 
treatment 
delivery 
that 
promise 
gains 
in 
therapeutic 
effectiveness 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
escalating 
the 
dose 
to 
the 
precisely 
known 
location 
of 
the 
tumour. 
However, 
the 
lack 
of 
sufficient 
numbers 
of 
well-trained 
medical 
physicists 
in 
various 
regions 
of 
the 
world 
may 
prevent 
the 
transfer 
of 
high 
technology 
advances 
to 
developing 
countries 
resulting 
in 
a 
technology 
gap. 


The 
first 
presentation 
concentrated 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
physics 
solutions 
to 
imaging 
for 
improved 
radiotherapy. 
45% 
of 
cancer 
patients 
can 
be 
cured 
and 
of 
the 
55%, 
for 
whom treatment 
fails, 
18% 
are 
because 
of 
failure 
of 
local 
control 
and 
this 
could 
be 
improved. 
The 
integration 
of 
cross-sectional, 
anatomical 
and 
functional 
imaging 
into 
real-time 
radiotherapy 
was 
stressed. 
The 
techniques 
used 
include 
computed 
tomography, 
magnetic 
resonance 
imaging 
and 
positron 
emission 
tomography. 
Following 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
tumour 
in 
space 
and 
time 
using 
gated 
radiotherapy 
and 
other 
techniques 
such 
as 
biological 
profiling 
using 
MR 
spectroscopy 
within 
the 
treatment 
plan, 
can 
avoid 
irradiating 
healthy 
tissue 
and 
thus 
reduce 
complications.

The 
second 
presentation 
discussed 
better 
targeting 
of 
therapy 
and 
stressed 
that 
intensity 
modulated 
radiotherapy 
(IMRT) 
had 
enabled 
dose 
sculpting 
in 
3D. 
Conformal 
avoidance 
radiotherapy 
avoids 
irradiation 
of 
normal 
tissue 
and 
the 
treatments 
can 
be 
more 
cost-effective. 
IMRT 
and 
tomotherapy 
can 
shorten 
treatment 
times, 
can 
be 
less 
expensive 
to 
deliver 
and 
will 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
tumour 
recurrences. 


The 
third 
presentation 
explained 
the 
role 
of 
medical 
physicists 
and 
the 
training 
they 
need 
to 
fulfil 
this 
role. 
Eight 
years 
after 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
the 
graduate 
programme 
in 
Mexico, 
25 
% 
of 
the 
clinically 
based 
medical 
physicists 
now 
have 
Master 
degrees, 
a 
qualification 
necessary 
to 
practice 
appropriately. 


The 
fourth 
presentation 
demonstrated 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
concentrating 
research 
resources 
around 
a 
centre 
of 
excellence. 
Combining 
nuclear 
science 
with 
biotechnology 
has 
enabled 
Cuba 
to 
develop 
drugs, 
vaccines, 
therapeutics 
and 
diagnostics 
culminating 
in 
an 
FDA 
licence 
for 
a 
specific 
cancer 
vaccine. 
The 
link 
between 
isotope 
production 
and 
radiopharmaceuticals 
is 
clearly 
beneficial. 


The 
panel 
discussion 
focused 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
regulatory 
needs 
for 
sustaining 
the 
use 
of 
radiotherapy 
equipment. 
A 
further 
point 
of 
major 
concern 
was 
in 
having 
access 
to 
trained 
staff 
in 
all 
the 
necessary 
disciplines. 
Various 
collaborative 
methods 
were 
proposed 
and 
one 
suggestion, 
to 
avoid 
brain 
drain, 
was 
to 
provide 
regional 
centres 
of 
excellence 
with 
on-site 
training, 
possibly 
with 
an 
Agency 
Professorial 
Chair 
to 
support 
this. 
The 
lack 
of 
recognition 
of 
Medical 
Physics 
as 
a 
profession 
was 
also 
highlighted 
and 
the 
Agency 
is 
addressing 
this 
issue. 


It 
was 
also 
pointed 
out 
that 
although 
the 
sophisticated 
new 
combined 
imaging 
and 
treatment 
systems 
could 
improve 
the 
treatment 
of 
about 
15 
% 
of 
cancers, 
the 
older, 
more 
established, 
less 
expensive 
techniques 
could 
be 
used 
with 
great 
effect 
especially 
in 
countries 
where 
70 
% 
of 
cancers 
are 
not 
currently 
treated 
at 
all. 
It 
was 
agreed 
that 
having 
sophisticated 
equipment 
in 
place 
without 
trained 
staff 
is 
futile. 


This 
session 
concluded 
with 
a 
presentation 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Programme 
of 
Action 
for 
Cancer 
Therapy 
(PACT), 
which 
is 
open 
to 
all 
Member 
States. 


A 
precondition 
for 
continuing 
reliance 
on 
nuclear 
power, 
is 
assurance 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
The 
fourth 
session 
explored 
various 
dimensions 
of 
this 
imperative. 


The 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
provides 
the 
framework 
for 
nuclear 
safety. 
The 
international 
component 
of 
that 
regime 
should 
be 
strengthened 
by 
establishing 
a 
more 
effective 
network 
for 
sharing 
operating 
experience, 
undertaking 
further 
modification 
of 
IAEA 
safety 
standards 
to 
provide 
more 
complete 
guidance, 
enhancing 
safety 
culture, 
strengthening 
practices 
under 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Convention, 
and 
undertaking 
multinational 
design 
review 
programs 
for 
new 
reactors. 
A 
fully 
engaged 
and 
informed 
regulator 
is 
essential. 


The 
public 
perception 
of 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
power 
must 
be 
directly 
addressed. 
This 
requires 
efforts 
to 
reach 
out 
to 
the 
public 
and 
to 
address 
their 
concerns 
candidly 
and 
completely. 
Operators 
and 
regulators 
have 
the 
obligation 
to 
achieve 
transparency 
in 
order 
to 
alleviate 
public 
concerns. 


The 
particular 
importance 
of 
safety 
culture 
was 
emphasized. 
It 
is 
not 
possible 
to 
develop 
a 
comprehensive 
indicator 
of 
safety 
culture, 
but 
its 
achievement 
is 
of 
singular 
importance. 
Chief 
among 
its 
characteristics 
is 
the 
recognition 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
is 
the 
prime 
responsibility 
of 
those 
who 
own 
and 
operate 
nuclear 
plants.

The 
achievement 
of 
safety 
requires 
focused 
consideration 
of 
the 
management 
of 
technical 
knowledge. 
This 
includes 
the 
encouragement 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
information 
from 
countries 
that 
are 
sophisticated 
on 
nuclear 
operations 
to 
those 
that 
are 
just 
developing 
nuclear 
power 
capabilities. 
In 
this 
connection 
there 
is 
a 
need 
for 
an 
experienced 
and 
accomplished 
workforce. 


There 
also 
is 
an 
opportunity 
to 
learn 
from 
past 
accidents, 
including 
those 
in 
other 
industries. 
Critical 
lessons 
include 
the 
need 
for 
sincere 
and 
committed 
leadership 
in 
making 
safety 
the 
highest 
priority, 
in 
encouraging 
continuing 
communication 
and 
learning, 
and 
encouraging 
alertness 
to 
organizational 
drift. 


The 
session 
emphasized 
the 
critical 
importance 
of 
encouraging 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
the 
years 
ahead. 
Even 
with 
many 
decades 
of 
experience, 
we 
still 
have 
much 
to 
learn. 


The 
scientific 
community 
greatly 
appreciates 
the 
IAEA 
initiative 
to 
organize 
this 
Scientific 
Forum on 
Nuclear 
Science: 
Physics 
Helping 
the 
World. 
It 
allowed 
very 
fruitful 
discussions 
and 
provided 
opportunities 
to 
share 
new 
ideas, 
to 
learn 
from each 
other 
and 
to 
forge 
new 
collaboration. 
The 
meeting 
showed 
that 
large 
progresses 
have 
been 
made 
in 
advancing 
nuclear 
science, 
but 
much 
needs 
to 
be 
done. 
Therefore, 
it 
is 
important 
for 
all 
countries 
to 
work 
together 
to 
realize 
the 
potential

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
(resumed) 
(GC(49)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
DONOGHUE 
(Ireland) 
said 
that 
having 
been 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Agency 
for 
more 
than 
thirty 
years, 
Ireland 
had 
observed 
how 
it 
had 
evolved 
to 
respond 
to 
changing 
trends 
in 
relation 
to 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
numerous 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
new 
proliferation 
challenges 
and 
the 
ever-present 
and 
increasingly 
complex 
challenges 
of 
safety 
and 
security. 
2. 
The 
Agency 
had 
moved 
over 
recent 
years 
from 
a 
relatively 
unknown 
agency 
to 
a 
trusted 
institution. 
Under 
Mr. 
ElBaradeiÂs 
leadership, 
it 
had 
continued 
to 
uphold 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
serving 
the 
Member 
States 
and 
fulfilling 
its 
mandate. 
Ireland 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
Conference's 
approval 
of 
Mr. 
ElBaradei's 
reappointment. 
3. 
Ireland 
had 
long 
believed 
in 
effective 
multilateralism 
as 
the 
best 
guarantee 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
All 
countries, 
but 
especially 
small 
ones, 
had 
a 
fundamental 
stake 
in 
a 
rules-based 
international 
order 
and 
strong 
international 
institutions. 
Ireland 
was 
committed 
to 
implementing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
multilateral 
regime 
of 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
and 
agreements 
and 
to 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
norms 
they 
contained. 
Ireland 
had 
a 
particularly 
close 
association 
with 
the 
NPT, 
the 
most 
universal 
of 
such 
instruments, 
which 
had 
been 
developed 
following 
an 
initiative 
taken 
in 
1958 
by 
the 
then 
Foreign 
Minister 
of 
Ireland, 
Mr. 
Frank 
Aiken. 
It 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
essential 
foundation 
for 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
4. 
The 
Irish 
Government 
had 
been 
deeply 
disappointed 
by 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
seventh 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
May, 
at 
which 
there 
had 
been 
wide-ranging 
debate, 
including 
on 
issues 
important 
to 
the 
ongoing 
work 
in 
Vienna, 
yet 
which 
had 
failed 
to 
produce 
a 
single 
conclusion 
or 
recommendation 
of 
substance. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
missed 
opportunity 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
tackle 
some 
key 
threats 
to 
global 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
to 
agree 
on 
an 
effective 
collective 
response. 
Global 
challenges 
were 
best 
tackled 
together, 
and 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT 
and 
ensure 
full 
respect 
for 
all 
its 
provisions 
needed 
to 
remain 
the 
highest 
priority 
in 
disarmament 
and 
proliferation. 
5. 
Earlier 
in 
the 
present 
month, 
at 
the 
high-level 
summit 
meeting 
in 
New 
York, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
again 
failed 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
occasion 
to 
bridge 
what 
the 
United 
Nations 
Secretary-General 
had 
called 
the 
deep 
rifts 
over 
how 
to 
confront 
the 
challenges 
being 
faced. 
The 
agreement 
reached 
by 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
on 
a 
United 
Nations 
reform 
programme 
had 
many 
important 
and 
positive 
elements. 
It 
was, 
however, 
deeply 
disappointing 
that 
it 
contained 
nothing 
on 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
nor 
on 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT. 
6. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
not 
allow 
such 
setbacks 
to 
lead 
to 
discouragement 
or 
despair. 
The 
challenges 
spoken 
of 
by 
the 
Secretary-General 
would 
not 
vanish 
by 
being 
ignored. 
If 
an 
effective, 
truly 
multilateral 
system 
was 
to 
be 
achieved, 
meaningful 
contributions 
must 
be 
made 
by 
all. 
The 
multilateral 
system 
was 
about 
empowerment 
and 
ownership, 
and 
all 
parties 
were 
responsible 
for 
finding 
shared 
solutions 
and 
playing 
their 
part 
in 
implementing 
them. 
7. 
Support 
for 
multilateral 
instruments 
needed 
to 
translate 
into 
support 
for 
effective 
compliance 
with 
their 
provisions. 
A 
key 
element 
in 
the 
global 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime, 

GC(49)/OR.8

therefore, 
needed 
to 
be 
support 
for 
the 
multilateral 
institutions 
charged 
with 
verifying 
that 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
were 
being 
honoured. 


8. 
The 
vital 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Agency 
safeguards 
system 
in 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
widely 
acknowledged 
and 
respected. 
The 
international 
community 
recognized 
the 
Agency's 
independent, 
technically 
qualified 
and 
impartial 
verification 
of 
global 
non-proliferation 
efforts. 
Events 
of 
recent 
years, 
however, 
had 
clearly 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
system 
needed 
to 
be 
reinforced. 
The 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
an 
effective 
safeguards 
regime 
and, 
together 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
should 
be 
the 
verification 
standard. 
9. 
Over 
the 
past 
year, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
again 
addressed 
a 
number 
of 
specific 
proliferation 
challenges. 
Recent 
developments 
in 
the 
DPRK 
six-party 
talks 
provided 
hope 
of 
a 
peaceful 
and 
negotiated 
outcome 
to 
one 
of 
the 
most 
critical 
challenges 
to 
face 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
in 
recent 
years. 
His 
Government 
welcomed 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
on 
19 
September 
following 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
talks 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
early 
implementation 
of 
the 
commitments 
made 
by 
the 
parties 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
effective 
verification 
arrangements. 
Ireland 
particularly 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
commitment 
to 
return 
to 
full 
compliance 
with 
its 
international 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT, 
including 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would 
refrain 
from 
any 
steps 
contrary 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
joint 
statement. 
10. 
Ireland 
shared 
the 
BoardÂs 
concerns 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
its 
failures 
and 
breaches 
of 
its 
obligation 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
its 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement. 
It 
was 
deeply 
regrettable 
that 
Iran 
had 
resumed 
conversion 
of 
uranium 
at 
its 
Esfahan 
facility. 
He 
urged 
Iran 
to 
take 
further 
necessary 
steps 
to 
return 
to 
full 
compliance 
with 
its 
safeguards 
obligations 
and 
to 
work 
proactively 
to 
implement 
the 
measures 
required 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
its 
resolution 
of 
24 
September2. 
He 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
return 
to 
the 
negotiating 
process 
to 
build 
the 
necessary 
confidence 
in 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
activities. 
11. 
The 
policy 
of 
successive 
Irish 
Governments 
in 
relation 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
reprocessing 
was 
clear 
and 
unambiguous, 
shaped 
by 
the 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
associated 
activities 
posed 
an 
unacceptable 
threat 
to 
public 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
Ireland 
did 
not 
share 
the 
view 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
provided 
a 
sustainable 
or 
acceptable 
energy 
source 
given 
the 
many 
serious 
problems 
which 
had 
been 
identified, 
including: 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations; 
the 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
materials; 
the 
unresolved 
problems 
regarding 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
and 
the 
reprocessing 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel; 
marine 
and 
terrestrial 
environmental 
contamination; 
the 
ever-present 
danger 
of 
a 
major 
accident 
or 
incident; 
and 
increased 
proliferation 
risks. 
The 
recent 
so-called 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
appeared 
to 
be 
based 
mainly 
on 
the 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
remained 
the 
only 
solution 
to 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
global 
warming. 
In 
IrelandÂs 
view, 
any 
perceived 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
were 
heavily 
outweighed 
by 
the 
serious 
risks 
and 
threat 
posed 
to 
the 
environment 
and 
public 
safety. 
He 
acknowledged, 
however, 
that 
other 
countries 
did 
not 
share 
those 
views. 
12. 
Ireland 
had 
not 
exercised 
its 
right 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power, 
yet 
it 
derived 
considerable 
benefit 
from 
its 
membership 
in 
the 
Agency 
in 
other 
ways. 
It 
greatly 
valued 
the 
pioneering 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
human 
health 
and 
other 
nuclear 
applications. 
It 
valued 
the 
high 
quality 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
research 
and 
the 
opportunity 
to 
participate 
in 
its 
work 
at 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
other 
conferences 
and 
meetings.

13. 
The 
Agency 
also 
provided 
the 
necessary 
framework 
for 
cooperative 
efforts 
to 
build 
and 
strengthen 
an 
international 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regime, 
which 
included 
advisory 
international 
standards, 
codes 
and 
guides, 
binding 
international 
conventions, 
international 
peer 
reviews 
and 
an 
international 
system 
of 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
providing 
for 
the 
implementation 
and 
coordination 
of 
those 
standards 
in 
Member 
States, 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
bilateral 
agreements 
as 
appropriate. 
Ireland 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
concluded 
a 
bilateral 
agreement 
in 
December 
2004 
under 
Article 
9 
of 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention. 
14. 
As 
a 
non-nuclear 
coastal 
State, 
Ireland 
had 
a 
particular 
interest 
in 
the 
safety 
of 
shipments 
of 
radioactive 
material 
passing 
through 
the 
common 
marine 
environment 
it 
shared. 
Given 
the 
risks 
posed 
and 
public 
concerns 
about 
such 
shipments, 
coastal 
States 
needed 
to 
be 
fully 
informed 
of 
such 
transports 
near 
their 
coasts 
so 
that 
they 
could 
assess 
the 
risks 
and 
take 
appropriate 
emergency 
preparedness 
measures. 
Building 
on 
the 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Transport 
of 
Radioactive 
Material 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
March 
2004, 
a 
number 
of 
meetings 
on 
that 
issue 
had 
taken 
place 
between 
concerned 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States, 
most 
recently 
in 
July 
2005. 
Ireland 
was 
seeking 
to 
strengthen 
and 
deepen 
that 
dialogue, 
with 
Agency 
involvement, 
and 
hoped 
to 
see 
common 
understandings 
developed 
regarding 
how 
intergovernmental 
communications 
related 
to 
safe 
maritime 
transports 
could 
be 
improved. 
It 
was 
also 
actively 
involved 
in 
other 
Agency 
bodies 
such 
as 
INLEX. 
15. 
Ireland 
was 
particularly 
concerned 
about 
the 
management 
of 
nuclear 
waste. 
Its 
deliberate 
discharge 
into 
the 
terrestrial 
and 
marine 
environment, 
causing 
contamination 
both 
in 
the 
immediate 
surroundings 
and 
further 
afield, 
was 
wrong 
and 
thus 
not 
an 
acceptable 
waste 
management 
option. 
He 
accordingly 
welcomed 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
among 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
OSPAR 
Convention 
to 
eliminate 
radioactive 
marine 
discharges 
in 
the 
North-East 
Atlantic 
and 
strongly 
supported 
the 
further 
implementation 
of 
the 
International 
Action 
Plan 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
He 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision 
the 
previous 
week 
to 
approve 
a 
Plan 
of 
Activities 
on 
the 
Radiation 
Protection 
of 
the 
Environment, 
which 
would 
focus 
necessary 
attention 
on 
the 
protection 
of 
plant 
and 
animal 
life 
and 
on 
the 
question 
whether 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
revise 
or 
add 
to 
existing 
safety 
standards, 
which 
currently 
addressed 
only 
human 
health. 
16. 
Given 
the 
potentially 
devastating 
consequences 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
equipment 
or 
technology 
falling 
into 
the 
wrong 
hands, 
nuclear 
security 
needed 
to 
be 
a 
key 
priority 
for 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
recognized 
that 
the 
first 
line 
of 
defence 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
was 
the 
strong 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
materials. 
Ireland 
therefore 
warmly 
welcomed 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Conference 
to 
Consider 
and 
Adopt 
Proposed 
Amendments 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material 
held 
in 
July. 
It 
intended 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendments 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
urged 
all 
other 
States 
Parties 
to 
do 
likewise. 
17. 
He 
also 
welcomed 
the 
BoardÂs 
recent 
approval 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
and 
supported 
the 
call 
on 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
to 
which 
Ireland 
had 
made 
voluntary 
contributions 
totalling 
over 
Â86 
000 
since 
its 
inception 
in 
2002 
and 
to 
which 
it 
expected 
to 
make 
a 
further 
payment 
in 
the 
coming 
weeks. 
18. 
Ireland 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
in 
particular 
its 
role 
in 
upgrading 
safety 
in 
beneficiary 
States. 
It 
endorsed 
activities 
in 
the 
broad 
area 
of 
non-power 
nuclear 
applications 
and 
had 
paid 
its 
full 
assessed 
contribution 
for 
2005. 
19. 
While 
the 
perspective 
of 
individual 
Member 
States 
might 
vary 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
all 
of 
its 
three 
pillars, 
all 
Member 
States 
had 
an 
interest 
in 
supporting 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
helping 
it 
to 
discharge 
its 
basic 
mission. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
helping 
to 
maintain 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
was 
currently 
as 
vital 
as 
it 
had 
ever 
been. 
The 
Agency 
was 
also 
an 
important 
catalyst 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
culture 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Ireland 
would

continue 
to 
engage 
constructively 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
support 
of 
the 
unstinting 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff. 


20. 
Mr. 
SOTIROPOULOS 
(Greece), 
noting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
contributing 
to 
nuclear 
research 
in 
medicine, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
education, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
Agency, 
which, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
major 
international 
partners 
like 
WHO, 
FAO, 
UNESCO 
and 
others, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
major 
donors, 
had 
provided 
training, 
experts 
and 
equipment 
to 
assist 
national 
and 
regional 
efforts 
to 
sustain 
the 
intensification 
of 
crop 
production 
systems, 
improve 
cancer 
therapy, 
address 
other 
human 
health 
problems 
and 
combat 
hunger 
and 
malnutrition. 
The 
Agency 
had 
cooperated 
with 
other 
institutions 
to 
improve 
the 
availability 
of 
water 
resources, 
so 
crucial 
for 
the 
world's 
sustainable 
development, 
and 
to 
protect 
the 
marine 
coastal 
environment. 
21. 
The 
safe 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
related 
nuclear 
facilities 
around 
the 
world 
required 
the 
preservation 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
and 
Greece 
highly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
in 
giving 
high 
priority 
to 
it 
in 
all 
programme 
areas. 
22. 
As 
to 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
Greece 
recognized 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
energy 
to 
meet 
the 
worldÂs 
requirements 
and 
improve 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
peoples. 
However, 
it 
would 
prefer 
the 
Agency 
to 
concentrate 
on 
resolving 
issues 
of 
economic 
performance, 
security, 
waste 
management 
and 
proliferation 
resistance, 
leaving 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
to 
the 
individual 
sovereign 
States. 
23. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
were 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to 
Greece, 
which 
had 
always 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
all 
aspects 
of 
that 
pillar 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
having 
joined 
the 
Incident 
Reporting 
System 
for 
Research 
Reactors 
and 
ratified 
all 
the 
conventions 
related 
to 
nuclear 
safety. 
In 
May, 
the 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(GAEC) 
had 
participated 
in 
an 
Agency-organized 
international 
exercise 
for 
radiological 
accidents, 
code-named 
CONVEX-3. 
24. 
Greece 
endorsed 
the 
Agency's 
efforts 
to 
establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
global 
safety 
regime 
and 
therefore 
supported 
the 
development 
and 
strengthening 
of 
safety 
standards 
covering 
the 
whole 
spectrum 
of 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities 
and 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
number 
of 
action 
plans, 
including 
the 
international 
Action 
Plan 
on 
the 
Decommissioning 
of 
Nuclear 
Facilities. 
Several 
safety 
reports 
had 
already 
been 
published 
on 
decommissioning 
and 
a 
large 
international 
conference 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
GAEC 
was 
to 
take 
place 
in 
Athens 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
December 
2006. 
He 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
maintain 
and 
step 
up 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
the 
safety 
area 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
implementation 
of 
its 
safety 
standards 
by 
all 
States 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
other 
international 
and 
multinational 
organizations. 
25. 
The 
Greek 
Government 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
security. 
International 
terrorism 
was 
now 
more 
far-reaching 
and 
more 
ruthlessly 
planned 
than 
ever, 
with 
sub-State 
actors 
showing 
that 
they 
were 
ready 
to 
attack 
any 
target. 
Greece 
had 
already 
provided 
a 
financial 
contribution 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
and 
contributions 
in 
kind, 
for 
example 
three 
seminars 
on 
security 
issues 
being 
held 
in 
Athens 
in 
November 
with 
Agency 
and 
EU 
support. 
The 
topics 
would 
include 
training 
on 
advanced 
detection 
equipment 
for 
combating 
illicit 
trafficking. 
Greece 
fully 
supported 
all 
Agency 
activities 
related 
to 
protection 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
considered 
the 
Agency's 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council's 
Counter-Terrorism 
Committee, 
Interpol, 
the 
WCO, 
Europol, 
the 
OSCE 
and 
the 
EU 
to 
be 
essential. 
It 
had 
also 
signed 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
amendments 
approved 
by 
the 
Conference 
to 
Consider 
and 
Adopt 
Proposed 
Amendments 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material 
in 
July. 
26. 
He 
recognized 
the 
high 
value 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Security 
held 
in 
London 
in 
March 
2005 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
achieving 
comprehensive 
security 
and 
eliminating 
the 
high 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material 
worldwide 
which 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 

GC(49)/OR.8

the 
international 
community, 
including 
that 
of 
Sub-State 
actors 
acquiring 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
to 
achieve 
their 
malicious 
purposes. 


27. 
Greece 
welcomed 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
AssemblyÂs 
adoption 
by 
consensus 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
was 
a 
vital 
step 
forward. 
Its 
implementation 
would 
prevent 
terrorist 
groups 
from 
gaining 
access 
to 
the 
most 
lethal 
weapons 
known 
to 
humanity 
and 
strengthen 
the 
international 
legal 
framework 
against 
terrorism. 
28. 
The 
previous 
year, 
the 
GAEC, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
Greek 
customs 
and 
under 
the 
Second 
Line 
of 
Defence 
programme 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy, 
had 
installed 
at 
GreeceÂs 
borders 
state-of-the-art 
technology 
to 
detect 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
materials. 
The 
Greek 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
sustainability 
of 
that 
large-scale 
project 
and 
had 
allotted 
significant 
funds 
to 
it. 
All 
Greek 
authorities 
involved 
had 
the 
appropriate 
personnel 
and 
the 
technical 
infrastructure 
to 
support 
the 
programme. 
The 
GAEC 
was 
contributing 
its 
know-how 
to 
ensure 
smooth 
operation 
of 
the 
systems 
and 
had 
undertaken 
the 
responsibility 
to 
provide 
continuous 
training 
to 
customs 
officers 
as 
well 
as 
to 
maintain 
and 
calibrate 
the 
equipment 
installed. 
29. 
As 
the 
past 
few 
years 
had 
shown, 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
continuously 
under 
stress 
on 
multiple 
fronts, 
for 
various 
reasons. 
The 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
the 
lack 
of 
any 
substantive 
progress 
in 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
regional 
instabilities 
were 
among 
the 
causes 
for 
concern. 
The 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
a 
prime 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Agency, 
required 
urgent 
corrective 
actions 
and 
full 
support 
to 
strengthen 
it 
even 
further. 
30. 
Greece 
reiterated 
its 
strong 
commitment 
to 
a 
universal 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
its 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
role. 
Reliable 
verification, 
which 
was 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to 
curbing 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
required 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
be 
universally 
in 
force 
so 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
conduct 
all 
necessary 
verification 
and 
evaluation 
activities. 
Such 
universal 
application 
would 
provide 
assurances 
that 
atomic 
energy 
was 
being 
used 
peacefully 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
would 
thus 
foster 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity. 
31. 
His 
country 
endorsed 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative 
and 
the 
principles 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
regarding 
enhanced 
information 
cooperation 
and 
fully 
supported 
the 
efforts 
being 
undertaken 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
NSG 
control 
regime. 
32. 
Greece 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
fuel 
conversion 
programme 
for 
the 
GRR-1 
research 
reactor. 
Conversion 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
the 
reactor 
was 
operating 
on 
LEU 
fuel. 
All 
HEU 
spent 
fuel 
would 
soon 
be 
shipped 
back 
to 
the 
United 
States. 
33. 
The 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and, 
in 
particular, 
of 
sensitive 
technologies 
should 
be 
only 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
should 
not 
be 
used 
as 
a 
tool 
for 
enhancing 
national 
prestige 
or 
as 
a 
pretext 
for 
national 
military 
expansion 
with 
the 
argument 
of 
regional 
instability. 
Nuclear 
military 
ambitions 
served 
exactly 
the 
opposite 
purpose. 
International 
relations 
should 
be 
based 
on 
mutual 
understanding, 
multilateral 
dialogue 
and 
well-established 
diplomatic 
methods. 
34. 
Greece 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
establish 
an 
expert 
group 
to 
study 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
achieving 
multilateral 
control 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
group 
had 
already 
presented 
its 
results 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
year; 
it 
remained 
for 
Member 
States 
to 
discuss 
them 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
That 
issue 
was 
one 
of 
the 
main 
sources 
of 
disagreement 
between 
the 
haves 
and 
the 
have-nots, 
and 
a 
common 
understanding 
was 
very 
essential 
and 
urgent.

35. 
Greece 
supported 
the 
principle 
of 
creating 
an 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification, 
as 
approved 
in 
June 
2005 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
strengthening 
the 
Agency's 
safeguards 
systems. 
He 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
participating 
in 
the 
Committee. 
36. 
His 
country 
was 
both 
a 
donor 
and, 
to 
a 
lesser 
degree, 
a 
recipient 
of 
technical 
assistance, 
fully 
appreciating 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
worldwide 
promotion 
of 
scientific, 
technological 
and 
regulatory 
capabilities 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
participating 
Member 
States 
through 
technology 
transfer 
and 
capacity-
building. 
Greece 
contributed 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
assisted 
the 
Agency 
by 
offering 
training 
for 
Agency 
fellows, 
providing 
experts 
and 
hosting 
and 
supporting 
events 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
37. 
The 
GAEC, 
after 
the 
successful 
organization 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
postgraduate 
course 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
2003, 
had 
become 
a 
regional 
training 
centre 
in 
that 
area 
and 
would 
continue 
organizing 
that 
course 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
38. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities. 
Greece 
supported 
every 
measure 
to 
ensure 
that 
its 
projects 
achieved 
meaningful 
and 
sustained 
benefits 
to 
Member 
States. 
However, 
programme 
planning 
must 
remain 
the 
prerogative 
of 
individual 
Member 
States, 
which 
in 
turn 
must 
ensure 
that 
the 
projects 
selected 
had 
strong 
government 
support. 
Technical 
cooperation 
projects 
needed 
to 
form 
a 
network 
of 
partnership, 
primarily 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States, 
but 
also 
including 
partners 
from 
other 
governmental 
institutions, 
relevant 
United 
Nations 
agencies, 
NGOs 
and 
private-sector 
donors. 
They 
should 
focus 
on 
putting 
advanced 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
work 
for 
meeting 
the 
economic 
and 
social 
needs 
of 
developing 
countries. 
39. 
Ms. 
WIJEWARDANE 
(Sri 
Lanka) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate 
and 
to 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
work, 
such 
as 
the 
development 
and 
application 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology 
transfer, 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
activities 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
standards. 
As 
a 
developing 
Member 
State, 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
benefited 
in 
particular 
from 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
which 
had 
contributed 
substantially 
to 
the 
well-being 
and 
betterment 
of 
the 
lives 
of 
millions 
of 
people 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
other 
parts 
of 
the 
world. 
She 
encouraged 
adequate 
funding 
for 
those 
activities 
and 
equal 
emphasis 
on 
them. 
40. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2004 
outlined 
activities 
undertaken 
against 
a 
background 
of 
global 
developments 
which 
had 
resulted 
in 
great 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
for 
the 
Agency. 
Important 
work 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
promoting 
and 
meeting 
the 
growing 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
developing 
countries 
now 
accounted 
for 
60% 
of 
the 
new 
reactors 
under 
construction. 
Nevertheless, 
while 
recognizing 
the 
growing 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power, 
including 
its 
potential 
economic 
value 
and 
its 
environmental 
benefits 
under 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol, 
Sri 
Lanka 
was 
concerned 
about 
its 
possible 
safety 
hazards 
and 
its 
security 
and 
proliferation 
dimensions. 
41. 
Sri 
Lanka 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
work 
carried 
out 
to 
increase 
Member 
StatesÂ 
capabilities 
in 
the 
development 
and 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
human 
health, 
water 
resources 
management, 
the 
environment 
and 
industrial 
applications. 
That 
important 
dimension 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
complemented 
her 
countryÂs 
social 
and 
economic 
development 
goals. 
42. 
She 
welcomed 
the 
continuing 
emphasis 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
the 
maintenance 
of 
an 
effective 
and 
transparent 
global 
framework 
based 
on 
strong 
national 
safety 
infrastructure. 
Sri 
Lanka 
recognized 
the 
synergies 
between 
nuclear 
safety, 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safeguards. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
global 
realities 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
it 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
activities 
and 
welcomed 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006-2009. 
Nuclear 
security 
was 
an 
issue 
of 
relevance 
to 
all 
States, 
not 
only 
those 
with 
large 
nuclear 
programmes. 
Sri 
Lanka 
endorsed 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
CPPNM 
by

the 
amendments 
adopted 
in 
July, 
and 
also 
considered 
the 
Agency's 
assistance 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
to 
be 
of 
practical 
benefit 
to 
Member 
States. 


43. 
Concerning 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
conclusions 
for 
2004, 
she 
noted 
that 
safeguards 
had 
been 
applied 
in 
152 
States 
and 
that 
in 
States 
which 
had 
failed 
to 
report 
nuclear 
activity 
to 
the 
Agency, 
corrective 
actions 
were 
being 
taken 
and 
verification 
was 
in 
progress. 
44. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
key 
dimension 
of 
Sri 
LankaÂs 
partnership 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
she 
was 
encouraged 
that 
resources 
for 
the 
TCF 
had 
increased 
in 
2004. 
Extensive 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
had 
begun 
in 
2004, 
in 
conjunction 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
cycle. 
She 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
restructuring, 
which 
would 
eliminate 
uncertainties 
that 
could 
negatively 
impact 
the 
programmeÂs 
substantive 
work. 
45. 
The 
Annual 
Report 
highlighted 
that 
an 
important 
change 
in 
Member 
State 
financial 
contributions 
had 
been 
made 
with 
the 
replacement 
of 
APCs 
by 
NPCs. 
The 
change 
had 
been 
implemented 
on 
a 
trial 
basis 
and 
its 
effectiveness 
would 
be 
reviewed. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
requirement 
that 
NPCs 
be 
paid 
prior 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
projects 
did 
not 
have 
an 
adverse 
impact 
on 
the 
delivery 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
46. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
paid 
its 
NPCs 
in 
full 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
year 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
the 
tsunami 
disaster 
of 
26 
December 
2004. 
The 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
been 
successful 
in 
keeping 
the 
inventories 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
irradiation 
apparatus 
intact 
within 
the 
areas 
affected 
by 
the 
tsunami. 
47. 
In 
2004, 
the 
implementation 
rate 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
dropped 
by 
comparison 
with 
previous 
years. 
The 
reason 
for 
that 
drop 
should 
be 
examined 
to 
enable 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
maintain 
higher 
levels 
of 
implementation. 
48. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
significantly 
benefited 
from 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
by 
acquiring 
the 
capability 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
industry. 
Projects 
fulfilling 
the 
central 
criteria 
and 
having 
a 
high 
impact 
on 
socio-economic 
development 
had 
been 
selected, 
targeting 
such 
issues 
as 
improvement 
of 
the 
quality 
of 
radiotherapy 
services 
provided 
in 
cancer 
hospitals, 
diagnosis 
of 
major 
infectious 
diseases 
through 
the 
use 
of 
molecular 
diagnostic 
techniques, 
assessment 
of 
pesticide 
contamination 
of 
surface 
water 
and 
groundwater 
for 
judicious 
application 
of 
agrochemicals, 
and 
safety 
and 
sustainability 
of 
dams 
built 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
for 
irrigation 
and 
hydropower. 
49. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
also 
established 
a 
partnership 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
cancer 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment, 
and 
it 
appreciated 
the 
Agency's 
effort 
in 
developing 
the 
PACT 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
with 
sound 
national 
cancer 
control 
programmes. 
The 
strategic 
partnership 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
WHO 
was 
also 
important 
for 
mobilizing 
funds 
and 
obtaining 
greater 
credibility 
for 
Agency 
activities 
in 
cancer 
therapy. 
50. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
institutesÂ 
self-reliance 
and 
sustainability 
through 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
were 
in 
line 
with 
the 
policies 
of 
Sri 
LankaÂs 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority, 
the 
national 
institute 
responsible 
for 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
the 
focal 
point 
of 
Agency 
programmes. 
The 
Authority 
had 
been 
able 
to 
generate 
50Â60% 
of 
its 
operational 
expenses 
in 
2004. 
51. 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
improve 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
management 
infrastructure. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
programme 
since 
the 
original 
interregional 
Model 
Project 
INT/9/143 
had 
been 
launched 
in 
1994 
and 
in 
subsequent 
regional 
Model 
Projects. 
It 
had 
achieved 
the 
ProjectÂs 
first 
two 
milestones. 
Regarding 
milestones 
3 
to 
5, 
the 
need 
for

further 
assistance 
had 
been 
identified 
and 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
Agency's 
consideration 
of 
further 
support. 


52. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
become 
party 
to 
the 
RCA 
in 
1976 
and 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
its 
programmes, 
which 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
establishing 
national 
programmes 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
mainly 
in 
the 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
industrial 
sectors. 
Many 
programmes 
initiated 
through 
the 
RCA 
had 
been 
developed 
into 
national 
programmes 
through 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Sri 
Lankan 
Government 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
its 
people. 
Sri 
Lanka 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
approach 
to 
foster 
regional 
cooperation. 
Members 
of 
her 
delegation 
also 
believed 
that 
regional 
cooperative 
agreements 
were 
effective 
mechanisms 
through 
which 
transboundary 
issues 
in 
safety 
and 
security 
could 
be 
addressed. 
53. 
In 
conclusion, 
Sri 
Lanka 
reaffirmed 
its 
fullest 
cooperation 
and 
support 
for 
the 
Agency's 
efforts 
to 
further 
peace, 
development 
and 
prosperity 
through 
effective 
utilization 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
54. 
Mr. 
KIRAKOSSIAN 
(Armenia), 
noting 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
growing 
demand 
for 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
often 
declared 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
international 
treaties 
and 
conventions 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
of 
non-proliferation. 
Its 
ratification 
the 
previous 
year 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
was 
explicit 
evidence 
of 
its 
serious 
approach 
to 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Its 
adherence 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
joint 
efforts 
in 
combating 
terrorism 
was 
shown 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
of 
Armenia 
had 
recently 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
55. 
Armenian 
national 
legislation 
in 
the 
nuclear 
domain 
had 
been 
improved 
significantly. 
The 
National 
Assembly 
had 
adopted 
a 
number 
of 
reforms 
to 
the 
national 
law 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
aimed 
at 
upgrading 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
at 
Metsamor 
and 
the 
verification 
regime. 
Armenia 
had 
also 
signed 
the 
Final 
Act 
of 
the 
conference 
to 
amend 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
its 
ratification 
was 
in 
process. 
The 
Government 
paid 
great 
attention 
to 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
the 
Metsamor 
plant: 
an 
IPPAS 
mission 
had 
taken 
place 
there 
whose 
report 
would 
be 
ready 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2005. 
The 
Armenian 
authorities 
would 
follow 
the 
recommendations 
made 
in 
that 
report 
and 
take 
action 
to 
upgrade 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
the 
plant. 
56. 
An 
OSART 
mission 
to 
Armenia 
was 
to 
take 
place 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Armenia 
hoped 
to 
finalize 
its 
report, 
with 
all 
relevant 
findings 
and 
recommendations, 
in 
2006. 
57. 
The 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
visited 
by 
an 
average 
of 
more 
than 
30 
different 
missions 
and 
inspections 
each 
year. 
Armenia 
had 
reported 
on 
it 
to 
the 
third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
The 
assessment 
of 
the 
Metsamor 
plant's 
safety 
and 
security 
had 
been 
considered 
satisfactory 
and 
several 
recommendations 
had 
been 
made 
which 
would 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
during 
its 
future 
operation. 
Armenia 
would 
continue 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
transparent 
and 
open 
way. 
58. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
events 
of 
the 
year 
had 
been 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
visit 
to 
Armenia. 
He 
had 
met 
the 
President, 
Prime 
Minister, 
Minister 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs 
and 
Minister 
of 
Energy. 
He 
had 
also 
visited 
the 
Metsamor 
plant 
and 
the 
oncological 
centre. 
Discussions 
had 
been 
very 
open, 
constructive 
and 
efficient. 
Armenian 
authorities 
had 
expressed 
their 
deep 
satisfaction 
with 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
confirmed 
that 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
Metsamor 
plant 
was 
the 
most 
important 
issue 
and 
that 
in 
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
continue 
to 
upgrade 
its 
safety, 
additional 
funds 
were 
needed. 
He 
had 
promised 
to 
seek 
additional 
extrabudgetary 
funds 
for 
that 
purpose.

59. 
The 
future 
of 
the 
national 
energy 
policy 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
main 
topics 
of 
the 
discussions. 
Both 
the 
President 
and 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
said 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
very 
important 
for 
Armenia 
since 
it 
supplied 
about 
40% 
of 
actual 
demand, 
thus 
making 
the 
country 
relatively 
independent 
in 
terms 
of 
energy 
supply. 
The 
Metsamor 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
also 
of 
regional 
significance 
as 
it 
would 
be 
able 
to 
supply 
neighbouring 
countries 
which 
had 
shortages 
of 
electricity. 
60. 
However, 
owing 
to 
the 
unstable 
political 
situation 
in 
the 
region, 
Armenia 
could 
not 
rely 
on 
uninterrupted 
fuel 
supply 
for 
its 
thermal 
plants, 
and 
hydroelectric 
energy, 
in 
the 
most 
optimistic 
scenario, 
could 
cover 
only 
25% 
of 
national 
demand. 
Preliminary 
estimates 
showed 
that, 
based 
on 
sustained 
GDP 
growth 
and 
present 
rates 
of 
consumption, 
Armenia 
would 
need 
four 
times 
more 
power 
in 
2020. 
Therefore 
it 
must 
seriously 
consider 
the 
possibility 
of 
constructing 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
Â 
an 
intention 
that 
was 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
International 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
in 
Paris, 
which 
had 
stressed 
the 
rapid 
growth 
of 
energy 
demand 
along 
with 
a 
desire 
to 
ensure 
the 
security 
of 
energy 
supply. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
promised 
Agency 
assistance 
in 
the 
feasibility 
study 
for 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
plant. 
61. 
Armenia 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
its 
continuous 
assistance 
in 
different 
fields. 
In 
particular, 
significant 
assistance 
had 
been 
provided 
to 
the 
oncological 
centre. 
A 
follow-up 
project 
was 
foreseen 
for 
2006Â2007, 
and 
after 
its 
termination, 
Armenia 
would 
have 
a 
fully 
equipped 
medical 
service 
for 
its 
citizens. 
Another 
important 
area 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
was 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Armenian 
National 
Regulatory 
Agency, 
which 
provided 
a 
strong 
and 
independent 
verification 
regime 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
radioactive 
sources. 
62. 
His 
country 
was 
deeply 
satisfied 
with 
its 
bilateral 
cooperation 
with 
other 
Member 
States. 
The 
United 
States, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
France, 
Slovakia, 
the 
Czech 
Republic, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
Bulgaria 
were 
constant 
partners. 
With 
their 
assistance, 
projects 
had 
been 
undertaken 
to 
upgrade 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
the 
Metsamor 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
He 
hoped 
that 
collaboration 
would 
continue. 
Ms. 
Wijewardane 
(Sri 
Lanka), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


63. 
Mr. 
CHONG 
(Singapore) 
said 
that 
the 
NPT 
remained 
the 
foundation 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
full 
and 
non-selective 
implementation 
of 
its 
objectives, 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
64. 
Over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
the 
NPT 
had 
faced 
serious 
challenges 
which 
had 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
it 
to 
be 
underpinned 
by 
a 
strong 
safeguards 
regime. 
There 
was 
currently 
significant 
potential 
for 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
given 
the 
discovery 
of 
a 
sophisticated 
and 
clandestine 
nuclear 
procurement 
network; 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
access 
to 
sensitive 
technology; 
and 
the 
complications 
that 
could 
arise 
from 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
While 
the 
Agency 
safeguarded 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
it 
also 
needed 
to 
ensure 
that 
such 
a 
right 
was 
exercised 
in 
compliance 
with 
States' 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
Article 
II 
of 
the 
NPT. 
65. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
central 
role 
to 
play 
in 
combating 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
needed 
to 
remain 
capable 
of 
responding 
to 
new 
challenges 
within 
its 
mandate. 
Singapore 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
of 
an 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification. 
It 
also 
agreed 
that 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
should 
be 
the 
new 
standard 
for 
safeguards 
verification 
so 
as 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Singapore 
had 
signed 
its 
additional 
protocol 
on 
22 
September 
as 
a 
reflection 
of 
its 
strong 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation. 
It 
supported 
the 
Board's 
decision 
to 
mandate 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
enter 
into 
negotiations 
with 
SQP 
States 
to 
modify 
their 
SQPs 
and 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
conclude 
only 
modified 
SQPs 
with 
eligible 
States 
henceforth.

States 
themselves 
also 
needed 
to 
enhance 
international 
cooperation 
to 
counter 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
Singapore 
supported 
the 
full 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
which, 
inter 
alia, 
called 
on 
United 
Nations 
Member 
States 
to 
enhance 
domestic 
controls 
and 
step 
up 
cooperation 
against 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
While 
legally 
binding 
multilateralism 
needed 
to 
be 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
other 
multi-country 
initiatives 
such 
as 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative 
were 
important 
elements 
in 
international 
counter-proliferation 
efforts. 
67. 
The 
Agency's 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
addressed 
several 
cases 
of 
proliferation 
concern 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years. 
On 
24 
September, 
the 
Board 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
on 
Iran. 
He 
urged 
that 
country 
to 
heed 
the 
Board's 
calls 
and 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
return 
to 
the 
process 
of 
dialogue 
and 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
matters 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
resolution. 
68. 
The 
joint 
statement 
on 
the 
DPRK 
resulting 
from 
the 
six-party 
talks 
held 
in 
Beijing 
was 
a 
significant 
step 
forward. 
Patience, 
perseverance 
and 
the 
political 
will 
of 
the 
parties 
had 
been 
the 
key 
ingredients 
of 
the 
outcome. 
Singapore 
welcomed 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
joint 
statement 
and 
encouraged 
continued 
progress 
in 
its 
implementation. 
69. 
There 
was 
a 
clear 
trend 
towards 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
developing 
world, 
particularly 
in 
Asia, 
as 
energy 
needs 
increased. 
A 
strong 
emphasis 
was 
therefore 
needed 
on 
effective 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regimes. 
Singapore 
strongly 
commended 
and 
endorsed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
adherence 
to 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
and 
guidelines. 
He 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
effective 
use 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
review 
services 
and 
other 
forms 
of 
assistance 
to 
raise 
nuclear 
safety 
standards 
and 
uphold 
an 
effective 
nuclear 
safety 
culture. 
It 
was 
incumbent 
upon 
States 
to 
establish 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
that 
would 
support 
credible 
national 
nuclear 
safety 
regimes. 
70. 
While 
ensuring 
nuclear 
safety 
ultimately 
remained 
the 
national 
responsibility 
of 
States, 
the 
cross-border 
implications 
of 
radiological 
fallout 
made 
nuclear 
safety 
very 
much 
a 
transnational 
concern. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
transboundary 
emergency 
preparedness 
capability, 
including 
appropriate 
regional 
cooperation. 
Such 
efforts 
also 
needed 
to 
include 
aspects 
related 
to 
radiological 
terrorism. 
71. 
Singapore 
firmly 
supported 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
had 
consistently 
contributed 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF. 
He 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
expanded 
and 
improved 
its 
management 
and 
delivery 
of 
technical 
assistance 
projects. 
The 
needs-
driven 
approach 
adopted 
by 
the 
Agency 
together 
with 
the 
Member 
States 
targeted 
the 
particular 
concerns 
identified 
by 
Member 
States 
while 
optimizing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
financial 
resources. 
Singapore 
looked 
forward 
to 
further 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
bilateral 
technical 
cooperation 
initiatives 
and 
supported 
the 
Agency's 
promotion 
of 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
72. 
Singapore 
had 
supported 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
its 
three 
pillars 
of 
promoting 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
and 
nuclear 
verification 
and 
safeguards. 
He 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
give 
their 
full 
cooperation 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
comply 
fully 
and 
transparently 
with 
their 
obligations. 
73. 
Mr. 
AMHA 
(Ethiopia) 
said 
his 
country 
had 
been 
engaged 
in 
a 
number 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
that 
applied 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
address 
various 
socio-economic 
development 
problems 
in 
agriculture 
(crop 
breeding, 
animal 
productivity 
and 
health); 
human 
health 
(nuclear 
medicine, 
radiotherapy, 
drug 
resistance 
in 
tuberculosis, 
malaria 
and 
HIV/AIDS); 
water 
resources 
management; 
non-destructive 
testing; 
energy 
planning; 
nuclear 
instrumentation; 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
Not 
only 
had 
the 
number 
of 
active 
national 
projects 
increased 
from 
three 
in 
2003Â2004 
to 
five 
in 
2005Â2006, 
but 
the 
content 
and 
depth 
of 
the 
projects 
had 
shown 
remarkable 
transformation. 
As 
a 
rule, 
in 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Ethiopia 
had 
pursued 
an 
approach 
focused 
on 
areas 
of 
high 
relevance 
for 

GC(49)/OR.8

socio-economic 
development 
objectives. 
The 
untiring 
efforts 
of 
Agency 
staff 
who 
had 
worked 
hard 
toward 
the 
positive 
development 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
between 
Ethiopia 
and 
the 
Agency 
would 
lead 
to 
rewarding 
results 
in 
the 
small 
number 
of 
areas 
pragmatically 
selected. 


74. 
The 
project 
aimed 
at 
eradicating 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
from 
the 
southern 
Rift 
Valley 
of 
Ethiopia 
using 
an 
area-wide 
integrated 
pest 
management 
approach 
with 
wide 
community 
participation 
and 
technical 
support 
from 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
initiated 
in 
1997 
with 
serious 
commitments 
from 
both 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government 
and 
the 
Agency. 
The 
two 
major 
components 
of 
the 
project 
were 
establishment 
of 
a 
centrally 
operated 
sterile 
insect 
production 
plant 
and 
actual 
field 
operation 
with 
fly 
population 
control 
followed 
by 
ultimate 
eradication. 
Although 
the 
commitment 
from 
both 
sides 
had 
been 
enormous, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
project 
was 
a 
pilot 
and 
learning 
project 
had 
meant 
that 
there 
were 
daunting 
challenges 
to 
implementation. 
However, 
the 
problems 
faced 
had 
only 
increased 
Ethiopia's 
resolution 
to 
make 
the 
project 
a 
reality. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Government 
had 
concluded 
a 
loan 
and 
grant 
agreement 
of 
over 
US 
$14 
million 
for 
six 
years 
with 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank, 
a 
measure 
which 
showed 
that 
a 
problem 
of 
the 
highest 
priority 
was 
being 
addressed. 
75. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
human 
health, 
Ethiopia 
had 
managed 
to 
build 
a 
modest 
infrastructure 
for 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
services 
through 
its 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency. 
However, 
the 
fact 
that 
it 
had 
only 
one 
reconditioned 
gamma 
camera 
that 
had 
served 
it 
for 
nearly 
20 
years 
and 
an 
old 
60Co 
machine 
for 
a 
population 
of 
more 
than 
71 
million 
showed 
that 
there 
was 
a 
long 
way 
yet 
to 
go. 
76. 
Turning 
to 
the 
area 
of 
water 
resources 
management, 
he 
said 
that 
Ethiopia 
was 
identified 
as 
the 
Âwater 
towerÂ 
of 
North-East 
Africa. 
It 
was 
thus 
paradoxical 
that 
the 
country 
was 
suffering 
from 
recurrent 
drought, 
and 
from 
famine 
caused 
mainly 
by 
water 
scarcity. 
The 
lowlands 
that 
constituted 
a 
substantial 
part 
of 
the 
country 
depended 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
on 
groundwater 
resources 
for 
their 
domestic 
and 
even 
agricultural 
water 
supply. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
groundwater 
resource 
potential 
had 
not 
been 
well 
studied 
and 
documented 
had 
caused 
problems 
for 
the 
economic 
and 
sustainable 
exploitation 
of 
the 
groundwater, 
even 
though 
in 
some 
dry 
areas 
it 
was 
the 
only 
viable 
option 
for 
meeting 
the 
growing 
demand 
for 
potable 
water. 
Technical 
cooperation 
to 
apply 
isotope 
techniques 
in 
managing 
groundwater 
resources 
had 
enabled 
basic 
capacities 
to 
be 
built 
and 
useful 
isotopic 
data 
to 
be 
generated. 
Major 
success 
stories 
were 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
isotope 
hydrology 
laboratory 
at 
Addis 
Ababa 
University, 
a 
national 
groundwater 
database 
with 
standardized 
data 
collection 
forms 
and 
field 
methods, 
and 
training 
of 
personnel. 
Support 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
form 
of 
equipment, 
experts, 
fellowships 
and 
data 
analyses 
was 
highly 
appreciated 
by 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government. 
77. 
Ethiopia 
also 
benefited 
from 
Agency-supported 
regional 
projects. 
Useful 
data 
were 
being 
generated 
and 
encouraging 
results 
were 
being 
registered 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
mutation 
breeding 
of 
indigenous 
crops, 
improvement 
of 
milk 
and 
meat 
production, 
equitable 
use 
of 
the 
common 
Nile 
basin 
water, 
energy 
planning, 
non-destructive 
testing, 
molecular 
detection 
of 
drug 
resistance 
in 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis, 
and 
study 
of 
nutritional 
interventions 
in 
HIV/AIDS 
patients. 
78. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
wished 
to 
underline 
the 
role 
being 
played 
by 
AFRA 
in 
streamlining 
and 
coordinating 
activities 
related 
to 
various 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
techniques, 
from 
the 
inception 
of 
projects 
to 
ensuring 
sustainability 
of 
the 
results, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
TCDC, 
to 
develop 
national 
and 
regional 
strategies 
for 
human 
resources 
development 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
and 
to 
integrate 
nuclear-related 
activities 
with 
the 
flagship 
programmes 
of 
NEPAD. 
Such 
initiatives 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
mobilizing 
resources 
and 
expertise 
from 
within 
the 
region 
to 
solve 
African 
problems. 
79. 
Ethiopia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
Member 
States 
whose 
country 
cooperation 
programmes 
had 
been 
evaluated 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Office 
of 
Internal 
Oversight 
Services 
during 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2005. 
The 
evaluation 
teamÂs 
preliminary 
findings 
indicated 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
overall 
country 
programme 
in 

GC(49)/OR.8 
29 
September 
2005, 
Page 
12 


Ethiopia 
had 
been 
responsive 
to 
a 
number 
of 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
needs 
and 
priorities. 
The 
evaluation 
confirmed 
that 
a 
major 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
targeted 
areas 
and 
sectors 
with 
high 
socio-economic 
impact 
and 
critical 
importance 
for 
further 
economic 
development, 
stability 
and 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
had 
therefore 
been 
in 
line 
with 
the 
most 
important 
national 
strategies 
and 
plans 
of 
action. 


80. 
Having 
engaged 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
relevant 
nuclear 
technologies 
for 
peaceful 
applications, 
Ethiopia 
was 
now 
consolidating 
the 
capacities 
built 
through 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Sustainable 
application 
of 
the 
acquired 
technologies 
demanded 
a 
continuous 
supply 
of 
trained 
scientists 
and 
technicians, 
which 
was 
best 
achieved 
by 
training 
the 
required 
manpower 
locally. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Government 
was 
currently 
undertaking 
a 
massive 
vertical 
and 
horizontal 
expansion 
of 
higher 
education 
throughout 
the 
country, 
including 
training 
in 
nuclear 
applications 
at 
both 
undergraduate 
and 
graduate 
levels. 
Courses 
in 
isotope 
hydrology, 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiopharmacy 
were 
being 
offered 
at 
various 
faculties 
of 
Addis 
Ababa 
University. 
Preparations 
were 
also 
being 
finalized 
to 
open 
new 
short-term 
and 
postgraduate 
training 
programmes 
in 
those 
areas, 
including 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
management. 
81. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
Agency's 
founding 
members, 
Ethiopia 
was 
aware 
of 
its 
international 
responsibilities 
for 
global 
and 
regional 
security 
in 
controlling 
radioactive 
and 
other 
nuclear 
materials. 
The 
Government 
had 
accordingly 
submitted 
an 
official 
letter 
to 
the 
Agency 
expressing 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
The 
Government 
had 
already 
allocated 
the 
required 
budget 
for 
the 
design 
and 
construction 
of 
a 
central 
waste 
management 
facility 
that 
was 
currently 
lacking. 
82. 
Ethiopia 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
CTBT 
in 
line 
with 
its 
long-standing 
commitment 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
ultimately 
to 
a 
world 
free 
of 
the 
nuclear 
threat. 
83. 
Reaffirming 
the 
Ethiopian 
GovernmentÂs 
full 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotion 
of 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technologies, 
he 
pledged 
that 
Ethiopia 
would 
continue 
to 
contribute 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF, 
despite 
its 
financial 
difficulties. 
84. 
Mr. 
ELWAZER 
(Palestine) 
said 
that 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority 
had 
established 
the 
Palestinian 
Energy 
Authority 
in 
1995, 
one 
of 
whose 
principal 
departments 
was 
the 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Department. 
In 
addition 
to 
improving 
health 
services 
for 
the 
Palestinian 
people, 
it 
operated 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
environmental 
protection, 
agriculture, 
water 
supply 
and 
training 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
The 
Department 
also 
gave 
priority 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
solid 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
security 
infrastructure. 
It 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
developing 
a 
legislative 
framework 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
in 
protecting 
Palestinian 
crops 
through 
sterile 
fruit 
fly 
technology 
in 
a 
joint 
project 
with 
Jordan 
and 
Israel. 
The 
success 
of 
such 
joint 
projects 
depended 
on 
Israel 
ending 
its 
economic 
blockade 
of 
Palestinian 
territory 
so 
that 
Palestine 
could 
enjoy 
their 
benefits 
to 
the 
full. 
85. 
Palestine 
trusted 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
support 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
concepts 
for 
2007-2008 
relating 
to 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
project, 
a 
laboratory 
to 
monitor 
environmental 
radiation, 
human 
resources 
development 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
science, 
and 
enhancement 
of 
technological 
and 
human 
capacities 
in 
the 
mineral 
resources 
sector. 
86. 
The 
Palestinian 
Authority 
also 
needed 
assistance 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
consequences 
of 
IsraelÂs 
unilateral 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
Gaza 
Strip, 
which 
had 
left 
GazaÂs 
infrastructure 
and 
economy 
in 
a 
state 
of 
chaos, 
not 
to 
mention 
the 
human 
and 
material 
losses 
sustained 
by 
the 
population 
over 
the 
past 
five 
years. 
The 
Authority 
looked 
forward 
to 
closer 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
using 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
monitor 
and 
address 
the 
possible 
impact 
of 
environmental 
problems 
created 
by 
Israel.

Assistance 
was 
also 
needed 
to 
train 
specialists 
in 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
emergency 
preparedness, 
since 
most 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
population 
and 
territory 
would 
be 
in 
the 
front 
line 
in 
the 
event 
of 
any 
radiation 
or 
nuclear 
accident 
occurring 
in 
IsraelÂs 
secret 
nuclear 
installations, 
which 
it 
refused 
to 
declare 
despite 
international 
pleas 
and 
General 
Conference 
resolutions. 
Scientific 
reports 
and 
satellite 
images 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
Dimona 
reactor 
had 
entered 
a 
strategically 
critical 
phase, 
having 
reached 
the 
end 
of 
its 
assumed 
lifetime. 
According 
to 
experts, 
Dimona 
staff 
members 
and 
many 
people 
living 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the 
site 
had 
contracted 
cancer. 
Moreover, 
Israel, 
the 
worldÂs 
fifth 
largest 
nuclear 
power, 
had 
a 
stockpile 
of 
nuclear 
warheads 
that 
could 
hit 
distant 
targets. 
It 
was 
constantly 
seeking 
to 
increase 
its 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
striking 
terror 
in 
the 
hearts 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
people, 
and 
it 
continued 
to 
refuse 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Hence 
the 
question 
on 
everybodyÂs 
lips 
was: 
why 
should 
Israel 
be 
allowed 
to 
possess 
nuclear 
weapons? 
88. 
The 
UNEP 
Regional 
Office 
had 
warned 
of 
the 
radiation 
risk 
from 
the 
Dimona 
reactor. 
A 
memorandum 
circulated 
to 
the 
Arab 
States 
referred 
to 
the 
adverse 
effect 
of 
such 
radiation 
on 
human 
beings, 
animals 
and 
plants 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
the 
reactor, 
including 
Palestine 
and 
neighbouring 
Arab 
States. 
The 
memorandum 
urged 
those 
States 
to 
take 
steps 
to 
protect 
themselves 
against 
the 
risk. 
Hence 
the 
urgency 
of 
persuading 
Israel 
to 
sign 
the 
NPT, 
to 
allow 
international 
verification 
of 
its 
installations 
and 
to 
comply 
with 
relevant 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
89. 
In 
May 
2005, 
the 
WHO 
had 
adopted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Palestine 
by 
95 
votes 
to 
8. 
It 
demanded 
that 
Israel 
halt 
its 
practice 
of 
dumping 
nuclear 
waste 
in 
Palestinian 
territory 
and 
requested 
the 
WHO 
Director-General 
to 
send 
a 
fact-finding 
mission 
to 
assess 
the 
X-ray-emitting 
detection 
equipment 
used 
by 
Israel 
at 
Palestinian 
border-crossing 
points, 
since 
many 
Palestinians 
had 
been 
exposed 
to 
unjustified 
radiation, 
and 
to 
investigate 
Israeli 
waste 
dumps 
in 
Palestinian 
territory 
and 
the 
Syrian 
Golan. 
The 
resolution 
further 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
guarantee 
the 
free 
movement 
of 
medical 
personnel, 
ambulances, 
patients 
and 
medical 
supplies 
during 
and 
after 
its 
withdrawal 
from 
Gaza. 
90. 
He 
urged 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
give 
serious 
attention 
to 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
threat 
to 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
and 
to 
regional 
and 
international 
security 
and 
peace, 
and 
to 
adopt 
strongly 
worded 
resolutions 
calling 
on 
Israel 
to 
apply 
Agency 
safeguards 
immediately 
with 
a 
view 
to 
creating 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
91. 
The 
Palestinians, 
just 
like 
their 
Israeli 
neighbours, 
longed 
for 
stability 
and 
peace, 
but 
they 
were 
beginning 
to 
lose 
hope 
that 
Israel 
would 
allow 
them 
to 
exercise 
their 
right 
of 
self-determination 
and 
establish 
an 
independent 
Palestinian 
State 
with 
its 
capital 
in 
East 
Jerusalem 
Â 
especially 
since 
its 
unilateral 
withdrawal 
from 
Gaza, 
leaving 
the 
Strip 
as 
one 
big 
prison 
for 
its 
people, 
closing 
the 
borders 
with 
Egypt 
and 
preventing 
people 
from 
using 
the 
airport 
or 
from 
building 
a 
harbour. 
Israel 
still 
controlled 
the 
airspace 
over 
Gaza 
and 
had 
begun 
to 
use 
its 
terrifying 
F-16 
aircraft 
on 
one 
pretext 
or 
another, 
although 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority 
had 
announced 
that 
all 
national 
and 
Islamic 
factions 
had 
declared 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
Cairo 
agreement 
on 
a 
period 
of 
ÂcalmÂ. 
It 
was 
therefore 
incumbent 
on 
the 
international 
community, 
particularly 
the 
Quartet, 
to 
take 
swift 
action 
to 
prevent 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
region 
from 
deteriorating 
and 
to 
urge 
Israel 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
Sharm 
el-Sheikh 
understandings, 
return 
to 
negotiations 
on 
the 
internationally 
supported 
Road 
Map, 
and 
refrain 
from 
unilateral 
action 
and 
creating 
facts 
on 
the 
ground. 
Peace 
was 
a 
strategic 
choice 
for 
the 
Palestinian 
people, 
but 
unfortunately 
Israel 
had 
resumed 
its 
policy 
of 
destruction, 
targeted 
killings, 
arbitrary 
arrests, 
confiscation 
of 
land, 
building 
and 
expansion 
of 
settlements, 
and 
continued 
construction 
of 
the 
separation 
wall 
on 
confiscated 
Palestinian 
land 
although 
it 
had 
been 
condemned 
by 
the 
International 
Court 
of 
Justice. 
Israel 
was 
also 
seeking 
to 
separate 
Jerusalem 
from 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
West 
Bank, 
pursuing 
a 
policy 
of 
displacement 
and 
Judaization. 
All 
those 
policies 
would 
wreck 
the 
peace 
process, 
and 
the 
Israeli 
GovernmentÂs 
policy 
of 
destroying 
Palestinian 
civil 
society 
institutions 
and

infrastructure 
on 
trivial 
pretexts 
would 
crush 
his 
peopleÂs 
dream 
of 
building 
a 
brighter 
future 
in 
an 
independent 
Palestinian 
State. 


92. 
Lastly, 
he 
stressed 
the 
need 
to 
rid 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
especially 
nuclear 
weapons, 
as 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
international 
security 
and 
peace. 
93. 
Mr. 
BELEVAN-MCBRIDE 
(Peru) 
said 
that 
during 
the 
past 
year, 
his 
country 
had 
continued 
to 
participate 
in 
numerous 
Agency 
activities 
directed 
towards 
increasing 
the 
contribution 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
Member 
States, 
enhancing 
safety 
in 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
further 
strengthening 
the 
regime 
for 
preventing 
the 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
non-peaceful 
and 
other 
illicit 
purposes. 
In 
PeruÂs 
opinion, 
it 
was 
imperative 
that 
Member 
States 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
in 
endeavouring 
to 
achieve 
a 
balance 
between, 
on 
one 
hand, 
the 
legitimate 
right 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
engage 
in 
nuclear 
R&D 
for 
strictly 
peaceful 
purposes 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
the 
need 
to 
promote 
all 
legal 
measures 
for 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
to 
create 
truly 
effective 
mechanisms 
for 
combating 
the 
illicit 
trade 
in 
nuclear 
technologies 
that 
could 
be 
used 
in 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
94. 
All 
countries 
could 
benefit 
Â 
and 
were 
indeed 
benefiting 
Â 
from 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
developing 
countries, 
the 
benefits 
were 
particularly 
important 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
health 
care 
and 
agriculture 
and 
even 
in 
industry. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
essential 
in 
that 
connection, 
and 
Peru 
would 
like 
to 
see 
them 
expanding. 
95. 
His 
country 
remained 
strongly 
committed 
to 
the 
activities 
being 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
ARCAL 
framework 
and 
welcomed 
the 
decision 
of 
Haiti 
to 
ratify 
ARCAL, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
ARCAL 
would 
finally 
enter 
into 
force 
and 
Â 
it 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
Â 
would 
attract 
more 
support 
from 
outside 
the 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
region. 
96. 
Turning 
to 
safeguards, 
one 
of 
the 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
he 
said 
that 
Peru 
was 
rigorously 
fulfilling 
all 
the 
obligations 
arising 
out 
of 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
thereto. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
conclude 
that 
there 
were 
no 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
taking 
place 
in 
Peru, 
and 
approval 
had 
been 
given 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
there. 
97. 
By 
contrast, 
many 
countries 
had 
still 
not 
concluded 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency 
Â 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
concern 
to 
Peru, 
which 
was 
continuing 
to 
promote 
the 
conclusion 
of 
such 
agreements 
in 
all 
relevant 
forums. 
98. 
Peru 
was 
also 
very 
concerned 
about 
the 
meagre 
results 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
particularly 
about 
the 
failure 
to 
seriously 
advance 
the 
cause 
of 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
All 
NPT 
Parties 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
help 
advance 
that 
cause, 
but 
perhaps 
some 
of 
them 
more 
than 
others. 
Peru 
was 
convinced 
that, 
if 
the 
nuclear 
Powers 
began 
demonstrating, 
through 
meaningful 
actions, 
their 
determination 
to 
fulfil 
their 
NPT 
obligation 
to 
reduce 
their 
nuclear 
arsenals, 
the 
other 
NPT 
Parties 
would 
be 
more 
prepared 
to 
do 
everything 
possible 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT 
regime. 
99. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
delegation 
greatly 
regretted 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
outcome 
document 
of 
the 
recent 
High-level 
Plenary 
Meeting 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
made 
no 
clear 
reference 
to 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
In 
its 
opinion, 
an 
important 
Â 
perhaps 
unrepeatable 
Â 
opportunity 
had 
been 
missed 
of 
exploiting 
the 
symbolism 
of 
the 
United 
Nations, 
humankindÂs 
most 
successful 
venture 
directed 
towards 
the 
attainment 
of 
world 
peace. 
100. 
One 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
tasks 
was 
to 
establish 
standards 
and 
issue 
guides 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
nuclear 
security 
and 
to 
promote 
their 
application. 
His 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
continuing 
to 
revise 
such 
standards 
and 
guides 
periodically, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
now 
seriously 
concerning 
itself 
also 
with 
the 
radiation 
protection 
of 
the 
environment.

101. 
Peru, 
which 
was 
supporting 
the 
work 
of 
INLEX, 
had 
great 
expectations 
for 
the 
regional 
course 
on 
nuclear 
liability 
which 
it 
was 
due 
to 
host 
in 
2006. 
102. 
Peru 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
emergency 
response 
system, 
but 
it 
would 
like 
the 
system 
to 
be 
able 
to 
respond 
not 
only 
to 
incidents 
occurring 
on 
land 
Â 
within 
national 
jurisdictions 
Â 
but 
also 
to 
incidents 
occurring 
at 
sea 
Â 
outside 
the 
jurisdiction 
of 
any 
country. 
103. 
Given 
countriesÂ 
obligations 
arising 
out 
of 
various 
conventions 
to 
provide 
assistance 
in 
emergencies, 
Peru 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
harmonized 
procedures, 
based 
on 
strict 
confidentiality, 
for 
the 
advance 
notification 
of 
governmental 
authorities 
regarding 
shipments 
of 
large 
quantities 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
or 
highly 
radioactive 
waste. 
In 
that 
connection, 
it 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
implementing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Safety 
of 
Transport 
of 
Radioactive 
Material. 
104. 
Peru 
had 
participated 
very 
actively 
in 
the 
third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
held 
in 
April 
2005, 
and 
also 
in 
the 
conference 
which 
had, 
in 
July 
2005, 
adopted 
important 
amendments 
broadening 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
CPPNM. 
In 
addition, 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
it 
had 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification. 
Its 
involvement 
in 
the 
decision-making 
which 
had 
taken 
place 
on 
those 
occasions 
demonstrated 
how 
individual 
Member 
States 
could 
help 
to 
create 
the 
basis 
for 
greater 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
for 
greater 
sharing 
of 
the 
benefits 
now 
and 
in 
the 
future. 
105. 
The 
previous 
day, 
he 
had 
read 
a 
newspaper 
report 
about 
how 
an 
Agency 
expert 
team 
had 
assisted 
in 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
a 
research 
reactor 
and 
the 
return 
of 
its 
highly 
enriched 
uranium 
fuel 
to 
the 
country 
of 
origin. 
The 
operation, 
which 
had 
been 
supported 
by 
the 
two 
largest 
nuclear 
Powers 
and 
by 
the 
government 
of 
the 
country 
where 
the 
research 
reactor 
was 
located, 
illustrated 
what 
could 
be 
achieved 
through 
international 
cooperation 
in 
endeavouring 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
more 
secure 
world 
in 
which 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
countries 
to 
engage 
in 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
was 
respected 
and 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
was 
reliably 
verified. 
The 
meeting 
rose 
at 
5 
p.m.

As 
recommended 
by

Committee 
of 
the 
Whole, 
the 
decision 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/L.6 
was 
adopted. 
28. 
Mr. 
CHO 
Chang-Beom 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
expressed 
a 
strong 
welcome 
for 
the 
decision 
just 
adopted. 
As 
all 
delegations 
were 
well 
aware, 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute 
was 
long 
overdue. 
Its 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
would 
be 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
enhancing 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
amendment 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon 
a 
long 
time 
ago 
and 
should 
be 
implemented 
within 
a 
reasonable 
time 
frame 
if 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
Conference 
and 
of 
the 
Agency 
itself 
was 
not 
to 
be 
compromised. 
His 
country 
wished 
to 
encourage 
all 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendment 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
trusted 
that 
the 
decision 
just 
taken 
would 
enhance 
awareness 
of 
the 
issue 
among 
Member 
States. 
29. 
Mr. 
ELOUMNI 
(Morocco) 
regretted 
the 
slow 
rate 
of 
acceptance 
of 
the 
amendment, 
which 
risked 
endangering 
the 
ideal 
of 
democratizing 
the 
Agency. 
His 
delegation 
would 
have 
preferred 
to 
see 
the 
decision 
use 
stronger 
language 
fully 
reflecting 
the 
importance 
the 
Agency 
attached 
to 
the 
amendment, 
which 
was 
intended 
to 
increase 
the 
representativeness 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
hence 
enhance 
its 
authority. 
His 
delegation 
urged 
those 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
deposit 
their 
instruments 
of 
acceptance 
of 
the 
amendment 
in 
order 
to 
permit 
it 
to 
enter 
into 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
30. 
Mr. 
BUTT 
(Pakistan) 
said 
that 
the 
ratification 
process 
had 
been 
moving 
very 
slowly 
and 
there 
had 
been 
inordinate 
delay 
in 
bringing 
the 
amendment 
into 
force. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
take 
account 
of 
the 
new 
realities 
of 
the 
changed 
global 
situation 
and 
to 
incorporate 
the 
changes 
that 
had 
been 
proposed, 
expanding 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
line 
with 
the 
new 
global 
requirements. 
His 
delegation 
urged 
others 
to 
give 
serious 
consideration 
to 
the 
matter.

32. 
Mr. 
ANDREWS 
(United 
Kingdom), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
the 
co-sponsors, 
invited 
the 
Conference 
to 
consider 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(49)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.1. 
33. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
request 
for 
a 
separate 
vote 
on 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
and 
he 
put 
that 
paragraph 
to 
a 
vote 
by 
show 
of 
hands. 
34. 
There 
were 
79 
votes 
in 
favour 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
and 
2 
against, 
with 
1 
abstention. 
The 
paragraph 
was 
adopted. 
35. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
founder 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
India 
had 
consistently 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities 
and 
had 
participated 
constructively 
in 
meetings 
on 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
the 
same 
spirit, 
India 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
on 
the 
recent 
Board 
of 
Governors 
decision 
to 
create 
a 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification. 
36. 
India 
believed 
that 
the 
value 
and 
success 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
attributable 
to 
the 
meticulous 
way 
in 
which 
it 
had 
carried 
out 
its 
tasks 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
mandate 
without 
becoming 
bogged 
down 
in 
extraneous 
issues. 
The 
main 
purpose 
of 
additional 
protocols 
and 
strengthened 
safeguards 
was 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
detect 
undeclared 
and 
clandestine 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
facilities 
in 
States 
that 
had 
concluded 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
37. 
Until 
2000, 
the 
safeguards 
resolution 
had 
been 
a 
consensus 
resolution. 
However, 
in 
2001 
a 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
had 
been 
added 
whose 
language 
contradicted 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
chapeau 
that 
had 
been 
worked 
out 
in 
difficult 
negotiations 
the 
previous 
year. 
The 
new 
paragraph 
appeared 
to 
impose 
upon 
non-parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
the 
same 
obligations 
as 
applied 
to 
parties, 
and 
that 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
India. 
The 
operative 
paragraph 
had 
been 
submitted 
without 
change 
ever 
since 
in 
spite 
of 
efforts 
to 
work 
out 
a 
compromise 
formulation. 
38. 
As 
his 
country 
had 
made 
clear 
at 
previous 
sessions 
of 
the 
Conference, 
the 
signing 
of 
a 
treaty 
was 
a 
Member 
StateÂs 
sovereign 
decision. 
IndiaÂs 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
did 
not 
impose 
upon 
it 
any 
obligation 
which 
was 
not 
contained 
in 
the 
Statute. 
Any 
resolution 
which 
ran 
counter 
to 
the 
Statute 
in 
spirit 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
India, 
and 
accordingly 
his 
delegation 
had 
had 
no 
option 
but 
to 
vote 
against 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
39. 
Mr. 
BUTT 
(Pakistan) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
always 
worked 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Statute 
and 
its 
legal 
authority 
and 
under 
international 
law. 
Its 
efforts 
and 
actions 
in 
enabling 
the 
Agency 
to 
discharge 
its 
responsibilities 
in 
an 
efficient 
and 
credible 
manner 
were 
well 
known. 
PakistanÂs 
vote 
against 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
was 
consistent 
with 
its 
principled 
stand 
on 
the 
issue. 
The 
language 
contained 
in 
the 
paragraph 
did 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
differentiated 
nature 
of 
Agency 
Member 
StatesÂ 
safeguards 
undertakings 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
law. 
Until 
that 
anomaly 
in 
the 
resolution 
was 
rectified, 
Pakistan 
would 
be 
obliged 
to 
vote 
against 
the 
operative 
paragraph 
in 
question. 
Pakistan 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
its 
role

manner

parameters.

The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished

adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
a 
whole.

The
