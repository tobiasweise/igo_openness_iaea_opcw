-Oral Report by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole 
(resumed) 

1. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to take up the agenda items regarding which the 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole had reported to it at its previous meeting. 
Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and transport safety and 
waste management (agenda item 13) 

2. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the three draft resolutions contained in 
document GC(47)/L.7 were adopted. 
Nuclear security Â measures to protect against nuclear terrorism (agenda item 14) 

3. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(47)/L.8 was adopted. 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities (agenda item 15) 

4. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(47)/L.9 was adopted. 
Strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications 

(agenda item 16) 

5. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the five draft resolutions contained in 
document GC(47)/L.5 were adopted. 
Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and 
application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 17) 

6. The PRESIDENT said that he would invite the Conference to take up agenda item 17, on which 
there had been no recommendation from the Committee, at the end of its consideration of the report by 
the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole. 
Personnel (agenda item 22) 

7. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the two draft resolutions contained in 
document GC(47)/L.6 were adopted. 
Amendment to Article VI of the Statute (agenda item 23) 

8. The PRESIDENT said that the General Conference: recalled its resolution GC(43)/RES/19, by 
which it had approved the amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute and had urged all Member 
States to accept the amendment as soon as possible in accordance with their respective constitutional 
processes; took note of the report by the Director General contained in document GC(47)/INF/5; and 
requested the Director General to submit to the Conference at its forty-ninth regular session a report on 
the progress made towards the entry into force of the amendment and to include in the provisional 
agenda for that session an item entitled ÂAmendment to Article VI of the StatuteÂ. 
9. Mr. Chang-beom CHO (Republic of Korea) said that his country had requested the inclusion of 
agenda item 23 in the General ConferenceÂs agenda because, in its view, the time had come to take 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 2 

stock again of the progress being made towards the entry into force of the amendment to Article VI 
which the General Conference had approved in 1999 through the adoption of resolution 
GC(43)/RES/19. 

10. Entry into force of the amendment would adjust the membership of the Board to todayÂs 
realities. There had been a considerable increase in the number of Agency Member States during the 
previous three decades, and further Member States had become very advanced in the technology of 
atomic energy - States which had a legitimate right to demand that their voices be heard in the Board. 
11. His delegation agreed with the Secretariat that entry into force of the amendment would Â as 
stated in paragraph 4 of document GC(47)/INF/5 Â be Âan important contribution to enhancing the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the AgencyÂ. 
12. Unfortunately, although the General Conference had, in operative paragraph 3 of resolution 
GC(43)/RES/7, urged all Member States to accept the amendment as soon as possible in accordance 
with their respective constitutional processes, to date only 34 of the AgencyÂs 137 Member States had 
accepted it. 
13. In the view of his delegation, those Member States which had consented to the approval of the 
amendment by the General Conference should act in line with the spirit and the letter of resolution 
GC(43)/RES/19 within a reasonable time frame; they were under an obligation to follow through on 
their commitment without unnecessary delay. 
14. His delegation therefore urged all Member States which had not yet accepted the amendment to 
accept it as soon as possible in accordance with their respective constitutional processes. 
15. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that her delegation was grateful to the President of the 
Conference and the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole for having reached an agreement 
leading to what the President had just stated regarding agenda item 23. 
16. Her delegation, which could not remain silent following sermons about the obligations of 
Member States, had often heard it said that the Âspirit of ViennaÂ should permeate the work of the 
Board and the General Conference. It regretted that the Âspirit of ViennaÂ had not been more in 
evidence with regard to agenda item 23. To its surprise, it had learned only two days earlier that 
General Conference action was going to be called for under that agenda item. 
17. As everyone knew, resolution GC(43)/RES/19 had been adopted in 1999 only after laborious 
consultations and delicate compromises. Although the MESA Group had had great difficulties with the 
outcome, as far as she knew only one Member State belonging to the MESA Group had been 
consulted regarding the inclusion of item 23 in the ConferenceÂs agenda. In fact, she had the 
impression that only Member States having no difficulties with the inclusion of the item in the agenda 
had been consulted. 
18. Her delegation continued to believe that the Article VI amendment issue should not have been 
addressed at the current session of the General Conference. 
19. The PRESIDENT said that that concluded the ConferenceÂs consideration of agenda item 23 
and invited the Conference to take up agenda item 17.

17. Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency 
of the safeguards system and application of the Model Additional 
Protocol 
(GC(47)/8; GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Rev.1) 

20. Mr. VACEK (Czech Republic), speaking as chairman of the working group on safeguards 
established by the Committee of the Whole and introducing the draft resolution which he personally 
had submitted in document GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Rev.1, said that the working group had spent three 
days exploring ways of arriving at a consensus on a draft resolution which the Committee could 
recommend to the Conference for adoption. 
21. The draft resolution before the Conference drew heavily upon resolution GC(46)/RES/12 
adopted in 2002, but it contained a number of new elements - particularly in preambular paragraph (g) 
and operative paragraph 5. Although the draft resolution enjoyed widespread support, three Member 
States were unable to accept operative paragraph 3, although they were prepared to accept the rest of 
the text. He understood that the delegations of those Member States would want a vote on operative 
paragraph 3. 
22. Mr. MORENO (Italy) said that, in view of the submission of the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Rev.1 by the chairman of the working group on safeguards, the 
sponsors of the draft resolution contained in document GC(47)/COM.5/L.3 wished to withdraw it. 
23. The PRESIDENT said that there had been a request for a separate vote on operative paragraph 3 
of the draft resolution and put paragraph 3 to a vote by show of hands. 
24. There were 76 votes in favour of operative paragraph 3 and three against, with one abstention. 
Draft paragraph 3 was adopted. 
25. Mr. SHAVIT (Israel) said that during the efforts to arrive at a consensus on a draft resolution 
his delegation had made a proposal and in addition had supported a proposal made by Ambassador 
Vacek that had received broad support in the working group, which had been very close to a 
consensus. 
26. Unfortunately, certain delegations had not supported Ambassador VacekÂs proposal, preferring 
to revert to wording used in resolution GC(46)/RES/12 that had not been acceptable to all Member 
States in 2002. 
27. Israel had been unable to accept operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(47)/COM5/L.17/Rev.1. However, it was in favour of strengthening the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system and would join a consensus on the draft resolution as a whole. 
28. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India) said that, as a founder member of the Agency, India had 
consistently attached great importance to the safeguards activities of the Agency and had participated 
constructively in meetings on strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. However, the main purpose of additional protocols and strengthened 
safeguards was to enable the Agency to detect undeclared and clandestine nuclear activities and 
facilities in States that had concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency - and 
comprehensive safeguards agreements flowed from the NPT. 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 4 

29. His country believed that the value and success of the Agency were attributable to the 
meticulous way in which it had carried out its tasks in accordance with its mandate without getting 
bogged down in extraneous issues. The Agency had not been established in order to become the 
watchdog of nuclear non-proliferation or nuclear disarmament, nor was it the NPT secretariat. 
30. It was in that context that India found most disturbing the practice of introducing into 
resolutions like the draft resolution which the Conference now had before it language which upset the 
delicate compromise worked out in 2000; the chapeau to the operative part of resolution 
GC(44)/RES/19, which had been the result of difficult negotiations, had enabled India to join the 
consensus on that resolution. In 2001, a paragraph contradicting the spirit of the chapeau had been 
added to the corresponding resolution, and that paragraph now appeared as operative paragraph 3 of 
the draft resolution under consideration. 
31. His delegation had made a sincere attempt to bring about a consensus on operative paragraph 3. 
For instance, it had proposed either the deletion of the phrase ÂBearing in mind the importance of 
achieving the universal application of the AgencyÂs safeguards systemÂ or the insertion of 
ÂconcernedÂ between ÂallÂ and ÂStatesÂ, but its proposal had not been accepted. 
32. As he had said at the ConferenceÂs 2002 session, the signing of treaties was a Member StateÂs 
sovereign decision, and being a Member State of the Agency did not impose upon India any obligation 
beyond those contained in the Statute. Any resolution which in spirit ran counter to the Statute was 
unacceptable to India. Accordingly, his delegation had had no option but to vote against operative 
paragraph 3 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Rev.1. However, it 
would not object to the adoption of the draft resolution as a whole without a vote. 
33. Mr. NAQVI (Pakistan) said that his country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system and his delegation therefore supported the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Rev.1 as a whole. 
34. Unfortunately, despite his delegationÂs best efforts, consensus language had not been found for 
operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution, and his delegation had therefore been unable to vote in 
favour of that paragraph. 
35. It was to be hoped that a consensus would be reached on the matter in the future. 
36. Mr. ZISCHG (Austria) said that the differences of opinion regarding a draft resolution to be 
recommended by the Committee of the Whole to the Conference for adoption had narrowed 
considerably during the previous three days. His delegation therefore deeply regretted the fact that, 
once again, no consensus had been reached. It hoped that one would be reached in 2004. 
37. Austria, which, as a party to the NPT, would welcome the universal application of 
comprehensive safeguards, believed that the additional protocols to safeguards agreements were an 
integral part of those agreements. Unfortunately, the draft resolution before the Conference did not 
make it clear that they were. 
38. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(47)/COM.5/L.17/Add.1 as a whole. 
39. It was so decided. 
40. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt), having thanked Ambassador Vacek of the Czech Republic for his efforts 
in chairing the working group, said that Egypt was a supporter of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and 
would like to see it made more effective and efficient, so as to provide the international community 
with the requisite assurances that nuclear material was not being used for non-peaceful purposes. 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 5 

However, it did not consider the measures provided for in additional protocols to be the only way of 
enhancing the safeguards systemÂs credibility. 

41. Egypt had not yet concluded an additional protocol, but it was not opposed to the conclusion of 
additional protocols by other States. It believed that the implementation of measures provided for in 
additional protocols at Egyptian nuclear installations would serve no useful purpose, but it had decided 
not to conclude an additional protocol at present primarily in order to send a clear message to the 
world that it would not accept additional obligations while one country in the Middle East 
categorically refused to accede to the NPT. 
42. Mr. Chung-ha SUH (Republic of Korea), having commended Ambassador Vacek of the Czech 
Republic on his efforts as chairman of the working group, said that the draft resolution just adopted 
was in line with his GovernmentÂs strong commitment to strengthening the effectiveness and 
improving the efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguard system. 
43. In the Republic of Korea, which had a formal safeguards support programme, preparations for 
implementation of the additional protocol signed by it had been completed and parliamentary 
ratification of the additional protocol before the end of 2003 was expected. 
25. Report on contributions pledged to the Technical 
Co-operation Fund for 2004 
(GC(47)/20/Rev.4) 

44. The PRESIDENT said that by 6 p.m. on 18 September 2003 the contributions pledged by 
Member States in the Technical Co-operation Fund had amounted to US $9 359 483, or 12.52% of the 
target for 2004, which was 2.34% higher than the percentage of the target for 2003 pledged by the 
same point in the preceding year. Since then pledges made by Algeria ($50 100), Namibia ($5 232) 
and Slovakia ($30 647) had brought the total to $9 445 462, or 12.64% of the target. 
45. He urged those Member States which had not yet done so to make their 2004 pledges and to pay 
their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, so that the Secretariat could submit to the 
Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee a proposed 2004 technical co-operation 
programme based on reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement the approved 
programme without hindrance or uncertainty. 
The meeting was suspended at 4.45 p.m. and resumed at 6.40 p.m. 

20. Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(47)/12 and Add.1; GC(47)/L.3) 

46. The PRESIDENT, introducing the agenda item, said that the subject had been considered by the 
Board of Governors the previous week. 
47. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) said that, in spite of the consensus that had now existed for 12 years on 
the need for all countries in the Middle East to accept the application of comprehensive Agency 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 6 

safeguards to all their nuclear activities, that objective had still not been reached. In his countryÂs 
view, the issue of the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East had not been addressed by 
Member States in a resolute manner and, although more and more financial and human resources were 
being allocated to the nuclear non-proliferation effort, there was not a genuine desire to deal with 
certain known cases of nuclear proliferation. 

48. In spite of an international commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, especially after the events 
of 11 September 2001, a number of Member States showed no interest in participating in the debate on 
the issue unless it focused on countries other than Israel. Moreover, some Member States had even 
expressed the wish that the item ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ be excluded 
from General Conference agendas. Egypt would not allow that to happen, however, since it believed 
strongly in multilateral forums as a means of ensuring international stability and security and it had 
witnessed numerous instances where action taken outside a multilateral framework had been 
counterproductive. 
49. As could be seen from Annex 1 to document GC(47)/12/Add.1, Egypt supported the convening 
of a forum on ÂExperience Relevant to the Creation of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle 
EastÂ, for which Jordan and the Syrian Arab Republic had also expressed support. Clearly, however, 
Israel wanted the forum to be a mere academic exercise, thereby demonstrating its lack of interest in 
making the Middle East more stable and secure. 
50. If the draft resolution before the Conference was adopted by consensus, Egypt would observe 
subsequent developments in order to determine whether its adoption was accompanied by a 
corresponding commitment to its implementation. If such a commitment was not forthcoming, Egypt 
would seek the support of other Member States for the submission of a substantively somewhat 
different draft resolution at the ConferenceÂs next session. 
51. His country wished to see a nuclear-weapon-free zone established in the Middle East, with 
Israel acceding to the NPT and placing all its nuclear installations under comprehensive Agency 
safeguards. Also, it wished to see the Islamic Republic of Iran taking the steps necessary in order to 
reassure the international community that its nuclear programme was designed to achieve only 
peaceful aims. 
52. Member States should renew their commitment to the application of Agency safeguards in the 
Middle East, with a view to - for example - reaching agreement on the creation of a mechanism for 
considering, with Agency assistance, all constructive proposals for the establishment of a nuclearweapon-
free zone in that region. 
53. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference was ready to adopt the draft resolution contained 
in document GC(47)/L.3 without a vote. 
54. It was so decided. 
55. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his country had joined the consensus on the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(47)/L.3 because it recognized that a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East could eventually serve as an important complement to overall peace, security and arms 
control in the region. However, his delegation had made no secret of its fundamental reservations 
about the language and current relevance of the draft resolution, and it had formally distanced itself 
from the associated modalities. 
56. Experience in other regions had shown that a regional nuclear-weapon-free zone should 
emanate from within and be supported by all concerned States of the region. Such a zone could not be 
imposed on regional parties. 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 7 

57. The basic premise of any regional security and arms control process was that the security 
margins of any participating State would offset its threat perception and not be reduced during the 
process. Consequently, any process demanding a reduction in security margins would have to be based 
on mutual steps to maintain security. The participation of all States in the region in such a process was 
an essential prerequisite for the simple reason that reciprocal relationships must prevail for all regional 
parties. 
58. Recent events had highlighted the stark realities in the Middle East. Those realities meant that 
only a practical, step-by-step approach would be effective. The process should begin with confidenceand 
security-building measures, carefully selected so as not to reduce the security margins of any 
State. In IsraelÂs view, after the building of trust, the achievement of reconciliation and the 
establishment of peace and good neighbourly relations among all Middle East parties the time would 
be ripe to move towards regional arms control and disarmament arrangements covering missiles and 
conventional, chemical and biological weapons, and Israel hoped that the establishment of a mutually 
verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone would then follow. The wisdom of such a step-by-step approach 
had been demonstrated by the experience with similar processes conducted elsewhere. The way to 
achieve security was to aim high but start modestly and move ahead carefully; confidence-building 
took a lot of time. 
59. The statements being made by the representatives of some of IsraelÂs neighbours were not only 
at variance with the responsibilities and mission of the Agency, they also undermined confidencebuilding 
and might make the road ahead even more tortuous. 
60. For his part, he hoped for reconciliation, security and peace in the Middle East. 
61. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his delegation had accepted the draft resolution 
because it had not wished to upset the consensus. However, the draft resolution did not refer to Israel 
by name, its operative paragraphs were vague and one operative paragraph referred to bilateral peace 
negotiations that had not existed for several years. It would be a source of embarrassment when future 
generations compared its contents with the circumstances in the Middle East at the time of its 
adoption. 
62. Was it possible to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East when Israel had not 
acceded to the NPT and had never shown any interest in doing so, and how could one build trust 
among the States of the Middle East while Israel mounted daily attacks on the Palestinian people, 
bombed villages in southern Lebanon and built settlements on the occupied Golan Heights? 
63. The Syrian Arab Republic was very concerned about the future of the Middle East, and he 
hoped that the international community understood the reasons for its concern. 
64. Mr. DARYAEI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones was an important measure in the field of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. Nuclearweapon-
free zones had made a fundamental contribution to regional and international peace, security 
and stability. 
65. Following an initiative taken by his country in 1974, the idea of establishing a nuclear-weaponfree 
zone in the Middle East had been considered by the General Assembly and a number of other 
international fora, including the General Conference and successive NPT Review Conferences. In 
May 1995, the NPT Review and Extension Conference had, in a resolution on the Middle East, called 
upon all States in the Middle East that had not yet done so, without exception, to accede to the NPT as 
soon as possible and to place their nuclear facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards, and the 2000 
NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the importance of that resolution and had stated that it would 
remain valid until its objectives were achieved. However, no meaningful steps had been taken to 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 8 

achieve its objectives, despite the fact that it was a manifestation of the legitimate demands of States 
belonging to the region. 

66. Israel was the sole country in the Middle East that was not a party to the NPT, and it was 
operating clandestine nuclear facilities that were the main obstacle to the establishment of a nuclearweapon-
free zone there. Ignoring the Israeli nuclear threat would only encourage Israel to continue as 
a source of instability in the Middle East. 
67. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believed that no country in the Middle East should develop, 
produce, test or acquire nuclear weapons or permit the stationing of nuclear weapons or other nuclear 
explosive devices within their territories or within the territories under their control, and that all 
countries in the Middle East should refrain from actions that ran counter to the NPT and to 
international efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Accordingly, his 
delegation had joined the consensus on the draft resolution just adopted despite the position of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran regarding the ideas expressed in operative paragraph 4. 
68. As regards operative paragraph 8, his country believed that all States had the same 
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. 
69. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) said that his country attached great importance to the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East for the benefit of the present generation and of future 
generations. As proof of that, it had acceded to the NPT, had concluded an NPT safeguards agreement 
with the Agency and had an additional protocol in force. 
70. Israel had not subjected all its nuclear activities to Agency safeguards, however, and 
consequently the draft resolution just adopted would not help in bringing peace to the Middle East. It 
conveyed the impression that double standards were being applied, with States whose nuclear 
programmes were not devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes receiving preferential treatment. 
71. Being IsraelÂs closest neighbour geographically, Jordan, which was also concerned about 
radiation hazards emanating from Israel, would like to see the Director General, supported by Member 
States with a special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, doing his 
utmost to persuade Israel to join the nuclear safeguards regime and submit all its nuclear installations 
to international inspections. It hoped that, at the very least, the draft resolution just adopted would be 
fully implemented. 
72. Referring to document GC(47)/22/Rev.1, which contained a statement of Arab delegations 
concerning their reservations about the credentials of the delegate of Israel, he pointed out that his 
delegation had not signed the statement. However, his countryÂs position regarding the illegal nature 
of IsraelÂs annexation of the occupied city of Jerusalem, which constituted a violation of Security 
Council resolutions, remained unchanged, as did his countryÂs view that all legislative and 
administrative measures relating to Jerusalem taken by Israel since it had occupied that city were null 
and void. 
21. Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat 
(GC(47)/6) 

73. The PRESIDENT said that it had been agreed in consultations that he should read out the 
following statement for endorsement by the Conference: 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 9 

ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement by the President of the 36th session, in 1992, 
concerning the agenda item ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ. That statement considered it 
desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 37th session. 

ÂThe General Conference also recalls the statement by the President of the 43rd session, in 1999, 
concerning the same agenda item. At the 44th. 45th, 46th and 47th sessions, this item was, at the 
request of certain Member States, re-inscribed on the agenda. The item was discussed. 

ÂSeveral Member States requested that the item be included in the provisional agenda of the 48th 
regular session of the General Conference.Â 

74. He took it that the General Conference was ready to endorse the statement he had just read out. 
75. It was so decided. 
76. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that her delegation was grateful to all those who had enabled 
the deliberations regarding the agenda item under consideration to go as smoothly as possible given 
the circumstances. 
77. While supporting the statement just read out by the President, her delegation would have liked it 
to contain a reference to the serious threat of nuclear weapons proliferation in the Middle East, a call 
to all countries in the region that had not yet done so to accede to the NPT and submit all their nuclear 
facilities to comprehensive safeguards, a reference to a commitment of the international community to 
the elimination of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, and a demonstration of that commitment in a 
credible and non-selective manner that would ensure the collective security of all the countries of the 
region. 
78. Her country was among those Member States which wished the item ÂIsraeli nuclear 
capabilities and threatÂ to be included in the provisional agenda for the ConferenceÂs 2004 regular 
session. 
79. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) said that his delegation had accepted the statement despite the fact that it 
did not meet JordanÂs aspirations. 
80. Israel should accede to the NPT and submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. Only 
so could the Agency provide the international community with the assurance that IsraelÂs nuclear 
programme was devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes. 
81. It was essential that the Middle East be free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear 
weapons. The statement just read out by the President did not reflect that fact, nor would it help to 
bring about the universal application of Agency safeguards in the interests of international peace and 
security. 
82. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that Israel had refused to accede to the NPT and 
place all of its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards, and the international community had failed 
to subject Israel to the kind of pressure that other States in the Middle East had been subjected to. 
83. Israel posed the real nuclear threat in what was one of the worldÂs most tense regions, and his 
country had therefore hoped that, in response to the concerns shared by the other States of the Middle 
East, the General Conference would adopt a resolution condemning IsraelÂs nuclear weapons 
development activities. If the international community wished to bring about stability in the Middle 
East, it would have to address the imbalance created by IsraelÂs possession of weapons of mass 
destruction, including nuclear weapons. 

GC(47)/OR.10

84. Some Arab states had been accused of seeking to obtain weapons of the kind already possessed 
by Israel - an example of double standards completely unacceptable in the twenty-first century. 
85. Mr. YOUSSEF (Egypt) said that, while a threat to international peace and security was posed by 
the five nuclear Powers, the secret nuclear ambitions of certain other countries posed a serious threat 
at the regional level. The international community had resolutely addressed some cases of nuclear 
weapons proliferation, but it had been very lenient in addressing others - especially when Israel was 
involved. 
86. Suspicions had grown in recent decades that Israel was conducting non-peaceful nuclear 
activities. Moreover, Israel had adopted an ambiguous position by refusing to confirm or deny 
possession of nuclear weapons. IsraelÂs nuclear programme constituted an imminent threat regionally 
and beyond. Despite its purported desire for peace, by endeavouring not only to develop an offensive 
nuclear potential - in addition to its great conventional military capacity - but also to develop a secondstrike 
nuclear capability, Israel had exacerbated the existing imbalance in the Middle East. 
87. Israel had not undertaken any international legal obligations that would prevent it from 
developing a military nuclear capability, and that raised the question whether exceptions to 
compliance with the NPT should be allowed. 
88. Also, there was the possibility of Israeli nuclear material falling into irresponsible hands. 
89. Perhaps some members of the international community believed that IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities were not a cause for concern as long as there were no other countries with nuclear 
weapons aspirations in the Middle East. At all events, one question which the international community 
should focus on was whether IsraelÂs nuclear programme had been developed locally or with outside 
assistance, including assistance from countries prohibited by the NPT from providing any. 
90. The continued existence of a nuclear programme that was not transparent or subject to 
safeguards posed a threat to the security of Egypt, which nevertheless remained firmly committed to 
peace in the Middle East and was continuing to explore all possible ways of achieving it by political 
means. However, apart from some encouraging statements, the response of the international 
community had failed to live up to EgyptÂs expectations; there was strong support for nuclear nonproliferation 
where Middle East countries other than Israel were concerned, but that support declined 
to unacceptable levels when Israel was the focus of attention. 
91. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey), commending the President on the compromise reached, said that 
Turkey, as a party to the NPT, attached great importance to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and 
would welcome universal adherence to the NPT. 
92. Given the threat of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, it was in the interest of all Middle East 
countries to adhere to the NPT, thereby making an important contribution to confidence-building and 
international peace and security. 
93. Mr. MORENO (Italy), speaking on behalf of the European Union, commended the delegations 
of member countries of the Arab League and also the Israeli delegation for the flexibility that they had 
demonstrated in accepting the statement read out by the President, which was in keeping with the 
Âspirit of ViennaÂ. He also commended the President for the way in which he had conducted the 
negotiations that had resulted in the statement. 
94. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT, accept full-scope 
Agency safeguards and conclude an additional protocol created a dangerous situation in the Middle 
East to which the international community had failed to respond. 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 11 

95. The statement read out by the President did not diverge substantively from the statements read 
out in previous years, but the delegations of Arab Member States had demonstrated a flexibility which 
he would like Israel to match. 
96. He believed that peace would ultimately come to the Middle East, but so far Israel had 
contributed only war and destruction. The international community should exert more pressure on 
Israel. 
97. Mr. TAJOURI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his delegation had accepted the statement 
read out by the President despite the fact that no reference was made in it to IsraelÂs growing nuclear 
capacity, which posed a threat to stability and security both in the Middle East and beyond. 
98. Israel had been called upon by the NPT Review and Extension Conference and the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference to accede to the NPT as soon as possible, but it had so far not responded 
positively. Double standards were being applied in the case of Israel, which was consequently 
pursuing policies that ran counter to the hopes for global peace and security. The international 
community should exert more pressure on Israel and force it to abandon those policies. 
99. Mr. BRILL (United States of America) said that the President was to be commended on his 
performance in handling items 20 and 21 of the agenda. However, the United States delegation was 
disappointed that the Israeli issue had not been adequately addressed under those two agenda items. 
The strength of the Agency lay in its technical focus, and his delegation would therefore like to see 
Member States pursue the political issues of interest to them elsewhere - not in the AgencyÂs General 
Conference. In his delegationÂs view, Agency activities designed to bring practical benefits to people 
in the Middle East through, for example, the use of the sterile insect technique against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly were more in line with the Âspirit of ViennaÂ than was the discussion that had 
taken place during the previous few hours. 
-Closing of the session 

100. The PRESIDENT thanked delegations for their patience and understanding, particularly during 
the informal consultations which he had conducted. 
101. The 2003 regular session of the General Conference had been particularly well attended, with 
over forty ministerial-level delegates - an indication of the great importance attached by many 
Member States to the AgencyÂs work. There had been 98 speakers in the general debate, which had 
highlighted the dedication of Member States to promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. On 
the fiftieth anniversary of the ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ initiative, the General Conference had been positive 
and constructive, and the outcome of the current session had reflected the spirit of co-operation and 
mutual respect which many had come to refer to as the Âspirit of ViennaÂ. The Agency was certain to 
benefit from that outcome, becoming stronger and more effective. 
102. Mr. SRIWIDJAJA (Indonesia) commended the President for his able leadership in guiding the 
ConferenceÂs deliberations to a successful conclusion and for the hard work done by him in ensuring 
that a number of contentious issues were dealt with in a constructive and sensitive manner. 
103. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile), speaking on behalf of GRULAC, commended the President 
on the way in which he had guided the ConferenceÂs deliberations. 

GC(47)/OR.10 
19 September 2003, Page 12 

104. GRULAC had agreed that Mexico and Peru should be elected to serve on the Board of 
Governors during the period 2003-2005 and also that Ecuador and Venezuela should be elected to 
serve during the period 2004-2006 - a demonstration of the solidarity of GRULAC in wishing to 
further strengthen the Agency. 
105. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) thanked the President for his patience and the 
Secretariat for its support. 
106. Several of the agenda items considered by the Conference had been of a technical nature, and in 
his view the Conference had made good use of its time. 
107. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) associated herself with those who had commended the President on 
his performance. 
108. The PRESIDENT thanked all Conference participants for their co-operation and expressed 
special thanks to: the Vice-Presidents of the Conference; Ambassador Garcia of the Philippines, the 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and Ambassador Stokes of Australia and Ambassador 
Vacek of the Czech Republic, the Vice-Chairmen of the Committee. He also thanked the Director 
General and his staff for their support and the Austrian authorities and the City of Vienna for their 
hospitality. 
109. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the Conference to 
observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and observed one minute of silence. 

110. The PRESIDENT declared the forty-seventh regular session of the General Conference closed. 
The meeting rose at 8.00 p.m.

-Opening of the session 
1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-seventh regular session of the 
General Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he invited 
delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation, including in their 
thoughts the victims of the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad on 19 August 
2003. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

At the invitation of the Director General, a short performance to mark the opening of the session 
was given by the MenÂs Choir of the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that a substantial amount of important work had been 
done by the Agency since the forty-sixth regular session of the General Conference. In particular, 
many Member States had been assisted in formulating international co-operative projects for peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy and in developing effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific, 
technological and regulatory capabilities on the basis of their top-priority needs. Technical 
co-operation, the backbone of the AgencyÂs mission to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
had been a success, contributing to the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in 
many areas, especially in developing countries. 
4. His country, which foresaw that it would not be able to remain dependent solely on the usual 
fuels for power generation, attached great importance to its nuclear programme as a means of meeting 
its projected demand for power generation capacity. In that connection, it also attached great 
importance to the role of the Agency in supporting the transfer of nuclear science and technology and 
promoting nuclear safety, and also as a cornerstone of nuclear non-proliferation. 
5. The Agency had done a great deal during the previous 12 months in the safeguards and nuclear 
security fields, and it was to be commended on the conclusion in the Safeguards Implementation 
Report for 2002 that in the 145 States with safeguards agreements in force the nuclear material and 
other items placed under safeguards had during 2002 remained in peaceful nuclear activities or been 
otherwise adequately accounted for. However, there was a need for further efforts in those fields, 
particularly in order to prevent terrorist and other criminal acts. 
6. It was to be hoped that the Agency would continue to upgrade nuclear safety around the world, 
further strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and extend its application, establish a 
strengthened nuclear security framework, continue assessing the role of nuclear power in sustainable 
development and continue promoting peaceful applications of nuclear techniques. In doing those 
things, the Agency would need concerted international support.

1. Election of officers and appointment of the General 
Committee 
7. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President of the 
Conference. 
8. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines), speaking on behalf of the Far East Group, proposed Mr. Takasu 
(Japan) for that position. 
9. Mr. Takasu (Japan) was elected President by acclamation. 
10. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr. Takasu on his election and wished him 
every success in his task. 
Mr. Takasu (Japan) took the Chair. 

11. The PRESIDENT, expressing gratitude to all those who had supported his candidacy, said that 
Japan, as a firm supporter of the Agency since its establishment, had consistently demonstrated strong 
commitment to its wide-ranging activities. He would do his utmost to live up to the high standards set 
by the previous President, Mr. Rajasa, whose advice he had greatly appreciated. 
12. Fifty years after President EisenhowerÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ declaration, nuclear technology 
offered significant benefits and potential not only for power generation but also for sustainable 
development in a world where there was a great deal of concern about matters such as climate change 
and safe drinking water scarcity. The Agency was to be applauded for its role in promoting the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology, which his country hoped would continue contributing to human 
security. 
13. Over the past year, the Agency had been in the public spotlight as it confronted a number of 
serious challenges to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, and the importance of the 
Agency as an independent and credible verification body had increased significantly. The international 
nuclear non-proliferation regime was under growing stress, and the need to enforce it in a number of 
key respects was becoming increasingly urgent. Efforts to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards system 
were central in that connection. 
14. The Agency had done much to promote nuclear safety and create a nuclear safety culture 
worldwide, and events since September 2001 had highlighted the importance of the AgencyÂs 
activities also in the area of nuclear security. 
15. His task, as President of the General Conference, was not only to preside but also to help ensure 
the success of the current session, and he thanked delegates in advance for their support. The 
ConferenceÂs provisional agenda contained several important items relating to nuclear technology, 
verification, safety and security, and he was sure that all delegations would work together in making 
the Agency stronger and more effective in seeking - as the Statute said - Âto accelerate and enlarge the 
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the worldÂ. 
16. Inviting the Conference to continue with the election of officers and appointment of the General 
Committee, he recalled that, pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference 
normally elected eight Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and five 
additional members of the General Committee - resulting in a General Committee of 15 members. At 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 3 

the current session, however, the General Committee would be composed of 16 members - the 
President of the Conference, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, seven Vice-Presidents and 
seven additional members - since the President of the Conference and the envisaged Chairman of the 
Committee of the Whole came from the same region -a region which customarily had only one 
representative on the General Committee. That would involve the suspension of Rules 34 and 40 of 
the Rules of Procedure, which had been done in comparable situations previously. 

17. He proposed: that the delegates of Algeria, Canada, Chile, France, Kuwait, Malaysia and the 
Russian Federation be elected as Vice-Presidents; that Mr. Garcia (Philippines) be elected as 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole; and that the delegates of Colombia, the Czech Republic, 
Germany, Pakistan, Sweden, the United States of America and Zimbabwe be elected as additional 
members of the General Committee. 
18. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
19. The PRESIDENT further proposed that item 2 of the provisional agenda, ÂApplications for 
membership of the AgencyÂ, be deleted since there were no new applications and that, in order to save 
time, the General Conference deal with items 3, 4 and 6 pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs 
recommendation on the provisional agenda. 
20. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
3. Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
21. Mr. ABE (Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs) read out the following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my greetings to the forth-seventh General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. Some fifty years after the ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ initiative, the IAEAÂs 
work in promoting the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and verifying compliance with 
solemn safeguards obligations is more important than ever. 

ÂThe Director General, Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, and the staff of the Agency have brought great 
professionalism and purpose to their work in what has been a challenging year, especially with 
respect to Iraq. I support the AgencyÂs continuing efforts to strengthen international safeguards in 
particular, to promote conclusion of additional protocols by Iran and other States, and to 
encourage other countries to conclude safeguards agreements with the Agency. I call for the early 
resumption of the AgencyÂs safeguards activities in the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea. I 
share with many the hope that we will see new progress in achieving adherence to comprehensive 
safeguards by all States, including in the Middle East and South Asia. I also share the conviction 
of many that efforts in the field of nuclear non-proliferation must be complemented by progress 
in the field of nuclear disarmament - an issue in which the Agency has an abiding interest. 

ÂProgress in all these areas would greatly reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism, as would fresh 
successes with regard to the safety and security of nuclear installations and to the fight against 
illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and radiation sources - other areas where the Agency is 
active. 

ÂThe international community is rightly endeavouring to prevent potentially dangerous uses of 
nuclear technologies, but these technologies nevertheless remain a powerful force for economic 


GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 4 

development. The IAEAÂs activities in protecting public health and the environment and 
promoting food production and sustainable development are particularly crucial. 

ÂI look forward to continuing to work with the Agency in the cause of peace and sustainable 
development. I wish you fruitful discussions.Â 

4. Statement by the Director General 
22. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that the past year had been a time of significant challenges 
and achievements for the Agency. In the area of verification, the Agency had been at the centre of 
attention and had again demonstrated its ability to perform objective and credible safeguards, but it 
was still facing a number of difficult unresolved situations. In the area of safety and security, there had 
been an overall improvement and the AgencyÂs work was making a difference, but much remained to 
be done. 
23. In the technology area, the Agency was contributing to sustainable development through its 
technical co-operation programme. The benefits of nuclear applications were being increasingly 
recognized, but more partnerships were needed in order to optimize the use of the valuable 
technologies in question. Nuclear power continued to hold great potential as a clean source of energy, 
but it remained in a holding position owing to a number of associated concerns. 
24. The contribution of nuclear power to world electricity production had been stable, remaining at 
about 16% for the past few years. The world electricity market had been growing continuously during 
that period - at an average rate of 2.8% a year - and the growth in nuclear electricity generation had 
kept pace. Six new power reactors had been connected to the grid in 2002, offsetting the retirement of 
four reactors during the year. The increased production had been complemented by further increases in 
the on-line availability of nuclear power plants as a result of better operational and outage 
management practices. 
25. There were currently 33 power reactors under construction, 20 of them in the Far East and 
South Asia. In other regions, the more immediate focus was on power upgrades, restarts of previously 
shutdown reactors, and licence extensions. Sixteen reactors in the United States of America had had 
their operating licences extended to 60 years, and many extension applications were under review. The 
Russian Federation and a number of other countries were also embarking on licence extension 
programmes. The Agency engaged in a range of activities designed to assist interested Member States 
with various aspects of licence extension, including outage optimization strategies, outage 
performance indicators, predictive maintenance, the modification of technical specifications, and 
ageing management. 
26. However, the medium-term projections for nuclear power were uncertain. Most studies 
predicted that nuclear power generation would continue to increase in the near term, but Agency and 
other projections showed the nuclear share of global electricity production falling to about 12% by 
2030. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, even if nuclear power 
was only to maintain its current share of the world electricity market, that would require the 
construction of 700 new 1000 MW reactors by the year 2050 - nearly double the present nuclear 
capacity. 
27. But any major increase in the number of power reactors would require the nuclear community to 
meet a number of challenges: achieving advances in innovative and evolutionary technology; meeting 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 5 

concerns about waste, proliferation, safety and security; and demonstrating new nuclear energy 
applications outside the electricity sector, such as hydrogen production and seawater desalination. He 
would briefly mention a number of Agency activities relevant to those challenges. 

28. Some 20 Member States were currently involved in national and international projects for the 
development of evolutionary and innovative reactor and fuel cycle designs, including acceleratordriven 
systems. Also, a number of countries were exploring the use of nuclear reactors for the 
co-generation of hydrogen, which could make a substantial contribution to meeting demands for 
cleaner energy in the transportation sector, and Agency co-ordinated research projects (CRPs) were 
exploring technological options for hydrogen production using high-temperature gas-cooled reactors 
and evolutionary water-cooled reactors. The Agency had established technical working groups 
focusing on each reactor type - including water-, gas- and liquid metal-cooled reactors - in order to 
provide interested Member States with a forum for information exchange, collaborative assessment 
and co-operative research. The role of innovation as a factor critical to the future of nuclear power, and 
the status of relevant global efforts, had been highlighted in June at an international conference on 
innovative technologies for the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear power. 
29. The final report on Phase 1A of the AgencyÂs International Project on Innovative Nuclear 
Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) had been published in June. The report defined Âuser 
requirementsÂ in five areas - economics, environmental impacts, safety, waste management and 
proliferation resistance - for incorporation into nuclear R&D projects. Also, it provided an assessment 
method for applying INPROÂs user requirements to specific innovative nuclear concepts and designs. 
30. Regarding the long-term management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, there had been slow 
but steady progress. In Finland and the United States of America, efforts directed towards the 
construction of geological repositories at Olkiluoto and Yucca Mountain were continuing, on the basis 
of approvals by the respective Governments. In Canada, the Nuclear Fuel Waste Act, which required 
the owners of spent fuel to develop a management and disposal plan within three years, had entered 
into force in November 2002. In Europe, the Directorate-General for Energy and Transport of the 
European Commission had recently proposed a directive that would require Member States of the 
European Union to decide on the location of repository sites by 2008 and to have the sites operational 
by 2018. The Russian Federation had in July taken steps to implement a new law allowing the storage 
and reprocessing of foreign spent fuel, and a number of Asian countries had begun work on siting 
programmes and the characterization of potential sites for underground repositories for high-level 
radioactive waste. 
31. Technological advances were also being made in the radioactive waste area. In France, Japan, 
the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States of America, R&D work was 
being done on the use of accelerator-driven systems to incinerate and transmute long-lived waste, in 
order to reduce the volume and radiotoxicity of the waste before it was sent to geological repositories. 
The Agency was supporting that work through CRPs, information exchange in technical working 
groups and at topical meetings, database maintenance and training. 
32. In June, at an Agency conference on power reactor fuel storage, a number of organizations had 
made it clear that they were considering the extension of spent fuel storage times to 100 years or 
longer. That would require more advanced storage technologies, assessments of the safety implications 
of prolonged storage, the extension of the licences of existing storage facilities, and sustainable 
institutional frameworks. The Agency expected an increasing demand for assistance as spent fuel 
accumulated and storage requirements expanded. 
33. The number of successfully completed decommissioning projects was steadily increasing, 
together with confidence in the feasibility of safe decommissioning. Some Member States were 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 6 

choosing to dismantle their nuclear facilities immediately, while others were continuing to opt for 
long-term safe enclosure and delayed dismantling. The choice depended on considerations such as the 
availability of waste disposal sites, spent fuel storage options, financial resources and radiological 
exposure. On the basis of the currently licensed operating periods, the number of decommissioned 
reactors either being dismantled or awaiting dismantling was expected to grow to about 160 over the 
next 7-10 years. The Agency was continuing to provide technical assistance to ongoing 
decommissioning projects in Bulgaria, China, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Serbia and 
Montenegro, Slovakia and Ukraine. An increasing demand for such Agency assistance during the next 
few years was expected. 

34. Almost two billion people - nearly one third of the population of the planet - remained without 
access to modern energy supplies. Recognizing that situation, the Agency was helping interested 
Member States to conduct comparative assessments of energy options, in order that they might 
determine whether - and, if so, when - nuclear power would be an optimum source of energy, and it 
would support the development of the necessary infrastructure and capabilities in those countries 
which decided to proceed with the nuclear power option. An initial country profile for sustainable 
energy development in Brazil was nearing completion, and work on a similar profile for South Africa 
was starting. 
35. Whether or not nuclear power generation expanded in the coming decades, it was essential that 
the scientific and technical competence necessary for the safe operation of existing nuclear facilities 
and the safe conduct of existing nuclear applications be preserved. The management of nuclear 
knowledge should include succession planning for the nuclear work force, maintenance of the Ânuclear 
safety caseÂ for operational reactors, and retention of the nuclear knowledge accumulated over the past 
six decades. 
36. That was a growing concern for many Member States, and was a topic that related to all areas of 
Agency activity. Two pilot projects responding to that concern were already under way -one to 
preserve knowledge about fast reactors and one to build a knowledge base regarding high-temperature 
gas-cooled reactors. An Asian network for higher education in nuclear technology would be used for 
pooling, analysing and sharing regional knowledge and experience relating to nuclear technology, and 
an Asian nuclear safety network was already doing the same for regional knowledge and experience 
relating to nuclear safety; it was envisaged that the networks would serve as models for other regional 
networks for nuclear knowledge management. In addition, the Agency was assisting Member States 
with capacity building and human resources development through education programmes, hands-on 
training and knowledge transfer in ways best suited to their desired uses of nuclear technology. 
37. The launching of the World Nuclear University (WNU) earlier that month in London, at the 
annual symposium of the World Nuclear Association, had in his view been a positive development. 
The WNU would essentially consist of a global network of established academic institutions and 
research centres with programmes in nuclear science and engineering. The main objectives would be 
to foster co-operation for mutual benefit among those institutions and centres and to promote a broader 
appreciation - particularly among students - of the opportunities available in nuclear energy-related 
vocations. The Agency planned to participate in WNU studies on various aspects of nuclear education 
and training, and it would endeavour to maximize the accessibility of WNU courses to students in 
Member States. 
38. The INPRO report that he had mentioned and various other reports had stressed the fact that a 
number of critical choices might have to be made in the area of fuel cycle design and operation, partly 
in order to address proliferation and waste management concerns. The issue was an important one that 
had been under discussion for several years, and it now merited serious consideration as part of the 
effort to cope with the increasing non-proliferation, safety, security and technical challenges facing 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 7 

nuclear power. Such consideration should include an examination of the merits of permitting the use 
of weapons-usable material (plutonium and highly enriched uranium) in civilian nuclear programmes 
only when it was subject to multilateral control. Also, thought should be given to limiting the 
processing of such material - and the production of new material through reprocessing and 
enrichment - to international centres. The limitations would need to be accompanied by appropriate 
rules regarding transparency, control and - above all - assurance of supply. It was clear that 
strengthened control of weapons-usable material was crucial to efforts to strengthen non-proliferation 
and enhance security. 

39. The merits and feasibility of multinational approaches to the management and disposal of spent 
fuel and radioactive waste should also be examined. The conditions necessary for geological disposal 
did not exist in all countries, and for many countries with small nuclear programmes for electricity 
generation or research the financial and human resource investments required for the design, 
construction and operation of a geological disposal facility were daunting. Considerable economic, 
safety, security and non-proliferation advantages might accrue from international co-operation in the 
construction and operation of international waste repositories. The convening of a group of experts by 
the Agency could be a useful first step. 
40. The year 2004 would mark 50 years since electricity generated by nuclear power had first been 
fed into a national grid - in Obninsk, Russia, in June 1954. In his view, it was important to review the 
successes achieved during and the lessons learned from 50 years of nuclear power generation - a topic 
that would be the focus of an international conference to be held under the AgencyÂs auspices in 
Obninsk in June 2004. Later in 2004, there was to be, in Paris, a conference at ministerial level to 
examine policies and the prospects for nuclear energy in the 21st century. 
41. The choice of whether to use nuclear power remained a national prerogative. The AgencyÂs 
statutory role, however, was to foster safety, security and technological development, and to support 
efforts to ensure the continued availability of nuclear power for those who wanted to make use of it. 
42. In the coming year, the Agency would focus on a number of high-priority issues related to 
nuclear power: supporting innovative approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle; promoting quality 
assurance; assisting Member States with energy planning assessments; promoting research, training 
and other forms of co-operation in waste management; assisting Member States with their licence 
extension and decommissioning efforts; supporting new nuclear energy uses; and improving the 
management of nuclear knowledge. 
43. A major part of the AgencyÂs technology-related work was focused on the sharing and transfer 
of nuclear technology for applications other than nuclear power generation. Under both the regular 
budget programme and the technical co-operation programme, many of those applications were 
becoming increasingly important as tools for social and economic development. The approach 
continued to be a needs-driven one, guided by comparative assessments so as to ensure that nuclear 
technologies were used only when they provided the best solution. 
44. According to WHO, the number of new cancer cases in the developing world was expected to 
double to ten million annually by 2015, as life expectancy increased and lifestyles changed. However, 
most developing countries did not have enough health professionals or radiotherapy machines to treat 
their cancer patients safely and effectively. Indeed, some 15 African countries and several countries in 
Asia lacked even one radiation therapy machine. In many cases, the machines and the associated 
radioactive sources could not be safely and securely transferred as the necessary safety and regulatory 
infrastructures had not been established. 
45. The Agency provided training, expertise and equipment in support of national and regional 
programmes for improving cancer therapy and of other human health programmes, working with 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 8 

partners such as WHO. A highly visible result of Agency support through technical co-operation 
projects in Africa had been an increase of approximately 35% during the past five years in the number 
of cancer patients receiving treatment in countries that were parties to AFRA - an increase of 
approximately 6500 patients a year. In addition, Agency-organized training had led to a reduction in 
machine downtime and helped to improve the managerial skills of radiation oncologists and 
radiographers, which in turn had lowered the overall cost of treatment. 

46. During the previous year, a great deal had been done in the field of nuclear medicine. For 
example, five Agency-organized courses had been held in West Asia alone, providing specialized 
training for more than 100 physicians and technologists, and technetium-99m radiopharmaceutical kits 
had been produced for the first time in Albania. The Agency had been working hard to develop 
advanced information and communication tools that could promote broader access to nuclear medicine 
in developing countries. A Âtele-nuclear-medicineÂ link had been established between Namibia, South 
Africa and Zambia to facilitate remote diagnosis and treatment, and another such link was being 
established among 15 countries in Latin America. Also, the Agency had developed an Internet-based 
training programme that would be made available to all nuclear medicine professionals in developing 
countries. 
47. Improving the availability of the worldÂs water resources was recognized as an area of crucial 
importance for development. More than one sixth of the worldÂs population lived in areas without 
adequate access to safe drinking water, a situation that was expected to worsen significantly unless the 
international community took prompt and effective action. Isotope hydrology was being used, in more 
than 80 technical co-operation projects, to map underground aquifers, manage surface water and 
groundwater, detect and control pollution, and monitor dam leakage and safety. An ongoing regional 
isotope hydrology project in Latin America had brought together more than 30 institutes to address 
water shortage problems, and conceptual models for seven aquifers - in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, 
Ecuador and Peru - had been developed. In Yemen, the Agency had assisted with the assessment of 
the deep and shallow groundwater system in the region of the SanaÂa basin. In Africa, Member States 
had proposed a number of projects relating to shared aquifers - for example, projects to promote the 
sustainable development and equitable use of the common water resources of the Nile Basin, the 
Nubian Sandstone Aquifer and the North Western Sahara Aquifer. 
48. The Agency was helping Member States to explore the technical and economic feasibility of 
seawater desalination using nuclear energy. At PakistanÂs Karachi Nuclear Power Plant, a reverse 
osmosis facility had been in service since 2000, producing about 450 cubic metres of fresh water a 
day. In India, at the Kalpakkam Nuclear Power Plant, a desalination plant designed to produce 
6300 cubic metres of fresh water a day was being commissioned. In the Republic of Korea, a design 
had been developed for a nuclear desalination plant which, using a Korean SMART reactor, would 
supply 40 000 cubic metres of fresh water and 90 MW of electricity a day. 
49. For many years, the Agency had been working with Member States on the mutation breeding of 
major food crops, and important results were now emerging in the form of commercial crops. For 
example, in Asia and the Pacific region, following trials with mutant varieties of rice in nine countries, 
many strains that yielded very well in different ecological conditions had been identified. In August, 
members of IndonesiaÂs Parliament had attended a harvesting ceremony held in recognition of the 
sustained positive economic impact of a rice variety with higher yield and of better quality that had 
been produced using gamma rays and successfully introduced in 20 Indonesian provinces; he expected 
the release of at least seven new rice varieties in that part of the world during the next three to five 
years. A regional technical co-operation project completed the previous year had brought valuable 
mutated germplasm to 12 countries of Asia and the Pacific region. 

GC(47)/OR.1

50. Work on the use of the sterile insect technique (SIT) to control the tsetse fly in Africa was 
continuing. The SIT was also being used against other insect pests - for example, the Agency was 
collaborating with authorities in Thailand in combating the oriental fruit fly and the Guava fruit fly by 
integrating the SIT with other control methods. 
51. In the area of humanitarian de-mining, the PELAN fast-neutron mine detector had been 
field-tested the previous year in Croatia with help from scientific staff of the Croatian Mine Action 
Centre. The test had shown that the detector could reliably identify mines of certain sizes at various 
depths under the soil surface in dry conditions, but more work needed to be done in order to achieve 
the reliable detection of smaller anti-personnel mines and detection in wet soil conditions. 
52. The AgencyÂs laboratories at Seibersdorf were continuing to support the Agency programmes 
relating to agriculture, human health, nuclear instrumentation, water resources, radiation protection 
and safeguards. They were also continuing to assist Member States with the calibration of dosimetry 
systems for national standards laboratories and to provide audit services designed to ensure the 
accuracy of the radiation doses delivered in hospital radiotherapy units and research institutes 
worldwide. Each year, the Agency performed about 60 dosimetry system calibrations and 
400 dosimeter checks for hospital radiotherapy units, in addition to training dozens of medical 
physicists. 
53. That year, a small laboratory had been inaugurated at Seibersdorf for work on the use of the SIT 
in combating malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. However, several years of research would be needed 
before extensive field trials with radiation-sterilized mosquitoes would be practicable. 
54. The Agency intended to introduce terrestrial radioecology programmes at Seibersdorf in the 
near future, the aim being to create urgently needed capacity for the assessment and remediation of 
contaminated sites after both radioactive and conventional pollution. 
55. In November 2002, the AgencyÂs deep underground counting laboratory had been inaugurated 
in Monaco. The underground location of the laboratory - for which Japan and the Monagasque 
Government had provided funding - reduced background interference from cosmic radiation and other 
sources and allowed significant reductions in sample volume and/or measuring time, greatly 
enhancing the efficiency of both field sampling and laboratory work. 
56. The demand for CRPs, which brought institutes in developing and developed Member States 
together in collaborative research on topics of common interest, remained high. Currently, the Agency 
was spending about $6.4 million a year on 132 active CRPs covering most aspects of its technical 
work, including cutting-edge nuclear techniques related to liver cancer therapy, drug resistance, child 
health, the development of radiation-modified crops for harsh environments, and - as part of recently 
expanded efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism - improvement of the sensitivity of instruments used for 
detecting illicit trafficking in nuclear material. 
57. Participation in a CRP helped Member States to understand the potential of a given nuclear 
application, and CRP results - such as the results of research into new plant strains - often led to 
technical co-operation project requests. In an effort to make the CRP system more transparent and 
accessible for Member StatesÂ research institutes, the Agency had developed an interactive web site 
that provided a great deal of information on-line. Also, the Agency was continuing to introduce 
so-called Âdoctoral CRPsÂ, which paired postgraduate students in developing countries with professors 
at research institutes in developed countries, thereby combining educational and research objectives. 
58. Looking ahead, it was clear that the Agency would have to increase its efforts to provide 
Member States and the public at large with objective information about the range of nuclear 
technologies available, in order to bring about a more balanced view of the benefits of nuclear energy 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 10 

and, using comparative assessments where applicable, to enable Member States to arrive at informed 
judgements about how best to use those technologies in addressing development needs. The Agency 
would seek to establish partnerships with other organizations when it considered that their technical 
expertise could increase the benefits derived from different nuclear applications. Also, the Agency 
would continue promoting the use of isotope hydrology techniques, endeavouring to improve the 
access to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy techniques worldwide, supporting research into plant 
strains adaptable to harsh environments, and encouraging the development of terrestrial radioecology 
techniques that could assist with the cleanup of sites contaminated by radioactive and other pollutants. 

59. The safety and security of nuclear activities around the globe remained important for the future 
of nuclear technology. It was gratifying that safety continued to improve at nuclear power plants 
worldwide, that more and more countries were raising their levels of performance in radiation 
protection, and that significant steps had been taken in the past two years to improve nuclear security. 
However, more needed to be done, particularly as public demands for greater transparency and 
accountability on safety issues were being widely voiced in many countries. Consequently, meeting 
the need for a more effective and transparent global nuclear safety and security regime continued to be 
a high priority. 
60. The Agency promoted the sharing of nuclear facility operating information. Also, national 
regulatory bodies and the nuclear power industry shared operating experience, and the Agency and the 
World Association of Nuclear Operators communicated the lessons learned from international 
experience through their peer review programmes. However, despite continued efforts by the entire 
nuclear community to share lessons learned from events that had occurred at nuclear facilities, 
incidents with similar root causes continued to occur, often shedding light on the safety culture 
situation. That had been seen not only in Member States with evolving regulatory infrastructures but 
also in Member States with robust ones, as evidenced by incidents that had occurred in recent years in 
countries such as France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Sweden and the United States of America. There 
was a need for a focused commitment to ensuring that the lessons learned in one country were 
effectively communicated to all other countries and reflected in the operational and regulatory 
practices of all relevant nuclear facilities. 
61. Currently, over 270 research reactors were in operation around the world, more than 200 were 
shut down and nearly 170 had been decommissioned. The safety of research reactors and the safe 
management and disposal of research reactor fuel continued to be areas of Agency emphasis. The 
United States of America had in 1996 initiated efforts to have spent research reactor fuel of United 
States origin returned to it for disposal, and he was pleased that similar efforts relating to research 
reactor fuel of Russian origin were being considered. A highly relevant Agency initiative in that 
connection was the development of a Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors, which he 
intended to submit to the Board for consideration in due course. 
62. Legally binding international agreements had proved to be a powerful mechanism for enhancing 
safety worldwide. One such agreement was the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, for which the first implementation 
review meeting would begin on 3 November 2003. Thirty-two contracting parties had submitted 
national implementation reports, and they were now reviewing and commenting on each otherÂs 
reports. At the review meeting, they would discuss the reports and compile a summary of their 
observations and conclusions. That summary would provide a first snapshot of the status of the safety 
of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management in States parties to the Joint Convention. 
However, many States were not yet contracting parties, and the snapshot would therefore be far from 
global. All States - even ones with no nuclear power plants or research reactors - had radioactive waste 
that must be managed safely, and he would accordingly like to see all States adhering to the Joint 
Convention. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 11 

63. Within the framework for co-operation established by the Early Notification Convention and the 
Assistance Convention, the Agency had assisted Bolivia, Ecuador, Nigeria and the United Republic of 
Tanzania with the recovery, characterization and securing of radioactive sources seized in illicit 
trafficking incidents. In June, 55 Member States had participated in the second meeting of 
representatives of national competent authorities identified under those two conventions, which he 
hoped would lead to the transformation of the two conventions from purely reactive mechanisms to 
proactive mechanisms for enhancing emergency preparedness and response. 
64. The Convention on Nuclear Safety was now approaching its third review cycle. The contracting 
parties would have to submit their national reports before the end of September 2004, sufficiently in 
advance of the review meeting due to take place in April 2005. To assist them with the preparation of 
their reports, the Agency was, in response to a request made at the 2002 review meeting, preparing a 
report on generic issues and trends in the area of nuclear power reactor safety that it had identified in 
the course of providing safety-related services. 
65. In the past two years, 20 additional States had become parties to the 1979 Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), bringing the total number of States parties to 89. 
That increase reflected the importance being attached to the CPPNM as part of the international 
nuclear security regime. In September 2001, he had convened an open-ended group of legal and 
technical experts to prepare a draft amendment to the CPPNM. In March 2003, the group had finally 
been able to adopt a report, which he had distributed to all States parties. The possible amendments 
identified in the report would extend the scope of the CPPNM to cover, inter alia, the physical 
protection of nuclear material in domestic use, storage and transport and the protection of nuclear 
material and facilities against sabotage. However, the text contained - in brackets -a number of 
clauses on which the group had not been able to reach agreement. He would like States parties to work 
rapidly towards consensus on the outstanding issues, so that a diplomatic conference to adopt the 
proposed amendments could be held at an early date. 
66. He was pleased to report good progress in the revision and updating of Agency safety standards. 
The aim was to complete the upgrading of all existing standards by late 2004. In addition, the Agency 
hoped to fill the remaining gaps in coverage - for example, by establishing internationally accepted 
safety standards for geological waste repositories - and to introduce a more coherent structure for the 
corpus of safety standards during the next three or four years, with a view to the standards being 
accepted and implemented as the global reference for protecting people and the environment from the 
harmful effects of ionizing radiation. 
67. The AgencyÂs safety review and appraisal services helped Member States to apply Agency 
safety standards and provided useful feedback on their effectiveness. At first, the focus had been 
essentially on nuclear installation safety, but now there were services relating to radiation, transport 
and radioactive waste safety as well. The provision of safety-related services and assistance to the 
countries of central and eastern Europe operating power reactors had been at the centre of the Agency 
technical co-operation programmes for those countries during the past decade, resulting in a 
significant positive impact on the operational safety of their power reactors. 
68. The demand for safety-related services continued to be very strong; the Annual Report for 2002 
listed more than 60 safety missions of various types to 29 States. Collectively, the services had 
generated a substantial body of worldwide safety experience. 
69. He had reconstituted the International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group with new terms of 
reference and a new membership, the aim being to have an authoritative source of recommendations 
and opinions on current and emerging nuclear installation safety issues. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 12 

70. With a view to the creation of a global, effective nuclear liability regime, he had decided to 
establish an International Expert Group on Nuclear Liability (INLEX) whose three main functions 
would be: to explore - and provide advice on - general issues relating to nuclear liability, including the 
need to further develop the AgencyÂs nuclear liability regime; to promote the adherence of all States to 
that regime regardless of whether they engaged in nuclear power-related activities; and to assist 
Member States in developing and strengthening national legal frameworks related to nuclear liability. 
71. Although the transport of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive material had been going on 
for decades without serious accidents, many Member States continued to express concern about the 
maritime transport risks. As part of the AgencyÂs efforts to promote dialogue among Member States, a 
widely attended international conference on the safety of transport of radioactive material had been 
held in Vienna in July. Most of the technical issues had been successfully addressed during the 
conference. Owing to the complexity of - in particular - the nuclear liability issue and the 
communication issue, however, some areas of disagreement between Member States had remained. 
The Agency would continue to promote constructive dialogue on those issues. 
72. That year there had been Transport Safety Appraisal Service (TranSAS) missions to Turkey and 
Panama and a pre-TranSAS visit to France, following missions to Brazil, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom. Some of the key States involved in the maritime transport of radioactive material had now 
hosted TranSAS missions, which he hoped would help to build confidence in the safety of 
international radioactive material transport and encourage other States, particularly ones very active in 
the transport of radioactive material, to make use of TranSAS. 
73. The AgencyÂs efforts to help Member States increase their nuclear security were continuing at a 
fast pace on several fronts. Measures to prevent the theft of nuclear material and the sabotage of 
nuclear facilities remained a high priority, and concerns about the threat of radiological terrorism had 
given increased emphasis to measures to improve the security of other radioactive material and to 
counter illicit trafficking. 
74. Since September 2001, the Agency had conducted 40 advisory and evaluation missions to 
countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa and convened 60 training courses, workshops and 
seminars. An international conference held in October 2002 in Karlsruhe, Germany, had focused on 
helping States to make use of advanced methods for analysing nuclear material seized in illicit 
trafficking incidents and to improve co-ordination between the nuclear science community and the law 
enforcement community. There had been International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) 
missions and follow-up missions to Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland, Turkey and Ukraine, and requests for 
eight additional IPPAS missions - to countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia - were currently 
being processed. Regional training courses on physical protection had been held Asia and Eastern 
Europe, and such courses were planned for Africa and Latin America. An international course was 
taking place in the United States at the moment, and a further one was planned for October. 
75. The identification and remedying of vulnerabilities at nuclear installations was an area in which 
safety and security merged. Workshops on safety measures contributing to the security of nuclear 
installations had been held in Hungary, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey. At an Agency 
conference held in Rabat, Morocco, earlier in the month, Member States had acknowledged the 
positive impact of the AgencyÂs Model Projects for upgrading national radiation protection 
infrastructures, at the same time calling for Agency guidance on how to reconcile the need for 
transparency in matters of radiation safety with the need for confidentiality where security was 
involved. 
76. There had been missions to numerous Member States in Eastern Europe, Africa and Central 
America for the purpose of assessing their ability to detect nuclear and other radioactive material at 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 13 

their borders and helping them to respond to illicit trafficking in such material. Significant progress 
had been made in formulating guidance for Member States on how to plan for responding to 
radiological emergencies resulting from malicious acts and on how to detect and respond to acts of 
illicit trafficking. 

77. In that connection, the Agency was strengthening its co-operation with other international 
organizations - including the United Nations and its specialized agencies, Interpol, Europol, the 
Universal Postal Union and the European Commission - in areas such as training and information 
exchange. 
78. Voluntary contributions amounting to nearly $23 million had been pledged to the Nuclear 
Security Fund by 21 countries and one organization, and over $13 million of that amount had been 
received. Much work remained to be done, however, and he hoped that further financial support would 
be forthcoming. 
79. Despite the increased attention being paid to the security of radioactive sources since September 
2001, many countries still lacked the programmes and resources necessary for responding properly to 
the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism. From information in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking 
database, combined with reports on discoveries of plans for making radiological dispersal devices, it 
was clear that a market existed for radioactive sources that could be used for malevolent purposes. 
Given the apparent readiness of terrorists to disregard their own safety, the personal danger involved 
in handling powerful radioactive sources could no longer be regarded as an effective deterrent. 
Fortunately, there had so far been no cases of radiological dispersal device utilization, but clearly the 
possible utilization of such devices had to be guarded against. 
80. Concern about radiological dispersal devices had been the focus of an international conference 
held in Vienna in March. The conference had emphasized the need for the Agency to assist States with 
locating and securing orphaned radioactive sources, to encourage the development of national source 
registries and strong national regulatory oversight bodies, to provide training and assistance designed 
to improve border controls and prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material, and 
to promulgate guidance on strengthening relevant national and international efforts. Findings from the 
conference had been reflected in a revised action plan for the safety and security of radioactive sources 
and a revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources which had been 
approved the previous week by the Board of Governors and the implementation of which would 
greatly improve radioactive source safety and security. 
81. The initiative launched by Russia, the United States and the Agency for securing vulnerable 
radioactive sources in countries of the former Soviet Union had so far resulted in missions to the 
Republic of Moldova and Tajikistan, with missions scheduled for seven additional countries. Also, the 
Agency was providing developing countries with assistance designed to ensure that sealed sources 
could be used and disposed of safely and securely; for example, it had assisted Angola, Sudan and 
CÃ´te dÂIvoire in organizing the return of sealed sources to the manufacturers. 
82. While much had been achieved in the area of nuclear safety and security, much still needed to 
be done in -for example - learning from recurring events, enhancing research reactor safety, 
continuing to enhance transport safety and tightening up the control of radioactive sources. The 
creation of a global nuclear safety culture - characterized by broad adherence to safety conventions, 
the adoption of legally binding agreements for the areas still not covered by such conventions, 
universal application of the complete set of Agency safety standards, and increased collaboration with 
relevant international organizations such as OECD/NEA and WHO - would do much to address the 
remaining vulnerabilities. The volume and scope of the activities relevant to protection against nuclear 
terrorism demonstrated the AgencyÂs ability to respond rapidly and with flexibility to emerging 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 14 

priorities, but the Agency would have to maintain the pace of its efforts if it was to be successful, 
particularly in combating illicit trafficking, protecting nuclear installations and nuclear and other 
radioactive material against sabotage, and responding to threats that could lead to radiological 
emergencies. 

83. The strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime was becoming more important than 
ever. Events of the past year had placed that regime under stress on several fronts and had made it 
clear that resolute steps to strengthen the regime were urgently required. The AgencyÂs role as an 
independent, objective verification body remained central to the effectiveness of the regime. 
84. In the SIR for 2002, the Agency concluded that, during 2002, in the 145 States (and in Taiwan, 
China) with safeguards agreements in force, the nuclear material and other items placed under 
safeguards had remained in peaceful nuclear activities or had been otherwise adequately accounted 
for - with the exception of the nuclear material in the DPRK. Moreover, in the case of 13 States with 
both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in force, the Agency, having 
found no indication of the existence of undeclared nuclear material or activities, had been able to 
provide broader assurance, concluding that all the nuclear material in those States had been declared 
and remained under safeguards. 
85. In response to resolution GC(46)/RES/12 adopted by the General Conference in 2002, the 
Secretariat had increased its efforts to promote the strengthened safeguards system through the 
conclusion of further safeguards agreements and additional protocols. Regional seminars had been 
held in Malaysia, Romania and Uzbekistan, with the financial support of Japan and the United States 
of America, in order to deepen the participating State officialsÂ understanding of the role of safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols in promoting the achievement of global and regional nonproliferation 
and security objectives. 
86. Since the previous yearÂs General Conference session, safeguards agreements had entered into 
force for Burkina Faso and Georgia, and the validity of AlbaniaÂs NPT safeguards agreement had been 
confirmed by an exchange of letters. Also, additional protocols had entered into force for Burkina 
Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Georgia, Jamaica, Kuwait and Mongolia. 
Additional protocols had now been concluded with 76 States and had entered into force for 36 of 
them. 
87. Clearly, however, the number of safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force 
remained well below expectations. Forty-seven States had yet to fulfil their legal obligation under the 
NPT to bring safeguards agreements with the Agency into force, and more than six years after the 
BoardÂs approval of the Model Additional Protocol over 150 countries still did not have an additional 
protocol in force. 
88. All those States which had not yet concluded and brought into force the required safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols should do so at an early date. Without the conclusion of 
safeguards agreements the Agency could not provide any assurance about the compliance of States 
with their nuclear non-proliferation obligations, and without the conclusion of additional protocols it 
could provide little or no assurance about the absence of undeclared material and activities. 
89. In 2002 he had reported that the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards had been 
completed, meaning that the necessary safeguards concepts, approaches, guidelines and criteria were 
sufficiently developed for the Agency to begin implementing integrated safeguards in States where the 
requisite safeguards conclusions had been drawn. Integrated safeguards aimed to improve the 
effectiveness and cost-efficiency of verification activities by integrating traditional nuclear material 
verification activities with new safeguards-strengthening measures, particularly those provided for in 
additional protocols. Efforts to improve the AgencyÂs technological capabilities for detecting 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 15 

undeclared nuclear material and activities were continuing. Integrated safeguards were currently being 
implemented in three States -Australia, Indonesia and Norway. 

90. Those three States had relatively small nuclear programmes. However, the implementation of 
integrated safeguards in States with much larger nuclear programmes - including Canada, Hungary 
and Japan - was expected to begin in the near future. 
91. He had recently initiated an evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of the safeguardsstrengthening 
measures now being implemented. The evaluation would be carried out by independent 
external evaluators, under the auspices of the AgencyÂs Office of Internal Oversight Services. Also, he 
had asked SAGSI to carry out a technical review of the safeguards criteria. 
92. The situation in the DPRK continued to pose a serious challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. 
93. As he had reported repeatedly to the Board, since 1993 the Agency had been unable to fully 
implement its NPT safeguards agreement with the DPRK. The Agency had never been allowed by the 
DPRK to verify the completeness and correctness of its initial declaration, made in 1992 - specifically, 
to verify that the DPRK had declared all the nuclear material subject to Agency safeguards under the 
NPT safeguards agreement. From November 1994 to December 2002, the Agency had been allowed to 
monitor the ÂfreezeÂ on the DPRKÂs graphite-moderated reactor and on related facilities pursuant to 
the Agreed Framework, but at the end of December 2002 the AgencyÂs inspectors had been withdrawn 
from the DPRK at its request. Since that time, the Agency had not performed any verification 
activities in the DPRK, and it could therefore not provide any assurance about the non-diversion of 
nuclear material in that country. 
94. The recent six-party talks in Beijing had clearly been a step in the right direction, towards a 
comprehensive resolution of the Korean crisis. He hoped that the dialogue would continue, that any 
future settlement would ensure the return of the DPRK to the nuclear non-proliferation regime, and 
that the Agency would be given the authority, resources and information necessary in order to fulfil its 
responsibilities under the NPT in a credible manner. He also hoped that the Agency would be 
consulted at an early stage on verification requirements. 
95. After an interruption of nearly four years, the Agency had resumed verification activities in Iraq 
in November 2002 under the mandate provided by United Nations Security Council resolution 687 and 
related resolutions. In December 1998, it had reported to the Security Council that the inspections 
carried out by it over a period of more than seven years had yielded no indication of Iraq having 
achieved the goal of producing a nuclear weapon and no indication that there remained in Iraq a 
physical capability for producing amounts of weapons-usable nuclear material of practical 
significance. 
96. Between November 2002 and March 2003, Agency inspection teams had carried out extensive 
inspection activities in Iraq to determine what, if anything, of relevance to IraqÂs nuclear activities and 
capabilities had changed there during the previous four years. 
97. At the time when the Agency had - in consultation with the President of the Security Council 
and the United Nations Secretary-General, and out of concern for the safety of its staff - ceased its 
Security Council-mandated verification activities in Iraq, it had found no evidence of a revival of 
nuclear activities prohibited under the relevant Security Council resolutions. However, following the 
four-year absence of its inspectors from Iraq, the time available for the renewed inspections had not 
been sufficient to permit the Agency to complete its overall review and assessment. 
98. The AgencyÂs mandate in Iraq under various Security Council resolutions still stood. In May, 
the Security Council had in resolution 1483 expressed its intention to review the mandates of the 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 16 

Agency and UNMOVIC. The Agency was awaiting the results of the review and further guidance 
from the Council. In the meantime, he hoped to be kept informed of the outcome of any current 
activities in Iraq that were relevant to the AgencyÂs mandate. Quite apart from its responsibilities 
pursuant to that mandate, the Agency had the continuing responsibility, under IraqÂs NPT safeguards 
agreement, to ensure that Iraq did not have any nuclear material or activities proscribed by that 
agreement and that all nuclear activities in Iraq were for peaceful purposes. The Agency would of 
course continue to fulfil that responsibility. 

99. In July he had reported to the Board and to the Security Council on a verification mission to 
Iraq that had been carried out in June. The request for that mission had been triggered by persistent 
media reports of looting. The mission teamÂs activities had been confined to the verification of 
material subject to safeguards at ÂLocation CÂ Nuclear Storage Facility near Tuwaitha, where the 
looting had reportedly taken place. In its report, the Agency had stated that a small quantity of 
uranium compounds could have been dispersed. Although - fortunately - neither the quantity nor the 
type of material involved would be sensitive from a proliferation point of view, he had called upon the 
Coalition Authority to ensure the physical protection of the entire nuclear inventory in Iraq. 
100. Pursuant to the mandate given him by the General Conference, he had continued to consult with 
the States of the Middle East region about the application of full-scope safeguards to all nuclear 
activities in the Middle East, the development of model agreements, and a forum on the experience of 
other regions that would contribute to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East. Once again, he regretted to report that, owing to the situation in the region, he had not been able 
to make progress in the implementation of that important mandate, which was of direct relevance to 
non-proliferation and security in the Middle East. As before, he would continue to exert every effort 
within his authority, and hoped that, with the active co-operation of all concerned, he would be able to 
make some progress in the coming year. 
101. During the current year, the Board had paid considerable attention to the implementation of the 
AgencyÂs NPT safeguards agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The previous week, it had 
adopted a resolution urging Iran to show proactive and accelerated co-operation and to demonstrate 
full transparency by providing the Agency with a complete and accurate declaration of all its nuclear 
activities. It was essential that all outstanding issues - particularly those involving highly enriched 
uranium - be brought to closure soon, so as to enable the Agency to provide the required assurance. As 
he had often stated, the more transparency was provided, the more assurance could be given - which 
was in the interests of both Iran and the international community. He therefore looked forward to a 
period of enhanced co-operation with Iran. 
102. For many years, he had reported on the progress being made under the initiative of Russia and 
the United States regarding the submission of nuclear material released from military programmes to 
Agency verification, with a focus on the associated technical, legal and financial issues. In 
September 2002, he had agreed with Minister Rumyantsev of Russia and Secretary Abraham of the 
United States that the initial phase of the work could now be concluded and that the verification 
concepts explored pursuant to the initiative would enable the Agency to derive credible and 
independent verification conclusions while the two States concerned would be able to ensure that 
sensitive information relating to the design or manufacture of nuclear weapons would not be divulged. 
The legal framework developed was ready to be used as the basis for the negotiation of agreements 
between the Agency and the two States, but no request regarding negotiations had yet been received 
from either of them. 
103. Agency verification continued to be a critical component of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, but its effectiveness depended on the Agency having the necessary authority, information and 
resources. An immediate priority, therefore, was the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 17 

agreements and additional protocols by all States that had made non-proliferation commitments. Also, 
it was essential that Member States provide the Agency with all the information relevant to its work, 
since the aim was to continue to implement safeguards in a manner that increased overall effectiveness 
and efficiency. On the broader front, it was essential that the international community continue to 
work towards the universal application of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. That was the key to the 
long-term viability of the non-proliferation regime. 

104. The technical co-operation programme of the Agency continued to be a major mechanism for 
implementing its basic - ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ - mission. With the AgencyÂs needs-driven approach there 
continued to be substantial differences between the technical assistance provided to different countries 
and regions: while many countries and regions focused primarily on development needs, others 
focused more on nuclear power plant safety, border controls, and other safety and security issues. 
105. The Secretariat was still working on ways of ensuring that Agency technical co-operation 
projects produced lasting benefits for recipient Member States. Efforts were being made to improve 
the planning of national technical co-operation strategies through early and direct dialogue with 
Member States and to ensure strong governmental commitment, with the focus on fewer but higherquality 
projects. Eighty-seven country programme frameworks - 29 more than in the previous year were 
now in place as planning tools for the design of technical co-operation projects within the context 
of national priorities. Thematic plans - which highlighted particular technical areas in which a nuclear 
technology could make a significant impact - had been prepared for food irradiation, river basin 
management and the use of isotopic techniques in the control of communicable diseases. Monitoring 
of the impact of projects had been expanded in order to increase project quality, relevance, 
effectiveness and sustainability. 
106. The Agency was continuing to build and expand partnerships with other international 
organizations and development partners, with a view to leveraging its limited resources, highlighting 
the benefits of nuclear technologies and - in some cases - drawing on the technical expertise of others 
so as to enhance the impact of a particular nuclear technique. 
107. Thus, the Asian Development Bank had recognized the AgencyÂs value in connection with its 
initiative aimed at reducing micronutrient malnutrition in Asia. Also, investigations carried out in 
Indonesia using stable isotopes to measure the effectiveness of fortified wheat flour had attracted the 
co-sponsorship of UNICEF, and the Indonesian experience was being drawn upon by China, Pakistan 
and other countries in studies designed to provide a basis for the formulation of nutrition policies. In 
addition, the results of an Agency project in which isotope-labelled water had been used in studying 
energy expenditure in young children in Chile and Cuba were being drawn upon by an 
FAO/WHO/UNU expert committee that was formulating recommendations on revised child nutrition 
requirements - work that would lead to an Agency study on low birth rates and one on obesity in 
adults, the results of which would be shared with WHO. 
108. The Agency was working to strengthen technical co-operation among developing countries 
through the pooling of resources and expertise in areas of mutual benefit, both within and between 
regions. For example, Mexico and Guatemala had established bilateral arrangements under which 
Mexico supported the implementation of a technical co-operation project in Guatemala through the 
provision of technical expertise. Also, Chile and the Republic of Korea had recently initiated bilateral 
co-operation, with Agency support, in the use of nuclear techniques in medicine and other fields. In 
addition, at the end of 2002 there had been seven regional resource centres in Africa designated within 
the AFRA framework for joint efforts in the areas of non-destructive testing, plant mutation breeding, 
radiation oncology, radioactive waste management and scientific equipment maintenance. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 18 

109. Most of the nuclear institutions in developing countries were largely dependent on government 
or donor funding for their operations. That funding had been gradually decreasing, which was 
endangering those institutions, whose expertise might well be lost. Several nuclear institutions had 
identified the inability to generate and retain income from services and products as a major barrier to 
self-reliance and sustainability. 
110. The Agency had been providing those institutions with guidance and training designed to help 
them achieve self-reliance and sustainability by revising their managerial practices, exploiting their 
core competencies and focusing their operations on areas relevant to national development efforts. In 
Africa, through support provided within the AFRA framework, at least ten national nuclear institutions 
had, by taking such action, become less dependent on external funding. In the East Asia and Pacific 
region, a regional project had focused on helping nuclear institutions to achieve self-reliance by 
providing needed services and products to the public and the private sector, thereby generating income 
and contributing directly to national development. 
111. Although many development needs of Member States were addressed through the sharing and 
transfer of nuclear technology, the public at large and even national and international decision-makers 
were often unaware of the fact. There was an awareness gap, and he had therefore asked the 
SecretariatÂs technical co-operation and public information experts to work out an Âexternal 
communication approachÂ together with representatives of Member States. He hoped that through 
better communication focused on a few thematic areas and a well-defined audience, including donor 
groups and international development organizations, it would be possible to demonstrate the 
soundness of investments in nuclear technology and know-how for economic and social development. 
112. Technical co-operation programme implementation, measured in financial terms, had in 2002 
reached an all-time high of $74.6 million - after the record of $71.0 million attained in 2001. However, 
implementation during 2003 had been hampered by - inter alia - the SARS epidemic and travel and 
transport restrictions resulting from security concerns, and the overall implementation figure for 2003 
was likely to be somewhat lower than that for 2002. In particular, the Agency had found it 
increasingly difficult to place fellows from many developing Member States in traditional host 
countries and to obtain visas for training course and workshop participants. The co-operation of 
Member States in helping to address the AgencyÂs difficulties was important. 
113. The new resources received for the 2002 programme had amounted to only $67.7 million, the 
lowest figure for new resources since 1998. Although the rate of attainment for contributions to the 
TCF had been set at 85% of the TCF target for 2002, the contributions received had corresponded to 
only about 80% of the target. The level of the pledges and payments of contributions to the TCF made 
so far in 2003 was encouraging, suggesting an upward trend, but he would nevertheless urge all 
Member States that had not already done so to pledge and pay their full shares of the TCF target for 
2003, in order to allow the 2003 technical co-operation programme to be fully implemented as planned 
and to provide a solid basis for the programme currently being finalized for 2004. 
114. With the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programmes continuing to respond successfully to the 
needs of Member States, the Agency was experiencing an ever-increasing demand for support through 
technical co-operation activities, and securing sufficient resources to meet that demand was a major 
challenge. He would continue to seek ways of enhancing the impact of technical co-operation projects 
through better planning, closer monitoring, expanded partnerships, the encouragement of self-reliance 
at national nuclear institutions, and the strengthening of technical co-operation among developing 
countries. Also, he would introduce a more proactive approach to external communication, so as to 
raise awareness of the developmental benefits of nuclear technologies and thereby attract greater 
financial support. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 19 

115. He was pleased that, after many months of intensive consultations, the Board had recommended 
the acceptance of regular budget proposals for 2004 which, when coupled with its plan to phase in 
further regular budget increases over the next few years, up to and including 2007, should go a long 
way towards easing the budgetary problems of the Agency and enabling it to carry out its top-priority 
activities. He was grateful for the hard work of the Board and of those Member States which had 
participated in the consultations conducted within the open-ended working group established for that 
purpose. 
116. He and the Secretariat, mindful of the fact that additional funds brought with them additional 
responsibilities, would remain committed to ensuring efficient and effective Agency programme 
delivery. A process of management reform had been introduced in 1998, and since then a number of 
important changes had been made - for example, results-based management had been introduced, a 
medium-term strategy had been adopted, annual senior management conferences had been instituted, 
the structure and internal procedures of the Secretariat had been streamlined, the AgencyÂs efficiency 
and organizational capacity had been enhanced through the greater use of information technology and, 
most recently, co-ordinators for cross-cutting issues had been appointed. 
117. In addition to the safeguards reviews mentioned by him earlier, an internal review of the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme management processes and the associated human 
resource requirements was currently under way. 
118. Moreover, efforts were being made to ensure that the various management initiatives launched 
and reforms introduced in recent years became part of the culture of the Secretariat. 
119. The end of the first biennium of full results-based management was approaching. The 
experience gained would be looked at closely and the lessons learned would be drawn upon in the next 
programme and budget cycle. In that connection, he would urge all Member States that had not yet 
done so to accept the amendment to Article XIV.A of the Statute which the General Conference had 
approved in 1999 in order to permit the introduction of biennial budgeting. To date, only 33 Member 
States had lodged the required instrument of acceptance with the depositary government. Biennial 
budgeting was important for the AgencyÂs recently introduced results-based approach to management 
and for the full implementation of a more effective programme and budget process. 
120. In recruiting Agency staff, he was guided by Article VII of the Statute, which stated that the 
paramount consideration in the recruitment of staff should be Âto secure employees of the highest 
standards of efficiency, technical competence, and integrity.Â In addition, he was mandated by the 
Statute and by General Conference resolutions to take into account: the contributions of Member 
States to the Agency; the importance of recruiting staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible, 
including unrepresented and under-represented countries; the desirability of increasing the number of 
staff from developing countries in senior positions; and the need for equality of gender representation 
in Professional positions. 
121. In the past six years, he had endeavoured to take those things into account, and the Agency now 
had 20% more Professional staff from developing countries. He would continue to fulfil his 
responsibilities with the best interests of the Agency in mind, and in accordance with Article VII of the 
Statute, the relevant General Conference resolution and the Board-approved staff regulations. 
However, he would need the assistance of Member States in identifying well-qualified persons and 
encouraging them to apply for vacant positions in the Agency. 
122. The international interest in nuclear issues continued to be high, helping to raise the AgencyÂs 
public profile. That was providing an opportunity to increase the awareness not only of the AgencyÂs 
role in areas of great current concern but also of other aspects of the AgencyÂs work. The Secretariat 
was striving to make good use of that opportunity in its responses to news media, on its web pages, 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 20 

and through its targeted multimedia products. For example, in hundreds of interviews during the past 
year about non-proliferation issues it had frequently reminded audiences of those other aspects. Some 
months earlier, a press campaign about the role of radiotherapy in combating the growing problem of 
cancer in developing countries had generated television, radio and press stories worldwide. He hoped 
that the Agency would continue to generate broader awareness of all the ways in which its work 
benefited Member States. 

123. After several years of reform efforts, the Agency could be proud of having achieved Âcutting 
edgeÂ effectiveness and efficiency, but it would continue to strive for performance improvements. The 
technical co-operation programme had become much more results-focused, but the resources for it 
needed to be more reliable, and the Agency needed to work more closely with recipient governments 
and other partners in order to increase the effectiveness of the programme. 
124. On the technology front, with global warming becoming an ever more serious threat worldwide 
the role of nuclear power as a clean source of energy that could mitigate that threat and contribute to 
sustainable development would depend on the success of the nuclear community in developing 
innovative technology and new approaches to current concerns. Non-power nuclear applications 
continued to demonstrate their increasing value, but there should be comparative assessments to 
ensure that such applications were employed only when they offered the best solution, and other 
technologies should still be used where they could enhance the benefits of a given nuclear technique. 
125. On the safety and security front, there were grounds for satisfaction at the degree of progress 
achieved, but all must remain vigilant. In the verification area, the Agency was working in an 
environment in which the nuclear non-proliferation regime was under growing stress. It should have 
all the authority, information and resources necessary in order to provide the international community 
with credible assurances. Also, the international community should work on bringing about the 
universality of the regime, address the question of proliferation incentives and endeavour to acquire 
better control over weapons-usable nuclear material, to establish a system of collective security that 
did not depend on nuclear weapons and to make steady but faster progress towards nuclear 
disarmament. 
126. The current year marked the 50th anniversary of the ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ speech in which 
President Eisenhower had articulated a vision, shared by many world leaders, of humanity making full 
use of the benefits of nuclear energy while minimizing its risks. That vision had led to the 
establishment of the Agency. Much had changed since then, and he believed that the time had come to 
take stock of the successes and failures, and to resolve to take whatever actions were required, 
including a switch to new ways of thinking and unconventional approaches, in order to ensure that 
nuclear energy remained a source of hope and prosperity for humanity and not a tool for selfdestruction. 
6. Contributions to the Technical Co-operation Fund for 2004 
(GC(47)/20) 

127. The PRESIDENT said that, following an agreement reached by the Board of Governors on 
18 July 2003, a TCF target figure of $74.75 million had been recommended for 2004. The early 
pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in planning the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation programmes, and he therefore urged delegations in a position to do so 
to notify the Secretariat during the current Conference session of the contributions which their 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 21 

governments would be making to the TCF for 2004. He would report at the end of the session, under a 
later agenda item, on the contributions which had been pledged so far. 

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2002 
(GC(47)/2) 

128. The PRESIDENT, pointing out that more than 90 delegates had already inscribed their names 
on the speakersÂ list, took it that, in order to avoid prolonged afternoon meetings (or a night meeting, 
the cost of which would be more than $16 000), the Conference authorized him, under Rule 50 of the 
Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of speeches to 15 minutes. 
129. It was so agreed. 
130. Mr. RUMYANTSEV (Russian Federation) said that the role of the Agency within the 
international nuclear non-proliferation regime was continuing to increase in importance and that the 
Agency was doing more and more to help Member States enjoy the benefits of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, including nuclear power generation. However, although the ÂCold WarÂ had ended 
some years previously there were many issues relating to the strengthening of peace and to strategic 
stability still to be resolved - and new challenges had emerged, particularly that of meeting the very 
real danger of international terrorists acquiring weapons of mass destruction or the materials and 
technological skills necessary for making such weapons. His country believed that such challenges 
should be met through active co-operation among all countries on the basis of international law and 
through strengthening of the international regime of which the NPT was a major element. 
131. Almost all countries were now parties to the NPT, which, in his countryÂs view, remained the 
most effective international legal instrument for countering the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation 
and a factor of great importance for both global and regional stability. Unfortunately, however, the 
NPT was currently under serious strain. His country therefore attached particular importance to the 
preparations being made for the 2005 NPT Review Conference, believing that the preparatory process 
should be used to strengthen the NPT and the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. The 
Agency, with its well-deserved reputation for professionalism and impartiality, could play an 
important role in that process. 
132. Russia had demonstrated its commitment to nuclear disarmament and to negotiations in the 
spirit of Article VI of the NPT by ratifying the Strategic Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty, the 
implementation of which was to reduce the numbers of the nuclear warheads in Russia and the United 
States to 1700-2000 by 31 December 2012. 
133. His country, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards system, would like to 
see all States parties to the NPT concluding additional protocols - especially the non-nuclear-weapon 
States engaged in significant peaceful nuclear activities involving nuclear fuel cycle facilities. 
134. In the present situation, it was impossible to overemphasize the importance of co-ordinating 
international efforts to eliminate the risk of nuclear terrorism. In the light of decisions taken by the G-8 
leaders at their summit meetings in Kananaskis, Canada, and Evian, France, about preventing terrorists 
and their accomplices from gaining access to weapons of mass destruction, his country believed that 
the Agency activities directed against nuclear terrorism deserved strong support. States should, with 
the assistance of the Agency, eliminate the possibility of acts of nuclear terrorism by improving the 
physical protection of nuclear materials and facilities, preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 22 

strengthening national systems of nuclear material accounting and control, and increasing the safety 
and security of ionizing radiation sources. 

135. In May, his Government had approved an energy strategy for the period until 2020 that foresaw 
nuclear power generation as the principal means of meeting RussiaÂs growing demand for electricity 
during that period. Against that background, Russian specialists were looking into the technical 
feasibility and cost-effectiveness of measures to improve the safety of existing power reactors and 
extend their service lifetimes. Accordingly, they welcomed the recently initiated extrabudgetary 
Agency programme on safety aspects of the long-term operation of PWRs. In their view, extending the 
service lifetimes of existing power reactors would facilitate the transition to new nuclear power 
technologies, with fast reactors replacing thermal ones. 
136. Large-scale R&D conducted with a view to securing the future of nuclear power was best 
conducted as an international co-operative effort, with a number of countries pooling resources. 
INPRO and the Generation IV International Forum were good examples of such an effort, and his 
country would welcome constructive practical interaction between the two. 
137. Following the completion of INPRO Phase 1A, there was to be a test of INPRO methodology at 
RussiaÂs BN-800 fast reactor. 
138. The Russian Federation, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs activities directed 
towards strengthening nuclear and radiation safety and waste management, welcomed the revised 
Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and looked forward to the BoardÂs 
consideration of a revised draft code of conduct for the safety of research reactors. 
139. The International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources held in Vienna in March 2003, 
co-sponsored by the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America and 
organized by the Agency, had been very important for future international co-operation in 
strengthening nuclear and radiation safety and the security of radioactive materials. 
140. His country looked forward to further close co-operation with the United States and the Agency 
within the framework of the tripartite initiative for securing radioactive sources in countries of the 
former Soviet Union - an initiative that was benefiting greatly from the support of the Director General 
and the United States Secretary of Energy. 
141. In May 2003, after almost five years of negotiations between the Russian Federation and a 
group of Western contributors, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme for Russia 
(MNEPR) agreement had been signed in Stockholm. The purpose of the MNEPR was to support 
co-operation relating to spent nuclear fuel safety, radioactive waste management and the dismantling 
of nuclear-powered submarines and icebreakers in the Russian Federation. The MNEPR laid the basis 
for the implementation of projects by Western countries in the north-west of the Russian Federation for 
example, urgent projects covered by bilateral and multilateral aid programmes such as the 
ÂNuclear WindowÂ of the European UnionÂs Northern Dimension Environmental Programme. 
142. According to Agency information, more than 200 000 tons of irradiated nuclear fuel had 
accumulated worldwide since the beginning of nuclear power generation, and it was therefore high 
time to consolidate the efforts of various countries directed towards solving the common problem of 
managing irradiated fuel rationally and safely. In that context, the Russian Federation welcomed the 
Director GeneralÂs idea of establishing a group of experts to evaluate, under the AgencyÂs auspices, 
different approaches to that problem. 
143. In recent years, the question of radioactive material transport had been attracting more and more 
attention. Although the Russian Federation did not think that the technological aspects of the question 
should give grounds for concern, it was grateful to the Agency for convening the International 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 23 

Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material held in July. It hoped that the 
discussions during the Conference would help to allay certain concerns about the international 
transport of radioactive material by rail and by sea. 

144. A pressing international issue was that of preserving the knowledge accumulated in the field of 
nuclear science and technology, and his country was pleased that the Agency was attracting public 
attention to the issue and trying to resolve it through international co-operation. 
145. The Russian Federation considered technical co-operation to be one of the AgencyÂs top 
priorities, and it welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts to make the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programmes an efficient means of ensuring sustainable economic and social development. 
146. On 27 June 1954, not long after President EisenhowerÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ speech, the worldÂs 
first nuclear power reactor had been commissioned -in Obninsk. That reactor, operating for almost 
50 years, had demonstrated the technical feasibility and viability of nuclear power generation. In 2004 
the Russian Federation would be hosting an international conference on ÂFifty Years of Atomic 
PowerÂ, to be organized with the participation of the Agency. He hoped that many other General 
Conference delegates would attend that conference. 
147. Mr. HOSODA (Japan) said that the DPRK nuclear issue had been raising international tension 
since October 2002. Japan, which had for a long time been financially and technically supporting the 
KEDO light-water reactor project in order to help the DPRK meet its energy needs, regretted that the 
DPRK remained in non-compliance with its safeguards agreement with the Agency and was 
proceeding with the development of nuclear weapons. The issue was a critical one for both regional 
and global peace and stability. 
148. As a neighbour of the DPRK, Japan would under no circumstances accept the development, 
acquisition, possession, testing or transfer of nuclear weapons by the DPRK, which should 
immediately and completely abandon any nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons programmes in a 
verifiable and irreversible manner. It believed in verification in connection with the DPRK nuclear 
issue and would continue to support the AgencyÂs verification efforts. 
149. The six-party talks held recently in Beijing had been an important starting point for a 
meaningful process leading towards a peaceful resolution of the issue, and it was essential to continue 
that process. 
150. The issue of the implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement with the Islamic Republic of 
Iran had become increasingly serious. The international community was deeply concerned about that 
issue, and Japan would like to see the Islamic Republic of Iran co-operating fully with the Agency in 
resolving it promptly and unconditionally, concluding and fully implementing an additional protocol 
to the NPT safeguards agreement. Japan expected the Islamic Republic of Iran to take, by the end of 
October 2003, all the actions called for by the Board in the resolution it had adopted on 
12 September 2003. 
151. Japan, which remained unshakeably committed to the NPT regime, would fulfil its obligations 
under its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency and the additional protocol to that agreement, 
ensuring full transparency in its nuclear activities, including the utilization of plutonium. 
152. Japan was the only country in the world to have suffered devastation caused by nuclear 
weapons, and its Atomic Energy Basic Law strictly limited the use of nuclear energy in Japan to 
peaceful purposes. The Japanese Government was a firm adherent to a long-standing policy whereby 
Japan would not produce or possess nuclear weapons or permit their introduction into Japan. That 
policy would not change. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 24 

153. As a nation with insufficient energy sources, Japan continued to attach high priority to nuclear 
power generation. It aimed to establish, with enhanced public understanding, a nuclear fuel cycle in 
which safety and non-proliferation were ensured. 
154. The falsification of self-inspection records by a Japanese co-operator, made public in 
August 2002, had seriously damaged public confidence in nuclear safety. In response, the Japanese 
Government had drastically revised its nuclear safety regulations in order to enhance JapanÂs nuclear 
safety culture. 
155. Thermonuclear fusion was a promising future source of practically unlimited energy, and the 
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project represented a major step towards 
achieving thermonuclear fusion. Japan had proposed a candidate site for ITER, and it would continue 
to actively support the ITER project. 
156. In view of recent problems related to the NPT regime, the AgencyÂs safeguards system needed 
to be strengthened. To that end, the universalization of additional protocols should be promoted. So 
far, 74 States had signed an additional protocol, but only 35 had brought one into force. That was far 
from satisfactory, and Japan would like to see far more States concluding additional protocols. The 
International Conference on Wider Adherence to Strengthened IAEA Safeguards, held in Tokyo in 
December 2002, had been very successful, reaffirming the importance of additional protocols. The 
Conference ChairmanÂs summary had contained a proposal for a series of actions designed to achieve 
wider adherence to strengthened Agency safeguards. In keeping with the ConferenceÂs outcomes, 
Japan would continue to promote the universalization of additional protocols. 
157. Nuclear security had become an important issue for the international community since 
11 September 2001, as evidenced by the International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources 
held in March and by the G-8 Evian Summit in June. Japan was continuing to take appropriate 
measures in the nuclear safety area, and it expected the international community to work on improving 
the management of radioactive sources and to support the AgencyÂs vital efforts in that connection. It 
would like to see many Member States implementing the revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources and reflecting it in their legislation. 
158. The smooth and safe transport of nuclear materials was essential for the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy. Nuclear material transport had always been carried out in conformity with the strictest safety 
standards, established by international organizations such as the International Maritime Organization 
and the Agency, and on the basis of the principles of freedom of navigation recognized under relevant 
international laws. The International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material 
held by the Agency in July had contributed to further enhancing the safety of nuclear material 
transport. In view of the importance of the issue, Japan was considering the acceptance of a TranSAS 
mission. 
159. The international community must increase the effectiveness of nuclear non-proliferation. 
Political appeals were not enough; the Agency must be provided with adequate financial resources. 
Japan, which recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards activities, had therefore, as a very 
exceptional measure, supported the proposed Regular Budget increases for 2004-2005. Efficiency was 
also important, however, and in July, when the Regular Budget had been agreed on, it had also been 
agreed that the Secretariat should review the cost-effectiveness of Agency safeguards. Japan looked 
forward to the early application of integrated safeguards in those countries which met the relevant 
criteria and to visible efforts by the Secretariat -with tangible results - to increase safeguards 
efficiency. 
160. The peaceful use of nuclear energy could greatly contribute to the welfare of mankind while 
reducing the burden on the environment. However, challenges to the NPT regime and Agency 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 25 

safeguards had surfaced. Against that background, the AgencyÂs activities in promoting both the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear non-proliferation were particularly important. Japan would 
continue lending its full support to those activities. 

161. Mr. ABRAHAM (United States of America) began his statement by reading out the following 
message from President Bush: 
ÂI send greetings to those gathered at the 47th conference of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). 

ÂAlmost 50 years ago, President Eisenhower proposed the Atoms for Peace initiative, which 
established the principles that all nations must work to stem nuclear proliferation and that all 
responsible nations should enjoy the peaceful benefits of nuclear power and technology under 
sound non-proliferation conditions. Since 1957, the IAEA has been the center of international 
efforts to turn these principles into practice. 

ÂThough the world has changed, and the roles of IAEA Member States have changed with it, the 
ideas of non-proliferation and peaceful nuclear power remain unchanged. The work of preventing 
nuclear proliferation has taken on a sense of great urgency. Today, as some States are seeking to 
acquire nuclear weapons, we must uphold our great responsibility to ensure full compliance with 
the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. With co-operation and strong 
leadership, we can combat the threat of nuclear proliferation and advance safety and security for 
people throughout the world. 

ÂBest wishes for a successful conference.Â 

162. During the past 50 years, the world had enjoyed enormous benefits from an impressive array of 
peaceful nuclear applications. However, such benefits remained linked to the obligation to use nuclear 
energy responsibly. Dramatic changes in the security environment now jeopardized them. 
163. Two years previously, shortly after 11 September 2001, he had spoken to the General 
Conference about the need for Member States to increase their efforts to address terrorist threats. 
There was reason to be proud of what had been accomplished since then. For example, the Agency 
had established a nuclear security plan of action and a Nuclear Security Fund, and the efforts to secure 
nuclear facilities worldwide had been accelerated. 
164. The international community had responded well to the need to address the threats posed by 
high-risk, under-secured radioactive sources, material that could be used in Âdirty bombsÂ, as 
evidenced by the many initiatives undertaken by the Agency since the International Conference on 
Security of Radioactive Sources held in March. 
165. Good progress was being made in the bilateral co-operative non-proliferation efforts of Russia 
and the United States. He and the Russian Minister for Atomic Energy, Mr. Rumyantsev, had together 
overseen efforts to - inter alia - reduce potential threats from under-secured nuclear materials in Russia 
and shut down Russian reactors still producing plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons. 
166. Such efforts were making the world more secure, but the non-proliferation regime was facing 
serious challenges from a few rogue States seeking a capability for attaining weapons of mass 
destruction (WMDs) and from those States which were facilitating their search or often appeared 
indifferent to it. Sophisticated terrorist organizations were also pursuing WMD capabilities, and illicit 
efforts to acquire nuclear and radiological weapons technologies and materials continued to be 
reported. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 26 

167. There was a need to build on the successes of the past and overcome the challenges of the 
present, in order to expand and sustain humankindÂs ability to enjoy the benefits of peaceful nuclear 
co-operation. Strengthening the non-proliferation regime was extremely important in that connection. 
168. First, the safeguarding and physical protection of nuclear materials must be further 
strengthened. His Government welcomed the recommendation made by the Board of Governors for an 
increase the AgencyÂs budget, primarily in support of the AgencyÂs verification activities, and 
President Bush had requested an increase of $10 million in the Department of EnergyÂs budget in 
order to support safeguards in the coming year. 
169. In 2002, President Bush had forwarded to the United States Senate, for ratification, the 
additional protocol to the safeguards agreement between the United States and the Agency. The Senate 
intended to hold hearings soon regarding the additional protocol - an essential step towards making 
strengthened safeguards a reality in the United States. Other Member States needed to act as well. 
170. Second, trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials and in nuclear technologies for 
weapons purposes must be prevented. The Proliferation Security Initiative was an important step in 
that regard, and the United States would like to see that initiative supported by all States that shared its 
concerns about the proliferation of WMDs. 
171. However, more must be done. Export control systems must be strengthened, and President Bush 
had proposed a $6 million increase in the Department of EnergyÂs export control budget, the additional 
funding to be used in helping to train and better equip customs guards and other border officials at 
home and abroad, in helping to develop new means of detection, and in supporting many other steps. 
172. During that week, he and his Chinese counterpart would sign a ÂStatement of IntentÂ regarding 
an exchange of non-proliferation assurances in connection with the transfer of nuclear technology. 
That would help China and the United States to realize the benefits of peaceful nuclear co-operation 
while ensuring that the co-operation took place within the context of strong non-proliferation 
commitments. 
173. In addition, the United States would assist the Netherlands with the installation at the Rotterdam 
seaport of equipment to screen for nuclear and other radioactive materials. Other States were 
considering the installation of such equipment, and still others should be doing so. 
174. Third, it was necessary to improve the security of research reactors and of other facilities where 
nuclear and non-nuclear radioactive materials might be co-located. Such facilities, which often 
supported legitimate peaceful applications of nuclear technology, could be vulnerable to sabotage, 
theft or attack if not adequately protected. 
175. The United States was responding to that problem. In Romania, it would be providing up 
to $4 million towards the purchase of low-enriched uranium fuel to be substituted for the highly 
enriched uranium fuel in the Pitesti research reactor. That exemplified what must be done to improve 
materials security without sacrificing the peaceful benefits of nuclear technology, and the United 
States strongly endorsed the AgencyÂs efforts in that connection. 
176. To begin or accelerate the initiatives that he had described, the United States would contribute 
an additional $3 million to the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Fund, and it would like to see many 
Member States following suit to the extent they were able. 
177. Those were practical steps that could be taken in order to address a number of serious 
proliferation concerns. There was a broader context, however, and responsible members of the 
international community should be concerned about the threats from a few States whose actions could 
undermine the non-proliferation regime. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 27 

178. ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ had been an initiative of the United States from which enormous benefits 
had accrued. The United States remained strongly committed to its objectives and to working within 
its parameters. 
179. The NPT was being challenged, however, and the international community must take strong 
measures to impede the efforts of those who were determined to undermine it. It must deal 
immediately and effectively with any State seeking to exploit the NPT for its own advantage and 
ignoring the letter and/or the spirit of its obligations under the NPT. 
180. The DPRK was one such State, but he was confident that progress would be made in 
dismantling its nuclear weapons programme in the context of the six-party approach recently initiated 
in Beijing. However, it was necessary to consider why the DPRK had been able to make so much 
progress in its nuclear weapons programme while a party to the NPT. 
181. The DPRKÂs activities sent to other would-be proliferants the message that a State could be a 
party to the NPT, enjoying its benefits, and still put in place the assets needed in order to break out of 
the NPT and pronounce itself a nuclear-weapon State. That was the wrong message, and the associated 
chain of events must not be allowed to happen again. All States that supported the non-proliferation 
regime and enjoyed the peaceful benefits deriving from it should take a clear look at the problem 
posed by proliferant States attempting to flout the NPT and should address that problem realistically 
and with determination. 
182. The United States was pleased with the resolution that had been adopted by consensus in the 
Board of Governors on 12 September 2003. That resolution had made it clear that the international 
community would not tolerate erosion of the non-proliferation regime, that the Islamic Republic of 
Iran had not responded to repeated calls for co-operation and transparency, and -most importantly that 
the DPRK precedent was unacceptable and Member States were prepared to take firm action in 
the face of serious challenges to the non-proliferation regime. 
183. Fifty years earlier, President Eisenhower had declared that Âif a danger exists in the world, it is a 
danger shared by all; and equally, if a hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be 
shared by all.Â Those words were still true and should guide the choices made in the pursuit of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
184. Mr. ANTONIONE (Italy) - speaking on behalf of the European Union, of the acceding countries 
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and 
Slovenia, of the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, and of Norway and Iceland expressed 
sorrow at the cowardly assassination days earlier of the Swedish Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Anna Lindh. 
185. In June, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, meeting in Thessaloniki, 
had reiterated their commitment to preventing the proliferation of WMDs. As regards nuclear 
weapons, the European Union considered a global nuclear non-proliferation regime supported by a 
strong system of international safeguards to be an essential prerequisite for collective security. The 
NPT was the cornerstone of such a regime, and the AgencyÂs safeguards system an essential element. 
Recent challenges to the NPT and the nuclear non-proliferation regime had again highlighted the need 
for full compliance with NPT obligations and for strong efforts to achieve universal adherence to the 
regime. 
186. In April, the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 NPT Review Conference had underscored the 
responsibility of the Agency for further strengthening its safeguards system. The Preparatory 
CommitteeÂs position was shared by the European Union. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 28 

187. The universal adoption and implementation of safeguards agreements with their additional 
protocols were essential for the effectiveness and credibility of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. In 
particular, the measures provided for in additional protocols were crucial to the detection by the 
Agency of undeclared nuclear material and activities and to the AgencyÂs ability to provide assurances 
regarding the absence of such material and activities. 
188. The European Union regretted the fact that the number of safeguards agreements and additional 
protocols in force continued to be far below expectations. All Member States of the European Union 
had signed additional protocols, which they had ratified or were in the process of ratifying. They were 
determined to bring those additional protocols into force before the end of the year. The European 
Union would like to see many more countries signing additional protocols. 
189. The European Union would also like to see the Secretariat further intensifying its co-operation 
with Euratom, especially with a view to the implementation of integrated safeguards within the 
European Union. In addition, it hoped that other States and regional groups would increase their 
co-operation with the Agency in the safeguards field. 
190. The European Union, which strongly supported all measures aimed at preventing terrorists from 
acquiring nuclear weapons, believed that, while the primary responsibility for nuclear security rested 
with States, the Agency had an essential role to play in combating nuclear terrorism. After 
11 September 2001, the Agency had promptly reoriented and stepped up its activities relevant to 
combating nuclear terrorism, and the European Union welcomed what had been achieved. It also 
welcomed the contributions which had been made to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
191. The Director General and the Secretariat were to be commended for helping Member States to 
establish and maintain stringent nuclear security frameworks. 
192. The European Union welcomed the decision taken by the Board in March 2002 under the 
agenda item ÂProtection against nuclear terrorismÂ, which had paved the way for much greater 
international co-operation under Agency coordination. It also welcomed the progress made in carrying 
out activities relevant to protection against nuclear terrorism - expanding activities being carried out 
mainly in support of national measures. In that context, it had noted the important role being played by 
Agency technical co-operation activities in upgrading safety and security. 
193. The European Union welcomed the increase, to 87, in the number of States parties to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, but it would like to see far more States 
becoming parties. It also welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in support of StatesÂ efforts to combat 
illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material, but it would also like to see far more States 
taking appropriate measures against illicit trafficking in such material. 
194. The European Union was grateful to the Co-Chairmen of the Informal Open-Ended Working 
Group on the Programme and Budget for 2004-2005, which had succeeded in producing a 
compromise package that would lead to substantial budgetary increases in 2004 and 2005. The 
Member States of the European Union could go along with the compromise package because they 
were aware of the AgencyÂs unavoidable future financial needs -mainly for verification activities. 
195. The European Union appreciated the work done by the Secretariat with a view to the 
introduction within the Agency of a single-currency system based on the euro by 2006. 
196. The European Union greatly appreciated the actions taken by the Agency in continuing to verify 
nuclear material in Iraq, including the mission which had focused on verification of the material 
subject to safeguards at Tuwaitha, where looting had reportedly taken place. In resolution 1483 
(2003), the United Nations Security Council had underlined its intention to revisit the mandate which 
it had assigned to the Agency with regard to Iraq. While looking forward to the Security Council 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 29 

review of that mandate, the European Union wished to recall that, irrespective of the outcome, the 
Agency would still have the obligation, under IraqÂs NPT safeguards agreement, to check that Iraq 
possessed no proscribed nuclear material. 

197. The European Union, which was increasingly concerned about the nuclear programme of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, wished to see that country co-operating fully with the Agency and meeting 
all the requests made of it by the Board. The prompt and unconditional signing, ratification and 
implementation of an additional protocol would be regarded as a sign of Iranian commitment to 
nuclear non-proliferation 
198. The Islamic Republic of Iran had failed to fulfil many of its obligations under its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. The delay in informing the Agency about the full extent of its nuclear 
programme, the undeclared receipt of nuclear material, the failure to declare the facilities where that 
material was stored and being processed, the introduction - despite a Board request - of nuclear 
material into the pilot facilities at Natanz, and the presence of undeclared highly enriched uranium 
were all grounds for grave concern. 
199. The Iranian authorities should, as a confidence-building measure, halt all enrichment-related 
activities until the Agency had resolved the issue of the undeclared highly enriched uranium and 
suspend any reprocessing activities that might be taking place. In addition, they should help to further 
clarify the questions relating to the importation of sophisticated equipment during the 1980s, to heavy 
water projects and to the production of uranium metal. 
200. The European Union, which greatly appreciated the Director GeneralÂs efforts to resolve the 
outstanding issues connected with the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, would like 
to see that country taking all the steps necessary in order to ensure the total transparency of its nuclear 
programme and to restore the confidence of the international community. 
201. WMDs were an issue of concern in the political dialogue between the Islamic Republic of Iran 
and the European Union, the progress of which would have implications for the economic relations 
between them. It was in the interest of the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by the peace and security 
norms applied internationally. 
202. The European Union, which had many times expressed its grave concern about the continued 
failure of the DPRK to fully implement its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency, 
deplored the DPRKÂs decision to withdraw from the NPT. The DPRK should completely dismantle its 
nuclear weapons programme in a verifiable and irreversible manner and fulfil its NPT obligations, 
which still stood. Only strict observance of the NPT, including acceptance of the full implementation 
of comprehensive Agency safeguards, could provide the necessary assurances about the DPRKÂs 
desire for positive international relations. 
203. The Board of Governors had reported to the United Nations Security Council that the DPRK 
was still not complying with its NPT safeguards agreement, and the European Union was alarmed that 
the Agency was still unable to verify the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration made 
by the DPRK regarding the nuclear material in its possession. Nevertheless, the European Union was 
in favour of a continuation of the dialogue taking place among all the interested parties. Thus, it 
welcomed the two meetings held recently in Beijing with a view to arriving at a negotiated solution to 
the DPRK nuclear issue and hoped that all those involved in those meetings would pursue negotiations 
in good faith. Above all, the DPRK should fully and unconditionally meet all its relevant international 
obligations, especially those arising out of its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
204. The Agency, in playing an essential role as the competent authority for verifying compliance 
with safeguards agreements, had earned the trust of the international community. In addition, the 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 30 

Agency was playing an essential role by promoting safety in the use of nuclear technology for 
peaceful purposes in those Member States which chose to use such technology. The European Union 
and the acceding States would continue to support the Agency in the performance of its statutory 
functions. 

205. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), recalling that on 12 September the Board of 
Governors had adopted a resolution relating to his countryÂs nuclear programme, said that his 
delegation objected not only to the content of the resolution but also to the manner in which it had 
been developed and negotiated. The resolution went beyond the letter and the spirit of the NPT and the 
AgencyÂs Statute, and even beyond the provisions of the additional protocol which his country was 
currently negotiating. The Iranian delegation had been unable to associate itself with the resolution, 
which had been pushed to a decision through the attribution to the Secretariat of opinions that it did 
not hold, through arm-twisting in many capitals and through the disregarding of views expressed and 
amendments proposed by 15 members of the Non-Aligned Movement and by others, including some 
co-sponsors of the draft resolution. The entire exercise had been an example of unilateralism at its 
worst - namely, unilateralism wearing a multilateralist cloak. 
206. His country believed that there was more to the resolution than met the eye - that there was an 
underlying agenda directed towards an escalation of tension and chaos for the purpose of diverting 
attention from serious issues of partisan politics in the United States. The heavy-handed approach 
adopted in pushing through the resolution cast serious doubt on the resolutionÂs practical usefulness; 
one could not help feeling that the resolution had been formulated in such a way as to guarantee its 
non-implementation or at best its semi-implementation, rather than to promote the effectiveness of the 
non-proliferation regime. The resolution was inconsistent with the NPT, set a deadline for 
co-operation and contained venomous language - all very problematic features. His authorities, whose 
preliminary views he had just expressed, were studying the resolution carefully and would respond to 
it officially within a few days. 
207. 
Meanwhile, he considered it important to underline that: 
- 
his country was fully committed to the NPT not only because of the obligations which it 
had assumed pursuant to it, but also on religious and ethical grounds; 
- 
for strategic reasons, his countryÂs policies and actions were geared to strengthening the 
safeguards regime; 
- 
his country, in planning to develop a nuclear power generation capacity of 7000 MW(e), 
wished to help strengthen the safeguards regime by concluding an additional protocol or 
taking some other action that would encourage the international community to seriously 
urge others in the Middle East to respond positively to his countryÂs initiative aimed at 
making the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone; 
- 
the efforts of his country to resolve outstanding issues through steadily increasing 
co-operation between it and the Agency were being opposed by parties seeking to disrupt 
that co-operation; 
- 
the resolution adopted by the Board was counter-productive in that it had interrupted a 
process which would undoubtedly have resulted in full transparency and a restoration of 
confidence; 
- 
his country was willing to seek ways of salvaging that process and keeping the issue 
under consideration within the framework of the Agency, under the direction of the 
Director General, account being taken of the interpretation placed by most Board 
members on the resolution; 

GC(47)/OR.1

- 
his country, as a party to the NPT, had an undeniable right to use nuclear technology for 
peaceful purposes; 
- 
his country would continue to co-operate with the Agency within the framework of 
comprehensive safeguards; and 
- 
his country would, as already stated by the Iranian Government, continue negotiating 
with the Agency on the additional protocol. 
208. The Islamic Republic of Iran firmly believed that the only way to counter challenges emanating 
from the nuclear arsenals of the nuclear Powers and from the proliferation of nuclear weapons was to 
strengthen the relevant international instrument through multilateral, comprehensive and 
non-discriminatory efforts, and that the NPT was the cornerstone of international efforts to achieve 
complete nuclear disarmament and halt vertical and horizontal nuclear proliferation. The essential 
question remaining was which country would accept the blame for providing Israel with nuclear 
weapons in contravention of its relevant NPT obligations. 
209. The effectiveness of the NPT depended on full compliance with all its provisions by all parties. 
The credibility of the NPT would be undermined by selective and discriminatory approaches to its 
implementation. 
210. Mr. GOFF (New Zealand) associated himself with the European UnionÂs expression of sorrow 
at the assassination of Anna Lindh, the Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
211. The prospect of terrorists gaining access to nuclear weapons was a horrifying one, and the risk 
of terrorists doing that could not be taken lightly. The Agency was engaged in valuable work directed 
against nuclear terrorism, through a programme financed from its Nuclear Safety Fund, to which New 
Zealand had made two contributions. 
212. Under that programme, training in the control of radioactive sources was being conducted and 
States were being provided with effective tools for combating illicit trafficking in nuclear material. 
213. The International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources held in Vienna in March 2003 
had - inter alia - underlined the importance of effective national nuclear regulatory structures and 
raised the profile of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, which 
had been revised in order to take greater account of the danger of radioactive sources falling into the 
hands of terrorists. New Zealand intended to fully implement the Code of Conduct as soon as possible. 
214. As one of the first countries to sign the NPT, New Zealand was deeply concerned about the 
announcement by the DPRK that it was withdrawing from the NPT. The development of nuclear 
weapons by the DPRK was destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and threatening regional security. Also, 
it might prompt other countries in that part of the world to develop nuclear weapons, opening up - as 
in South Asia - the possibility of nuclear confrontation. New Zealand welcomed the recent multilateral 
talks on the DPRK nuclear issue and hoped that the process of dialogue would continue, leading to an 
agreement which would result in the permanent abandonment by the DPRK of its nuclear weapons 
and the renewal of energy and development assistance to the DPRK. China was to be commended for 
the constructive role which it was playing in facilitating the process of dialogue. 
215. New Zealand was greatly concerned about the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. Given the scope and advanced state of that programme, it was important that the Agency be able 
to verify that the intentions of the Islamic Republic of Iran were peaceful. The Islamic Republic of 
Iran should, as a matter of urgency, co-operate fully with the Agency and demonstrate complete 
transparency in order that the Agency might provide the independent assurances which the 
international community needed. 

GC(47)/OR.1 
15 September 2003, Page 32 

216. The NPT envisaged not only that States would forego the development of nuclear weapons but 
also that those States which already possessed nuclear weapons would give them up; it provided for 
nuclear disarmament, and the nuclear disarmament commitment made by the nuclear-weapon States and 
reaffirmed unequivocally at the 2000 NPT Review Conference - should be honoured. Appeals by 
nuclear-weapon States to other States not to develop nuclear weapons would carry more moral 
authority if accompanied by greater progress in the field of nuclear disarmament. 
217. The current development of strategic plans which appeared to envisage the possible use of 
nuclear weapons was a matter for great concern, and research into new types of nuclear weapons 
would run counter to the NPT and undermine the efforts being made to achieve universal adherence to 
it. 
218. The early entry into force of the CTBT was the first of the 13 practical steps to nuclear 
disarmament agreed at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. New Zealand was very concerned about the 
fact that the prospects for the CTBTÂs entry into force had not improved. Pending the entry into force 
of the CTBT, for which New Zealand would continue to press, it was important that the work on 
establishing an international monitoring system continue. Even if the CTBT was not in force, a 
network of monitoring stations was essential for exposing any State which resumed nuclear weapons 
tests. 
219. The Pacific Forum, which New Zealand was currently chairing, had repeatedly expressed 
concern about the risks to populations and the environment associated with the maritime transport of 
radioactive material and had called for a strict regulatory regime and for a comprehensive liability 
regime that met the needs of all. New Zealand welcomed the outcomes of the International Conference 
on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material held in Vienna in July, which had recommended 
the establishment of a dialogue between the shipping States and the relevant coastal States on 
communication between governments and the setting up of a working group on liability. It hoped that 
real progress would be made in the months to come. 
220. New Zealand greatly appreciated the professionalism displayed by the Director General and his 
staff during the past year, which had been a difficult one, and particularly the manner in which the 
Director General had carried out his responsibilities - sometimes under extraordinary pressure. It was 
confident that the Director General would provide strong leadership and demonstrate sound judgement 
also in the future. 
221. With the current instabilities as regards global security, the coming year was also likely to bring 
many challenges for the Agency. He therefore wished to emphasize that New Zealand remained 
strongly committed to the Agency, which was making an indispensable contribution to the multilateral 
disarmament and non-proliferation system. 
The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.

7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (continued) 
(GC(47)/2) 
1. Ms. FERRERO-WALDNER (Austria) said that, in fighting the threat of terrorism and weapons 
of mass destruction, the international community was united in spite of differing views. Developments 
over the preceding year had both highlighted the importance and raised the profile of the Agency as a 
nuclear safety and non-proliferation watchdog, underlining its immense responsibility for maintaining 
international stability and security. Vienna was proud to host such an organization. 
2. A key element of nuclear security was the protection of nuclear material against theft and the 
protection of nuclear facilities against sabotage or unauthorized access. The AgencyÂs physical 
protection guidelines had served those purposes well since the early 70s. The CPPNM, although an 
important first step towards a legally binding instrument in that field, failed to meet current needs. She 
therefore commended the Director General for his initiative in convening a group of experts to discuss 
possible amendments to the Convention, and for having presented the results of those deliberations to 
Member States. Austria had participated actively in the expert meetings and was working with other 
countries to prepare a proposal for amendment of the Convention. 
3. Another key element of nuclear security and nuclear non-proliferation was safeguards. Over the 
preceding twelve months the Board had dealt with proliferation challenges in Iraq, the DPRK and Iran. 
It was of utmost importance that the Agency should be able to verify not only non-diversion of nuclear 
material but also the absence of undeclared materials and activities. As a staunch supporter of the 
safeguards system, Austria had welcomed the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol and the 
development of the integrated safeguards system, but it shared the Director GeneralÂs disappointment 
at the low number of additional protocols that had come into force so far. Furthermore, 47 countries 
had not yet even concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency as required under 
Article III of the NPT. Her country held the view that the conclusion of an additional protocol was not 
optional but a legal obligation for non-nuclear-weapon States party to the NPT. It therefore called 
upon all States to negotiate and conclude an additional protocol to their safeguards agreements without 
delay. It also appreciated the efforts of the Agency and the Government of Japan to promote the 
universal application of the additional protocol. 
4. Nuclear security was a precondition for nuclear cooperation and trade, and States party to the 
NPT were obliged to ensure that any nuclear items they supplied were not diverted to non-peaceful 
uses. To do that, it was essential to verify that the recipient state had concluded a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, that it adequately protected its nuclear material, had 
adopted and implemented stringent export control legislation, and had adequate measures in place to 
combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material. Many countries lacked the experience to devise and 
implement such a national nuclear security system. It was therefore incumbent on the Agency and 
Member States with sufficient experience to assist those countries to close the security gap. 
5. AustriaÂs nuclear power policy aimed at gradually phasing out nuclear power production at 
international level, and at assisting those countries wishing to follow that path. However, as nuclear 
power plants would continue to exist for quite some time, it was essential to reduce the risks of that 
technology as far as possible. Austria was therefore actively participating in all efforts to reduce such 
risks and was closely involved in nuclear safety issues within the context of EU enlargement and the 
establishment of common EU safety standards for nuclear installations. It also fully supported the 
AgencyÂs efforts to upgrade and complete its set of safety standards. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 2 

6. The public expected legally binding and enforceable standards. For that reason, Austria attached 
particular importance to nuclear liability and had adopted a strict nuclear liability regime. Current 
international nuclear liability regimes granted many privileges to industry but did not provide 
sufficient guarantees for potential victims of a nuclear accident. The pending amendments to the Paris 
Convention failed to remedy that situation. 
7. Future energy strategies should focus on demand. Austria had concluded energy partnerships 
with several neighbouring countries and, with a view to ensuring fair competition, it advocated the 
elimination of unwarranted advantages, subsidies and assistances to well established energy industries, 
in particular the nuclear industry. 
8. Several countries had ratified or acceded to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management over the preceding year. The first 
review meeting for that Convention was to be held in November 2003 and it was hoped it would yield 
positive results. Austria called upon all States which had not yet done so to sign and ratify the 
Convention, particularly those that operated nuclear power plants or dealt with significant amounts of 
radioactive waste. 
9. The effectiveness and efficiency of the technical cooperation programme continued to increase. 
Austria fully supported the AgencyÂs activities in the field of non-power applications of nuclear 
energy, in particular in the areas of human health, hydrology and the environment. It had once again 
paid its full share of the TCF target in 2003 and would continue to meet its financial obligations. 
10. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China) commended the INPRO project, which should inject new vitality 
into the development and application of nuclear energy in the future, and the AgencyÂs work on 
nuclear technology applications in human health, water resource development, food safety and 
environmental protection, as well as the progress in the development of integrated safeguards. 
11. The year 2004 marked the fiftieth anniversary of nuclear power generation. Over that period, 
nuclear power had come to be acknowledged as a clean, safe and economic form of energy, and had 
played an important role in the energy mix throughout the world. Nuclear power was undergoing 
stable development in China. In the course of a year or more, five new reactor units had been installed, 
doubling the countryÂs installed capacity, and another three would be put into operation over the 
coming two years. Nuclear power would be further developed to meet the power demands of 
economic development up to 2020 and feasibility studies for new nuclear power projects were in 
progress. 
12. China strongly opposed the proliferation of nuclear weapons and consistently supported the 
efforts of the international community to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It had 
taken the lead among the nuclear-weapon States by bringing into force an additional protocol in 
March 2002 and submitting a declaration to the Secretariat, and had clarified some issues on its 
nuclear cooperation with non-nuclear weapon States. He called upon all countries with major nuclear 
activities to sign and ratify an additional protocol. 
13. Terrorism was currently a great threat to peace and development and China supported the 
Agency in its efforts to combat nuclear terrorism, in accordance with the principles and objectives of 
the Statute. It also hoped that the modification of the CPPNM would be completed at an early date. In 
cooperation with the Agency, the Chinese Government had hosted a training course on physical 
protection of nuclear material and facilities in late 2002 and had provided aid in kind for that event 
worth US $100 000. The Chinese Government and the Agency had decided to hold a training course 
on SSACs early in 2004 to help train personnel from countries in the Asia and Pacific region. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 3 

14. The safe operation of nuclear reactors, disposal of nuclear waste and management of radioactive 
sources had always been challenges facing nuclear energy development. His country therefore noted 
with pleasure that the Agency had finished compiling a series of international legal documents on 
nuclear safety, and that the implementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention was progressing systematically with energetic support from Member States. The Agency 
had reinforced its efforts on the safety and security of radiation sources by organizing the International 
Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources and formulating and revising the code of conduct and 
the action plan on that issue. Its work fully demonstrated the high level of importance the Secretariat 
and Member States attached to the matter. 
15. China, like other countries in East Asia faced with the problem of integrating nuclear power 
technology, had accumulated successful experience in incorporating management technology and 
safety supervision mechanisms from other countries. In 2004, a regional seminar on management and 
safety was to be held in China which would be co-sponsored by the Agency and would serve as an 
appropriate forum for Member States to share and exchange such experience. 
16. The Agency still tended to give more attention to safeguards than to technical cooperation. The 
shortage of funds for technical cooperation activities had not been given enough attention during the 
discussions of the AgencyÂs budget for 2004Â2005. Some projects of vital importance to developing 
countries had not been included in the AgencyÂs core programme owing to financial constraints. 
Moreover, some developed countries had obstructed scientific visits and training under technical 
cooperation projects, which had affected their successful implementation. 
17. As the only intergovernmental organization in the nuclear field, the Agency should devote more 
attention to technical cooperation and adopt effective measures to meet the legitimate needs of 
developing Member States for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Equally, Member States should 
support the AgencyÂs promotional activities, ensure sufficient and reliable funding was available and 
facilitate the successful implementation of technical cooperation programmes. 
18. China pursued an independent and peaceful foreign policy and held that disputes within the 
international community should be settled through friendly consultations and negotiations. Following 
the trilateral talks on the Korean nuclear issue in Beijing in April, six-party talks had been held 
successfully in Beijing from 27 to 29 August. At those talks, all parties had expressed their willingness 
to resolve the Korean nuclear issue through peaceful dialogue with a view to maintaining peace and 
stability and creating lasting peace on the Korean peninsula. They had spoken in favour of the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and had recognized the need to consider and resolve the 
security concerns of the DPRK. Moreover, they had agreed to seek a comprehensive and reasonable 
package solution that allowed for phased, simultaneous or parallel implementation, had given 
assurances that they would not take any measures which would escalate the situation during the talks, 
had agreed to continue the dialogue with a view to building confidence, reducing divergences and 
expanding consensus, and had agreed to continue the six-party talks. China, as the host country, had 
been pleased with the progress made and remained convinced that the issue could be properly and 
peacefully resolved as long as all parties involved maintained the political will to do so. It hoped that 
the Agency would continue to play an active role in settling such issues through peaceful negotiations 
based on objectiveness and fairness. 
19. The year 2004 would mark the 20th anniversary of ChinaÂs accession to the Agency. As a 
developing country, China had benefited greatly from the AgencyÂs assistance and had also 
contributed to the AgencyÂs activities. The Chinese Government was committed to maintaining its full 
support for the AgencyÂs work and remained convinced that, with the joint efforts of Member States 
and the Secretariat, and provided it followed the principles and objectives of the Statute and 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 4 

maintained a proper balance between its two main functions, the Agency could look forward to even 
greater achievements. 

20. Mr. Ho-koon PARK (Republic of Korea) commended the SecretariatÂs efforts to prevent 
nuclear terrorism since 11 September 2001 and its significant contribution to the establishment of a 
nuclear security infrastructure for Member States. In April 2003, the Republic of Korea had concluded 
an arrangement for technical cooperation on nuclear security with the Agency with a view to 
consolidating the relevant expertise and experience of both parties in that area. It had also promulgated 
a new domestic law on physical protection of nuclear material and facilities and measures for a 
radiological emergency in May 2003. 
21. The Government of the Republic of Korea had assigned the highest priority to nuclear safety in 
developing its nuclear policy and the Korean nuclear community had adopted a nuclear safety charter 
setting forth eight fundamental principles in September 2001. With regard to the safety and security of 
radiation sources, his country was testing a GPS-linked tracking method for source containers and 
hoped the Agency and other Member States would join it in studying that approach. It also supported 
the AgencyÂs initiative to establish an Asian nuclear safety network and had hosted the second 
consultation meeting for that venture in March 2003 to share its experience of the Korean safety 
networking programme. 
22. Nuclear energy had been a major stimulus to economic growth in his country, which had 
eighteen nuclear power plants in commercial operation providing approximately 40% of the nationÂs 
electricity supply. Six units were Korean standard nuclear power plants with a capacity of 
1000 MW(e). The Republic of Korea had also developed the innovative advanced power reactor with 
a capacity of 1400 MW(e), the first of which scheduled for construction in 2004. It was planned that 
27 nuclear power plants would be on the grid by 2015. His country had also launched a pilot project 
for a 65 MW(t) SMR, the SMART-P (System-integrated Modular Advanced Reactor P), scheduled for 
completion in 2008. Moreover, it was very willing to share its experience in the planning, construction 
and operation of nuclear power plants with all Member States and encouraged them to participate in 
the SMR deployment programme. 
23. The Republic of Korea appreciated the SecretariatÂs initiative in convening an international 
conference on innovative technologies for nuclear fuel cycles and nuclear power in June 2003 which 
had provided a forum for a collaborative approach to the development of future-oriented nuclear 
technologies. It was also a member of INPRO and would be actively participating in the 
implementation of that project, including the conducting of a case study of user requirements and the 
continued assignment of a cost-free expert to the AgencyÂs Department of Nuclear Energy. 
24. Turning to other future energy sources, the hydrogen economy had been discussed at an IEA 
meeting in April 2003, and nuclear energy could play a key role in clean, large-scale hydrogen 
production. The Agency should therefore revisit that issue and consider revitalizing its hydrogen 
energy programme. In June 2003, the Republic of Korea had joined the ITER project as a full partner 
and would be contributing fully to it using its superconducting tokamak advanced research facility. 
25. Radiation technology was being ever more widely used in such areas as water resource 
management, health care, food preservation and environmental protection. In December 2002, his 
country had enacted a law on the promotion of the utilization of radiation and radioisotopes and it 
would be making extensive efforts to increase the share of radiation technology in the nuclear industry 
up to 30% by 2010. To that end, a new advanced radiation technology R&D centre was under 
construction in Jeongeup City which it was hoped would be used as a shared resource for the North-
East Asia region.

26. The Republic of Korea supported the AgencyÂs nuclear knowledge management activities 
pursuant to resolution GC(46)/RES/11 and the idea of an international nuclear university. In 
collaboration with the Agency, it had hosted an inaugural meeting for the Asian network for higher 
education in nuclear technology in June 2003. 
27. The RCA Regional Office had been opened in the Republic of Korea in March 2002 with a 
view to consolidating RCA ownership, and his Government had contributed $500 000 annually for its 
operation. It was expected that a resolution legally establishing that office would be adopted at the 
32nd RCA General Conference to be held during the current week. 
28. His country unswervingly supported the AgencyÂs safeguards system, which was essential to 
international peace and security. The system currently faced unprecedented challenges despite the 
excellent record of compliance by the vast majority of NPT countries. 
29. He noted with concern that the Agency was still unable to provide assurances regarding the nondiversion 
of nuclear material to nuclear weapons in the DPRK, whose nuclear programme posed a 
serious and immediate threat to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. He urged the DPRK to retract its 
announced withdrawal from the NPT and comply with its NPT obligations, to dismantle its nuclear 
weapons programme completely, irreversibly and verifiably, to commit itself to the complete and 
effective implementation of its safeguards agreement, and to cooperate promptly and fully with the 
Agency. The six-party talks held in Beijing in August 2003 had marked a significant step towards a 
peaceful resolution of the DPRK issue. In particular, the six parties had agreed in principle on the 
ultimate goal of establishing a nuclear weapon-free Korean Peninsula through peaceful dialogue. It 
was hoped that there would be a timely resumption of the talks to facilitate meaningful progress. 
30. The BoardÂs resolution of the preceding week on IranÂs nuclear programme demonstrated the 
firm commitment of the international community to resolving swiftly all outstanding safeguards issues 
and maintaining the integrity of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. He expressed the hoped 
that Iran would offer accelerated cooperation and full transparency on all aspects of its nuclear 
programme and comply with the resolution in a constructive manner. 
31. The Republic of Korea supported universal adherence to the additional protocol, which had 
greatly contributed to building confidence within the international community that all States would 
fully comply with their non-proliferation commitments. His Government had recently completed its 
domestic preparations for the implementation of an additional protocol and it was expected that the 
parliamentary ratification process would be concluded by the end of 2003. Moreover, the new 
partnership approach for LWRs between the Agency and the Republic of Korea had already saved 
more than thirty days of inspection time, as described in the Safeguards Implementation Report 
for 2002 (document GOV/2003/35, paragraph 81). 
32. The amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute had been adopted unanimously at the 
43rd regular session of the General Conference in resolution GC(43)/RES/19. The outcome of nearly 
twenty years of discussions at the Agency aimed at adapting the BoardÂs composition to conform to 
present-day realities, it accommodated the principle of greater democratic representation without 
jeopardizing the BoardÂs efficiency. He urged all Member States that had not yet done so to accept the 
amendment as soon as possible and encouraged the Director General to continue to remind Member 
States of the need for the amendment to enter into force. 
33. Fifty years had passed since President Eisenhower had made his historic ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ 
speech. Over that period, nuclear technology had been used to generate the electricity needed to meet 
human needs and, over the coming fifty years, nuclear science and technology would surely bring 
greater prosperity and enhanced quality of life for future generations. 

GC(47)/OR.2

34. Mr. NURKOVIC (Serbia and Montenegro) said that relations between Serbia and Montenegro 
had been regulated by the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro since 4 
February 2003. The aim of establishing new relations had been, inter alia, to achieve equal status of 
the member States, to harmonize regulations and practices with European and international standards, 
and to sign the Stabilization and Association Agreement to be followed by accession to the European 
Union. The Constitutional Charter regulated relations between Serbia and Montenegro in a new way. 
Some matters that had previously been administered by the joint community had been transferred to 
member State level, including nuclear energy. The Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro 
had recognized the need to create two focal points for the establishment of national regulatory bodies 
to deal with all nuclear energy issues. Serbia and Montenegro would establish new communication 
channels, taking into account the standards and principles applied by the Agency for communications 
with its Member States. The Council of Ministers would also coordinate the harmonization of the 
positions and interests of the member States of Serbia and Montenegro. 
35. Serbia and Montenegro fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international 
cooperation in the field of nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. Renewed impetus should be 
given to the management and disposal of spent high-enriched uranium nuclear fuel, and the tripartite 
activities of the United States of America, the Russian Federation and the Agency in that area should 
be resumed since they not only contributed to nuclear and radiation safety but also helped protect 
against nuclear terrorism. His country had a particular interest in those activities, since it had spent 
fuel of that type at the Vinca Institute. In 2002, its unused 80% enriched nuclear fuel had been shipped 
back to the country of origin, the Russian Federation. 
36. His country understood the need to strengthen national radiation protection infrastructures and 
had made additional efforts to adopt safety standards and develop infrastructures that met Agency 
recommendations. Regrettably, it had so far been unable to join regional projects on the establishment 
of a regulatory body, control of radiation exposure in the working environment, during medical 
treatment and in the environment, and emergency response. However, it would be applying for support 
in that area in the 2005Â2006 technical cooperation cycle and hoped that that would not affect its 
applications for assistance in other areas. 
37. Serbia and Montenegro supported strengthened safeguards and was ready to embark on the 
harmonization procedure for the draft agreement on the application of safeguards in connection with 
the NPT and, subsequently, the additional protocol. Its priorities continued to be the removal of the 
spent nuclear fuel from the RA research reactor, the decommissioning of that reactor and the safe 
management of nuclear waste at the Vinca Institute. 
38. His country had paid the envisaged amount into the AgencyÂs Regular Budget for 2003 and 
would also take all necessary measures to meet its future financial commitments in a timely manner. It 
was also willing to pay a voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2004. 
Ms. Hall (Canada) took the chair. 

39. Mr. RAJASA (Indonesia) expressed appreciation for the level of resources the Agency 
committed both directly and indirectly to technical cooperation. To date, 87 CPFs were in place which 
were used as planning tools to design projects in the light of national priorities. To get the maximum 
benefits from the limited resources of the TCF, Indonesia had signed a CPF in November 2000 which 
was currently being updated to meet its changing development plans. He commended the AgencyÂs 
efforts to expand and intensify the application of nuclear science and technology to improve quality of 
life, particularly in developing countries. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes had 
significantly helped his country with the development of human resources and technical capabilities. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 7 

40. Nuclear technology could have a significant impact in such fields as food irradiation, river basin 
management and the use of isotopic techniques to control communicable diseases. Indonesia attached 
high priority to activities in the areas of education and capacity building, and particular emphasis was 
being given to programmes that had a direct impact on improving quality of life and increasing social 
welfare 
41. To disseminate their proven research products, the scientists of the Indonesian National Nuclear 
Energy Agency (BATAN) maintained close contacts with local government, universities, hospitals, 
small and medium-sized enterprises, cooperatives and NGOs. BATAN had recently released three 
new high-yield rice varieties which were resistant to pests and unfavourable climate. Significant 
progress had also been made in the development of nuclear techniques to improve animal reproduction 
and health, and of feed supplementation technology to increase meat and milk production and quality. 
The products in question had been transferred successfully to farmers and small and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
42. For 2003Â2004 the Agency had approved a project on the setting up of a radiotherapy centre on 
Borneo at the Ulin Hospital in South Kalimantan. The South Kalimantan Provincial Government had 
engaged to provide the infrastructure and financial support for operational and maintenance costs, as 
well as the cost of replacing the cobalt-60 source, on a cost-sharing basis. As the project counterpart, 
the Ulin Hospital would contribute by constructing a new laboratory building in the hospital area 
where the radiotherapy equipment would be installed. 
43. IndonesiaÂs national development programme for the medium and long term included nuclear 
power as a potential option in the energy mix. In view of the environmental merits of nuclear power, 
Indonesia would pursue and enhance systematic planning for its introduction, in particular in the fields 
of safety, regulation, final waste disposal, environmental impact analysis, and financing. In 1997, the 
nuclear power plant programme had been close to approval and BATAN had nearly completed the site 
and off-site data acquisition and evaluation. However, the programme had been interrupted by the 
economic crisis, prompting further investigation and data collection to strengthen the planning 
process. That study of different energy sources had been carried out through the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme and the results had been submitted to the President of Indonesia in 
August 2003. His country was also considering the use of nuclear power for seawater desalination. 
With Agency technical assistance, Indonesia and the Republic of Korea had initiated a joint feasibility 
study of a nuclear desalination plant to supply water and electricity for Madura Island. 
44. The development of an effective and efficient regulatory framework and instruments, as well as 
the human resources required and the associated supporting scientific and technical infrastructure, was 
essential to ensure nuclear and radiological safety in the development and utilization of nuclear 
energy, especially in view of the plan to introduce nuclear power in Indonesia in the foreseeable 
future. Furthermore, the increasing terrorist threat to nuclear and radiation facilities, and illicit 
trafficking in and/or illicit use of nuclear material, radiation sources and radioactive waste, called for 
greater attention to nuclear security. In that connection, Indonesia appreciated the assistance and 
cooperation the Agency had given to Member States with the setting up of national regulatory 
frameworks, in particular through model projects RAS/9/026 and RAS/9/027. Those model projects 
had provided significant assistance to the Indonesian Nuclear Energy Control Board. IRRT missions 
had been sent to Indonesia to review the effectiveness and efficiency of the national regulatory 
authority and make appropriate recommendations, in particular with respect to the development of 
emergency response capabilities. In addition, integrated safety evaluation missions and basic 
professional training courses had been conducted to assist the country with its preparations for the 
introduction of nuclear power. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 8 

45. According to the Safeguards Implementation Report for 2002, 145 States had safeguards 
agreements in force, and nuclear material and other items placed under safeguards had remained in 
peaceful uses or were otherwise adequately accounted for. Moreover, approximately 80 additional 
protocols had been approved. 
46. His country was in the process of implementing the framework for integrated safeguards and 
had brought both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol into force. 
Internationally, it also took part in discussions concerning the additional protocol. He believed that 
those measures would strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Additional Protocol. 
47. With regard to verification in the DPRK, at the 36th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting ASEAN 
Foreign Ministers had reaffirmed their conviction that a nuclear-weapon-free Korea and a peaceful 
resolution of the current tensions through dialogue and negotiation would be a valuable contribution to 
peace and stability in East Asia. In that connection, Indonesia strongly supported for the process of 
dialogue and consultation at the six-nation talks held in China, in August 2003. 
48. The universality, consolidation and strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, 
including concrete steps to reduce the number of and dependence on nuclear weapons, were more 
important than ever for the continued sustainability and credibility of the regime. However, 
international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was also important, and one of the 
fundamental pillars of the NPT. Both Article VI of the NPT and the inalienable right of all State 
parties to the unimpeded and non-discriminatory transfer of nuclear technology and material played an 
indispensable role in catering for national development requirements. The CTBT also constituted an 
effective step towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and his country was pursuing its 
efforts to ratify the Treaty as evidence of its commitment to world peace. It also supported the 
establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and called upon all 
parties concerned to take urgent and practical steps to establish such a zone and, pending its 
establishment, to place all their nuclear facilities under Agency comprehensive safeguards without 
delay. 
49. The recent bomb attack at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in August 2003 had demonstrated the 
heinous, ruthless and uncivilized nature of such attacks. The barbaric terrorist attack on the United 
Nations Office in Iraq had cost the lives of many United Nations staff. Indonesia condemned terrorism 
in all its forms and manifestations. However, it was essential to address the root causes of terrorism 
and to reject any attempt to associate terrorism with a religion, race, nationality or ethnic group. 
Terrorism was a serious threat to international peace and security and his country stood ready to 
support measures at global and regional level to combat it. The real danger that terrorist groups might 
resort to the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction was cause for particular concern. 
He expressed appreciation to the Agency for its commitment in the area of nuclear security and its 
efforts to protect Member States and the international community against nuclear terrorism. In 
particular, he commended it for organizing the International Conference on Advances in Destructive 
and Non-Destructive Analysis for Environmental Monitoring and Nuclear Forensics in Karlsruhe, 
Germany, and the International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources in Vienna, and for 
establishing the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security. 
50. Indonesia also shared some of the concerns of coastal states with respect to nuclear transport 
safety and, in particular, the growing danger of accidents caused by natural events, human error, or 
criminal or terrorist acts. Nuclear security should be one of the worldÂs priorities and he called upon 
all parties concerned to do their utmost to support efforts to strengthen international cooperation in 
nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. It was also important that the activities proposed by the 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 9 

Director General in his report on protection against nuclear terrorism (document GOV/2002/10) 
should continue. The Agency should use the Nuclear Security Fund for that purpose. 

51. Mr. ARCHILA SERRANO (Guatemala) said that his country was pursuing integration with 
neighbouring countries under the Plan Puebla PanamÃ¡ which would create enormous opportunities for 
over 65 million people. The electrical power networks of Mexico and Central America would be 
interlinked, joint clean energy projects would be developed and peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
promoted. 
52. The Agency had proved a loyal ally of Guatemala in its development efforts. As a signatory to 
the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Tlatelolco Treaty, the country was 
committed to fostering global peace, security and nuclear disarmament. Radiation safety was a priority 
interest and the national body responsible for regulating ionizing radiation, backed by appropriate 
legislation and the authority to penalize offenders, monitored the safety of radiation sources entering 
or leaving the country, the security of radioactive material and good practice in handling radioactive 
material. 
53. The AgencyÂs model projects in the radiation protection field had strengthened GuatemalaÂs 
regulatory authority through the support they had provided for the legislative framework governing 
radiation protection, ionizing radiation and the transport of radioactive material. The secondary 
standards dosimetry laboratory had been strengthened. It also served as a reference laboratory for the 
Central American region, currently providing calibration services to El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa 
Rica for radiotherapy. Guatemala stood ready to offer such services free of charge to regulatory 
authorities in the subregion. Guatemala had attended the meeting of national counterparts and 
decision-makers on radiation protection model projects and it urged the Agency to extend the project 
for the next five years and to support the initiative of the Forum of Ibero-American Regulators to set 
up an Ibero-American network on nuclear and radiation issues, as well as supporting GuatemalaÂs 
membership of that Forum. His country had undertaken to implement contingency plans for 
radiological emergencies and had established a national radiological emergency response plan. A 
recent audit mission to evaluate the effectiveness of the regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety 
and control of occupational exposure had concluded that the model project had been effective. The 
Agency thus played an ongoing promotional, supervisory and advisory role and Guatemala 
encouraged it to continue conducting such audits. 
54. The new approach adopted in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had enhanced the 
design, monitoring and evaluation of projects in Guatemala. National and regional workshops on 
project development had been held in the country to develop managerial capacity in the region. 
Guatemala had enhanced its institutional capacity and the expertise of its human resources and had 
used nuclear technology to solve problems in the areas of health, agriculture, industry and the 
environment. The Agency had provided technical assistance in the form of medical equipment and 
training for medical physicists, and had helped with the introduction of quality assurance programmes 
in radiotherapy. GuatemalaÂs geothermal fields had been evaluated through the regional project on the 
development of geothermal energy and it hoped to achieve an overall output of 500 MW from its 
known geothermal areas. With help from the United States and Mexico, and the support of the Agency 
and the FAO, the medfly had been successfully eradicated and fellowship holders from all over the 
world had been trained in the SIT. The medium-term technical cooperation programme would focus 
on activities aimed at eliminating poverty and promoting rural development. Finally, at the most recent 
meeting of the ARCAL Technical Coordination Board, his country had been elected Vice-President 
and the next meeting would be held in Guatemala. He commended the AgencyÂs support for ARCAL, 
which had promoted and implemented a large number of nuclear applications projects. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 10 

55. In conclusion, he urged all Member States to continue to pay their assessed contributions and 
announced that Guatemala had undertaken to pay off its arrears to the TCF over a period of ten years. 
56. Mr. AL-ATHEL (Saudi Arabia) said that the results of the AgencyÂs analysis of its policy and 
management over the preceding two years should be taken into account when developing the Medium 
Term Strategy for 2006Â2011. 
57. Although Saudi ArabiaÂs nuclear activities were confined to the educational field and a limited 
number of medical, agricultural and industrial projects, it was eager to maintain its constructive 
programme of technical cooperation with the Agency. 
58. Saudi Arabia had joined the hard-won consensus in the Board of Governors on the package 
proposal on the AgencyÂs draft programme and budget for 2004Â2005. Board members had expressed 
divergent views on the SecretariatÂs justifications for ending the policy of zero real growth, although 
the Director General had insisted on the need for an increase in the Regular Budget to meet the 
demands of the AgencyÂs expanding membership and requests for increased technical cooperation and 
safeguards activities. The consultations had been so protracted that they had prevented the Board from 
taking the customary steps to transmit the draft programme and budget to the General Conference. 
59. There seemed to be a discrepancy between StatesÂ priorities in submitting requests to the 
Agency and the criteria applied by the Agency in drawing up its programme and budget, namely its 
legal obligations under the Statute and pursuant to the decisions of its policy-making organs. The 
Secretariat saw little opportunity for further savings in administrative costs, citing the opinion of the 
Swiss external management consultant Mannet to the effect that any further cost reductions would 
adversely affect the quality of the AgencyÂs programmes and services. However, many Board 
members had taken a different view, continuing to urge the Agency to seek ways of cutting costs while 
maintaining the quality of its performance. According to the Agency, safeguards activities were one of 
the main reasons why an increase in the Regular Budget was necessary in real terms. It had so far 
failed, however, to achieve the anticipated savings from the introduction of integrated safeguards, nor 
had it undertaken the planned redeployment that would have reduced safeguards posts by seven. 
Perhaps the safeguards activities currently under way in a State whose Government was bearing the 
full cost of the AgencyÂs verification and inspection activities could be used as a precedent for the 
future in order to reduce the financial burden on the Agency. 
60. The use of part of the requested increase in the Regular Budget for 2004Â2005 for the funding 
of statutory Â principally verification Â activities that had formerly been financed from 
extrabudgetary resources in order to eliminate uncertainty with respect to their implementation, and 
the planned reduction in extrabudgetary funds from 8.6% to 2.5%, had prompted developing countries 
to question the importance attached by the Agency to efforts to develop more stable arrangements for 
financing technical cooperation. The decline in the resources available for implementing technical 
assistance programmes adversely affected the AgencyÂs cooperation with Member States that required 
its assistance with the implementation of nuclear applications to promote their sustainable 
development. 
61. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Agency would be able to wrap up the items on the 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East and IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities and threat, which 
had been on the ConferenceÂs agenda Â to no avail Â for a number of years, and that the outcome 
would be the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East through the adoption of an 
equitable approach to the States concerned. 
Mr. Takasu (Japan) resumed the chair. 


GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 11 

62. Mr. YERMILOV (Ukraine) said that, for his own country and many others which used nuclear 
power to produce energy, some of the main priorities were improvement of the safety and reliability of 
nuclear reactors and management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. The Ukrainian Government had 
introduced a programme to upgrade its 13 operating nuclear power plant units and improve their 
safety. It was also concerned over their physical security and was participating actively in the work on 
the amendment of the CPPNM. Ukraine also supported the efforts of the Agency and its Member 
States to prevent nuclear terrorism. 
63. Dealing with the consequences of the accident at Unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant 
was still an important issue for his country. A number of unique and large-scale projects were under 
way at the site, involving organizations, scientists and engineers from many countries. A new 
containment structure for the destroyed Unit 4 was being designed and infrastructure created for 
decommissioning the plant. Particular attention was being paid to nuclear and radiation safety 
standards in that work. Ukraine had fulfilled all its obligations in respect of the shutdown of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant. He expressed the hope that the signatories to the Memorandum of 
Understanding signed in Ottawa in 1995 would fulfil their obligations equally conscientiously. The 
Agency was making an important contribution to resolving the problems of making the Chernobyl 
Shelter ecologically safe and minimizing the nuclear and radiation risks from the destroyed unit. An 
Agency technical cooperation project was currently working on approaches for evaluating the fuelcontaining 
masses and radioactive waste in the Shelter. 
64. Another key element of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities was its work to improve 
the operational safety of nuclear power plants. Ukraine would be commissioning two new units at the 
Rovno and Khmelnitsky nuclear plants over the coming few years and it was working to raise safety 
standards at its nuclear power plants, including the new units, to the level expected by the international 
community. It stood ready to cooperate with the Agency and other countries on that issue. 
65. Ukraine was also interested in industrial, agricultural and medical applications of nuclear 
technology, but its chief priorities in its technical cooperation with the Agency were improving the 
safety of its nuclear power plants, ageing management and extension of plant operating life. All those 
aspects were covered in its CPF. Ukraine also met its financial obligations to the Agency in full and on 
time. 
66. The results of INPRO were important to many countries including his own, which was 
developing an energy strategy in which nuclear power played a large part. Over the coming 30 years, 
electricity generated by nuclear power plants would play a key role in meeting the energy needs of the 
country. 
67. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the efficiency of the safeguards system 
in the face of the new challenges that had arisen in recent years. Safeguards agreements and additional 
protocols were undoubtedly a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. As a State which 
had voluntarily renounced the worldÂs third largest nuclear arsenal and had adopted non-nuclearweapon 
status, Ukraine appealed to all Agency Member States, and especially the DPRK itself, to do 
their utmost to preserve that countryÂs non nuclear-weapon status and re-establish its full cooperation 
with the Agency. Ukraine was currently preparing to ratify the additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement which it had signed in August 2000. 
68. His country was a party to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and those issues were of great interest to it owing to 
its significant reliance on nuclear power, and the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. He called on all 
States which had not already done so to accede to the Joint Convention and expressed the hope that 
those issues would be adequately reflected in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. He 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 12 

thanked the Secretariat for its work in preparing the first Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the 
Joint Convention to be held in November 2003, which should allow the situation in each country to be 
assessed, priorities to be determined and appropriate recommendations elaborated. 

69. The International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna in 
March 2003, had strengthened GovernmentsÂ understanding of the tasks to be faced in that area and 
their readiness to work together to fulfil them. His Government supported an enhanced role for the 
Agency in the Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Ukraine was 
participating in the approval of the draft Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and felt sure that the changes which it had suggested would help strengthen the safety and 
security regime for such sources. He expressed the hope that the General Conference would endorse 
the Code of Conduct and that the Agency would continue to promote its application. Although it was 
not legally binding, Ukraine intended to abide by its provisions and he called upon other Member 
States to do likewise. 
70. In February 2003, his Government had submitted its instrument of ratification for the 
amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute to the depositary. Increasing the number of members 
of the Board of Governors would undoubtedly make its decisions more effective. 
71. Finally, during the coming year the parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety would be 
preparing for the third review meeting under the Convention which should provide an opportunity to 
demonstrate what progress the Contracting Parties had made in improving the nuclear and radiation 
safety of their nuclear power plants. 
72. Mr. AMHA (Ethiopia) said that more than 85% of EthiopiaÂs population depended on the 
agricultural sector for their livelihood and increasing agricultural production was therefore the main 
priority of his GovernmentÂs economic policies. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation with Ethiopia 
had focused on two major projects: one on use of the SIT for tsetse eradication, and one on exploration 
of groundwater and geothermal resources . Some 150 000 to 200 000 km2 of land in the south, west 
and north-west of the country were infested with tsetse flies, placing 10Â14 million head of cattle and 
an equivalent number of small ruminants at serious risk of trypanosomosis. The tsetse eradication 
project had been initiated some five years previously and its achievements so far included manpower 
development and baseline data collection and analysis. Its activities focused mainly on the 
establishment of tsetse fly mass rearing and sterilization centres and on pest suppression and 
surveillance. Those tasks required substantial resources and there was an imperative need to search for 
additional sources of support. The efforts being made by the Agency were greatly appreciated, and he 
also expressed gratitude to the United States Government for its support. Ethiopia had played a leading 
part in the establishment of PATTEC, and the recent meeting of Heads of State and Government of the 
African Union held in Maputo had confirmed the commitment of African countries to dealing with the 
problem. He called on the Agency to consolidate and strengthen its efforts in that area. 
73. Agency support in the area of isotope hydrology had helped generate the information needed to 
understand the movement, recharge and origin of groundwater, lake level rise problems and 
geothermal resources. The Government of Ethiopia was launching a groundwater resources 
assessment programme aimed at mapping the hydrogeology of the country using a phased approach 
over a period of 10Â12 years. There was a clear need for proper management of water resources in 
order to ensure sustainable water supplies and food self-sufficiency and Ethiopia was seeking strong 
support from the Agency and the international community. 
74. As early as 1993, Ethiopia had established a national radiation protection authority. For the last 
five years it had been actively cooperating with the Agency in the framework of the regional model 
projects for the development and strengthening of radiation protection infrastructure in Africa. Efforts 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 13 

to build a sustainable national infrastructure compatible with the socio-economic conditions of the 
country, and to establish sound protection standards and a deep-rooted safety culture in all areas where 
ionizing radiation sources were used, would continue. Ethiopia looked forward to continued technical 
cooperation with the Agency in that area. His country had also actively participated in the revision of 
the Code Of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, had successfully hosted a 
number of AFRA events through the year, and would continue to foster regional cooperation. 

75. In conclusion, the Agency had been a reliable development partner for his country over a 
number of years and he thanked the Director General for the assistance it provided. Ethiopia was 
committed to making a positive contribution towards the achievement of the AgencyÂs major 
objectives. 
76. Ms. SHABANGU (South Africa) said that the peaceful application of nuclear technology 
formed an integral part of the NPT. South Africa had continued its efforts to promote international 
cooperation in the field of peaceful nuclear activities and had encouraged the exchange of scientific 
information, particularly in Africa. It welcomed the united manner in which the Board of Governors 
had acted to encourage the Government of Iran to further its cooperation with the Agency on the 
implementation of safeguards and to clarify outstanding issues so that the Agency could fulfil its 
mandate. In that context, it was essential to remember the cardinal importance of maintaining and 
enhancing the integrity of the NPT and the Agency. 
77. South Africa valued the AgencyÂs work in the area of technical cooperation and had, for its part, 
continued to make available technical experts for missions to States in the region dealing with such 
issues as conditioning and safe storage of spent radiation sources, sharing of experience and provision 
of advice on increasing the financial independence and sustainability of national nuclear institutions, 
and the use of tracer techniques in agriculture and industry. It had also continued to support 
programmes aimed at promoting applications of nuclear technology in African countries. Its 
contributions in kind over the preceding year in that regard had amounted to more than $180 500. She 
expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation project on the use of isotope techniques 
to assess nutrition intervention programmes related to HIV/AIDS in Africa, which addressed problems 
of immense importance for the region. Continued support was needed for the application of nuclear 
techniques in nutrition studies. Her country also supported the efforts to enhance regional resource 
centres, which would give impetus to TCDC. A project aimed at emerging cattle farmers had been set 
up in South Africa, with the assistance of AFRA, under which the Agency would be supplying ten 
African States with radioisotope-labelled progesterone produced in South Africa to assist farmers with 
the early diagnosis of infertility as part of a regional project to improve the performance of dairy 
cattle. 
78. South Africa had continued to seek innovative solutions to the problem of radioactive waste 
management and valued the support the Agency had given to the project aimed at the development and 
demonstration of technology to evaluate boreholes as a disposal option for disused sealed radiation 
sources, which she hoped would help developing countries to prevent accidents involving such 
sources. 
79. South Africa appreciated the AgencyÂs initiatives relating to the preservation and strengthening 
of nuclear knowledge. As a follow-up to the Agency meeting on that subject in June 2002, it had 
established a mechanism whereby funding for nuclear training could be generated, inter alia, from 
international countertrade agreements. A training agreement relating to various disciplines within the 
nuclear sector had been entered into with a French company and 10 staff members from nuclear 
organizations within South Africa had already completed courses in France.

80. She commended the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the representation of women among its staff. 
South Africa supported initiatives such as Women in Nuclear, and the Charter of Women in Nuclear 
South Africa had recently been adopted. Her country looked forward to working together with Women 
in Nuclear Global and the Agency to achieve greater participation of women in that field. 
81. South Africa had signed an additional protocol prior to the preceding session of the General 
Conference and had submitted an expanded declaration within the required time period. It appreciated 
the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts to organize training in the area of nuclear security. Following a request 
from South Africa, a workshop had been held on the design basis threat, which had led to the 
strengthening of security measures in the country. In addition, some South Africans were undergoing 
training in physical protection in the United States under the auspices of the Agency. Effective 
systems for nuclear material accountancy and control were essential to maintain the security of nuclear 
material and combat illicit trafficking. The AgencyÂs efforts to achieve increased cooperation with 
State and regional systems of accounting and control were welcome. South Africa would be holding the 
AgencyÂs SSAC course for the African region in October. 
82. The studies carried out under the INPRO initiative should be expanded. South Africa had 
completed preparations for joining INPRO and would be making a formal proposal to the Agency in that 
connection before the end of the year. Her country had actively continued its work on the development of 
the pebble bed modular reactor project as part of the international drive to establish novel concepts for 
nuclear power generation in the 21st century. An environmental impact assessment of the reactor had 
been approved in June and the National Nuclear Regulator was currently reviewing its safety. A 
comprehensive and systematic approach for the licensing process was being followed, which also 
provided for public involvement. 
83. South Africa continued to support and participate actively in the AgencyÂs safety standards 
programme and it welcomed the initiative to broaden representation on Agency safety standards 
committees. Her Government had recently made public its radioactive waste policy and strategy, which 
was based on the AgencyÂs fundamental safety principles, thereby paving the way for South Africa to 
become party to the Joint Convention. It had published five regulations in the area of nuclear safety, 
including a new set of safety standards. South Africa had also adopted the AgencyÂs transport safety 
standards as basic requirements for the safe transport of radioactive material and was pleased to note that 
the Agency had approved the research project proposal by South Africa on risk assessment of bulk 
transport of zircon sands. The Agency should consider developing a programme to address exposure from 
naturally occurring radioactive materials. South Africa was well advanced in assessing radiation hazards 
in various industries dealing with naturally occurring radioactive materials and reports from the working 
groups established to address those issues would be made available to the AgencyÂs technical working 
groups. 
84. Her country supported the trend towards the establishment of international nuclear regulatory 
authority cooperative groups; it belonged to the network of regulators of countries with small nuclear 
programmes and would be participating in that bodyÂs next meeting in September 2003. 
85. In conclusion, she expressed appreciation for the support the Agency had given to the first all-
African congress of the International Radiation Protection Association held in South Africa in May 2003. 
The congress had helped promote a better understanding of problems associated with radiation protection 
in Africa, creative indigenous solutions to those problems had been discussed and a practical programme 
elaborated to help Africa enhance its role in the field of radiation protection. 
86. Mr. TAHA NASAR (Sudan) commended the Agency on its promotion of peaceful applications 
of nuclear energy and expressed strong support for its efforts to eliminate the hazards of non-peaceful 
use by encouraging compliance with relevant international treaties. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 15 

87. Sudan was deeply committed to the goal of making the Middle East region a nuclear-weaponfree 
zone under a comprehensive treaty binding on all parties concerned. IsraelÂs nuclear capability 
continued to be a major concern for all States in the region, since Israel was the only entity in the 
Middle East that possessed nuclear weapons. It was high time for the international community to put 
pressure on Israel to sign and ratify relevant Agency agreements, thus ceasing to apply double 
standards and reducing tension in the Middle East in pursuit of a just solution to the Palestinian 
problem. 
88. Sudan would shortly be signing an additional protocol. In line with its aspiration to make Africa 
a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, it had hosted the first conference of African national 
authorities on enforcement of the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention in August 2003. 
Twenty-nine African States had sent representatives, and representatives from Romania, France, the 
United States of America and the International Committee of the Red Cross had participated as 
observers. Sudan was willing to host more regional conferences on non-proliferation. 
89. He expressed the hope that dialogue would continue between the Agency and Iran with a view 
to reaching a solution to the current problem that satisfied all parties concerned, so that Iran could 
benefit from Agency assistance in the peaceful uses of atomic energy and the international community 
could rest assured that Iran was complying with its obligations. 
90. Both the United Nations weapons inspectors and the coalition forces had failed to discover the 
alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and peace could only be restored if the occupying forces 
withdrew and the United Nations was mandated to play a fundamental role in the country until such 
time as Iraq recovered its sovereignty. As the AgencyÂs mandate in Iraq remained unchanged, the 
Director General should pursue his efforts to enable the AgencyÂs inspectors to complete their mission 
and submit a final report. 
91. Malaria was the foremost killer disease in Africa in general and in Sudan in particular. The 
Agency had provided valuable technical assistance to his country with the eradication of malariatransmitting 
mosquitoes using the SIT. Sudan looked forward to broader donor participation to ensure 
the success of projects in the areas of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. 
92. The technical cooperation programme was also making a welcome contribution to enhancing 
food security. As the tsetse fly was one of the major impediments to development in Africa, the 
AgencyÂs efforts to eradicate it using the SIT were greatly appreciated. Sudan was particularly grateful 
for the AgencyÂs sponsorship of the bilateral agreement between Sudan and Ethiopia on control of the 
tsetse fly. It hoped that the AgencyÂs technical support in that regard would be expanded to include 
southern Sudan in its entirety, and that the Agency would continue to assist Sudan with the 
management of scarce freshwater resources for consumption and agriculture. 
93. He called for support for the efforts aimed at enhancing and developing cooperation among 
States party to conventions on nuclear and radiation safety, and at harmonizing regulations and 
legislation governing cooperation in the radiation protection field and in capacity-building to 
implement such regulations, with a view to developing a model project. The progress achieved by the 
Agency and Member States in science and technology projects under the AFRA agreement was 
commendable and he urged all parties concerned to support projects aimed at tackling major regional 
problems. With technical support provided through AFRA, Sudan had been able to devise a spent 
source treatment and management programme ensuring the collection and secure storage of such 
sources or their disposal. 
94. With a view to addressing the issue of scarcity and migration of trained manpower, Sudan was 
in the process of establishing a high-level research institute focusing, inter alia, on nuclear techniques. 
It hoped to benefit from the AgencyÂs programmes in that connection. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 16 

95. In conclusion, he announced that Sudan intended to settle its arrears in contributions to the 
Agency. 
96. Mr. ABDENUR (Brazil) said that, as a founding Member State of the Agency, Brazil had 
always devoted its best efforts to supporting the Agency in its statutory mission of accelerating and 
enlarging the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. 
Consistent with its commitment to the use of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes Â a 
fundamental principle of its foreign policy which was enshrined in its Constitution, Brazil remained 
convinced of the potential benefits to be derived from the responsible use of nuclear technologies in 
implementing the national development policies of the developing countries. In that context, 
international cooperation was of great importance and the Agency had a unique role to play. He 
reaffirmed his countryÂs support for the AgencyÂs activities and acknowledged its outstanding 
contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and to the use of energy in the context of 
sustainable development. 
97. The Agency had a special mission, namely to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy while 
at the same time preventing its diversion for the production of nuclear weapons. As discussions on 
non-proliferation efforts had assumed a central position on the international agenda, it was important 
not to lose sight of the equally pressing need for effective action to achieve full implementation of the 
nuclear disarmament commitments enshrined in Article VI of the NPT. The main objective of the NPT 
was to avoid the spread of nuclear weapons and to eliminate them, not to restrict their possession to 
the few countries that had already acquired them when the Treaty was signed. Thus, forceful appeals 
should be made for clear disarmament measures at the next meeting of the Preparatory Committee for 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference. Although the nuclear-weapon States had committed themselves 
unequivocally to the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, 
they had yet to show real readiness to achieve that goal. Some even seemed to be considering 
developing new nuclear weapon systems and revising nuclear doctrines, which his country could only 
view with concern. 
98. Over the preceding year, no progress had been made in other fundamental areas of the 
multilateral nuclear disarmament scenario: the deliberations of the Conference on Disarmament had 
stagnated, and there had been no significant progress with the ratification of the CTBT by Annex II 
countries. He therefore appealed to all nations to step up their efforts and reverse the current negative 
trends with respect to the upholding of disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, commitments 
entered into by consensus at international level and other important initiatives in the disarmament 
field. On the positive side, he welcomed CubaÂs decision to accede to the NPT, sign a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency and ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty; those decisions contributed to 
the universality of the NPT and had the important effect of bringing all Latin American and Caribbean 
countries under the umbrella of the Tlatelolco Treaty, which had established the worldÂs first nuclearweapon-
free zone. He also noted with satisfaction that Cuba had decided to sign an additional 
protocol. 
99. Brazil remained committed to international efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, including 
possible malicious acts involving nuclear material. It also fully shared the concerns regarding the risk 
of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, which reinforced the need to work towards 
nuclear disarmament. However, the discussion of measures to combat such eventualities should not be 
allowed to provide even implicit justification for StatesÂ indefinite retention of nuclear weapons. 
100. The negotiations on the programme and budget of the Agency for 2004Â2005 had resulted in the 
approval by the Board of a package which included agreement on a revised level of the Regular 
Budget and other measures of fundamental importance for the future of the Agency. The overall 
increase in the level of the Regular Budget that had been approved represented a drastic departure 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 17 

from the policy of zero real growth and was heavily biased towards Major Programme 4. Throughout 
the negotiating process, Brazil, as the Chair of the Group of 77 and China, had made it clear that it was 
imperative to preserve a balance between the AgencyÂs various statutory activities. Nevertheless, the 
package was a successful achievement, providing a sounder basis for enhancing the AgencyÂs role as a 
major organization in the United Nations system. Brazil looked forward to further interaction with the 
Secretariat on the implementation of the package and would seek to ensure that the spirit in which the 
package had been negotiated and approved was honoured. 

101. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was a major element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, 
whose universality his country strongly supported. Brazil welcomed the substantial progress achieved 
in the development of integrated safeguards, as well as the increased cooperation between the Agency 
and the ABACC. It attached high importance to such cooperation and hoped that it would continue in 
order to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort and achieve cost-effectiveness in safeguards 
activities. 
102. While his country was pleased that the Board had approved a resolution regarding IranÂs nuclear 
activities without a vote, it was disappointed that it had not proved possible to achieve the highest 
possible level of agreement. He urged Iran to ensure that the required cooperation was provided and 
full transparency achieved by providing all the information deemed necessary and granting 
unrestricted access to any location and installation the Agency might wish to inspect. The progress 
towards a satisfactory conclusion of the issue should not be disturbed by a lack of transparency on the 
part of the Iran, nor by premature conclusions which were not based on a clear and definitive 
assessment by the Agency of IranÂs fulfilment of its obligations. 
103. In the technical cooperation area, the Agency should concentrate its efforts on projects where 
nuclear and ionizing radiation applications played a vital role, thereby sharpening the focus of the 
programme and improving its overall quality. Brazil supported regional cooperative approaches such 
as ARCAL. 
104. The safe operation of nuclear facilities was of key importance to public acceptance of nuclear 
energy, and Brazil appreciated the quantity and quality of the safety standards and guides issued by the 
Secretariat in 2002. The second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, in which his country had actively participated, had shown that the Convention was 
meeting its objective. Brazil also appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to foster the safety culture concept 
and drew attention to the success of the International Conference on Safety Culture in Nuclear 
Installations held in Brazil in December 2002. 
105. His country supported the AgencyÂs work aimed at developing national capacity to respond to 
radiological emergencies arising from accidents and deliberate acts. The AgencyÂs emergency 
response system should be strengthened. 
106. In view of the potential risk to coastal populations and the marine environment in the event of 
an accident during maritime transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste, Brazil had supported 
initiatives aimed at strengthening the relevant international norms. The findings of the TranSAS 
mission carried out the preceding year in Brazil had acknowledged that Brazil already had a sound 
transport regulatory system in place. Recommendations had been made to streamline and improve 
regulatory practices, and good practices had been identified to serve as a model for other competent 
authorities in the radioactive material transport sector. He welcomed the results of the International 
Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material held in Vienna in July 2003. The 
General Conference should continue to promote dialogue and build upon agreed concepts and 
guidelines in order to address the legitimate concerns of coastal and transporting countries. 

GC(47)/OR.2 
15 September 2003, Page 18 

107. The scope of the AgencyÂs activities in the area of preservation of nuclear knowledge should be 
broadened to address other issues such as nuclear science and its applications and nuclear safety. 
Nuclear technology could only develop in a positive manner if the vast existing repository of 
knowledge was kept active through constant use and continuous evolution. Brazil welcomed the 
creation of the World Nuclear University in that regard. 
108. Referring to the Director GeneralÂs remarks concerning possible critical choices to be faced in 
the future in the area of fuel cycle design and operation in order to address proliferation concerns and 
waste management, he said that some of the ideas he had put forward would have far-reaching 
implications for national programmes for the peaceful use of atomic energy. The international 
communityÂs concerns with respect to non-proliferation, safety, security and the technical challenges 
facing nuclear power should always be addressed in such a way so as to take full account of the 
principles of universality, transparency and the inalienable right of all peoples to derive benefit from 
the peaceful application of nuclear energy. 
The meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.

6. The General CommitteeÂs decision was accepted. 
7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (resumed) 
(GC(47)/2) 
7. Mr. SHKOLNIK (Kazakhstan) said that in his country work on the regulation of nuclear activities 
focused on the control of radioactive materials, including control of the use and movement of ionizing 
radiation sources. With the support of the Agency, those controls were being strengthened, and 
measures were being taken to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive materials. The 
International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources held in Vienna in March 2003 had been 
an important event in that regard. 
8. Kazakhstan welcomed the IAEA programme to strengthen the control of radioactive sources and 
would suggest that a system for the control of inter-State transfers of such sources be set up, along the 
lines of the system of control for transfers of nuclear materials. His country welcomed the approval by 
the Board of Governors of the new edition of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources and planned to incorporate its provisions into national regulatory norms in the 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 2 

near future. It also welcomed the initiative taken by the Agency, the Russian Federation and the 
United States of America to implement a programme designed to re-establish control of sources within 
the territory of the former USSR. 

9. After gaining its independence, Kazakhstan had abandoned the military use of atomic energy, and 
now banned the production of nuclear explosive devices. With the support of donor countries, work 
was in progress to liquidate the infrastructure of weapons of mass destruction, and controls over all 
nuclear activities were being strengthened. In November 2003 his Government would be signing the 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
10. The NPT regime, one of the key elements of international peace and stability, had been severely 
tested in 2003. He was sure that the active approach taken by the Director General with the support of 
Member States would succeed in strengthening the non-proliferation regime, and he looked forward to 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference as an important step in that direction. 
11. Research into nuclear and radiation safety was continuing in Kazakhstan as a basis for developing 
the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In particular, studies were being conducted on the optimization of 
the nuclear fuel cycle, and it was planned to participate in work on innovative reactor technologies. 
Kazakhstan was also taking part in controlled fusion research under the ITER programme. Work had 
begun on the construction of a new accelerator to be used for nuclear applications as well as for 
educational purposes, and plans were being made to develop nuclear medicine. 
12. In conclusion, he confirmed KazakhstanÂs support for all Agency activities aimed at developing 
the peaceful uses of atomic energy, strengthening the non-proliferation regime and improving safety. 
13. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) emphasized the potential benefits for developing countries of 
participation in the General Conference, especially in terms of scientific and technological advances 
and peaceful uses of atomic energy for the pursuit of comprehensive development. 
14. His country supported in particular the AgencyÂs activities in the areas of: strengthening 
international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy; nuclear and radiation safety and 
security; waste safety; transport safety of radioactive materials; strengthening and improving the 
efficiency of the safeguards system; and measures against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and 
radioactive sources as well as measures promoting the safety of such sources. 
15. He appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the developmental activities of Member States, especially 
in the areas of public health, water, agriculture, industry and protection of human beings and the 
environment from radiation and other hazards. 
16. Yemen supported strong action to eliminate the causes of political tension and wars and to 
promote understanding and cooperation among nations. It therefore supported nuclear disarmament 
within the framework of the NPT, elimination of the damaging effects of nuclear weapons on people 
and the environment and the equitable subjection of the nuclear installations of all States Â without 
exception Â to international supervision and the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Accordingly, he urged 
the international community to ensure that IsraelÂs nuclear installations were made subject to 
international law by requiring it to adhere to the NPT and to sign a safeguards agreement and an 
additional protocol. 
17. YemenÂs initiatives on radiation safety and safety of radioactive sources at the national, regional 
and international levels had culminated at the current Conference in its sponsorship of draft resolutions 
together with Australia, the European Union and the United States, in particular the draft resolution 
under the agenda item on measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation and 
transport safety and waste management, the draft resolution under the agenda item on nuclear security 
and the draft resolution on the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 3 

His country had also submitted a proposal which had been adopted at the fifteenth regular session of 
the Arab Atomic Energy AgencyÂs General Conference, held recently in Tunis, calling for joint Arab 
action in the area of radiation safety and security of radioactive sources. 

18. The reports of the AgencyÂs peer review mission to Yemen in July 2003, organized at his 
countryÂs request, indicated that Yemen had established its National Atomic Energy Commission 
in 1999 as an independent national regulatory body entrusted with specific responsibilities and 
functions in conformity with international standards and that the Commission had been able, in a short 
period of time, to develop an effective and successful inspection, registration and authorization regime 
incorporating appropriate safety requirements. 
19. The Model Project on upgrading the radiation protection infrastructure had proved extremely 
successful in Yemen and in many other Member States. His country shared with other countries 
participating in ARASIA the view that the Model Project should not only be continued but 
strengthened and expanded. He noted in that connection that ARASIA had been playing a major role 
in solving the common problems of its participating States. 
20. Mr. BUGAT (France) paid tribute to Mr. SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello and the other United Nations 
staff who had died in the service of the international community as a result of the recent terrorist attack 
in Baghdad. 
21. Non-proliferation issues and commitments were now, more than ever, one of the major challenges 
facing the international community. While France recognized the inalienable right of States to benefit 
from nuclear energy development for peaceful purposes and from international cooperation in that 
area, as laid down in Article IV of the NPT, that right could only be exercised provided the safeguards 
measures foreseen by Article III of the Treaty were strictly observed so as to establish a climate of 
trust between all parties. 
22. In the particular case of Iran, it was now up to that country to restore a climate of trust, openness, 
cooperation and total transparency. While the Iranian authorities had already taken some steps in that 
direction, they had still not provided satisfactory answers to questions raised by the Agency. They 
should therefore comply with the resolution1 adopted by the Board of Governors the previous week 
and cooperate unreservedly with the Agency. In particular, Iran should unconditionally sign, ratify and 
implement an additional protocol based on the model adopted by the Board. 
23. The situation in the DPRK was also a source of grave concern. The DPRKÂs refusal to meet the 
commitments it had accepted for the application of safeguards and its announced withdrawal from the 
NPT constituted a serious challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation system. A peaceful solution 
needed to be based on multilateral dialogue, such as within the framework of the current six-party 
talks. 
24. The NPT was and should remain the cornerstone of the international nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. In that respect, the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference had demonstrated the strength and value of the Treaty as well as the efficiency of 
enhanced reviews and preparatory committees. France hoped that the preparation for the 2005 Review 
Conference would continue in a balanced and progressive way leading to full implementation of all 
the TreatyÂs objectives. 
25. France also looked forward to the convening of a diplomatic conference to ratify the amendment 
to the CPPNM which was currently being drafted. 
GOV/2003/69. 


GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 4 

26. The AgencyÂs activities made an important contribution to the maintenance of international peace 
and security and, moreover, greatly facilitated the dissemination of nuclear technologies to those 
countries that had a legitimate need to use and develop them for peaceful purposes. 
27. France had always vigorously supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes and, 
having paid its share of the TCF target in full, invited all Member States to do the same. France had 
also financed several footnote-a/ projects and continued to support the activities being carried out 
under the AFRA and ARCAL regional agreements. French specialists had contributed to expert 
missions in several countries, and France itself continued to welcome fellows. It also remained firmly 
committed to training, particularly in the area of radiation protection. 
28. Nuclear technologies could make a major contribution to development in the areas of health, food 
and agriculture, access to water and energy, and environmental protection. France supported the 
international provision of Agency expertise in the area of sustainable development and wished to see 
further expansion of such activities. 
29. The Nuclear Safety Convention had led to progress in a number of areas and those States that had 
nuclear installations but were not yet parties to the Convention should ratify it as soon as possible. 
With regard to the Joint Convention, France welcomed the success of the organizational meeting held 
in April 2003 and was actively preparing to participate in the first review meeting to be held in 
November 2003. 
30. The International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material recently held in 
Vienna had highlighted the high level of safety and sophistication of transport-related activities. It had 
also confirmed the justification for international action and the need for continued cooperation and 
dialogue on ensuring that the highest possible level of safety was achieved, that the parties worked 
together effectively to improve safety still further, and that strengthened assurances of transport 
quality and safety were provided. 
31. In the case of international transports, France strictly applied international regulations, and it had 
asked the Agency to carry out a TranSAS mission in 2004. Together with its partners, France had 
engaged in a dialogue over several years to ensure the greatest level of transparency possible and to 
provide concerned countries with the assurances they were seeking as well as other useful information. 
Such transport activities should of course always comply with basic security requirements and should 
not call into question the provisions of the Law of the Sea. 
32. The AgencyÂs system of strengthened and integrated safeguards provided essential instruments for 
more credible verification of the NPT and increased confidence within the international community. 
They should be implemented as widely and swiftly as possible in order that all States might reap the 
benefits. In that spirit, France had carried out a regional project involving 30 African countries the 
previous year, and it very much welcomed the recent signature of those instruments by several of 
them. 
33. However, despite such progress, only 74 additional protocols had been concluded to date, of 
which 35 were currently in force. France therefore called on all States to fulfil their commitments to 
sign and implement an additional protocol as soon as possible, and pledged to continue its own 
diplomatic efforts aimed at universal implementation of that instrument. 
34. In that context he noted that the law authorizing the ratification of FranceÂs additional protocol had 
been finally adopted on 10 April 2003 and that the internal procedures for its implementation were 
now being determined. 
35. The events of 11 September 2001 had heightened awareness that nuclear or radioactive material 
could be used for criminal or terrorist purposes. The international community had taken action to 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 5 

protect itself against that threat and, while relying on the existing high level of protection for nuclear 
activities, would further improve the situation where necessary. 

36. Although responsibility for nuclear security rested primarily with States, the exercise of national 
responsibilities should receive effective support from international cooperation and information 
exchange. In conformity with its Statute, the Agency obviously had an important role to play in 
ensuring the security of nuclear material and installations. France had already provided financial and 
technical support for the anti-terrorism measures adopted by the Board of Governors in 2002. 
37. With regard to the security of radioactive sources, the conference held in Vienna in March 2003 
had laid the foundations for the Agency to widen its activities in that area. During the G-8 summit held 
in Evian in June, France had expressed its commitment to improve the security of radioactive sources 
and had launched an action plan aimed at supporting Agency activities and promoting the recently 
adopted Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. France would continue 
to make an active contribution to that initiative, particularly as it was due to host the fourth 
international conference on the safety and security of radioactive sources in 2005. 
38. Turning to the prospects for nuclear power, he said that concerns over security of energy supply 
and greenhouse gas emissions had made it an increasingly attractive option. It had also been 
recognized as a competitive source of energy, for example, in Finland. In order to ensure a high level 
of energy independence, France had for over 25 years based its energy strategy broadly on nuclear 
power. In 2002, its 58 operating reactors had accounted for 78% of its electricity production. The 
French authorities had organized a public debate on energy between March and May 2003 with a view 
to determining FranceÂs general energy policy over the next 30 years. The debate, which had 
confirmed the need for a diversified energy supply in which nuclear power retained a recognized 
place, was to be followed at the end of 2003 by the submission to parliament of a guideline law to 
define national policy and priorities. 
39. With the current global context favourable to nuclear power, international cooperation involving 
the Agency was essential. Innovative designs for a new generation of safer, more competitive systems 
would be called for which would be capable of generating less long-lived radioactive waste while also 
meeting global energy needs and helping to ensure sustainable economic and social development. 
They should also make it possible to combine electricity generation with other applications, such as 
seawater desalination or hydrogen production. France had participated actively in the Generation IV 
initiative and was closely following the work under INPRO, and it welcomed the efforts that had been 
made to achieve complementarity and synergies between those two projects. 
40. The development and transfer of nuclear techniques must be accompanied by a long-term strategy 
for knowledge and competence management aimed at preserving expertise and training the experts 
who would be needed in research and industry. France would provide active, substantial and specific 
support to the AgencyÂs activities in that area given their vital importance for the future of the nuclear 
industry. 
41. For the longer term, France attached particular importance to implementation of the ITER project 
as a vital step towards controlled nuclear fusion. That ambitious global project, involving close 
international cooperation, had already received EuropeÂs support, and indeed France had proposed 
Cadarache as a possible site in view of its excellent scientific and technical environment. 
42. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his Government had called for a serious initiative 
in the United Nations Security Council early in the year to establish a zone free of all weapons of mass 
destruction, especially nuclear weapons, in the Middle East, reflecting the will of all States in the 
region except Israel. Those States, again except Israel, had already acceded to the NPT and placed 
their nuclear facilities under safeguards. Israel continued to be the only State in the region with a 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 6 

nuclear arsenal, contrary to all international resolutions and treaties. Moreover, owing to IsraelÂs 
intransigence, the Director General had been unable to fulfil his mandate from the General Conference 
to apply the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region, which was a 
precondition for establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Syria therefore called on 
the General Conference to pass a resolution reflecting the factual situation as a first step towards 
achieving those goals. While he appreciated the Director GeneralÂs idea of holding a forum on the 
proposed nuclear-weapon-free zone, he feared it would serve no purpose if Israel continued to refuse 
to sign the NPT. 

43. The bloodletting in the occupied Palestinian territories and IsraelÂs savage and suppressive 
policies there and in the occupied Golan had shocked the entire world. Israel was still using its security 
concerns as a pretext for its policy of nuclear deterrence without being subjected to any international 
pressure to change its ways. 
44. In contrast to Israel, which had been obstructing peace, the Syrian Government had adopted the 
approach of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic option that would ensure the restoration of 
rights and hold out the prospect of a decent life for all parties concerned. 
45. The AgencyÂs departure from the principle of zero-real-growth budgeting which had been 
followed for the past fifteen years was acceptable in view of the need to meet the AgencyÂs resource 
requirements. He welcomed the postponement of deshielding until 2008 to alleviate the financial 
burden on developing States. It was necessary, however, to provide more predictable and assured 
resources for technical cooperation. The idea of integrating the TCF into the Regular Budget or of 
establishing a mechanism to ensure that States honoured their financial commitments was no less 
important than the decision to allow real growth in the Regular Budget. He was in favour of an 
increase in TCF resources commensurate with the increase in the Regular Budget as soon as a suitable 
mechanism for securing the necessary resources was established. 
46. He regretted that the rate of attainment mechanism agreed to by developing States in 2000 in the 
hope that TCF resources would be increased in return for their consent to gradual deshielding with 
respect to the safeguards component of the budget had not achieved the desired result. He was 
therefore looking forward to discussing specific proposals for achieving that goal at the next TACC 
meetings in November. He indicated that his country had fulfilled all its financial obligations to the 
Agency. 
47. Agency technical cooperation projects had made a major contribution to sustainable development 
in his country. The Model Project on the development of technical capabilities for sustainable 
radiation and waste safety infrastructure had made considerable progress. The first and second 
milestones Â development of the national regulatory framework and control of occupational radiation 
exposure Â had already been approved, and efforts were under way to complete work on the other 
milestones in cooperation with the Agency as soon as possible. An environmental monitoring action 
plan and programme had been established, and a national emergency plan had been approved. 
48. Progress had been made in the current year at the Nuclear Medicine Centre of the Atomic Energy 
Commission of Syria, whose cyclotron facility had started production of radiopharmaceuticals and 
radionuclides under a strict quality control regime. The project would greatly assist in upgrading the 
countryÂs health care system. Syria was grateful for the AgencyÂs assistance in the form of experts and 
of training in international laboratories for national technicians. 
49. The interregional project on saline groundwater and wastelands for plant production was being 
supplemented by a national project on the exploitation of saline land. 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 7 

50. Within the framework of promoting a nuclear safety culture, his country had signed a contract 
with the Agency to translate into Arabic and to distribute the IAEA Bulletin, which had previously 
been published only in the other official languages. The first issue for 2003 had already been 
translated and printed, and 1000 copies would be distributed to universities, Arab scientific institutions 
and interested Arab organizations. He was also pleased to announce that the third cohort of students 
had recently completed the regional postgraduate course at Damascus University leading to a diploma 
in radiation protection and safety of radioactive sources. The course was based on cooperation 
between the Agency and the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria. The fourth cohort, comprising 
students from all Arab States, had just started work. The training course was a basic component of a 
well-established nuclear safety culture and formed part of the postgraduate curriculum at Damascus 
University. His country was willing to enrol more Arab students in the course. 
51. During the previous year, the Atomic Energy Commission had received twenty-four Arab trainees 
with fellowships from the Agency and had hosted eight regional courses under the AgencyÂs auspices. 
In addition, the Agency had used the services of eight cost-free experts from the Commission. 
52. Early in the year, Syria had hosted the first meeting of ARASIAÂs Board of Representatives, 
which had resulted in ARASIAÂs first adopted guidelines and operational rules. It had also volunteered 
to act, through the Atomic Energy Commission, as a secretariat for the States party to ARASIA. Under 
the AgencyÂs auspices, the States party to the Agreement had already embarked on two regional 
projects: on comparative assessment of electricity generation options and on strengthening regional 
training and certification capability in non-destructive testing. He called on Arab Member States in 
West Asia to complete their ARASIA accession procedures. 
53. Mr. KORBI (Tunisia), noting that his country had been one of the first to join the Agency, said it 
had been giving high priority to the development of the science and technology sector as the 
cornerstone of its development effort. The tenth development plan (2002Â2006) reflected the 
GovernmentÂs clear political will to support the sector. A key measure among the many decisions and 
procedures adopted was the doubling of appropriations for research, which would reach 1% of the 
countryÂs GDP in 2004. 
54. The most important challenge at the national level had been to meet the increasing need for staff 
and research structures at higher education establishments and research institutes, and to promote 
technological innovation to enhance companiesÂ competitiveness through continued consolidation of 
multidisciplinary technological focal points and Âinstitutional incubatorsÂ around university centres so 
as to create the largest possible number of job opportunities, especially for higher diploma holders, 
who would number around 85 000 by 2010, or 50% of total job applicants. 
55. His country attached great importance to the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology and 
had therefore been following advances in that area with interest; in particular, the design and 
manufacture of small and medium-size reactors enabled small countries to generate power and 
desalinate seawater in quantities commensurate with their needs and capabilities, and he hoped the 
Agency would continue to support that technology in view of its positive impact on sustainable 
development. In that context, his country had joined the expert group on desalination set up by the 
Agency in cooperation with the French Atomic Energy Commission. 
56. Current collaboration between Tunisia and the Agency consisted in the funding of many technical 
cooperation projects under national, regional or international programmes and the provision of training 
opportunities and expertise to specialized national personnel, enabling them to use scientific 
instrumentation to further economic and social development. The AgencyÂs assistance included: 
consolidation of the laboratories attached to the National Nuclear Science and Technology Centre, in 
particular the sterile medfly production unit, which was helping to control a pest found throughout 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 8 

North Africa; a study of water resources and monitoring of dam water leakage; consolidation of a 
model food irradiation unit at the Centre helping to enhance the export capacity of many national 
enterprises; and strengthening of the non-destructive testing service. He trusted that the Agency would 
continue its support so that his country could establish an advanced scientific and technological base 
for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in cooperation with the Agency and friendly countries. Tunisia 
was also working with sister Arab States at the bilateral level and in the Arab Maghreb Union, the 
Arab League and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, based in Tunis, and he called on the IAEA to give 
greater attention to cooperation and scientific partnership with the latter Agency in particular so as to 
support its regional role. TunisiaÂs contributions to technical cooperation among African countries, 
especially under AFRA, included the hosting of scientific meetings and training courses; for example, 
it had organized four important scientific events in 2002 and was contributing to four similar events in 
2003. It had also participated in study courses and workshops in Member States. His countryÂs support 
for AFRA stemmed from its firm belief in the need for greater South-South coordination and its 
leading role in North-South cooperation. 

57. He thanked the Agency staff and experts for their efforts to implement AFRA since its 
inauguration in 1990, which had produced tangible results. AFRA was now a tool for scientific and 
technical development and an important key to the future prosperity of African countries. He called on 
donors to support it in the light of the convincing evidence of its potential. 
58. Tunisia firmly believed that cooperation in the area of nuclear safety would bring safety for all and 
that the peaceful use of nuclear technology would foster wide and sustainable development. It also 
believed that the accession of all States to relevant treaties, compliance with their provisions, and 
decisive action against illegal trafficking in nuclear materials would provide fundamental safeguards 
and assurances for all Member States. It therefore supported the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance global 
nuclear safety. 
59. Conscious of the need to limit the risks from the use of nuclear material and to prevent its 
deployment for illegal purposes, Tunisia had made consistent efforts towards the establishment of 
appropriate international mechanisms: it was a party to the Pelindaba Treaty on a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in Africa, it worked jointly with the international community on strengthening the safeguards 
regime, and indeed, it was involved in all international endeavours to promote nuclear safety, 
safeguards, non-proliferation and the banning of nuclear testing. 
60. In line with the AgencyÂs aims and guidance, his country had sought the AgencyÂs assistance in 
developing a national control and accountability system, in particular through the training of Tunisian 
safeguards specialists. Meanwhile, considerable progress had been made in studying the Model 
Additional Protocol in preparation for its ratification. 
61. Tunisia could not but express grave concern at IsraelÂs continued refusal to accede to the NPT. It 
called on Israel to cooperate with the Agency by submitting its nuclear installations to safeguards in 
accordance with the relevant international resolutions, a step that would build confidence among 
countries and move forward the peace process in the Middle East. It also wished to renew its appeal 
for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in addition to the one already 
established in Africa. 
62. Tunisia was consistently opposed to all forms of terrorism and considered international solidarity 
to be the optimum framework for cooperation among all countries in resisting terrorism. 
63. In view of the prevailing global circumstances, with glaring social and economic disparities 
among States and within individual communities, the President of Tunisia had called on world leaders 
and United Nations and other international bodies to create an international solidarity fund whose 
assets, including voluntary contributions, would be used to alleviate poverty and to develop the 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 9 

poorest regions of the world. The international community had responded positively to the PresidentÂs 
call and agreed to the creation of the fund. 

64. In that context, he noted that his country had paid its contribution to the AgencyÂs budget for the 
current year and was about to pay its contributions to the TCF and its assessed programme costs. 
65. In conclusion, he said that the Agency had the capability, through its technical cooperation 
programme, to achieve the lofty objectives for which it had been founded, namely dissemination of 
knowledge, technology transfer and capacity-building in Member States for the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology to improve human living conditions in both developed and developing countries. 
Radionuclides had applications, for example, in food security, water resource management, human 
health, environmental protection, and scientific research in general, and the Agency had an important 
role to play in strengthening international cooperation to promote the nuclear safety concept, 
preventing terrorist acts, disseminating a culture of solidarity, and bridging the gap between North and 
South. 
66. Mr. BUTT (Pakistan) said that the dramatic changes in perceptions of international peace and 
security since the turn of the century were presenting taxing challenges to the Agency, which was 
handling them with commendable skill and wisdom. Pakistan was gratified to note that in the process 
the statutory interests of Member States, particularly the developing countries, had been given due 
importance. 
67. Pakistan was perhaps one of the most prominent developing countries in which the generation of 
electricity from nuclear power could play a vital role in economic development. The AgencyÂs 
forecast for the use of nuclear power in the Asia region was a promising one, and Pakistan would 
expand the use of nuclear power in its economy as part of a proper energy mix and to counter the risks 
of industrial pollution resulting from economic growth. The excellent operational and safety record of 
its two nuclear power plants had encouraged Pakistan to acquire a third. In addition to generating 
electricity, some of those facilities would also be used to power desalination plants in the future. 
Pakistan was currently collaborating with the Agency in establishing its first demonstration 
desalination unit, and was also interested in playing a serious role in INPRO, so that it could benefit in 
future from safe, cost-effective and proliferation-resistant nuclear power plants. 
68. The safety and security of its nuclear installations was as important to Pakistan as expanding its 
generating capacity, and it had been able to establish a strong safety culture. It had further reinforced 
the security measures around its nuclear installations in order to avoid any possibility of nuclear 
terrorism or illicit trafficking in nuclear material, and was pleased to renew its commitment to a safer 
world in line with the AgencyÂs nuclear security plan. Pakistan wanted to see an early conclusion of 
the deliberations on amending the CPPNM in the hope that it would then be able to enhance its 
capabilities to protect its nuclear installations and material more effectively. 
69. Pakistan attached the highest importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. As 
for other developing countries, an important requirement for Pakistan was access to equipment and 
material from the industrially advanced countries. Embargoes and restrictions acted as an impediment 
to accelerating economic development in many countries which had attained a certain level of 
advancement with the help of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. Such embargoes and 
restrictions inhibited the AgencyÂs efforts to assist the developing countries in making the transition 
from dependence to self-reliance, and Pakistan would strongly urge the advanced countries to take a 
fresh look at their policy of technology denial. Such a policy had not produced any useful results in the 
past; nor was it likely to do so in the future. The impact of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme could be significantly enhanced if the developing countries were given better access to 
advanced technologies. SAGTAC should deliberate on the matter and advise the Agency on how to 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 10 

facilitate the transfer of technology in an effective and sustainable manner. It would be helpful for 
Member States if SAGTACÂs recommendations were periodically brought to their notice. 

70. Pakistan wished once again to assure the world community that it was fully committed to the 
cause of Agency safeguards and would make every effort to keep the safeguards system fully 
functional and oppose any impediments which could negatively affect its smooth operation. Pakistan 
earnestly desired to continue fulfilling all its obligations under existing safeguards agreements and was 
confident that its cooperation with the Agency in that area would become stronger. 
71. While fully acknowledging the importance of safeguards, Pakistan placed equal emphasis on a 
balanced approach with regard to the AgencyÂs other statutory functions and firmly believed that 
maintaining a proper balance between promotional and safety- or security-related activities was 
essential to success. It was difficult to understand why the simple notion of harmonious balance should 
become a matter of contention with some Member States. There was a need for cohesion and greater 
understanding among all the AgencyÂs members in order to advance the AgencyÂs mandate, and 
thereby enhance its strength and credibility. 
72. Pakistan greatly appreciated the role regional agreements were playing in supplementing the 
AgencyÂs development activities and hoped that new management arrangements would strengthen the 
RCA. It also hoped that the RCA would retain its role as a regional agreement and would not be 
weakened because of an increasing influx of activities which could be implemented as national 
projects. Pakistan would like SAGTAC, SAGNA and SAGNE to study that aspect and advise the 
Agency as to how it should maintain a focused approach to its various regional development 
programmes. 
73. Pakistan shared the AgencyÂs concern regarding its continued financial constraints and believed 
that Member States must support it by providing the resources it needed so that it could fulfil its 
statutory obligations. A working group of interested Member States should be set up to study the 
matter and advise the Agency on how to overcome the financial problems in a realistic manner. 
Pakistan had consistently paid all its contributions in full and on time regardless of its economic 
problems. 
74. Pakistan had made significant achievements in the past year in the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy for the countryÂs socio-economic development and wished to record its deep gratitude for the 
help it had received from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. In agriculture alone, the 
increase in revenues due to the application of nuclear techniques had been of the order of $100 million 
per year, which would pay for the installation every six or seven years of a small or medium-sized 
nuclear power plant. 
75. Pakistan also intended to participate in the World Nuclear University, and had recently joined the 
SESAME project. 
76. Ms. KELLY (Argentina) noted with regret that the nuclear non-proliferation regime now faced 
serious challenges. Within the Agency, efforts should be continued to develop a consensus embracing 
as many countries as possible, with a view to creating an atmosphere of confidence and legitimacy of 
decisions. Priority must be given to preserving and consolidating multilaterally negotiated 
international norms, for instance by bringing the CTBT into force as soon as possible. 
77. Countries such as her own had contributed to broadening the international consensus on 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. ArgentinaÂs policy in that regard was not confined 
to adherence to regional or global treaties and agreements: it also involved fulfilment of obligations 
undertaken, and a firm commitment regarding both its internal nuclear development and its role as a 
nuclear supplier. Accordingly, its fundamental concern was to ensure strict compliance with 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 11 

international agreements relating to non-proliferation. She wished to express ArgentinaÂs appreciation 
for the actions taken by the Director General in that area, and for his efforts to foster an effective 
safeguards regime and a safety system designed to protect people and the environment from radiation 
damage. 

78. Argentina also favoured a balanced approach to the question of safe transport of radioactive 
material. The Secretariat could play an important role facilitating dialogue between Member States on 
the issues identified in the conclusions of the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material which had taken place in July 2003. Argentina was ready to contribute towards 
reaching the necessary consensus on the subject, in particular through the draft resolution that would 
be before the General Conference. 
79. Another important event had been the International Conference on Security of Radioactive 
Sources in March. The Action Plan on that subject was an important contribution to the coordination 
of international efforts. 
80. Concerning safeguards, her country was in favour of universal application of comprehensive 
safeguards such as those implemented under the NPT. In discussions on the verification programme 
for the coming biennium, her delegation had recommended continued efforts to achieve greater 
efficiencies and savings without loss of effectiveness. On that basis, it had agreed, exceptionally, to a 
departure from the principle of zero growth and had supported the consensus on a significant 
budgetary increase to strengthen the AgencyÂs activities. In that context, Argentina had recommended 
intensifying the AgencyÂs cooperation with other verification bodies such as ABACC. 
81. Her countryÂs activities in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had included development of 
radioisotope production for medical and industrial use, providing inter alia an important tool for 
irradiation of prototype research reactor fuel elements with high-density uranium. Argentina was 
continuing operation of its two nuclear power plants, which supplied 8Â10% of the countryÂs total 
electricity requirements. 
82. Argentina welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in the area of innovative nuclear reactors and fuel 
cycles and was participating in INPRO. The future survival of the nuclear power option would depend 
on the results of such studies carried out with international collaboration. While appreciating the 
important role played by the Agency in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and 
technological development, Argentina wished to reiterate its support for the international safeguards 
regime applied and administered by the Agency and for export controls for sensitive technologies to 
ensure their use for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
83. A recent example of bilateral cooperation involving Argentina related to the construction of a 
research reactor in Australia, an important initiative which would help to foster relations with that 
country. 
84. Nuclear sector and regulatory institutions in Argentina, in cooperation with the IAEA, had 
continued to sponsor courses, workshops and scientific meetings while also providing training to 
students and scientists from abroad. At the same time, the country had made available to the Agency a 
considerable number of experts and lecturers. Particular mention should be made of the postgraduate 
course on radiation protection and nuclear safety for students from Spanish-speaking countries. 
85. Argentina had a great interest in participating in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes 
as a supplier and looked to the Secretariat to establish transparent criteria and norms for the AgencyÂs 
purchasing, particularly in Latin America. 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 12 

86. Argentina had been among those supporting the amendment to Article VI of the Statute to increase 
participation in the work of the Board of Governors and hoped the General Conference would seek 
ways of accelerating the entry into force of that amendment. 
87. Another subject of concern to her delegation was the large number of countries that risked losing 
the right to vote because their economic and financial situation had made them unable to pay their 
contributions. That issue should be dealt with in the context of a complete review of the criteria for 
assessment of contributions in international organizations. 
88. Mr. ADAMOWITSCH (Germany) said that the Iraq conflict had again demonstrated the 
usefulness of the Agency as a reliable and central partner in the field of non-proliferation. Germany 
very much appreciated the work of the Director General and his staff in Iraq and supported continuing 
that work to resolve remaining questions regarding IraqÂs past nuclear programme and further 
implementing the reinforced ongoing monitoring and verification system as an effective deterrent to 
IraqÂs resumption of its nuclear weapons programme. To that end Germany was looking forward to the 
review of the AgencyÂs mandate in Iraq as envisaged by Security Council resolution 1483 (2003). 
89. The DPRKÂs nuclear programme had been a source of grave concern to the international 
community for years, and Germany welcomed the start of the six-party talks at the end of 
August 2003. The DPRK must reactivate its membership of the NPT and accept all obligations 
resulting from its safeguards agreement with the Agency. The DPRK could count on returning to the 
world community only if it fulfilled its obligations and contributed actively to the complete 
transparency of its nuclear activities. 
90. Germany hoped that the situation regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran could also be solved in a 
satisfactory manner. That country had repeatedly promised full transparency, and Germany expected it 
to continue its full cooperation with the Agency, accepting all necessary inspections. Germany 
welcomed its announcement that it intended to start negotiations on an additional protocol and 
expected it to sign, ratify and implement such a protocol without preconditions at the earliest date. It 
was the only way for Iran to begin re-establishing the confidence which had been seriously 
undermined by lack of transparency and its various failures to comply with its safeguards obligations. 
91. The developments in those countries had shown to many observers that the international 
non-proliferation system had to be strengthened. Germany therefore welcomed the initiative of the 
Director General in declaring that it was time for reform and calling for the international collective 
system to be reinvigorated to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Germany hoped that 
that initiative would not be disregarded, and that careful thought would be given to the issue. His 
country in fact had the impression that lessons were already being drawn and steps were being taken in 
the right direction. The European Union was working on a comprehensive strategy to combat the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with one of the key objectives being the universalization 
and reinforcement of multilateral agreements by ensuring the detectability of treaty violations and 
strengthening the role of the Security Council as the final arbiter of compliance. In that context the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system too should be reviewed and modernized. 
92. Germany expected all countries to comply fully with their obligations, including the signing and 
ratification of the additional protocol, which now represented the safeguards standard and should be 
reflected in nuclear export control regimes as soon as possible. Germany called on all countries which 
had not yet concluded an additional protocol to do so at the earliest opportunity. 
93. The events of recent years had reminded the world community what a fragile world it lived in, and 
had also demonstrated that governments and societies often reacted only after a major incident had 
occurred. They had shown that safety and security were core responsibilities in modern technological 
societies and that their basis was the maintenance and development of technical know-how and of 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 13 

political, economic, psychological and even philosophical knowledge, and sometimes simply of 
human understanding. All fields of knowledge were interrelated in modern societies. Germany 
therefore strongly supported the AgencyÂs activities in the field of maintaining and developing 
knowledge and know-how and hoped that the World Nuclear University initiative could be carried out. 
Nuclear expertise was important even for countries such as Germany which were phasing out nuclear 
energy, as the maintenance of nuclear know-how was still indispensable for reasons of safety, security, 
non-proliferation, transport, storage and environmental protection. Germany also supported all other 
forms of nuclear safety culture and particularly welcomed the progress made since the last session of 
the General Conference in implementing the AgencyÂs programme to improve nuclear security and to 
protect against nuclear terrorism. Germany would be supporting the NSF to the tune of Â1 million in 
the period 2004Â2005. However, the methodology being applied for the use, storage and transport of 
radioactive sources still needed to be clarified and brought into line with that employed by the 
European Commission for the same purposes. The progress made over the past year in improving the 
AgencyÂs emergency response arrangements had been an important step towards increasing its 
capability to protect people against radiological hazards originating from lost, stolen or abandoned 
radioactive sources. The increasing number of real events demonstrated the need for that expert 
capability. 

94. The nuclear safety culture required constant training and development, and it was the AgencyÂs 
task not only to contribute to those efforts but also to admonish Member States tempted to lessen their 
activities in that regard. Cooperation in the world nuclear community must be very close indeed to 
guarantee the safety of nuclear energy. The nuclear community must also inform and train the public 
so that it had an adequate understanding of the safety of nuclear energy. In that respect as well, the 
Agency had an important task to perform. The TCF was an important instrument for supporting 
developing countries in the various areas linked to the nuclear safety culture. Some developing 
countries had reached a very high level of nuclear know-how, and Germany hoped that INPRO would 
contribute not only to the development of new, innovative reactors but also, and above all, to safety, 
non-proliferation, and improved storage and environmental protection. 
95. The Agency was confronted by an abundance, even over-abundance, of tasks, which were likely to 
increase rather than diminish, and which required the Agency to be adequately funded. There had been 
very complicated budget negotiations during the year, and finally a compromise had been reached. 
Germany had accepted the compromise, given the special and unique character of the Agency and its 
tasks, and given the political necessities, but it was going to continue its efforts to ensure that the 
AgencyÂs budget was set up in the most efficient way. In that context, Germany very much 
appreciated the fact that the Board had recommended to the General Conference the appointment of 
the German Supreme Audit Institution as the AgencyÂs External Auditor. 
96. It was well known that Germany was phasing out nuclear energy. In two yearsÂ time German 
irradiated fuel would no longer be transported to other countries for reprocessing. The disposal 
problem had not been finally solved but slow, steady progress was being made. Germany remained 
committed to research in the nuclear field and would continue to collaborate closely with the Agency, 
especially regarding all aspects of the nuclear safety culture and matters of non-proliferation. The 
Agency remained the cornerstone in those important areas, and Germany would further support it to 
the extent possible. 
97. Mr. VALECA (Romania) said that his country had adopted a long-term strategy and plan of action 
in October 2002 for the development of its nuclear sector. The strategy provided for specific activities 
at all stages of the nuclear cycle. In line with the GovernmentÂs policy of developing nuclear power as 
a contributor to the national electricity supply, Cernavoda Unit 1 now covered 10% of electricity 
demand. As safety was a high priority, an interim depository for spent fuel had recently become 
operational at the plant. RomaniaÂs sound nuclear infrastructure and expertise would effectively 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 14 

support the construction and operation of Cernavoda Unit 2 by 2005 to meet increased demand later in 
the decade. The national infrastructure would cover more than 50% of the investment. A feasibility 
study on construction of Cernavoda Unit 3 would be completed by mid-2004 by a Romanian company 
and international companies, and steps would then be taken to select members for a public-private 
partnership and to negotiate a framework contract. 

98. An example of the Romanian GovernmentÂs commitment to nuclear safety and security was the 
strengthening of the activities of the national regulatory body with the support of the Agency and the 
European Union. Romania had pledged in-kind contributions to the AgencyÂs action plan on nuclear 
terrorism and in February 2003 had organized, in close cooperation with the Secretariat, a regional 
pilot course for south-eastern Europe on techniques for counteracting nuclear threats. A follow-up 
course was being contemplated as a further in-kind contribution to the NSF. At the national level, new 
regulations on physical protection, including the use of the design basis threat concept, had been 
adopted. Individual matrixes had been sent to each nuclear facility and operator with a view to 
improvement of physical protection systems, and regulations had been issued on qualifications of 
guards and security personnel for nuclear facilities. 
99. The chapters of the accession negotiations with the European Union concerning environment and 
energy, including in particular the nuclear safety and radiation protection norms, had been completed 
and the recommendations contained in the 2001 nuclear safety report of the European CouncilÂs 
working group on atomic questions were being implemented. RomaniaÂs framework law on nuclear 
safety had been amended to allow the establishment of technical support organizations and to make 
the financing of regulatory activities more flexible by using extrabudgetary resources. A law on the 
safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel had set up the National Agency for Radioactive 
Waste and a law on the promotion of nuclear activities and the peaceful use of nuclear energy had 
established the Nuclear Agency, which would coordinate bilateral and multilateral external 
cooperation, including with the European Commission and the Agency. 
100. Romania was committed to fulfilling all its obligations under the NPT, safeguards agreement 
and additional protocol and to promoting a responsible export control policy. In February 2003 it had 
hosted a regional seminar on the promotion of the additional protocol in south-eastern Europe. 
101. He thanked the Agency for its continuous support for Romania under the technical cooperation 
programme, especially through the provision of training and expertise. New European Union members 
from the region should remain eligible for assistance under the programme in the first years after 
accession. Romania would continue to support technical cooperation activities by training experts 
from developing countries, organizing regional seminars and workshops, and sharing information and 
expertise. He was confident that the Agency would continue to make full use of RomaniaÂs nuclear 
facilities for its international and regional training. 
102. His Government attached great importance to the footnote-a/ project to convert the TRIGA 
research reactor in Pitesti from HEU to LEU. He thanked the United States for its generous decision 
earlier in 2003 to provide $4 million of financial support for the project. 
103. Another high priority was the decommissioning of the VVR-S research reactor, which had been 
shut down by a 2002 governmental decision. The decommissioning plan had been submitted to the 
Agency in May 2003. It was hoped that the Agency would support the plan to return the spent fuel 
from the reactor to the Russian Federation. 
104. Romania counted on international cooperation, especially from the Agency and countries with 
similar nuclear programmes, in training human resources at the undergraduate and postgraduate level 
for the proper operation of the nuclear sector. 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 15 

105. Romania, whose term as a member of the Board of Governors would end during the current 
session, had ratified the 1999 amendment to Article VI of the Statute in 2001 and urged all Member 
States to follow suit. 
106. Romania supported the draft programme and budget for 2004Â2005 and trusted that the Agency 
would preserve the balance between its statutory responsibilities and its technical cooperation 
activities. His country would continue to make regular payments to the TCF and the Regular Budget. 
107. Mr. FRANIC (Croatia), deploring the terrorist bombing in Baghdad that had claimed the lives 
of so many United Nations staff members on a peace mission in Iraq, said that the battle against 
terrorism must continue to be a high priority for every State. The Agency was an indispensable 
institution in that context. 
108. Dramatic developments in Iraq, the DPRK and the Islamic Republic of Iran also attested to the 
importance of the Agency. A positive resolution of the issues involved would benefit both the 
countries concerned and the international community as a whole. Member States had an obligation to 
provide the Agency with all necessary support in that regard. 
109. As one of the first countries in which an additional protocol had entered into force, Croatia 
welcomed the conclusion by Cuba of a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional 
protocol and the conclusion by Iceland of an additional protocol. He urged Member States that had not 
yet signed or ratified safeguards agreements and additional protocols to do so as soon as possible. 
110. Croatia had also been one of the first ten countries to accept the amendment to Article VI of the 
Statute. He invited other Member States to accelerate their internal procedures to ensure its early entry 
into force. 
111. Croatia greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation, which facilitated the transfer 
and implementation of nuclear knowledge and know-how. Among the wide range of ongoing or 
completed projects in Croatia, he drew attention in particular to the use of nuclear technology in 
landmine detection, a project whose outcome could make a valuable contribution to demining efforts 
worldwide. All six projects proposed for 2003Â2004, ranging from medical applications to combating 
illicit trafficking, had been accepted. He expressed regret, however, at the delay in implementing 
project CRO/0/006 on the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials. 
112. Croatia welcomed the growing number of foreign experts visiting its research institutes and the 
University of Zagreb under Agency fellowships. It hosted a number of training courses, workshops 
and seminars each year under the technical cooperation programme and invited the Agency to make 
greater use of CroatiaÂs capacity and infrastructure for that purpose. He also expressed the hope that 
the visit in June 2003 by the AgencyÂs Deputy Director General for Nuclear Sciences and Applications 
to the Center for Marine Research of the ÂRuder BoÂkovicÂ Institute in Croatia would encourage the 
Agency to make greater use of that institutionÂs knowledge and capacity. 
113. Given the importance of education in nuclear and radiological science and of preserving nuclear 
knowledge, he welcomed the inauguration of the World Nuclear University. 
114. Although Croatia was a net recipient country, it was fully aware of the AgencyÂs reliance on 
financial contributions to meet ongoing requests and needs and had therefore paid its full share to the 
TCF and discharged all other financial obligations in full and on time. 
115. With regard to the KrÂko nuclear power plant, built on the territory of Slovenia and jointly 
owned by Croatia and Slovenia, he was pleased to announce that the lengthy dispute over joint 
operation had been resolved in 2001 by means of a compromise agreement, which Croatia had ratified 
in July 2002 and Slovenia in March 2003. Joint management of the plant had been restored in 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 16 

April 2003 and Croatia had begun to receive its half of the plantÂs electricity production. The two 
Governments had decided to elaborate jointly a programme for decommissioning and radioactive 
waste and fuel management. He welcomed the AgencyÂs positive response to the request for assistance 
in implementing the project, which would provide a long-term solution to safety and security issues. 

116. He commended the Agency on its organization in 2003 of the International Conferences on 
Security of Radioactive Sources and on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material. Croatia also 
looked forward to participating, not least through the elected Croatian Vice-President, in the first 
review meeting under the Joint Convention. 
117. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba) said that his country had always staunchly supported general 
and complete disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, under strict international control. The 
NPT had been a first step in that direction, albeit flawed and discriminatory because it permitted a club 
of nuclear Powers to shirk their practical disarmament responsibilities. Nevertheless, Cuba had 
acceded to the NPT in November 2002 and had ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 2002 as an 
indication of its commitment to multilateralism and world peace, even though it was the target of 
sanctions and increased hostility on the part of the sole nuclear Power in the Americas. 
118. On acceding to the two treaties, Cuba had immediately opened consultations with the Agency 
with a view to signing both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol. 
Although it could have settled for an agreement corresponding to a small-quantity country, his 
Government had opted to sign standard instruments as a mark of its support for a strong, effective and 
efficient safeguards regime. The instruments would be signed during the current session of the General 
Conference. He thanked the Secretariat for ensuring that the consultations proceeded in an atmosphere 
of trust and transparency. 
119. The eighteenth session of the OPANAL General Conference would be held in Havana in 
November 2003, and on that occasion Latin America and the Caribbean would be declared the worldÂs 
first inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
120. Cuba had always maintained that it was possible to reach a negotiated settlement of the issue of 
the DPRKÂs nuclear programme. He thanked the Director General and China for their information on 
the subject. 
121. He fully supported the statements by the non-aligned NPT States at the recent session of the 
Board of Governors on the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It was the AgencyÂs 
duty to take all necessary steps to ensure that all States complied fully with their safeguards 
obligations, but Cuba opposed any attempt to prejudge or to politicize the discussion concerning a 
countryÂs nuclear programme. The Director General had made it clear that the verification process had 
not been completed, so that no definitive conclusions could yet be drawn. Moreover, Iran was 
cooperating with the Agency in the process of investigation. Cuba was confident that it would 
continue to show transparency and goodwill in respect of its NPT commitments and welcomed its 
decision to open negotiations on the conclusion of an additional protocol. It was unacceptable to 
encroach on a StateÂs sovereign right to accede to an international instrument whenever it saw fit. 
Accepting such a precedent would have an adverse impact on international relations. Cuba would use 
its powers of advocacy to prevent any mishandling of the issue of IranÂs nuclear programme from 
unleashing a new international crisis and strongly supported political and diplomatic efforts to reach a 
settlement that was acceptable to all parties, that remained within the framework of the Agency, and 
that respected the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations. 
122. He reiterated the importance of the endorsement by the Non-Aligned Movement, in the final 
document of its thirteenth summit conference, of the aspiration to declare the Middle East a 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 17 

nuclear-weapon-free zone, which would require Israel to place its nuclear installations under Agency 
safeguards. 

123. The use of nuclear technology had had a tangible impact on CubaÂs priority development 
programmes. The country had benefited from technology transfer under the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme. Its performance indicators were excellent and the resources allocated had 
been put to the best possible use. Cuba had therefore systematically honoured its financial 
commitments to the Agency in spite of its economic difficulties. Cuban specialists had also transferred 
the expertise acquired through technical cooperation projects to other countries and regions under 
Agency programmes. 
124. Since the fourth session of the ARCAL Technical Coordination Board, held in Havana in 
June 2003, Cuba had assumed the presidency of ARCAL for a period of one year. He was confident 
that the AgencyÂs support for ARCAL, and hence for technical cooperation among developing 
countries, would be intensified in the future. 
125. The recruitment of Agency personnel should be based on efficiency, technical competence and 
integrity, while respecting the principle of geographical distribution and seeking an increase in the 
number of staff members from developing countries and of women staff members. Noting that 66.6% 
of staff employed in CubaÂs science sector were women, he reiterated his countryÂs willingness to 
place highly qualified professional staff at the AgencyÂs disposal. 
126. Mr. RAMAKER (Netherlands) said that the continued delay in the entry into force of the 
CTBT, which, once operational, would considerably strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, remained a cause of concern to the Netherlands, as did the fact that the NPT, after more 
than 30 years of existence, was still not universally adhered to. Recent developments in Iraq, Iran and 
the DPRK and the threat of international terrorism constituted challenges to the non-proliferation 
regime and thus to global peace and security. Work within the IAEA, which was in essence the 
executive agency of the NPT, was of direct relevance to the preservation of the regime. 
127. He was pleased to note that a framework of integrated safeguards was taking shape, since a 
solid system of comprehensive safeguards was crucial in preventing the further spread of nuclear 
weapons. It was a matter of urgency that States which had not yet done so should adhere to the 
safeguards system without delay, since safeguards not only guaranteed peace and security but also 
created the conditions in which the benefits of nuclear technology could be enjoyed to the full, thus 
enabling technical cooperation to flourish. 
128. The Netherlands welcomed the steps taken to ensure a more stable financial foundation for 
safeguards activities, so that they could be less dependent on extrabudgetary contributions. He 
understood that after the agreed increase in the Regular Budget had taken effect, there would be a 
return to zero real growth. For the Netherlands, safeguards activities would remain the principal 
yardstick against which perceived needs for real budgetary growth would be measured in future. 
129. His country deplored the low level of collection of contributions to the Regular Budget, and the 
increasing arrears that resulted. That situation needed to be remedied if the Agency was to be able to 
meet the financial demands made on it. While the Netherlands supported the extension of repayment 
schedules to 10 years, it saw no direct link between that arrangement and the restoration of full voting 
rights to Member States in arrears. Rather, it favoured a trial period during which progress made by 
the State concerned in paying off those arrears could be assessed. 
130. Since technical cooperation in the nuclear field was important for the development of many 
countries, all Member States should contribute to the TCF in accordance with the targets set for them. 
The Netherlands had pledged its full share of the target for the year 2004. It saw no contradiction 

GC(47)/OR.3 
16 September 2003, Page 18 

between technical cooperation activities in general and activities designed to enhance nuclear security, 
and therefore had difficulty in accepting the ceiling of $1.5 million set for the latter within the TCF. 
Such a ceiling was detrimental to the principles of technical cooperation and potentially damaging to 
its functioning. 

131. The Netherlands called on all Member States which had not yet done so to sign and ratify the 
amendment to Article VI of the Statute. 
132. His country was party to both the Nuclear Safety Convention and the Joint Convention and 
looked forward to a fruitful first review meeting under the latter. It intended to implement the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, to the extent that it did not conflict with 
European Union rules, and welcomed the related Action Plan. 
133. The Netherlands supported all efforts to improve the security of nuclear material so as to 
prevent it from ending up in the wrong hands, and therefore favoured strengthening the CPPNM by 
means of a substantive amendment. However, it was not altogether satisfied with the progress 
achieved by the open-ended group of legal and technical experts in drafting that amendment and 
considered it vital that the Agency should continue, in parallel, to develop practical measures on the 
basis of existing rules and regulations. 
134. His country had so far contributed Â500 000 to the NSF and was pleased to state that it would be 
contributing a further Â50 000 to that Fund. At the same time, it continued to believe that activities in 
the field of combating terrorism should be financed from the Regular Budget. Member StatesÂ 
commitment to contribute to the NSF should match their commitment to contribute to the TCF, but 
currently only 21 States had pledged contributions to the former. He noted that as of 30 April 2003 
only 28% of contributions to the NSF had been spent, and hoped that the 60% that had been 
committed would be spent during the year. 
135. In his countryÂs view, the existing regime covering international transport of nuclear materials 
offered sufficient guarantees for safety, and IMO and ICAO were the bodies competent to issue 
transport regulations. The Netherlands therefore did not favour discussions within the Agency to 
develop additional rules and regulations concerning transport of nuclear material. In the same way, the 
Netherlands favoured a clear international system of nuclear liability and would not support a separate 
liability convention for nuclear transport; instead, any gaps in existing conventions should be closed. 
He therefore welcomed the creation of the INLEX group and called on other States to become party to 
the Joint Protocol. 
136. Nuclear energy could only be an option in the overall energy mix once the safe storage of 
nuclear waste, as well as the safety of nuclear power plants, could be properly guaranteed. His 
Government had agreed to allow the Borssele power plant in the Netherlands to continue operation 
until the end of its technical lifetime in 2013 at the latest. Given the potential contribution of nuclear 
energy to limiting carbon dioxide emissions, the Netherlands was closely following developments in 
other countries, monitoring international research, and continuing to provide INPRO with a cost-free 
expert. 
137. In conclusion, his country attached the utmost importance to the AgencyÂs role in promoting 
non-proliferation and the safety and security of nuclear energy, and would continue to give it all 
possible support. 
The meeting rose at 1.00 p.m.

General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (continued) 
(GC(47)/2) 
1. Mr. REIMANN (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, said that nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation were crucial to international security. The international community 
must spare no effort to achieve those goals while there was still disparity in the world nuclear order 
and a risk of horizontal or vertical proliferation. The DPRKÂs recent withdrawal from the NPT was a 
case in point. 
2. The AgencyÂs crucial role as custodian of non-proliferation had been reaffirmed. It had again 
conducted highly sensitive inspections in Iraq the previous winter at the request of the Security 
Council. Unfortunately, certain States party to the NPT had been unwilling to place confidence in its 
expertise, thereby weakening its role and authority. It was in that context that the Agency was 
currently investigating nuclear activities in Iran. He urged the Iranian authorities to cooperate fully, 
complying with the terms of the resolution adopted the previous week by the Board of Governors 
(document GOV/2003/69). He also urged all Member States possessing relevant information to make 
it available to the Agency. He trusted that the Agency would be able to work without undue pressure 
and that States party to the NPT would respect its analysis and decisions. 
3. Switzerland looked forward to the entry into force of the CTBT and urged States to sign and/or 
ratify it. 
4. Financial austerity in Member States and the increase in the AgencyÂs operational costs had 
necessitated substantial internal rationalization and reorganization in recent years, and Switzerland 
supported the proposed increase in the Regular Budget for 2004. However, Switzerland had been in 
favour of zero real growth. His Government, which attached great importance to the effectiveness of 
and the need to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards activities, felt that further economies could be 
made by reviewing safeguards approaches and criteria. While acknowledging that a short-term 
increase in the budget was unavoidable, Switzerland had recommended that the necessary funds be 
taken from programmes containing projects of lower priority that could be deferred for a few years. It 
still preferred that procedure Â even if it meant giving precedence in financial terms, for as short a 
period as possible, to verification over promotion activities Â and was disappointed that it had not 
been adopted. 
5. Switzerland had placed great hopes in the NPT and would shortly ratify an additional protocol. 
He noted that, earlier in the year, the Agency had published a document analysing the impact of the 
introduction of integrated safeguards. According to that document, only an insignificant reduction in 
the number of inspectors could be contemplated, and then only after the requested increase over the 
next few years. The purpose of safeguards was to enhance mutual confidence so that Member States 
could step up nuclear cooperation for development without fear. But not all Member States had made 
the same effort and not all had the same status. In the case of some States which had ratified an 
additional protocol, the Agency would soon be able to provide credible assurances of the absence of 
undeclared nuclear activities. Those States would then have fulfilled all the original nuclear 
non-proliferation aspirations. As many other States as possible should follow suit. But they needed an 
incentive for such an additional handover of sovereignty. Otherwise who stood to benefit? States that 
were not party to the NPT, States that had still not honoured their commitment to eliminate their 
nuclear arsenals or States that had not signed an additional protocol? He urged Member States that 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 2 

were concerned to ensure the application of integrated safeguards to take that into consideration and 
act accordingly. 

6. Switzerland was following the AgencyÂs INPRO project with great interest. Its final goal, like 
that of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), was the development by 2020 to 2030 of one or 
more nuclear systems and fuel cycles for the production of electricity and hydrogen, so that nuclear 
energy could finally become renewable and hence sustainable. 
7. In 2002 Switzerland had hosted the first International Conference on Occupational Radiation 
Protection, convened jointly by the Agency and the ILO. Its recommendations were set forth in the 
draft action plan contained in document GC(47)/7. 
8. SwitzerlandÂs new law on nuclear energy, which would probably enter into force in 2005, 
offered the possibility of building new nuclear power plants and did not limit the lifetime of existing 
plants. It did, however, introduce a ten-year moratorium in respect of new contracts for the 
reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. Also, it provided for an optional referendum with respect to the 
construction of new nuclear installations. It thus reaffirmed his GovernmentÂs long-standing support 
for the nuclear energy option, which had been endorsed by the people in May 2003 when they had 
rejected two anti-nuclear initiatives. 
9. Mr. RÃNAKY (Hungary), noting that his country had been one of the first States to sign and 
implement an additional protocol, was pleased that the Agency had drawn the first conclusion on the 
absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities there. The past year had been exceptionally 
eventful for the Agency, particularly regarding verification, and there had been alarming developments 
in the international arena. The extent and nature of IranÂs nuclear programme was a matter of grave 
concern. While all countries had the right to benefit from the peaceful application of atomic energy, 
that should be done openly and under Agency safeguards control. Hungary supported the Director 
GeneralÂs efforts to resolve all outstanding issues as quickly as possible. It urged Iran to respond 
positively to the calls of the Member States, as reflected in the resolution recently adopted by the 
Board of Governors (document GOV/2003/69), and to act in line with the provisions of the additional 
protocol so that definite conclusions could be drawn about its nuclear programme by November 2003, 
or before. 
10. He also expressed concern over the DPRKÂs actions to block Agency inspections at its nuclear 
facilities and its announced intention to withdraw from the NPT. Nuclear threat should never be a 
bargaining chip at the negotiating table and the DPRK must comply with its NPT safeguards 
agreement, which remained binding and in force. He urged the DPRK to give up its policy of defiance 
and comply fully with its obligations. Hungary welcomed the six-party talks in Beijing and was 
hopeful that they would lead to a peaceful solution of the problem. 
11. His country supported the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts in Iraq pursuant to the relevant Security 
Council resolutions and commended it on its role in drawing a full picture of IraqÂs nuclear activities. 
12. Universal participation was the most important prerequisite for a reliable nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, but was not the only one. A solid and reliable verification system was also 
essential, but required a firm budget. With a zero-real-growth budget the Agency would face 
difficulties in performing its tasks under a strengthened safeguards system. Hungary was pleased that a 
consensus had been reached on the AgencyÂs budget proposal for 2004Â2005, but efforts to increase 
effectiveness and efficiency should not be relaxed. 
13. Given the threat posed by nuclear terrorism, Hungary supported the endeavours aimed at 
preventing weapons of mass destruction and their components from falling into the hands of terrorist 
or criminal groups. It attached great importance to the security of radioactive and nuclear materials 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 3 

and installations, and appreciated the AgencyÂs leading role in organizing and coordinating national 
and international efforts to that end. He welcomed the success of the International Conference on 
Security of Radioactive Sources, which had been held in Vienna in March 2003. Hungary would 
continue to support the AgencyÂs efforts on that issue and had not only contributed to the Nuclear 
Security Fund but also allocated resources to provide in-kind assistance. 

14. National responsibility for nuclear safety was vital and much had been done to improve it in 
Hungary in recent years. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had been one of the first national 
bodies to introduce its own quality management system and its independence had been further 
strengthened by amendment of the Atomic Energy Act. Supervision of the Authority had been 
transferred to the Minister of the Interior. 
15. The serious incident which had occurred in April at the Paks nuclear power plant had shown 
that safety should not be taken for granted. Thorough investigations had been carried out to reveal the 
causes and consequences of the incident and their findings had been summarized and made public. At 
the request of his Government, the Agency had sent an international expert mission to Hungary to 
perform an independent evaluation of the event and to formulate recommendations to the facility and 
the regulatory body. The mission report had recently been made public and action plans were being 
drawn up for implementation of the recommendations. Further assistance from the Agency on that 
issue would be appreciated. 
16. The incident had shown that there was still room to improve safety culture. In that connection, 
he noted the success of the International Conference on Safety Culture in Nuclear Installations, held in 
Rio de Janeiro in December 2002, which had emphasized that the safety culture concept needed to be 
extended. Also, he welcomed the publication of Key Practical Issues in Strengthening Safety Culture 
(INSAG-15), which would be an important and useful guide in HungaryÂs everyday activities. The 
Agency played an essential role in the development of safety standards, which provided the basis for a 
comprehensive international framework for nuclear safety. 
17. Radioactive waste management was another issue of importance to Hungary. He commended 
the AgencyÂs ongoing work related to waste safety, including the International Conference on Issues 
and Trends in Radioactive Waste Management held in December 2002, and the establishment of waste 
safety standards. It was regrettable that adherence to the Joint Convention was still limited; several 
countries with wide relevant experience and most developing countries had not yet acceded. He 
requested that the Secretariat look for ways to rectify that situation. 
18. The safe use of nuclear technology relied heavily on the accumulation of knowledge, and the 
successful operation of any organization was greatly dependent on its recruitment and management 
policy. He commended the AgencyÂs recruitment policy, which took into account both professional 
and managerial competence. 
19. The success of the technical cooperation programme and improvement of its performance was 
the result of coordinated efforts. In that regard, he commended the hard work of the Department of 
Technical Cooperation and welcomed Ms. Cetto, the first lady ever appointed at the Deputy Director 
General level in the Agency. Hungary supported her intention to move away from technology transfer 
as a primary operational principle to the idea of knowledge sharing. Strong emphasis should be placed 
on collaboration to strengthen the institutional capacities of the Member States and the fellowship 
programme was an essential tool in attaining that goal. However, the administrative work associated 
with the fellowship programme could and should be simplified. Maximum use should be made of 
national capabilities and Hungary was ready to assist where possible. Regional cooperation was also a 
key issue in that regard, and good management from the AgencyÂs side would dispense with the need 
for formal agreements, as had been shown in Central Europe. The realization of those initiatives would 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 4 

require a firm technical cooperation budget. He was pleased to announce that his Government had 
pledged its contribution to the TCF for 2004 and he appealed to all Member States to pay their 
contributions in full and on time. 

20. Mr. HANIFF (Malaysia), speaking on behalf of NAM, noted that a Vienna Chapter of the 
Movement had been established pursuant to the 13th NAM Summit Conference held in 
February 2003. NAM Member States felt that it should play an active role in issues before the Agency, 
in close cooperation with the Group of 77 and China. 
21. At that Conference, the NAM Member States had expressed strong concern at the growing 
resort to unilateralism and unilaterally imposed prescriptions, and had reaffirmed that multilateralism 
and multilaterally agreed solutions, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, were the only 
sustainable way of addressing disarmament and international security issues. 
22. Also the Summit Conference had reaffirmed the need for the speedy establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in accordance with Security Council resolution 487 
(1981), and paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), and the relevant General 
Assembly resolutions adopted by consensus. NAM asked all parties concerned to take urgent and 
practical steps towards the establishment of such a zone and called on Israel to place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency full-scope safeguards without delay. 
23. NAM noted with concern the persistence of undue restrictions on exports to developing 
countries of material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes and stressed that proliferation 
issues were best addressed through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and 
non-discriminatory agreements. Non-proliferation control arrangements should be transparent and 
open to participation by all States and should ensure that they did not impose restrictions that hindered 
development. 
24. His delegation welcomed the recommended increase in the Regular Budget for 2004 after more 
than a decade of zero growth. 
25. He commended the professional and transparent manner in which the Agency had undertaken 
its safeguards responsibility in Iraq under the mandate of the Security Council until the suspension of 
verification activities just prior to the commencement of war in March 2003. That mandate needed to 
be brought to a proper close with appropriate further guidance from the Security Council. 
26. On the implementation of the safeguards agreement between the Agency and the DPRK, he 
expressed support for the six-party negotiation process towards a peaceful solution of the issue. It was 
consistent with the NAM view that the parties directly concerned should resolve, through dialogue and 
negotiations, all issues related to the DPRKÂs decision to withdraw from the NPT. 
27. NAM welcomed the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to begin negotiations with the 
Agency on an additional protocol and reiterated the basic and inalienable right of all Member States to 
develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes. NAM attached great importance to achieving an 
appropriate balance between the rights and obligations of Member States. NAM was pleased that Iran 
had taken action rectifying the issues reported by the Agency, in particular by providing the Agency 
with more information and allowing the access requested to additional locations and the taking of 
associated environmental samples. It encouraged Iran to act with full transparency and hoped that 
cooperation between Iran and the Agency would be stepped up with a view to achieving a full 
settlement of the issue. NAM underscored the need for resolution through constructive dialogue within 
the framework of the Agency. NAM would have preferred the recent Board resolution on the issue 
(document GOV/2003/69) to have been adopted by consensus. Malaysia, as the current Chairman of 
NAM, had worked hard to that end and had made four specific proposals for amendments. Consensus 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 5 

might have been possible had there been opportunity for broader consultations involving the entire 
Board. The primary objective of the proponents had apparently been to produce a Âstrong resolutionÂ, 
even if it had to be put to a vote. In the end, the Board resolution had been adopted without a vote and 
NAM had made an interpretative statement on its proposed amendments.1 NAM was confident that the 
Director General would discharge his responsibilities in that connection in an impartial, effective and 
professional manner. 

28. As a beneficiary of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, Malaysia commended the 
Department of Technical CooperationÂs achievements in 2002. Malaysia would continue to fulfil its 
financial commitments to the Agency in full and on time, including with respect to the TCF and its 
APCs. It also welcomed the appointment of Ms. Cetto as the first woman Deputy Director General of 
the Agency. 
29. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) noted the AgencyÂs efforts to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy 
in various socio-economic areas and its achievements in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
materials. 
30. He recalled the positive role the Agency had played in the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development held in Johannesburg in 2002, which had given a high priority to nuclear applications in 
the areas of water, energy, health, agriculture and industry. He underlined the importance of such 
applications in water resource monitoring and management in a world where water was becoming 
increasingly scarce. To that end, multipurpose medium-size nuclear reactors could be used to 
desalinate sea water for drinking purposes and radiation technology used to sterilize waste water. He 
expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs regional projects in States, including his own, aimed at 
developing policies to reduce the depletion of water resources. 
31. Another vital application of nuclear energy was use of the SIT to control the medfly, an 
application which benefited people, the environment and the economy. He appreciated all the 
technical assistance given by the Agency in the past and hoped that help would continue to be 
provided with a view to eradication of that pest from the region. In particular, he hoped that, with 
Agency help, a rearing facility could be established to facilitate easy and affordable acquisition of 
sterile male flies. 
32. In cooperation with the Agency, Jordan had been implementing a number of national and 
regional projects in the important area of nuclear medicine, especially relating to cancer detection and 
treatment, integrated nuclear medicine in the national health care system, and radiation protection in 
medical practices. They had led to notable improvements in public health. 
33. His country paid attention to the environment in general and the maritime environment of the 
Gulf of Aqaba in particular. The competent authorities in Jordan, in cooperation with the Agency, had 
been implementing a radionuclide monitoring project in the Aqaba Gulf area and developing the 
relevant institutional capability. He hoped that the Agency would continue providing assistance in that 
regard. 
34. Jordan also paid serious attention to the security and safety of radiation sources and nuclear 
materials by strictly controlling radioactive waste management and the movement of radiation sources. 
It had set up a radioactive waste management system and issued instructions on the transport of 
radioactive materials based on the AgencyÂs standards and drawing on the results of model projects 
implemented in the region over the past years. Also, under an Agency project, it had installed 
See document GOV/OR.1081 paras 16Â18. 


GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 6 

monitoring systems to detect the illicit transport of any radioactive materials into the country. Jordan 
was currently setting up such systems at all border crossing points. 

35. He thanked the Agency for assisting his country in the area of radiation protection infrastructure 
development, especially as related to legislative and organizational frameworks. As a result of regional 
model projects, a law on nuclear energy and radiation protection had been promulgated and an 
independent Nuclear Energy Commission had been established whose functions included all radiation 
regulatory control activities. While Jordan had made good progress in developing its radiation 
protection infrastructure, it still needed support under regional projects in order to maintain the 
efficiency and ensure the sustainability of the work done in cooperation with the Agency over the past 
five years. 
36. Jordan supported all efforts to achieve the universality of the AgencyÂs comprehensive 
safeguards system, which was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. It called on all States 
that had not yet signed additional protocols to do so. Jordan, for its part, had fulfilled its obligations 
with respect to the non-proliferation regime, the CTBT and the additional protocol. 
37. His Government attached great importance to the application of AgencyÂs safeguards to all 
nuclear activities in the Middle East. Israel should accede to the NPT and implement all of its 
obligations, including the conclusion and implementation of a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol. Jordan had repeatedly expressed its desire for the establishment of a zone 
free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East and stressed the need for the adoption of a 
single standard to all States in the region with nuclear activities that were not directed towards 
peaceful purposes. 
38. Jordan, which had already expressed its willingness to attend an international forum on the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, noted that the proposed agenda for 
that forum, contained in document GC(47)/12, included proposals that it had submitted. 
39. His country was proceeding with the SESAME (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science 
and Applications in the Middle East) project; a site had been selected and construction work had 
already begun. He called on the Agency to provide all possible assistance to ensure its success and 
thereby enhance international and regional scientific cooperation. 
40. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark) said that a universal nuclear non-proliferation regime, backed 
by a strong international safeguards system, was essential to all efforts to pursue nuclear disarmament 
and maintain collective security. The NPT was the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, 
and the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system was the fundamental instrument for securing 
non-proliferation. He called on all non-nuclear-weapon States which were party to the NPT to sign and 
bring into force safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It was regrettable that 47 States had 
not yet signed and implemented safeguards agreements, and that only 35 States had additional 
protocols. Denmark had ratified its additional protocol and expected it to enter into force during 2003, 
along with the national protocols of the other States of the European Union. 
41. His Government had long recognized the need for an effective, cost-effective and properly 
funded safeguards system. It had accordingly supported the increase in the funding of safeguards in 
the AgencyÂs 2004Â2005 budget. 
42. Over the previous months, the European Union had voiced its increasing concern about the 
nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. His Government fully supported the resolution 
contained in document GOV/2003/69, adopted by the Board of Governors on 12 September 2003, 
which called on Iran to provide accelerated cooperation and full transparency with the Agency and 
promptly sign, ratify and fully implement an additional protocol. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 7 

43. His Government was also concerned about the situation in the DPRK. Since 1993, the Agency 
had been unable to implement its comprehensive NPT safeguards agreement with the DPRK. Any 
future settlement must give the Agency the necessary authority to fulfil its verification responsibilities. 
44. The situation in Iraq had changed dramatically over the previous year. Pending guidance from 
the Security Council, his Government fully supported the AgencyÂs continued efforts to ensure that 
Iraq had declared all its nuclear materials, in accordance with its safeguards agreement. 
45. The international community must continue to give the highest priority to nuclear safety. It was 
the responsibility of States engaged in peaceful nuclear activity to ensure that the highest safety 
standards were maintained in order to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology and prevent 
nuclear terrorism. His Government had noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs efforts to establish, 
update and strengthen safety standards and the relevant legal instruments, including the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention and the CPPNM. 
46. In the field of the prevention of nuclear terrorism, the Secretariat was stepping up its 
cooperation with Member States to create a comprehensive nuclear security framework for nuclear 
installations and materials Â an area in which the technical cooperation programme could play an 
important part. 
47. Denmark had decided almost two decades before that nuclear power would not form part of its 
energy policy because of the great problems posed by nuclear safety and waste storage. It therefore 
believed, as a growing number of other countries did, that nuclear power was not an option for 
sustainable development. His Government trusted that its views would be duly acknowledged in the 
technical cooperation work of the Agency. 
48. Technical cooperation was one of the main pillars of the AgencyÂs activities. Denmark had 
always paid its contributions to the TCF in full and on time, and would do so again in 2004. Technical 
cooperation activities must be demand-driven. Recipient countries should select and prioritize their 
own projects in close cooperation with the Secretariat. The activities chosen should receive financial 
and practical support from the recipient government; they should be integrated into national 
programmes and closely coordinated with the activities of other international organizations. High 
priority should be given to monitoring and evaluation of programmes, which would provide valuable 
inputs for programme formulation and implementation. The limited funds available for technical 
cooperation must be used in the most cost-effective, efficient and transparent manner. His Government 
was concerned to note that outstanding APCs now stood at almost $10 million, $3 million more than 
the previous year. 
49. Mr. NOIRFALISSE (Belgium) said multilateralism was the keystone of BelgiumÂs foreign 
policy. His Government was committed to promoting multilateral diplomacy, strengthening existing 
multilateral structures and making the best use of the mechanisms which they offered, and in that 
connection it recognized the vital role of the United Nations, and in particular that of the Agency. 
50. The NPT was the essential foundation of both the nuclear non-proliferation regime and nuclear 
disarmament. For that reason, Belgium was pursuing its efforts to make the NPT universal, including 
through the specific proposals which it had made at the second preparatory meeting for the 2005 NPT 
Review Conference. 
51. Belgium continued to work actively with a view to elaborating a European Union action plan 
against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The declaration of the European Council at 
Thessaloniki in 2003 on that subject stressed that the European Union would support multilateral 
institutions entrusted with verifying and upholding compliance with multilateral disarmament and 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 8 

non-proliferation treaties. The European Union was in favour of strengthening the role of the Security 
Council and its ability to meet the challenge of non-proliferation. 

52. His delegation welcomed the compromise attained on the 2004Â2005 Regular Budget. In 
particular, Belgium was pleased that Member States had agreed to provide the safeguards system with 
considerable additional funding. 
53. Belgium shared the international communityÂs concern about the Iranian nuclear programme. 
Despite increased cooperation by Iran, troubling questions persisted. Belgium supported dealing with 
the issue in the appropriate institution, namely the Agency, and welcomed the BoardÂs adoption the 
previous week of a resolution on Iran, contained in document GOV/2003/69. Belgium called on Iran 
to provide clear, detailed and conclusive answers to all questions pending so that the matter could be 
brought to a satisfactory close. His delegation welcomed IranÂs positive attitude towards signing an 
additional protocol and encouraged it to proceed without delay. IranÂs implementation of that 
additional protocol should help prevent a recurrence of the current difficulties. 
54. With regard to the DPRK, Belgium also endorsed a multilateral approach. His Government 
commended China on its initiative to set up a useful basis for discussion. Belgium continued to favour 
a diplomatic settlement, and urged the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear programme in a visible, 
verifiable and irreversible manner and comply fully with its international non-proliferation obligations 
as an important step towards a global and peaceful solution. The ongoing process would require not 
only a firm stance on non-proliferation, but also creative and bold initiatives in order to restore peace 
to the Korean Peninsula. 
55. The safety and security of nuclear materials and radiation sources was of particular importance 
to Belgium. There could be no peaceful use of nuclear energy without standards and measures to 
protect populations from ionizing radiation and the risk of accidental or criminal radioactive 
contamination. Belgium welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in those areas, which were a part of its 
statutory work to promote the peaceful uses of atomic energy. His delegation would like to see the 
broadest possible application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources. Closer consideration should be given to how the CodeÂs provisions could be incorporated 
into the existing regulatory framework and what impact the Code would have on the export and import 
of sources. Although nuclear safety and security had points in common, they were very different and 
at times incompatible subjects. That made it difficult for States to elaborate or update a clear and 
coherent regulatory framework. His delegation asked the Secretariat to initiate discussion of that topic. 
56. Belgium, which was developing expertise in food irradiation, was participating with interest in 
the AgencyÂs activities in that area. The Belgian authorities also attached importance to radiological 
protection for patients, in particular dosimetry, and was exchanging information with the Agency in 
that field. Yet another area in which Belgium was actively cooperating with the Agency was 
radioactive waste management and was currently chairing the WASSC. Belgian university institutions 
and research centres continued to host many trainees under Agency auspices. 
57. Recent history had shown that the multilateral non-proliferation regime was under pressure. It 
was up to the Member States to strengthen the AgencyÂs authority and credibility so as to prevent any 
violation of the joint commitments undertaken to ensure world peace and security. 
58. Ms. BECERRIL MARTÃNEZ (Spain) expressed satisfaction with the work done over the past 
year by the Agency to improve the security of nuclear and other radioactive materials, and nuclear 
installations, as reported by the Director General in document GC(47)/17. In particular, the 
programme on nuclear security had been incorporated into both the Department of Nuclear Safety and 
Security and the technical cooperation programme. However, the $1.5 million limit for the latter 
should be removed, and recipient countries should themselves decide what type of projects they 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 9 

required. To demonstrate the importance her country attached to the matter, Spain had 
pledged Â67 000 to the nuclear security plan of action. 

59. She commended the SecretariatÂs revision of the Action Plan and Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Spain had adopted, and was implementing, a national 
action plan to improve the security of nuclear and radioactive materials and installations. 
60. Another important achievement had been the finalization of preparations for amendment of the 
CPPNM. The diplomatic conference to adopt the amendment should be held as soon as possible. 
61. The financing of safeguards had been the subject of much discussion over the past year. The 
significant increase in resources proposed for the Department of Safeguards over the coming four 
years should be sufficient to ensure the efficiency and quality of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
However, that increase would establish a new point of reference for the agreed Âcost neutralityÂ of 
integrated safeguards. Maintaining that neutrality would require constant improvement in the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the system, and necessitate changes in the traditional approaches and 
criteria used. The planned review of safeguards working methods would doubtless provide new and 
useful ideas. 
62. Good progress had been made in developing the conceptual framework of integrated safeguards. 
It should be applied as soon as possible to countries with medium or large nuclear programmes as it 
was not desirable for a long period to elapse between submission of the initial declarations and the 
drawing of conclusions by the Agency. The fact that, 6 years after the adoption of the Model 
Additional Protocol, 21 States with significant nuclear programmes had not yet signed additional 
protocols was a cause for concern. Spain had already completed the necessary internal processes for 
entry into force of its additional protocol. 
63. Her delegation, which attached great importance to nuclear safety, radiation protection and 
waste management, was satisfied with the significant progress made in that area in 2002. In particular, 
the Agency had done much to improve the regulatory infrastructure for nuclear safety by strengthening 
national regulatory bodies. Spain was prepared to contribute its know-how and human resources in 
support of the AgencyÂs IRRT service. 
64. Enhancing nuclear safety culture and addressing the ageing of installations were challenges that 
would require constant scientific, technological and regulatory updating. She congratulated the 
Agency on its organization of the International Conference on Safety Culture in Nuclear Installations, 
held in Brazil in December 2002. The Agency should, however, intensify its activities in that regard. 
Spain was willing to assist in the preparation of a safety guide on safety management and culture. 
65. Given the increasing importance of risk assessment, the Agency should do more work in that 
area, seeking a balance between deterministic and probabilistic approaches, and explaining the 
advantages and disadvantages of risk-based methods. 
66. She welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen regulatory infrastructures and education and 
training infrastructures and to develop networks for the sharing of knowledge and experience in the 
field of radiation safety. Spain intended to contribute Â98 000 in support of the extrabudgetary 
programme on nuclear and radiation safety in Ibero-America, which was just being established and 
was to be coordinated with the activities of the Forum of Ibero-American Nuclear Regulators. 
67. Spain had participated actively in the AgencyÂs successful International Conference on National 
Infrastructures for Radiation Safety, held in Morocco in September 2003 and was grateful for Agency 
support for the international conference on training in radiation protection currently being held in 
Madrid. Spain was in favour of the Agency organizing an international conference aimed at finding 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 10 

consensus on the right balance between the levels of protection and the resources required to integrate 
environmental protection into the current radiation protection system. 

68. The first review conference of the Joint Convention would demonstrate StatesÂ willingness to 
attach a high priority to the safety of radioactive waste management. On a related issue, Spain would have 
liked the AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2002 to contain information on its activities to develop safety 
standards applicable to deep geological storage. 
69. Regarding technical cooperation, she noted with satisfaction the increase in the implementation rate 
and the total volume of assistance provided. The decrease in available financial resources reflected the 
budgetary difficulties being faced by Member States. Spain had also had a strict budgetary policy, but 
intended to continue increasing its contribution to the TCF, by Â200 000 in 2003. Spain had also 
supported the technical cooperation programme in other ways in 2002, including the hosting of 67 fellows 
and visiting scientists, the provision of 55 experts for technical assistance missions and had hosted 4 
training courses or events. The increase in expenditure on equipment under the technical cooperation 
programme was worrying. Although equipment was often essential, human resources training should be 
given priority. Also, the Secretariat should diversify its equipment procurement, more than half of which 
had been from only two countries. 
70. Spain was in favour of budget normalization and a gradual elimination of CAURBs so that all core 
activities would be included in the Regular Budget. 
71. The main highlights in the Spanish nuclear sector in the past year were that its 9 nuclear facilities 
had produced 63 043 GWh, contributing 26% of the total electricity generated. Nuclear energy had 
continued to play an important role as a means of diversification of energy sources, reduction in 
dependence on external power sources and control of greenhouse gas emissions. SpainÂs nuclear power 
plants had functioned safely and efficiently, with an average availability of 93%. The construction of a 
new storage facility for low-level radioactive waste had progressed. It would provide additional capacity 
and allow more rational management of low-level waste, including that from the dismantling of nuclear 
installations, or scrap that could not be treated as conventional waste. 
72. Spain had gained extensive experience from the dismantling of the VandellÃ³s I plant, which had 
now reached level 2 in the AgencyÂs classification. The site had been offered by her Government as a 
potential site for the ITER project. Also, ENRESA (National Radioactive Waste Company) had decided 
to establish a technology centre on the site to carry out future projects in collaboration with CIEMAT 
(Research Centre for Energy, Environment and Technology) and Spanish universities, including the 
dismantling of the JosÃ© Cabrera nuclear power plant, scheduled for 2006. All experience and know-how 
acquired would, of course, be shared with the Agency. 
73. Mr. KERIMOV (Azerbaijan) said that his country was actively involved in the international 
communityÂs efforts to strengthen the international safeguards regime. It supported universal nuclear 
disarmament and was party to all the main international treaties and agreements on the 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Caspian Sea region was acquiring increased 
significance on the worldÂs political map given its geographical location and energy resources. It was 
also particularly vulnerable to the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism. 
74. Azerbaijan had repeatedly called for a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the South Caucasus. 
Unfortunately, that was proving impossible owing to the policy of Armenia, which had committed 
armed aggression against Azerbaijan and occupied 20% of its territory. That had led to the creation of 
a zone not under the control of the Government of Azerbaijan and not subject to international 
verification mechanisms, thereby greatly increasing the risk of illegal movements of nuclear and 
radioactive material and their possible use for the purposes of terrorism. To prevent illicit trafficking 
in nuclear and radioactive material, Azerbaijan was cooperating closely with the Agency and had 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 11 

taken steps to train and equip border guards and customs officials. However, those actions would not 
be fully effective unless the occupied zone was liberated and control over the area re-established. 

75. The Agency was the only international forum able to counteract the threat of nuclear terrorism 
and it was essential to strengthen its activities in that domain. Member States had a responsibility to 
strengthen their national radiation safety infrastructures, improve control mechanisms, establish 
reliable physical protection systems and make inventories of nuclear and radioactive materials. The 
AgencyÂs role in providing assistance in that regard could not be overestimated. 
76. Azerbaijan welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to implement the action plan for nuclear security. 
The services it provided to help identify physical protection requirements, and to provide legislative 
assistance and staff training would clearly increase the capability of Member States in that area. The 
Agency should coordinate activities with Member States to ensure the effective use of available 
resources. The steps taken to assist Member States in strengthening their national infrastructures and 
in taking other necessary measures should be fully consistent with the priorities of the recipient States, 
and should include both recommendations and specific proposals for their implementation, including 
sources of funding. 
77. With regard to technical cooperation, he said that the Agency continued to provide assistance to 
Azerbaijan under the project launched in 2001 on upgrading the radiation protection infrastructure and 
safety of radioactive sources. Several expert missions had been carried out, and staff of the regulatory 
bodies had participated in a number of training sessions and seminars to improve their skills. The 
regulatory bodies had been restructured and a system had been established for the issuing of permits 
for the transport, import and use of radioactive materials. Azerbaijan was receiving assistance under 
three further Agency projects on the establishment of an INIS centre, the prevention of illicit 
trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials, and the upgrading of radiation oncology at the 
National Oncology Centre. The modernization of nuclear diagnostics and radiotherapy services was of 
particular importance in the health sector and Azerbaijan looked forward to cooperation with the 
Agency in that area. Raising radiation safety levels to comply with international standards, while 
meeting the urgent needs of the public, industry, agriculture and also protecting the environment, 
remained a priority. His GovernmentÂs aim was to introduce new methods, including nuclear 
techniques, to enhance the technological development of the country. 
78. A priority area for his countryÂs technical cooperation with the Agency was upgrading of the 
regulatory and legislative infrastructure. In that connection, a programme concerning radiation 
protection and radiation safety standards was currently being formulated. To improve cooperation with 
the Agency, a State Commission for Cooperation with the IAEA had been established comprising 
experts from various scientific and technical fields. 
79. Azerbaijan had paid its contributions to the Regular Budget in good time and had taken steps to 
pay its share of the TCF target. 
80. Given the need to intensify efforts regarding nuclear and radiation security and the growing 
threat of nuclear terrorism, it was hoped to establish a National Centre for Radiation and Nuclear 
Security at the Institute for Radiation Problems, for which support under the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme would be welcome. 
81. Detailed inventories were being taken of all the radioactive waste generated and issues such as 
its collection, processing, transport and storage were being addressed. The existing storage facilities 
were being modernized, and new ones for the long-term storage of radioactive materials were under 
construction. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 12 

82. The use of nuclear techniques for the protection, rehabilitation and monitoring of the 
environment was also a high priority. Contamination of the drinking water was a serious problem in 
Azerbaijan, not least because waste water from nuclear power plants in countries neighbouring 
Azerbaijan was being discharged into the Caspian Sea. The Agency should pay more attention to the 
radioactive contamination of water resources. 
83. Finally, he looked forward to closer cooperation with the Agency and all interested Member 
States in order to resolve all the issues he had mentioned with a view to strengthening peace and 
security in the region. 
84. Mr. SHANGULA (Namibia) said that Namibia profited greatly from Agency assistance under 
the AFRA regional projects and interregional projects, particularly in the areas of animal disease 
control, water resources management and human resources development. 
85. Efforts were currently being made to diagnose and eradicate livestock diseases in the northern 
part of Namibia, where 60% of the population lived. Since farming accounted for 28% of national 
income, the AgencyÂs role in expanding the diagnostic capacity of the Central Veterinary Laboratory 
was greatly appreciated. 
86. Namibia was a very arid country which was often hard hit by droughts. His delegation 
welcomed the AgencyÂs assistance in transferring technology to Namibia to enable it better to exploit 
the groundwater recharge and flow mechanism of the countryÂs aquifers. Greater knowledge would 
assist Namibia in its efforts to manage its groundwater resources and provide clean and safe water to 
its citizens. 
87. The Agency was actively involved in seawater desalination activities using nuclear power. His 
Government would consider the merits and viability of that technology for Namibia, 13% of whose 
population did not have access to safe drinking water. He hoped that NamibiaÂs cooperation with the 
Agency on water resource management would help reduce that figure significantly. 
88. His delegation was grateful for Agency help under the technical cooperation project on human 
resource development and nuclear technology support, which would strengthen national capacity and 
enhance the impact of current and future technical cooperation projects. 
89. His Government was exploring new areas of cooperation with the Agency to reduce and 
eradicate the armoured bush cricket and fruit flies, which caused damage to NamibiaÂs most important 
subsistence crops. His delegation was confident that, given the merit of the project proposals, the 
Agency would provide Namibia with the necessary technologies and resources. 
90. As in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, malaria placed a heavy burden on NamibiaÂs 
society and economy and accounted for a significant percentage of the countryÂs mortality, particularly 
in the north. His delegation called on the Agency to provide increased resources and to step up 
research into malaria control. The success of the SIT in alleviating the problem of tsetse infestation in 
parts of Africa was encouraging. The north-eastern parts of Namibia suffered greatly from diseases 
transmitted by tsetse flies, and he asked the Agency to expand its current tsetse fly campaign. 
91. His Government would like to see technical cooperation funding increased without diversion of 
financial resources to other projects within the AgencyÂs mandate, and it urged the donor community 
to support funding for technical cooperation projects. Namibia, for its part, would continue to honour 
its financial obligations towards the Agency. 
92. It was important not to overlook the importance of radiation, nuclear waste and transport safety. 
In that context, the model project on upgrading radiation protection infrastructure in Member States 
offered an effective mechanism for addressing common needs in meeting the principal requirements of 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 13 

the Basic Safety Standards. That project had had a significant impact on NamibiaÂs radiation 
protection infrastructure. He called for renewed commitment by the Agency to that project to enable 
Member States to attain its milestones. 

93. Namibia also attached great importance to the security of nuclear and radioactive material. It 
had stringent measures in place to control trafficking in radioactive sources and nuclear material. With 
the atomic energy and radiation protection authority bill at an advanced stage, those measures would 
soon be strengthened. 
94. Namibia was one of the largest uranium mining countries in the world, and it was important for 
it to safeguard against illicit trafficking in nuclear material. Following a recent attempt to traffic 
illicitly in uranium oxide, the culprits had been immediately arrested, and the law would take its full 
course. Namibia had an NPT safeguards agreement and had signed an additional protocol, and was 
keen to expedite its obligations under those agreements. Its additional protocol was expected to enter 
into force soon. In addition, a national system for nuclear materials accounting and control was being 
set up to support the legislative initiatives. 
95. His delegation welcomed the formation of the Advisory Group on Nuclear Security (AdSec) 
and would appreciate it if the Secretariat kept Member States regularly informed of its activities. 
96. Namibia was concerned at the under-representation of developing countries in the Secretariat. 
He called for increased efforts to recruit staff from developing countries, including women, that were 
not represented or under-represented. 
97. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland) said his country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
efforts to enhance the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The signing of additional protocols to 
safeguards agreements would help to build trust among States and adherence to them was mandatory 
under Article III of the NPT. Poland, which had ratified all international instruments under the 
non-proliferation regime, urged other States to fulfil their obligations in that area in advance of 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference. He expressed full support for the Final Declaration of the third 
Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT. The early entry into force of that Treaty, 
which Poland had ratified in 1999, would further strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
98. The events of 11 September 2001 had underlined the need for international cooperation to face 
common threats, including the possibility of nuclear terrorism. The Agency played a crucial role in 
planning and coordinating efforts to prevent nuclear material and radioactive sources being used in 
terrorist acts. Poland therefore considered that high priority should be given to further implementation 
of the AgencyÂs nuclear security plan of activities. In that context, it fully supported the proposed 
extension of the scope of the CPPNM to include the protection of such material in domestic use, 
storage and transport and protection against sabotage. He hoped that the diplomatic conference to 
amend the Convention would be convened as soon as possible. While Poland appreciated the 
establishment of the Nuclear Security Fund, it was unable to support it for the time being for 
budgetary reasons. However, it would do so in due course. 
99. Poland, which was party to the Nuclear Safety Convention and the Joint Convention, noted with 
satisfaction the increase in the number of signing and ratifying States. He trusted that the First Review 
Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention in November 2003 would prove as productive 
as the Second Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Nuclear Safety Convention in 2002. 
100. Noting the improved quality of the revised nuclear safety standards, he said that Poland would 
continue to support initiatives aimed at enhancing their application. Polish experts had assisted in 
revising the codes of conduct on the safety and security of radiation sources and on the safety of 
research reactors. Poland also welcomed progress in ensuring the safety of transport of radioactive 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 14 

material and the strengthening of the international response to nuclear and radiological emergency 
activities. The Agency also played an essential role in education and training for nuclear safety. 

101. In the current difficult socio-economic situation, nuclear and isotopic techniques could play a 
valuable and sometimes unique role in meeting basic human needs. Poland strongly supported the 
AgencyÂs technology development activities and its involvement in international projects on 
innovative nuclear reactors. It endorsed all Agency initiatives aimed at ensuring the availability of 
qualified manpower to sustain the current scientific and engineering level in nuclear technology. 
102. Poland had moved from being a purely recipient country under the technical cooperation 
programme to being a partner and even a donor, contributing within its region by means of TCDC. 
However, that did not mean that it no longer required assistance. An example of regional cooperation 
was that fuel for the further operation of the only Polish research reactor would soon be provided by 
the Russian Federation. Also, Polish training centres accepted many fellows and scientific visitors 
from the region. Indeed the technical cooperation planning and programming process in Europe, 
involving not only Member States but also the AgencyÂs technical divisions and potential donors, had 
been one of the most efficient, transparent and effective, even without a formal regional agreement. He 
commended the Europe Section of the Department of Technical Cooperation on its contribution to that 
process. 
103. He supported the AgencyÂs active collaboration with organizations within the United Nations 
system, regional organizations and other bodies to increase funding for footnote-a/ projects. He also 
shared the view that every opportunity should be taken to simplify procedures in order to facilitate 
cost-sharing or outsourcing. 
104. To ensure that the financing of technical cooperation activities was assured, sufficient and 
predictable, Member States should pledge and pay their share of the TCF target and their APCs on 
time and in full. Poland therefore strongly supported the due account principle. As usual, Poland 
intended to pledge and pay its target share. 
105. Poland supported the compromise proposal for the programme and budget for 2004Â2005. 
106. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile) said that his country, on signing an additional protocol to its 
safeguards agreement the previous year, had joined the growing number of States that recognized the 
AgencyÂs role in ensuring the reduction and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. At the same time, 
Member States should do more to convince public opinion of the benefits to be gained from the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, thereby strengthening the Agency and promoting peaceful research 
and development at country level. Chile had therefore proposed including an item on international 
cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the agenda of the Fourth Committee of the 
General Assembly. 
107. The Director General had successfully steered the Agency through a period of great 
international political tension. Chile was confident that the Agency would maintain that course, but 
Member States should resist the temptation to exploit the Agency for transitory political goals. 
108. Chile had signed the NPT and ratified the CTBT which, together with other instruments and 
regional bodies such as OPANAL in Latin America, were the cornerstones of the global disarmament 
regime. The members of OPANAL, including Chile, were due to meet in Havana in November 2003. 
109. The current scenario, characterized by proliferation and a qualitative increase in nuclear 
weapons, could be perceived as a flagrant violation of the principle of equality among States and an 
example of double standards. Some States could feel morally justified under the circumstances in 
developing or continuing to develop nuclear weapons. Such a state of affairs, when combined with 
political instability, could provide an incentive for terrorism. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 15 

110. States that possessed nuclear weapons thus bore a heavy responsibility for non-proliferation and 
the gradual elimination of their arsenal. Transparency was essential because action aimed at 
international confidence-building could easily be thwarted by suspicion. Multilateral action to that 
end, particularly by specialized agencies, should continue to create conditions in which human 
security, as a concept transcending national or international security, could be guaranteed. Multilateral 
cooperation was all the more important at a time when unilateral policies were undermining 
confidence among States, potentially generating or escalating conflicts. Sustainable 
confidence-building mechanisms based on transparent cooperative action were therefore essential. 
111. Chile hoped that the action envisaged at the recent International Conference on the Safety of 
Transport of Radioactive Material would be carried out in the manner outlined by the Director 
General. It attached special importance to the convening of a group of experts, in which Chile would 
participate, to examine the legal regime governing nuclear liability. 
112. The transport of nuclear material and radioactive waste should be brought within the scope of 
the predominant international law doctrine that characterized nuclear activities as ÂultrahazardousÂ on 
the basis of the Âabuse of rightÂ theory, a logical consequence of which was appropriate prior 
notification of such transport. The practice of some States and operators, which provided coastal States 
with advance notification and responded to queries regarding transport safety and their ability to react 
in an emergency, should be extended to all cases of transport and should ultimately form part of a 
global regime governing communications and liability in the event of accidents. The doctrine of 
liability for acts not prohibited by international law should be one of the building blocks of that 
regime. Moreover, as a confidence-building measure the principle of absolute liability should be 
applicable to damage caused by an accident during the transport of radioactive material. Chile was 
particularly concerned about the possible adverse impact of accidents on the health of coastal human 
populations and the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic marine environment, and also about the potential 
economic damage. 
113. In the area of technical cooperation, the Agency had responded to a decision by the Chilean 
President to set up an ad hoc committee on the red tide problem. In addition to the health risk from 
toxins contained in seafood, which was sometimes lethal, red tide also affected the Chilean economy 
because the commercial potential of large coastal areas could not be exploited and thousands of 
families who depended on fishing had been deprived of their livelihood. 
114. The Agency had also offered successful bilateral cooperation in projects agreed with Argentina 
and the Republic of Korea. 
115. The Latin-American section of the American Nuclear Society had held a symposium in Chile on 
the development of nuclear energy attended by experts from the region, the Agency and the United 
States Department of Energy. 
116. In the area of nuclear applications, fuel elements for research reactors, wholly designed and 
produced in Chile, had been certified at the Petten Energy Research Centre in the Netherlands. Now 
Chile could produce fuel independently for its two research reactors and become an international 
supplier. Also, in the past year Chile had acquired a cyclotron for the production of labelled glucose 
for medical diagnosis through positron emission tomography, creating new potential for nuclear 
medical applications and for basic and applied research. 
117. With regard to nuclear security and verification, Chile had offered to host a regional congress on 
nuclear security in conjunction with the Agency and the Economic Commission for Latin America and 
the Caribbean (ECLAC).

118. With an eye to the future, steps were being taken to train scientists and engineers in nuclear 
science and technology in Chile. 
119. Chile was pursuing activities using funding from the national budget and a World Bank loan 
aimed at, in the medium term, developing a knowledge-based economy based on strong links between 
research centres and industry. 
120. Mr. KANGAI (Zimbabwe) called on Member States both to cooperate fully with the Agency so 
that it could implement its statutory mandate and to allow it sufficient time to reach credible definitive 
conclusions in connection with its verification activities. 
121. Zimbabwe was in the process of finalizing a Country Programme Framework with the Agency 
which, it hoped, would further enhance the implementation of technical cooperation programmes in 
Zimbabwe for the period 2005Â2010 addressing immediate human needs with respect to health, 
agriculture, food and education. In the past some projects had not got off the ground because of lack of 
support or financial resources. 
122. A regulatory authority would soon be set up in Zimbabwe establishing an appropriate legal 
framework to facilitate the implementation of Agency projects and compliance with the requirements 
of the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards. 
123. He noted with satisfaction the number of experts from his country receiving training from the 
Agency. Zimbabwe was experiencing a high level of manpower attrition in the health sector, including 
nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. 
124. The Agency had been involved in a project with the University of Zimbabwe Medical School to 
improve medical services by introducing in vivo diagnostic procedures at the Parirenyatwa Group of 
Hospitals in Harare. It had also installed a new gamma camera, which would be of enormous benefit 
to cancer patients. He was grateful for Agency assistance in providing the Mpilo Hospital with a new 
cancer treatment planning system and hoped that the Agency would fund a gamma camera and more 
equipment for the Mpilo HospitalÂs Nuclear Medicine Department. Also, Agency assistance was 
sought in sourcing funds for the project on upgrading radiotherapy in Zimbabwe (Phase II), which had 
been placed in the footnote-a/ category. 
125. Zimbabwe appreciated the equipment, training and expert visits provided in connection with the 
development of isotope-aided molecular techniques for the early detection, treatment and control of 
the human papilloma virus, which caused cancer of the cervix. 
126. His Government was committed to the ongoing project on groundwater assessment in the 
Northern Matebeleland and had provided significant financial resources to enable borehole drilling to 
continue despite the withdrawal of the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). 
Zimbabwe would be working with the Secretariat to find much-needed technical and financial support. 
127. He thanked the Agency for its involvement in the development of biofertilizers for increased 
crop production and soil fertility. Although Zimbabwe had been hit by severe drought, the project had 
proved valuable to smallholders and had been expanded to include all provinces except Matebeleland. 
128. Zimbabwe was participating in the project on sustainable energy development in sub-Saharan 
Africa and hoped that appropriate plans for sustainability would be devised. It was also participating in 
a number of AFRA projects on the maintenance of medical and scientific instruments, strengthening 
of waste management infrastructure, the development of improved crop varieties, the improvement of 
clinical radiotherapy and tumour marker capabilities, and non-destructive testing. Through such 
projects, Zimbabwe was gleaning numerous benefits in the form of manpower development and 
equipment. 

GC(47)/OR.4

129. He commended the Agency on its sustained commitment to the expansion of tsetse-free zones 
using the SIT and encouraged it to build technical, strategic and financial partnerships in support of 
the PATTEC initiative. 
130. Malaria and tuberculosis were a major threat to human lives and he welcomed the support of the 
United States of America, Germany and France for Agency initiatives on use of the SIT in combating 
malaria. 
131. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that the commissioning of the two units at the Temelin 
nuclear power plant had remained a prominent theme in the area of nuclear energy in the Czech 
Republic in recent years. Both units were still in the trial operation phase and the next challenge was 
to switch to the standard operation mode, combining the highest possible standards of operational 
safety with adequate operational efficiency. The Temelin plant could not have been completed without 
broad international cooperation. Most of the vendors from more than ten countries had made 
significant safety improvements to the original project. Close cooperation between the Czech national 
regulatory authority, its partners in several countries and various international agencies had enabled 
independent peer reviews at different stages of the authorization process and a high level of 
transparency. She thanked the Agency for its prompt response to requests for a third-party peer 
review. Criticism from some quarters of an unfeasible Âmix of technologies and approachesÂ had 
eventually proved unjustified. All future projects should be based on a similar cooperative approach 
and the AgencyÂs potential in that regard should be used to the full. The Czech Republic was willing 
to contribute to such efforts and share its experience in the safe use of nuclear energy. 
132. With the aim of supporting technical cooperation among Member States, a number of Czech 
organizations and individual experts had contributed to the technical cooperation programme and other 
Agency-sponsored activities, and her Government had again provided extrabudgetary support. The 
Czech Republic had contributed money to four projects in countries of the former Soviet Union in 
2003: nuclear power plant safety in Armenia and Ukraine; radiation protection in medical applications 
in the Republic of Moldova; and safety of a research reactor in Uzbekistan. Also, her country had 
co-sponsored the training of more than 80 experts in radiation protection and waste safety, and had 
supported 7 Agency-organized training courses in the Czech Republic through in-kind contributions. 
133. In line with its long-term strategy of supporting concerted action on common problems, her 
country had contributed $40 000 to the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Fund. 
134. Earlier in 2003, the Czech Republic had joined the AgencyÂs safeguards support programme by 
signing a cooperative arrangement. A medium-term plan had identified areas in which the Czech 
Republic could join 16 other Member States in further enhancing the AgencyÂs safeguards system, 
thereby demonstrating its commitment to the global non-proliferation process. 
135. The Czech Republic had ratified the amendment to Article VI of the Statute in 2002 and urged 
all Member States that had not yet done so to speed up their ratification process in order to bring the 
amendment into force. She was prepared to support a General Conference resolution to that effect. 
136. Ms. ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia) said that, following the events of 11 September 2001, the world had 
been confronted with the threat of nuclear terrorism. That threat had affected all countries which 
cooperated together in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and had brought them closer together in 
their efforts to strengthen the international nuclear security regime. She was pleased that the 
international community was implementing the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme. 
137. Slovakia attached great importance to the ongoing review of the CPPNM and the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Despite the fact that the open-ended group 
of legal and technical experts, established to prepare a draft amendment aimed at strengthening the 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 18 

CPPNM, had concluded its work, agreement had not yet been reached on all clauses. She called on all 
States Parties to the CPPNM to work towards adoption of the amendment as soon as possible. 

138. The NPT constituted a firewall against nuclear terrorism and proliferation, and Slovakia 
believed that it should embrace the whole international community. All States that had not done so 
should accede to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon States and place their facilities under comprehensive 
safeguards agreements with the Agency. 
139. Slovakia supported the AgencyÂs programme on strengthening the effectiveness and improving 
the cost efficiency of the safeguards system. She welcomed the progress that had been made in the 
implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It was also 
encouraging that the framework for integrated safeguards continued to be developed and that 
integrated safeguards were being implemented in two Member States. Despite the SecretariatÂs great 
efforts, a significant number of States had still not concluded NPT safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols thereto. She urged them to do so without delay. 
140. Non-proliferation regimes and nuclear disarmament were an integral part of the CTBT. 
However, seven years after its opening for signature, the Treaty had still not entered into force. She 
called on all States which had not done so, to sign and ratify the CTBT so as to ensure its entry into 
force without further delay. 
141. All nuclear material and facilities in Slovakia were subject to the AgencyÂs full-scope 
safeguards. In addition, SlovakiaÂs nuclear regulatory authority performed regular inspections in 
accordance with the provisions of the national legislation. 
142. Slovakia considered the safe use of nuclear energy to be of the utmost importance. Regulators 
and operators exchanged experience and technical information on nuclear safety related matters in a 
number of forums. The Agency had an essential role to play in supporting those activities and making 
its services available to Member States. Slovakia welcomed Agency cooperation with other bodies 
within the United Nations, with institutions of the European Union and other international 
organizations, such as the OECDÂs Nuclear Energy Agency and WANO. It was the responsibility of 
the nuclear community to promote global nuclear safety and her country therefore supported the 
AgencyÂs activities aimed at globalizing nuclear safety through networking, integrating its safety 
evaluation activities and promoting adherence to international safety conventions. 
143. Nuclear energy remained an important source of energy in the medium term in SlovakiaÂs 
energy plan and currently accounted for 54% of national consumption. Safeguards and safety were 
important prerequisites for the use of nuclear energy in Slovakia. The nuclear regulatory authority was 
working to ensure that the operation of all nuclear installations in Slovakia was safe, reliable and in 
line with the relevant regulations and international good practices. Nuclear installation safety 
continued to be the subject of bilateral meetings with neighbouring States to discuss common issues 
and exchange experience. Those meetings had been beneficial and had helped to build confidence. 
144. Slovakia had invited the AgencyÂs IRRT to conduct a follow-up mission in November 2002. 
The mission report had contained valuable comments and suggestions, had identified some good 
practices, and had identified the need for improvements in the area of roles and responsibilities, 
staffing and financial resources of the regulatory body. The AgencyÂs expert services were an essential 
part of international cooperation and provided support to the national regulatory decision-making 
process. 
145. Her country was cooperating with the Agency on a number of national, regional and 
interregional technical cooperation projects. For Slovakia, which was an acceding country to the 
European Union, technical cooperation in such fields as nuclear safety, long-term nuclear power plant 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 19 

operation and decommissioning was an important source of information transfer and necessary for 
strong national development. There were other cooperation activities with the Agency in the area of 
nuclear applications, including a national project on radiochemical facilities for producing medical 
radionuclides. 

146. Her Government was also cooperating with the Agency to organize workshops for experts from 
all over the world. Slovak organizations would continue to accept fellows and scientific visitors 
sponsored by the Agency to share its broad experience in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As in 
previous years, Slovakia intended to contribute to the TCF. 
147. Finally, noting that Slovakia had already deposited its instrument of acceptance of the 
amendments to Articles VI and XIV A. of the Statute approved by consensus by the 43rd General 
Conference, she urged all Member States which had not done so to follow suit. 
148. Mr. VAPIREV (Bulgaria) said that the effectiveness of the non-proliferation regime depended 
on Member States fulfilling their safeguards commitments consistently and comprehensively, enabling 
the Agency to provide credible assurances in accordance with its mandate. Bulgaria had been one of 
the first countries to ratify an additional protocol to its NPT safeguards agreement and to submit an 
initial declaration as required. It had recently supported the decision on increased financing for 
safeguards. It was encouraging that by July 2003 a total of 74 Member States had signed an additional 
protocol and that 35 protocols had entered into force. However, it was necessary to intensify the 
process to ensure the effectiveness and credibility of the safeguards system. 
149. Bulgaria supported all measures taken by the Agency in Member States to prevent the 
acquisition and use of nuclear material and violent acts against nuclear facilities by terrorist groups. 
The integrated multi-track approach to planning and implementing the nuclear security plan was the 
right response to a complex issue. 
150. He welcomed the outcome of the International Conference on Advances in Destructive and 
Non-destructive Analysis for Environmental Monitoring and Nuclear Forensics and the International 
Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources. Bulgaria was interested in starting the diplomatic 
process to amend the CPPNM to strengthen its capacity to prevent unlawful trafficking or seizure of 
nuclear material and equipment. 
151. For the past 10 years the Kozloduy nuclear power plant had been providing between 40 
and 47% of BulgariaÂs annual electricity supply. Units 1 and 2 had been disconnected at the end of 
2002 and a decision on their decommissioning would be taken in the light of a comprehensive 
analysis. The Agency experts who conducted a safety review mission of Units 3 and 4 in June 2002 
had concluded that all problem areas of design and operational safety had been resolved in full 
compliance with the AgencyÂs safety standards and guides and sound international practice. In the first 
half of 2003, the Bulgarian nuclear regulatory agency had issued operating licences for Units 3 and 4 
for eight and ten years respectively. The European Union Working Party on Nuclear Safety had 
confirmed that Bulgaria had taken into consideration all recommendations contained in its report on 
nuclear safety in the context of European Union enlargement. A peer review of Units 3 and 4 would be 
undertaken prior to completion of the negotiations for accession to the Union. The terms of reference 
for that review included methodology requirements, assessment criteria and qualifications of experts. 
152. A programme for modernization of Kozloduy Units 5 and 6 had been initiated in 1993. Based 
on the safety issues and their ranking identified by the Agency for WWER-1000 model 320 nuclear 
power plants, it aimed to achieve a safety level comparable to international practice and lifetime 
extension of 15 to 20 years. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 20 

153. The decision to halt construction of BulgariaÂs second nuclear power plant at Belene in 1991 
had been overturned by a Council of Ministers decision in late 2002. A final decision on the future of 
the project would be taken in the light of feasibility studies on nuclear safety, radiation protection, 
environmental impact, physical protection, and radioactive waste and spent fuel management. 
154. He commended the Agency on the broad range of achievements recorded in the Annual Report 
for 2002, especially with respect to the nuclear safety regime and the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the technical cooperation programme. Bulgaria was grateful for the AgencyÂs assistance in upgrading 
the safety of its nuclear facilities, developing and applying new nuclear energy technologies and 
enhancing the capabilities of the Bulgarian nuclear safety authority. 
155. A new act on the safe use of nuclear energy had entered into force in Bulgaria in July 2002, 
establishing the Nuclear Regulatory Agency. At the request of his countryÂs authorities, an Agency 
IRRT mission had been conducted in June 2003. It had been concluded that Bulgaria had now 
established an effective regulatory framework, laying the basis for independence and minimizing the 
potential for political interference. The staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Agency were described as 
experienced and competent. 
156. Bulgaria participated actively in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, giving high 
priority to projects related to nuclear power and nuclear safety. With financial support from the 
Agency, Bulgarian scientists and specialists attended international conferences, symposia and 
seminars. Bulgarian research institutes and laboratories took part in the AgencyÂs research programme 
and contributed to the implementation of coordinated research projects. 
157. Expressing support for the proposed budget for 2004, he said that Bulgaria, despite considerable 
financial difficulties, had met in full its financial obligations to the Regular Budget for 2002 as well as 
its pledged voluntary contribution to the TCF and APCs. In addition, it had contributed extrabudgetary 
funds to INPRO and to a project on safety aspects of the long-term operation of pressurized water 
reactors. It was prepared to provide experts to assist in the implementation of the latter project. 
158. BulgariaÂs voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2004 would be $10 000. 
159. Mr. WALTHER (Norway) said the NPT, which was the cornerstone of collective security, was 
facing serious challenges. He called on the DPRK not to withdraw from the NPT, to comply with its 
obligations thereunder and to cooperate unconditionally with the Agency. 
160. Also, the Agency should be allowed to complete its work in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as the 
Board of Governors had stressed in its resolution adopted the previous week (document 
GOV/2003/69). Iran should sign and implement an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement as 
soon as possible to demonstrate its peaceful intentions and its commitment to nuclear 
non-proliferation. He noted with satisfaction from the Director GeneralÂs most recent statement to the 
Board of Governors that Iran now seemed prepared to work more closely with the Agency.2 
161. A strengthened Agency safeguards system was an essential part of the multilateral 
non-proliferation regime, and must be properly funded. A key message from the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference should be that any country seeking to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes should 
implement fully a comprehensive safeguards agreement with an additional protocol. 
162. Norway had been the second Member State, after Australia, to apply integrated safeguards. He 
was pleased to see that Indonesia had now become the third and he urged others to follow suit. 
See document GOV/OR.1075, para. 26. 


GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 21 

Australia and Norway were establishing a bilateral programme to improve the implementation of both 
traditional and integrated safeguards. 

163. Export controls were crucial to non-proliferation efforts and his country had therefore 
strengthened its national export control system as an important means of preventing terrorists from 
acquiring sensitive nuclear materials or technology. 
164. Nuclear safety was an integral part of the fight against terrorism and the spread of weapons of 
mass destruction. The concentration of nuclear installations in the north-west of the Russian 
Federation was greater than anywhere else in the world. Since 1995, Norway had contributed 
over $100 million to help the Russian Federation secure its nuclear waste and spent fuel. Norway had 
joined the Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, set 
up by the G-8 countries. It was also a donor in the Multilateral Nuclear Environment Programme in 
the Russian Federation (MNEPR), a multilateral framework for assistance to nuclear safety projects in 
that country. Coordinated action through the AgencyÂs CEG and other bodies should allow an efficient 
division of labour between donors in order to face the enormous environmental and non-proliferation 
challenges. A high priority was the dismantling of decommissioned Russian nuclear submarines. 
Norway had already financed the dismantling of two submarines and hoped that other countries would 
support those efforts. 
165. His country fully supported the conclusions of the International Conference on Security of 
Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna in March 2003, and commended the AgencyÂs efforts to promote 
the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
166. Norway likewise supported the AgencyÂs action plan to combat nuclear terrorism and had 
contributed $60 000 to the subprogramme on nuclear and radiation emergencies. Member States 
should take steps at a national level to keep their nuclear and radioactive materials secure and to be 
prepared to respond to emergencies. 
167. He welcomed the establishment of the National Competent AuthoritiesÂ Coordinating Group 
(NCACG)3, chaired by Norway, and the decision to develop an action plan to enhance international 
nuclear and radiological emergency preparedness and response systems, to which he hoped all 
Member States would contribute. 
168. Norway supported efforts to strengthen the CPPNM and welcomed the Austrian initiative to 
amend the Convention. He commended the Agency for its work to develop the IPPAS, which would 
help to improve international regulatory approaches and standards. An IPPAS team would shortly visit 
Norway to evaluate its physical protection systems. To facilitate further work on security and physical 
protection, Norway intended to make a voluntary contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
169. Many States, especially coastal States, were concerned about the potential dangers of the 
maritime transport of radioactive materials. Efforts should be made to improve the relevant 
international regulations and more effective enforcement of them. Also, all States should accede to the 
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International Convention for the Prevention of 
Pollution from Ships (MARPOL Convention), the International Convention for the Safety of Life at 
Sea (SOLAS Convention), and adopt the AgencyÂs Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive 
Material. His country supported the conclusions of the International Conference on the Safety of 
Transport of Radioactive Material, held in Vienna in July 2003. Increased international cooperation 
was needed in accident emergency planning to ensure rapid containment of damage and to ensure 
See document GC(47)/INF/4. 


GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 22 

public safety. Norway was in favour of a liability regime that would help to cover the costs of dealing 
with nuclear accidents. 

170. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs emphasis on sustainable development and environmental 
protection, and looked forward to the International Conference on the Protection of the Environment 
from the Effects of Ionizing Radiation, to be held in Stockholm in October 2003. 
171. His country was in favour of a substantial increase in the AgencyÂs Regular Budget, ensuring 
continuation of the AgencyÂs core programmes and reducing dependency on extrabudgetary funding. 
He urged all Member States to pay their share of the TCF target in full and on time. 
172. Mr. STRITAR (Slovenia) said his country attached the utmost importance to nuclear safety and 
to the work of the Agency in that field. It was worth noting that the European Union was discussing 
Council Directives on basic obligations and general principles on the safety of nuclear installations, 
and on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. The concept of common safety 
standards was a key element. 
173. As a country with only one nuclear power plant and a limited number of other nuclear facilities, 
Slovenia supported Agency initiatives aimed at the preservation and better management of nuclear 
knowledge. 
174. Slovenia continued to need the AgencyÂs advisory and review services on nuclear safety. The 
third OSART mission to the KrÂko nuclear power plant was scheduled for 20 October to 6 November 
2003. 
175. In May, Slovenia had submitted its first report under the Joint Convention. Slovenia trusted that 
the First Review Meeting of Contracting Parties under that Convention would be conducted in the 
same productive spirit as the previous two under the Nuclear Safety Convention. 
176. Slovenia was grateful to the Agency for the technical assistance it had provided in the field of 
radiation safety under a model project on upgrading radiation safety infrastructure, as well as through 
activities related to the safe transport of radioactive materials, occupational radiation protection and 
radiological protection of patients. The revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources provided the basis for significantly better control of radioactive sources and for 
improving their safety and security. The Agency had launched commendable initiatives to promote 
emergency preparedness and response capabilities among Member States. Earlier in the year Slovenia 
had applied for membership of the ERNET and had appointed four standby emergency response teams 
at the Josef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. 
177. Verification and security of nuclear and other radioactive materials was another issue of great 
importance and his country had repeatedly stressed its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and the NPT. Slovenia was already implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement and 
additional protocol. Unfortunately, only 35 such protocols were in force, a number that was still well 
below expectations. It was regrettable that the Agency was still unable to verify the correctness and 
completeness of the DPRKÂs initial declaration of nuclear material. The reporting obligations under 
safeguards agreements must be met in order to preserve the safeguards regime and provide the 
international community with the credible assurance of the non-diversion of nuclear material and the 
absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities. Slovenia fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts 
to resolve all outstanding issues with the Islamic Republic of Iran as soon as possible. In relation to 
Iraq, his country was pleased that the Security Council had expressed its intention to revisit the 
mandates of the Agency and UNMOVIC, and that the Agency remained ready to resume its 
verification activities. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 23 

178. Over the past year the AgencyÂs activities relating to protection against nuclear terrorism had 
been significant. They included the establishment of the Advisory Group on Nuclear Security 
(AdSec), organization of design basis threat workshops, and expansion of the use of the Illicit 
Trafficking Database. His delegation endorsed the recommendations made in Vienna in March at the 
International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources to revise the action plan for safety and 
security of radioactive sources and believed that the proposed activities had been prioritized correctly 
to ensure the long-term security and control of such sources. 
179. He reiterated SloveniaÂs support of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. Greater efforts 
needed to be made by the Member States to ensure adequate funding for the technical cooperation 
programme and he appealed to all Member States to pay their contributions in full and on time. As in 
the past, Slovenia had pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2004, and it had met its financial 
obligations with regard to the TCF and the Regular Budget for 2003. 
180. Mr. MÃRQUEZ MARÃN (Venezuela) said that, as a developing country, Venezuela favoured 
careful selection of an energy mix based on available resources. In Venezuela, 75% of the electricity 
generated came from hydroelectric sources. For nuclear energy to make a greater contribution to 
electricity operation in the future, it would be necessary to address its implicit operational and 
developmental risks, and decrease the enormous costs of constructing, maintaining and operating 
reactors as well as of training a qualified workforce. For those reasons, Venezuela would prefer to see 
the development of new technologies Â not necessarily nuclear Â that were more accessible to 
developing countries, as well as sustainable and environmentally friendly. 
181. On the other hand, there was vast scope for nuclear applications in many sectors of the 
economy, where they often provided the best or even the only solution to a specific problem. 
Venezuela therefore attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. 
VenezuelaÂs national development plans aimed at improving the standard of living for its people. It 
endorsed the AgencyÂs view that projects should have clear governmental support and produce 
tangible results. Venezuela had submitted to the Agency a list of proposed projects for the biennium 
2005Â2006 in a number of sectors including human health, protection of the environment, training of 
human resources, mineral prospecting, the oil industry, animal production and the maintenance and 
development of nuclear instruments. All had been given a high priority in the national development 
programme and complied with the AgencyÂs core criteria. 
182. Given the current international situation, another important role of the Agency was its 
verification of disarmament and non-proliferation treaties. Each State should do all it could to 
strengthen those treaties. In addition, Venezuela was convinced that early entry into force of the CTBT 
would provide the international community with a greater degree of security. 
183. His country was deeply concerned by doctrines justifying the development of a new generation 
of limited-range nuclear weapons. That would very probably lead to a new arms race, or damage the 
international disarmament regime. 
184. Finally, regarding the resolution recently adopted by the Board of Governors on implementation 
of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran, contained in document 
GOV/2003/69, he said that the solution to the problem lay in a detailed technical analysis that only the 
Agency could carry out in a sufficiently neutral and non-political manner. His delegation was 
concerned that the resolution set unrealistic deadlines with potentially counterproductive 
consequences. He urged Iran to accelerate its cooperation with the Agency and rectify any errors or 
omissions that had caused doubts to be raised by the international community. 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 24 

185. Mr. SOURGHIA (Niger), having thanked the Agency for the assistance it had given to his 
country, said that Niger was firmly committed to the AgencyÂs objectives and would make every effort 
to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
186. Progress with respect to disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation, safeguards and the safety and 
security of nuclear installations would greatly reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism and the illicit 
trafficking of nuclear material and radiation sources. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the 
international non-proliferation regime, and he hoped that international community would continue to 
work towards the achievement of all the TreatyÂs objectives. 
187. Niger welcomed the AgencyÂs activities to promote sustainable development and the peaceful 
use of nuclear techniques in areas such as human and animal health, protection of the environment, 
and food and agriculture. His country was particularly grateful to the Agency for the technical 
assistance it had received in the fields of radiation and waste safety, human health, nuclear medicine, 
animal health and production, and nuclear sciences and applications. Thanks to the Agency, nuclear 
medicine had become a reality in Niger. His country now had a radioimmunoassay laboratory and a 
gamma camera for cancer diagnosis. 
188. NigerÂs Country Programme Framework had almost reached completion. Under it, technical 
cooperation activities would correspond to the national strategy to combat poverty, the main aspects of 
which were education, health, water and purification, population growth and the strengthening of 
capacities. 
189. Like many other countries in Africa, Niger suffered from a cruel shortage of renewable water 
resources. It was therefore grateful for Agency assistance under the regional project to combat 
desertification in the Sahel. 
190. He looked forward to increased Agency involvement in the use of nuclear techniques to help 
deal with communicable diseases, particularly the HIV/AIDS virus. 
191. His GovernmentÂs priority in the area of human health was to provide palliative and curative 
treatment for cancer patients. Niger had an infrastructure for diagnosis, had developed in vitro and was 
in the process of establishing an in vivo nuclear medicine service in Niamey. According to WHO 
estimates, more than 8000 new cases of cancer per year would be diagnosed in Niger by 2005. While 
some types of cancer, such as cervical and breast cancer, could be treated in Niger others had to be 
referred to hospitals abroad, an often prohibitively costly exercise. If a radiotherapy centre were 
established in Niger, two-thirds of new cancer patients could be treated. His Government planned to 
build such a centre, recruit staff and allocate an operating budget which provided for replacement of 
the cobalt source and for the necessary radiopharmaceutical products and consumables. He called on 
countries to contribute to the construction of the centre within the framework of bilateral cooperation. 
A cancer reference centre in the subregion was also needed. The fact that there was already a 
radioprotection service in operation in Niger meant that it would be feasible to establish a cancer 
management and treatment programme in the country in the near future. 
192. Mr. DE ESTEBAN (European Commission) endorsed efforts to establish the euro as the 
AgencyÂs functional currency. During the previous year, the CommissionÂs Green Paper on the 
security of energy supply had become firmly anchored in its energy policy. World events had 
underscored its importance for both national and international security. The volatility of the oil 
markets, predicted by some in the wake of the Iraq war, had been averted to some extent by the 
CommissionÂs active participation in the ongoing dialogue with oil and gas producers. 
193. Since the previous session of the General Conference, the Council of Ministers had adopted a 
Directive on the energy performance of buildings, a new programme entitled Intelligent energy for 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 25 

Europe and a package for promoting the use of biofuels in transport. The Sixth Framework 
Programme for Research and Technical Development, adopted in 2002, would help develop new, 
cleaner nuclear and non-nuclear energy options. Also, work was progressing satisfactorily on two 
important packages to improve the security of oil and gas supplies and safety in the nuclear sector. 
Euratom was vigilant with regard to the security of nuclear fuel supplies. Given the time it took for 
additional uranium resources to reach the market, the European Union nuclear power industry had 
been advised to maintain an adequate level of strategic inventories and diversify the origin of their 
main suppliers. 

194. The Commission had adopted two Directive proposals, one setting out the basic obligations and 
general principles for the safety of nuclear installations, and the other, for the management of spent 
fuel and radioactive waste. Their legal bases were the Euratom Treaty, the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety and the Joint Convention. The first Directive proposal on nuclear safety would be compatible 
with, and build on, the international nuclear safety framework and would make the international 
conventions binding under Community law. National safety authorities would ensure the systemÂs 
credibility. It also aimed to ensure that adequate resources were available to cover all 
decommissioning operations and waste management. 
195. The second Directive proposal was based on the CommissionÂs conviction that the safest and 
most lasting option for long-lived high level radioactive waste was burial in geological formations. 
Under it, Member States were obliged to launch, and report regularly on, detailed programmes for the 
management of all radioactive waste under their jurisdiction. It also encouraged research on waste 
management and better coordination of activities. The two Directives, which should enter into force by 
May 2004, would ensure enhanced nuclear safety in the enlarged European Union and fair competition 
on the internal power market. 
196. The Commission still financed research on the transport of radioactive material to enable 
Member States to constantly upgrade their regulations, many of which had served the Agency in the 
revision of its regulations. The Commission and national experts had successfully collaborated with 
the Agency on the preparation of transport guidelines in the application of INES and looked forward to 
their imminent inclusion in Agency recommendations. The Commission was also working with 
European Union member countries on more harmonious enforcement of the regulations on their 
territory. It encouraged the Agency to pursue its development of a forum to consider such matters 
outside TRANSSC. 
197. Once the acceding countries became members of the European Union, most of the 24 nuclear 
reactors currently operating there would become part of the UnionÂs enlarged nuclear capacity, so 
nuclear safety was an important issue in accession talks. Following the 2001 and 2002 safety 
assessments of acceding countries nuclear facilities, it had been agreed that 6 units, which did not meet 
the required safety standards, would be closed down between 2005 and 2009, while other reactors 
could be brought up to European Union standard. The Commission was closely monitoring how the 
acceding countries applied the European Union recommendations. The Phare programme had 
contributed immensely to improving the nuclear safety of the acceding countries, the accent being 
placed on institutional strengthening to ensure the efficiency and independence of the nuclear 
regulatory authorities, and on radioactive waste management. The European Union was the main 
contributor to the three international decommissioning support funds to help Bulgaria, Lithuania and 
Slovakia, which were already closing down some of their nuclear reactors. 
198. Over the years, under the Tacis programme, the European Union had allocated 900 million 
euros for improving nuclear safety in the Russian Federation and the Newly Independent States. The 
main priorities were to promote a genuine culture of nuclear safety, management of spent fuel, 
decommissioning and management of nuclear waste, and participation in international initiatives such 

GC(47)/OR.4 
16 September 2003, Page 26 

as that for the closure of the Chernobyl plant. In that regard, close cooperation with the Agency and 
other international donors had been much appreciated. 

199. Where safeguards were concerned, close collaboration between the Commission and the 
Agency was crucial to stability at a time when the latter was facing huge challenges. Despite the fact 
that the CommissionÂs safeguards were still being modified to take account of changing requirements 
for an enlarged European Union and to move towards a regional system similar to the AgencyÂs 
international safeguards system, the Commission had pledged to honour its commitments. Once the 
changes were completed, it would study with the Agency the implications for their continued close 
cooperation. It was preparing for the implementation of additional protocols in the European Union; in 
liaison with the Agency, it had put in place all the modalities for prompt ratification and 
implementation. 
200. Regarding radiation protection, European legislation contained strict rules for the general public 
and for workers. The Commission supervised the alignment of domestic laws with the European 
provisions. The Commission, sharing international concerns over radioactive sources not under 
regulatory control and the need for greater security and safety in the management of radioactive 
sources, had submitted to the Council a Directive proposal on the safe management of high-activity 
sealed sources, supplementing existing legislation with a view to harmonizing and strengthening 
member countriesÂ controls. By increasing traceability, it hoped to reduce the risk of criminal 
diversion of radioactive sources. 
201. Joint research by institutes in Europe was vital for the safe operation of nuclear reactors. During 
the Fifth Framework Programme for 1998Â2002, the European Union had supported over 200 
projects. For the Sixth, 2002Â2006, it planned to support further nuclear research to improve nuclear 
safety, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. All R&D activities in the area of 
nuclear fusion in member countries and certain associated countries had been integrated in a single 
European programme. 
202. The Commission had always supported international cooperation on nuclear matters. The 
European Union had concluded bilateral agreements with a number of Agency Member States and was 
negotiating with many others. Talks were under way for implementation of the ITER project to discuss 
such topics as site location, cost-sharing, management, personnel, and privileges and immunities. He 
hoped that the Agency would continue to lend its strong support to that project. 
203. In conclusion, he said that the European Commission looked forward to strengthening its 
cooperation with the Agency in a number of areas of common concern. 
The meeting rose at 7.25 p.m.

6. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (continued) 
(GC(47)/2) 
1. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) said that, at a time when the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and 
the AgencyÂs resources were being stressed to the limit, his country continued to give the organization 
its firm support. The Agency had never been needed by the international community as much as it was 
at present. 
2. For more than a decade the world had been undergoing major changes and the dust stirred up by 
the end of the Cold War had still not settled. Some things, however, remained unchanged. Most 
notably, the nuclear-weapon States were still unwilling to meet their undertakings under Article VI of 
the NPT. Thus, ironically, those who had been advocating that increased human, technical and 
financial resources be devoted to preventing and combating the proliferation of nuclear weapons were 
themselves clinging indefinitely to their nuclear arsenals. Some had even been seeking pretexts to lend 
new legitimacy to nuclear weapons. 
3. Until recently, nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon technology had been possessed by only a 
very few States. They had been perceived by that elite group as a stabilizing factor that maintained the 
balance between the two poles of the then world order. With the end of the Cold War, weapons of 
mass destruction and, in particular, nuclear weapons no longer constituted a stabilizing factor. 
4. Quite apart from such sophisticated weapons, the public had now become conscious of the 
threat that could be posed by a small canister containing radioactive material in reckless hands, or by 
the smuggling of a small quantity of enriched uranium. Nuclear weapons had proved useless in the 
fight against terrorism. 
5. In addition, all attempts to restrict the possession of such weapons to a limited number of States 
had only led to more States clandestinely seeking to acquire them. Thus, while the nuclear-weapon 
States had been devoting massive resources to maintaining thousands of nuclear weapons which it was 
hoped would never be used, aspiring nuclear-weapon States had been depriving their people of badly 
needed resources in their attempts to acquire such weapons. 
6. Twelve years had passed since agreement had been reached at the General Conference on the 
need for all States in the Middle East to accept Agency safeguards on all their nuclear installations and 
activities. Regrettably, that goal had not yet been achieved. While Egypt had expanded its efforts to rid 
the region of nuclear weapons, Israel and the international community had remained indifferent to the 
matter. While the mere suspicion of nuclear programmes in Iraq, Iran and North Korea aroused 
concern and condemnation, there seemed to be little interest in IsraelÂs nuclear activities. As long as 
such double standards continued to be applied, and the regionÂs political problems and security issues 
remained unresolved, more countries would seek to redress the military imbalance in the region by 
acquiring weapons of mass destruction. 
7. True and lasting security could only come through peace based on justice and respect for 
national identities and aspirations. The Middle East needed a security system based on just and mutual 
commitments that met the legitimate security concerns of all parties in a balanced and 
non-discriminatory manner and that provided equal security to all. Egypt had been and would continue 
to be at the forefront of efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region, including the establishment 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 2 

of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. However, in the absence of an equally strong commitment on the part 
of all States in the region, those efforts could well prove vain. 

8. The level of Agency technical cooperation with Member States, a mechanism provided for 
under Article IV of the NPT, fell short of expectations. While the blame for that situation had to be 
shared by Member States, there had been a significant degree of reluctance to promote peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy owing to the fear that the know-how thus acquired might be used for 
non-peaceful purposes. Given the potential of those applications, that situation should not be allowed 
to continue. 
9. For more than forty years, Egypt had been cooperating closely with the Agency to expand the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the country. It had been working to strengthen and modernize its 
nuclear infrastructure, had commissioned its second 22 MW research reactor, had received assistance 
from IAEA-funded experts to raise the reactorÂs efficiency, and had been working towards the optimal 
utilization of the cyclotron facility set up in cooperation with the Russian Federation to produce 
medical isotopes for use in medicine. 
10. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to develop and improve the technical cooperation 
programme and supported the concepts of partnership in development and self-reliance, and the 
emphasis on projects which brought tangible benefits for end-users. 
11. In its own cooperation programme with the Agency, it had concentrated on those kinds of 
projects and had placed emphasis on the establishment of laboratories for performing radiation 
measurements and hydrological surveys employing radioisotopes. The work of those laboratories 
extended to other Arab and African countries. Egypt had also been cooperating with the Agency in the 
areas of isotope production, irradiation of food and medical instruments, the production of hydrogen 
for use in medicine, the development of nuclear and environmental monitoring equipment, agriculture 
and the development of desert areas, the inspection skills of the regulatory authority and the detection 
of landmines using nuclear techniques. However, the goals of the technical cooperation programme 
could not be achieved as long as some countries continued not to fulfil their financial obligations 
towards the TCF. 
12. Egypt was looking forward to the 2005 NPT Review Conference which should provide an 
opportunity for States to reaffirm their commitment to the NPT as the cornerstone of the global 
nuclear non-proliferation regime, and to both nuclear disarmament on the one hand and the promotion 
of the peaceful uses of atomic energy on the other. It hoped that States would renew their commitment 
to the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide, and in particular in the Middle East region. 
13. Finally, his country continued to support the pivotal role played by the Agency in such areas as 
the peaceful use of nuclear technology, nuclear safety and the provision of assurances through 
verification activities that nuclear material was only being used for peaceful purposes. 
14. Ms. HALL (Canada) said that events over the preceding twelve months had shown that, while 
new threats might appear, old ones did not necessarily disappear. It was thus of paramount importance 
that the international community, with the support of the Agency, did everything possible to prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons which remained the most serious threat to international peace and 
security. It had to be made clear to potential proliferators that there would be zero tolerance for 
non-compliance with international non-proliferation norms and obligations. The Agency and its 
Member States should be flexible and innovative in adapting to a new and complex reality. The 
historic budget before General Conference showed that the Member States were able to adapt to a 
changing international environment and set clear priorities. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 3 

15. One serious challenge facing the Agency was the situation in the DPRK. While Canada 
supported the resumption of multilateral talks, it remained deeply concerned about that countryÂs long 
record of failure and its flagrant violations of its legal obligations and international non-proliferation 
norms. 
16. The DPRKÂs commitments under its safeguards agreement had remained unfulfilled for many 
years and, in October 2002, it had revealed that it had also engaged in further undeclared clandestine 
uranium enrichment activities for nuclear weapons purposes in direct contravention of its NPT 
obligations. The reaction of the international community would set the standard for the future. An 
inability to respond effectively to such blatant examples of non-compliance would not be lost on other 
potential proliferators. Member States should give their full support to the Agency in its efforts to 
verify effectively StatesÂ compliance with their safeguards obligations and resolve questions of 
non-compliance. 
17. Canada was also concerned about the scope and nature of IranÂs nuclear programme which was 
a potential serious threat to international peace and security. The resolution unanimously adopted by 
the Board in the preceding week had sent a firm, clear signal to Iran and to the world and had 
demonstrated that the concerns over IranÂs nuclear programme were well founded and broadly shared. 
That kind of decisive and united action was important for maintaining the AgencyÂs credibility and 
relevance. Her country urged Iran to conclude an additional protocol promptly and without 
preconditions, and to implement it as a clear indication of its genuine commitment to nuclear 
non-proliferation. Continued failure to do so would necessarily result in the Agency referring the 
matter promptly to the Security Council. 
18. Canada supported the AgencyÂs activities in Iraq mandated by the Security Council and 
regretted that the Agency had not been able to fulfil its mandate prior to the start of hostilities. It 
welcomed the Security CouncilÂs intention to revisit the mandates of the Agency and UNMOVIC and 
looked forward to the early return of Agency inspectors. 
19. It continued to be concerned that India, Israel and Pakistan remained outside the NPT, and it 
urged those countries to join the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States unconditionally and without 
delay. That was an essential requirement for the continued sustainability of the multilateral nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and for full membership in the international community. 
20. Over the preceding year, Canada had been closely involved in the work on the AgencyÂs 
programme and budget for the next biennium. While most of the proposed budget increase was rightly 
intended to meet the Director GeneralÂs request for additional resources for safeguards and verification 
activities, almost US $6 million had also been allocated to other areas of the AgencyÂs programme 
which her country believed should have been subject to zero nominal growth. Furthermore, 
only $280 000 had been added for the management of the AgencyÂs nuclear security activities to assist 
the Secretariat in the implementation of the nuclear security action plan. That programme should be 
included in the AgencyÂs Regular Budget. The continuing trend towards increasing reliance on 
extrabudgetary contributions might be unsustainable in the long term. Canada would be contributing 
an additional $2.9 million to the AgencyÂs security activities, making it the second largest contributor 
to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
21. Her country applauded the fact that the development and implementation of integrated 
safeguards remained a prime focus of the Agency and it encouraged the Agency to proceed in a timely 
fashion with the application of integrated safeguards in those Member States with an additional 
protocol. The additional resources for safeguards and verification included in the 2004Â2005 
programme and budget should help the Agency determine how to develop and deploy its tools and 
resources to address more effectively the most serious threats to non-proliferation as part of an 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 4 

appropriately mandated review of safeguards. During the discussions on the programme and budget, 
her country had seen the proposed budget increases in Major Programme 4 as a timely opportunity to 
review safeguards working methods and criteria in order to enhance the flexibility, credibility and 
effectiveness of the safeguards system. Additional resources for safeguards should translate into better 
safeguards, not just more. Canada would have serious concerns if, as a result of the substantial 
increase in the safeguards budget, safeguards activities were to increase significantly in Canada or 
other countries where there was full transparency. Thus, the forthcoming review should focus on the 
technical and conceptual aspects of safeguards and verification and should explore and recommend 
ways for the Agency to ensure that it was doing the right things in the right places. Canada welcomed 
the Director GeneralÂs recent request to SAGSI to undertake that vital task. 

22. Canada had always been a staunch supporter of an international rules-based approach to 
addressing threats to international peace and security. However, while it was of the utmost importance 
for the international community to continue to strive towards universal adherence to the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, Member States had to realize that the signing and ratification of international 
legal instruments alone was not sufficient to ensure the benefits that came with those commitments. 
Effective implementation, total compliance, full transparency and a strong and sustained political 
commitment to non-proliferation were also essential for States to have full access to peaceful nuclear 
cooperation. Thus, the Agency had to be fully equipped to fulfil its mandate under Article III of the 
NPT if Member States were to share the benefits of Article IV. In that regard, it was important to 
move quickly to make acceptance of the additional protocol a key requirement for new nuclear supply 
to non-nuclear-weapon States, and it was time to consider the need for additional verification 
measures in instances where concerns had arisen about certain proliferation-sensitive nuclear 
activities. 
23. The AgencyÂs safety standards should be the international reference standard in the area of 
nuclear and radiation safety. They already served that purpose in CanadaÂs regulatory programmes and 
they should be incorporated or used as much as possible in the legislation, regulations and standards of 
Member States. Safety was a necessary and important precondition for the sustained use of nuclear 
technology for peaceful purposes. CanadaÂs national report for the first review meeting under the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management had been submitted to the Agency and it hoped that that meeting would be instrumental 
in advancing nuclear safety worldwide. She urged Member States which had not yet done so to 
promptly sign and ratify the Joint Convention. 
24. As a firm supporter of the use of nuclear power and nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes, 
her country believed that the Agency should play a vital role in helping facilitate international 
cooperation and promote international awareness of the many promising benefits of existing and new 
innovative nuclear technologies. Innovation was a requirement for the future of nuclear power and 
Canada looked forward to ongoing progress in both the INPRO and Generation IV initiatives. She 
stressed the need for beneficial collaboration between those projects. 
25. Her country welcomed the successful completion of the third Qinshan nuclear power plant in 
China. Those two CANDU units had entered into service within the original budget and significantly 
ahead of schedule thanks to the hard work and dedication of all parties involved, especially in China. 
26. As a world leader in the production of radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes, 
Canada was committed to seeing those beneficial applications of nuclear technology promoted through 
the Agency in those countries which could most benefit from them.

27. It also continued to believe that nuclear knowledge management remained a high-priority 
international issue and it planned to introduce a follow-up resolution on nuclear knowledge which it 
hoped would enjoy as much support as the previous one in 2002, if not more. 
28. Mr. KAKODKAR (India) said that, although the world had made impressive strides in 
increasing the share of nuclear electricity in total electricity production and in expanding 
non-electricity applications of nuclear technology, the barriers to increased use of nuclear technology 
for the benefit of the larger part of humanity were yet to be addressed. Unless action was taken soon, 
the threat to the global climate and the tensions stemming from inequality could assume unmanageable 
proportions. 
29. He welcomed the fact that the Agency was giving due attention to the new threat of malevolent 
use of nuclear and radioactive material by unscrupulous and terrorist elements. India had recently held 
an international training course on security of nuclear installations in cooperation with the Agency. 
The feedback had been encouraging and it could serve as a model course. India was prepared to run 
more such courses on a regular basis. 
30. Welcoming the G-8 statement on the safety and security of radioactive sources, he noted that 
India had actively participated in the discussions on the amendment of the AgencyÂs code of conduct 
on that issue and had put in place an adequate legislative and regulatory infrastructure to achieve the 
objectives of the code of conduct. 
31. Within about four years, India would have an installed generating capacity of 
around 6800 MW(e) as against the current capacity of 2720 MW(e). The Government had 
recently approved the construction of a 500 MW(e) prototype fast breeder reactor. That indigenously 
developed technology could boost the installed power generation capacity to well 
above 300 000 MW(e). In 2002Â2003, the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited had achieved 
an annual overall capacity factor of 90%, which was among the best in the world. Its three PGWR 
units had been among the five best-performing units in the world in 2002. 
32. The fast breeder test reactor at the Indira Ghandi Centre for Atomic Research had been 
performing excellently without any fuel failure. The irradiation of uranium-plutonium mixed oxide 
fuel, using uranium-233 as an additional fissile supplement to achieve the required linear heat rating, 
had begun in July 2003. To close the fuel cycle for the reactor, a facility for reprocessing the carbide 
fuel had been commissioned and the reprocessing campaign had begun. 
33. The second waste immobilization plant for the vitrification of high-level waste had been 
commissioned. The uranium-thorium separation facility for the separation of uranium-233 from 
irradiated thorium fuel had gone operational. 
34. Growth of nuclear energy in the developing countries should be a matter of global interest, if the 
earth was to be protected from irreversible climate changes. Where there were no genuine concerns, 
barriers to the deployment of nuclear energy technology needed to be examined and brought down 
using a pragmatic approach. Mindless controls that failed to take account of the development 
aspirations of the needy did not help. The AgencyÂs INPRO project had the potential to address that 
problem. The development of an advanced heavy water reactor in India, which would more than meet 
the INPRO objectives in terms of sustainability, economy, safety and proliferation resistance, was 
progressing according to plan and would lay the basis for large-scale energy production using thorium. 
India was conscious of its responsibility to assist in preventing proliferation. However, it was 
important, in moving forward to the development and use of proliferation-resistant technologies, to 
remove restrictions on the flow of equipment and technology related to the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 6 

35. A recent study had shown that India would need to achieve an annual electricity availability of 
around 5000 KwÂ·h per capita to provide its more than a billion people with a quality of life consistent 
with modern norms. That would only be possible if the nuclear power share was at least 25%. R&D 
programmes were already under way to develop an FBR fuel cycle with a shorter doubling time, 
uranium-233 clean-up, accelerator-driven systems to achieve a better doubling time with thorium fuel 
cycles and for waste transmutation, and a compact high-temperature reactor. At the Institute for 
Plasma Research, one of the worldÂs first super-conducting steady-state tokamaks with elongated 
divertor plasmas and 1000-second operation capability was being constructed and commissioned. 
India had been watching developments in the ITER project and was keen to participate. Various Indian 
institutions were participating in the STAR experiment at the relativistic heavy ion collider at the 
Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United States and in the large hadron collider experiments at 
CERN. 
36. India would continue to share its experience with other countries under the technical 
cooperation programme. In 2002, it had trained 33 Agency fellows, hosted 8 Agency and RCA events 
and sent 50 experts on Agency assignments. He hoped that the agreement reached on linking growth 
in the Regular Budget with the volume of the TCF would enhance the resources available for technical 
cooperation. India consistently paid its share of the TCF in full. 
37. India was also in a position to contribute to global efforts to manage and preserve nuclear 
knowledge and intended to participate in the recently established World Nuclear University. It had 
also participated in the establishment of the Regional Asian Network for Higher Education in Nuclear 
Technology, and Indian scientists had been among the leading contributors to scientific publications 
on PHWRs. 
38. He welcomed the compromise reached on the programme and budget for 2004Â2005. The move 
away from zero real growth provided an opportunity to rectify certain imbalances and remove some 
procedural complexities that had crept in over the years. The Director GeneralÂs one house concept 
should be fully realized and not remain a mere slogan. Technology should be the key driving force 
behind it, linking together the AgencyÂs programmes. India was willing to participate in the studies 
proposed by the Board to streamline procedures and make economies. 
39. Thanks to the green revolution in agriculture, the doomsday scenarios of famine and starvation 
had not materialized in densely populated developing countries. A revolution in nuclear power 
technology would also help address residual issues facing the developing and developed world alike. 
A two-pronged strategy that safeguarded developmental aspirations while preventing the malevolent 
use of nuclear technology was needed to bring that about. 
40. Mr. BEKOE (Ghana) said that the Annual Report for 2002 clearly showed how the Agency had 
actively continued to promote R&D on innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles. It had invested 
considerable resources in the establishment and improvement of safety criteria to cover all kinds of 
nuclear activities. Through technology transfer and capacity building, it had forged strategic technical 
cooperation partnerships which were needs-driven and therefore focused on the demands of Member 
States. 
41. Through its Atomic Energy Commission, Ghana was trying to encourage and promote the 
commercialization of R&D results by aligning the CommissionÂs research activities with the countryÂs 
needs. That required close collaboration between the Commission and industry, and other production 
and social sectors. Under the auspices of three main operational institutes set up by the Commission, a 
number of research activities had been undertaken with the aim of making a positive socio-economic 
impact. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 7 

42. The gamma irradiation facility was used for the commercial sterilization of medical products 
and the preservation of agricultural produce and food items. It helped enhance food safety and security 
and would also be a great source of income to support the development efforts of the Commission. 
Efforts were being made to upgrade the facility to a 500 kCi source with a conveyor system. 
43. GhanaÂs research reactor was used for a variety of activities, including analysis of traditional 
plant medicines, pesticide and pollution studies, and the development of radioisotope applications for 
the petroleum industry. It had generated 20% of the Reactor CentreÂs annual budget, and that figure 
was expected to increase as customers became aware of the CentreÂs importance. 
44. In animal, nutrition, production and health research, studies had been conducted of the efficacy 
of some common drug treatments for helminth infestations in dogs, and Mycobacterium bovis in milk 
and milk products had been detected using PCR techniques. 
45. Even though Ghana had trained personnel offering NDT services, the lack of a functioning NDT 
society made it difficult to establish a national qualification and certification body, which the Agency 
was encouraging all countries participating in the AFRA NDT project to do. 
46. The radiotherapy centre in Accra was treating cancer patients from Ghana and other West 
African countries. The equipment provided by the Agency for the second radiotherapy centre in 
Kumasi had been successfully installed and tested. In view of the difficulty of retaining trained 
personnel, Ghana was strongly committed to the development and implementation of the AFRA 
project on education and local training of medical physicists, technicians and radiographers. 
47. As part of its efforts to harness nuclear and biotechnology techniques to promote 
socio-economic advancement and self-reliance, Ghana had set up a business development unit at the 
Commission which was responsible for planning and coordinating all capital mobilization activities, 
introducing nuclear technologies to the public, negotiating the sale of technologies, and arranging 
partnerships with the relevant stakeholders. 
48. Within the framework of AFRA, facilities and equipment belonging to the Commission had 
been used to train students from GhanaÂs universities and researchers from Ghanaian and other 
African institutions, through the regular training programmes sponsored by the Agency. 
49. He thanked the Agency for the technical assistance it had provided and looked forward to 
further cooperation in the future. He also urged all Member States and donor organizations to pay their 
contributions on time so that the Agency would be financially able to pursue its much needed and 
highly appreciated technical cooperation programme. 
50. One of the more urgent challenges currently facing the Agency was the need to strengthen the 
safeguards system in order to increase the likelihood of detecting clandestine nuclear weapons 
programmes. The adherence of all States to strengthened safeguards was a crucial component in that 
endeavour. The Ghanaian parliament had recently ratified a number of Agency-related instruments, 
but even before that the country had been complying fully with the provisions of the NPT and its 
additional protocol. He encouraged all Member States that had not yet done so, especially those in 
Africa, to conclude safeguards agreements and additional protocols. 
51. Nuclear disarmament remained a priority issue in contemporary international relations. The 
slow progress in that area was cause for concern. Nuclear weapons were weapons of mass destruction 
and, as such, should be decommissioned in the interests of a peaceful and safer world. 
Nuclear-weapon-free zones should be increased in all regions, and non-nuclear weapon States should 
be given assurances that they would not become the victims of nuclear weapon strikes. Ghana could 
not support the view that some States deserved to have a monopoly on nuclear weapons. That 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 8 

standpoint undermined the NPT and the safeguards regime. Nuclear technology should be used to 
improve life, not to destroy it. 

52. Though the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rested with national governments, 
international cooperation was vital and the Agency was to be commended for its continued efforts in 
that area. He welcomed the AgencyÂs attempts to help Member States reinforce their nuclear safety 
infrastructure and improve related laws and regulations, and also the preparation of the code of 
conduct on the safety of research reactors. The AgencyÂs safety standards should be applied 
universally and incorporated into national rules and regulations. 
53. With the ever increasing threat of nuclear terrorism, it was right that attention should be given to 
concrete and practical steps that would ensure enhanced protection of nuclear material and its safe and 
secure storage. In particular, he welcomed the development of an Agency action plan to combat 
nuclear terrorism. However, equal emphasis should be given to all three main pillars of the AgencyÂs 
activities. Efforts to curb the threat of nuclear terrorism should be matched by those promoting 
non-proliferation and the AgencyÂs development activities. 
54. Mr. NGANDAJINA (Angola) said that every effort was being made to ensure that the climate 
of peace established in his country after a lengthy armed conflict lasted, and to create the conditions 
for political and socio-economic stability. Technical assistance and nuclear science and technology 
could help promote sustainable development in Angola and the well-being of its population. 
55. His country was very grateful to the Agency for the technical assistance it had received, in 
particular with the establishment of a national radiation protection infrastructure and staff training, and 
with the setting up of a nuclear physics teaching laboratory. Other important projects related to the 
establishment of a radiotherapy centre, modernization of laboratories for the diagnosis of animal 
diseases, and work on marine pollution. 
56. AngolaÂs Country Programme Framework covering the period 2004Â2009 took account of his 
GovernmentÂs priorities and the AgencyÂs activities in such areas as health, agriculture and water 
resources. It should help the country meet its requirements for specialized staff and equipment. In that 
connection, he emphasized the importance of technical cooperation for the mutual evaluation of 
progress made in the development and application of new technologies and of the results achieved in 
the fight against famine in Angola. 
57. His country was totally committed to the Agency and its objectives and intended to establish a 
regulatory authority and promulgate an atomic energy law as soon as possible. Despite the difficulties 
his country faced, his Government had always met its financial obligations to the Agency. 
58. Angola supported AFRA and hoped to be able to accede to that agreement in the near future. 
59. Finally, in the interests of humanity, all those who promoted and produced nuclear weapons 
should renounce their nuclear weapons programmes. Moreover, all States should respect the Charter 
of the United Nations in resolving conflicts and punishing those who did not respect international law. 
60. Mr. DAINIUS (Lithuania) said that the terrorist attack on United Nations Headquarters in 
Baghdad in the preceding month had been a painful reminder that the war on international terrorism 
was far from over. Lithuania offered its sincere condolences and deepest sympathies to the families 
that had lost loved ones in the attack and strongly condemned those brutal acts. Any attempts to 
destabilize and disrupt the restoration of peace, security and stability in Iraq would be quashed by the 
concerted efforts of the international community. 
61. His country supported fully the AgencyÂs efforts to clarify cases of possible non-compliance 
with non-proliferation obligations. A stringent nuclear security framework for nuclear installations and 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 9 

material was needed in order to prevent sensitive nuclear material and technology from falling into the 
hands of terrorists. 

62. Nuclear energy played an important role in the Lithuanian economy. In 2002, Lithuania had 
been the country with the worldÂs highest nuclear share in its energy production Â around 80%. In 
October 2002, the Lithuanian parliament had adopted a revised national energy strategy setting out the 
terms and conditions for the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, in line with the timetable for 
LithuaniaÂs accession to the European Union. Every effort was being made to ensure the highest safety 
standards at the Ignalina plant until its closure. Plant safety during the transition period from operation 
to decommissioning would be given top priority. The Lithuanian Government looked forward to 
continued cooperation with the Agency, whose assistance during the preparatory phase had been much 
appreciated. 
63. The Ignalina plant and all nuclear material in Lithuania had been placed under comprehensive 
Agency safeguards. Having signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement, Lithuania urged 
other States to do likewise as soon as possible. Following the verification of spent fuel by Agency 
inspectors in December 2002, it was hoped that integrated safeguards would be applied in Lithuania in 
the near future. 
64. In cooperation with the Agency and other Member States, Lithuania was undertaking all 
necessary measures to improve its national physical protection regime. A follow-up IPPAS mission 
had visited Lithuania in 2002 and the Agency experts had expressed a favourable opinion with regard 
to the implementation of the recommendations made by the 1999 mission, and had suggested further 
improvements to upgrade the physical protection infrastructure taking into account the forthcoming 
decommissioning process. In 2002, the Lithuanian Government had approved new regulations on 
physical protection of the Ignalina plant. 
65. He noted the fact that the group of legal and technical experts charged with preparing a draft 
amendment to the CPPNM had completed its work and he thanked the Austrian Minister for Foreign 
Affairs for initiating the amendment process. 
66. Lithuania attached great importance to technical cooperation with the Agency and particularly 
valued the assistance the latter provided in such areas as nuclear and radiation safety, radiotherapy and 
waste management. In view of the challenges posed by the decommissioning of nuclear facilities, 
waste management and the threat of nuclear terrorism, further improvement of nuclear safety, 
radiation and physical protection infrastructure should be EuropeÂs greatest priority. 
67. His country was constantly upgrading its radiotherapy equipment and treatment methods. A 
national cancer control programme had been launched for the period 2001Â2010 with a view to 
bringing Lithuanian radiotherapy services and equipment in line with EU and international standards. 
Lithuania appreciated the AgencyÂs positive response to the launch of a national project on 
improvement of radiotherapy under the 2003Â2004 technical cooperation programme. With the 
AgencyÂs assistance, it intended to acquire and commission a second dual energy accelerator in order 
to enhance the capacity, reliability and standards of the radiotherapy service at the Lithuanian 
Oncology Centre. 
68. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States in formulating adequate, 
affordable and environmentally friendly energy policies, thanks to which Lithuania had developed 
substantial expertise in the field. The successful implementation of the national project on energy 
supply options had provided significant input for the updated national energy strategy. The Europe 
Section of the Department of Technical Cooperation and the Planning and Economic Studies Section 
of the Department of Nuclear Energy had made an outstanding contribution to the successful 
implementation of that project. The competence and capabilities acquired by the Lithuanian Energy 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 10 

Institute would be utilized to assist counterparts in Latvia and Estonia in carrying out energy studies 
which would later be incorporated in the Baltic region energy study. 

69. Lithuania strongly supported the efforts of the Agency and Member States to resolve the critical 
issues of proper management and safe disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, which 
were of vital importance to the future of nuclear energy. Steps were being taken to facilitate the 
ratification of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management, and in 2002 the Lithuanian Government had approved a strategy for 
radioactive waste management. The Lithuanian radioactive waste management agency had initiated 
preparatory work to set up a near-surface repository for low- and intermediate-level short-lived 
radioactive waste, with assistance from Sweden. The site selection process was under way. 
70. Spent fuel reprocessing was prohibited in Lithuania by law and spent fuel was viewed as 
radioactive waste. Apart from a national deep geological repository, the radioactive waste 
management strategy included the option of a regional repository constructed in collaboration with 
other countries. Under the 2003Â2007 national research programme, it was planned to specify the 
inventory and characteristics of the waste to be placed in such a repository. 
71. The successful future development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was dependent on 
the adherence of all States to internationally accepted nuclear safety standards. The services offered to 
Member States through the AgencyÂs safety missions were highly valued and regional technical 
cooperation projects in that field facilitated the exchange of experience. In 2002, Lithuania had 
welcomed an expert mission on assessment of the human factor and had hosted two successful 
regional workshops on nuclear power facility licensing and RBMK reactor safety issues. Activities in 
the near future would focus on the implementation of safety improvement measures at the Ignalina 
nuclear power plant. 
72. In cooperation with the Agency and the European Commission, his country was allocating 
substantial resources to strengthening its regulatory infrastructure for the control of radiation sources 
and exposure to radiation. It was hoped that the Agency would provide assistance with the 
establishment of a national radiation protection training centre. Through the regional project on 
enhancing occupational radiation protection at nuclear power plants, Lithuania had been able to share 
experience and, through effective implementation of the optimization principle, occupational exposure 
at the Ignalina nuclear power plant had been reduced significantly. 
73. He commended the Agency for embarking on the revision of the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources and requested that it continue to provide the training and 
equipment needed for State border control, customs departments and other State institutions 
responsible for the detection and control of illicit trafficking in radioactive material. Lithuania was 
actively involved in the activities of the information system on occupational exposure. In that 
connection, the implementation of quality systems in hospitals was vitally important to control 
medical exposure. He also welcomed the AgencyÂs support for the Central and Eastern European 
ALARA network. 
74. Recognizing the importance of timely and full payment of contributions to the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, the Lithuanian Government was prepared to pledge and pay its 
recommended target share of the TCF. 
75. Mr. BONOU (Burkina Faso) welcomed the measures taken since the preceding session of the 
General Conference to protect against nuclear terrorism and illicit trafficking in nuclear material and 
radiation sources. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 11 

76. Burkina Faso had signed a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in 2003 and urged 
other States that had not yet done so to follow suit. 
77. He welcomed the agreement concluded between the Agency and the African Union on joint 
programmes to eradicate the tsetse fly using the SIT. African Heads of State and Government, at their 
36th and 37th summits held in 2000 and 2001, had reaffirmed the priority status of such programmes 
and, at the July 2003 summit in Maputo, the African Union had integrated activities related to 
PATTEC into NEPAD. He noted with particular satisfaction the implementation of the AgencyÂs 
regional technical cooperation programmes on use of the SIT to control malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes and to create tsetse-free zones in Africa. He urged all Member States to support the 
programmes in question. 
78. His Government was grateful to the Agency for its technical cooperation activities in the areas 
of food and agriculture, human health, animal production and health, radiation protection, radiological 
safety and radioactive waste, which were helping enhance human capacity in Burkina Faso through 
training in the peaceful use of nuclear technology and nuclear techniques. A large number of 
fellowships were being granted under both national and regional technical cooperation programmes. 
The Country Programme Framework that was currently being elaborated would provide an 
opportunity to refocus cooperation activities in the light of the national anti-poverty strategy which 
gave priority to education, health, potable water, agriculture and stockbreeding. His country was 
committed to establishing a legal and regulatory framework for radiation protection and radiological 
safety as soon as possible, which would allow a nuclear medicine and cancer treatment centre to be set 
up. With the AgencyÂs assistance, food quality and drug control facilities were gradually being 
introduced at the National Public Health Laboratory. The Applied Biochemistry and Chemistry 
Laboratory at Ouagadougou University was also developing a drug against fowl pox based on plant 
extracts. 
79. Like many other countries, Burkina Faso suffered from a severe shortage of renewable water 
resources. Judging from current trends, those resources would decline by half by 2005, potentially 
jeopardizing all socio-economic activity in the Niger River basin. His country therefore attached 
special importance to the AgencyÂs water resource management activities and actively supported its 
strategy in that area. It also urged the Agency to pursue its regional anti-desertification programme and 
to make available increased human, financial and material resources for its implementation. 
80. Lastly, he suggested that the Agency should examine ways isotope techniques could be used in 
the fight against AIDS. 
Ms. Al-Mulla (Kuwait) took the Chair. 

81. Mr. OÂSHEA (United Kingdom) said that, although his country recognized value in all areas of 
the AgencyÂs work, it considered the most important aspect thereof to be the AgencyÂs contribution to 
the worldwide campaign against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In an uncertain 
world where the risks of nuclear proliferation were changing and increasing, it was more important 
than ever that the Agency had the tools it required to carry out its verification activities effectively. It 
was also essential that the Agency addressed whatever challenges arose with rigour and determination 
and that the Board of Governors provided real leadership and direction. 
82. The United Kingdom was grateful to the Department of Safeguards for another year of valuable 
work and it attached the highest importance to the assurances the Agency was able to offer about the 
non-diversion of nuclear material. It was only the combined implementation of comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols that provided the basis for the Agency to make 
statements about the absence of undeclared nuclear material or activities. It was therefore imperative 
that both comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols become the norm for 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 12 

safeguards, particularly for those States with significant nuclear programmes that included or provided 
for the development of enrichment or reprocessing capabilities. The United Kingdom was pleased to 
be able to assist the Secretariat in its efforts to help Member States implement the additional protocol 
by hosting a technical meeting in London in October on the revision of the additional protocol 
guidelines. It would also help fund the integrated safeguards information system re-engineering 
project, in addition to the consultancy support it already provided for safeguards. 

83. Iraq, the DPRK and Iran demonstrated the importance of the AgencyÂs role in preventing 
proliferation. The deployment of inspectors in Iraq to investigate claims of widespread looting of 
nuclear material highlighted the need for the Agency to be able to respond to events at short notice. 
The analysis results had shown that the quantity and type of uranium compounds dispersed were not 
sensitive from a proliferation point of view. The United Kingdom continued to support the multilateral 
talks aimed at the peaceful settlement of the situation on the Korean Peninsula and deplored the 
statement by the DPRK following the latest round indicating that it had no further interest in the talks. 
The Agency should have a role in verifying the transparent, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement 
of the DPRKÂs nuclear programmes, as called for by a large part of the international community. In 
addition, his country welcomed the resolution regarding Iran adopted by the Board in the preceding 
week and expected Iran to comply with all of its provisions. 
84. It was because of the importance of the AgencyÂs verification work that the United Kingdom 
had been one of the Member States that had taken the lead in supporting a substantial justified increase 
in funding for the work of the Department of Safeguards, and it was delighted that agreement had been 
reached on a budget package incorporating such an increase. It was essential that the full increase, to 
be phased in over four years, was implemented in future budget decisions. 
85. The AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear security also contributed to non-proliferation. The 
international community had to cooperate to reduce the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction, to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear or radioactive material or sabotaging nuclear 
facilities or material, and to deal with the consequences of any such attacks. In that connection, he 
called on Member States to continue to provide funding to sustain the nuclear security programme, 
pending the proposed review of the funding mechanism in which his country intended to participate 
actively. The United Kingdom had pledged Â£750 000 to the Nuclear Security Fund over three years, 
two thirds of which had already been paid. 
86. The United Kingdom welcomed the work undertaken to revise the draft action plan for the 
safety and security of radioactive sources. It had also played a key role in the negotiation of the 
revised code of conduct on that subject which would strengthen significantly international cooperation 
and control in that area when it was implemented. 
87. The AgencyÂs efforts to promote high and consistent levels of nuclear safety were welcome. His 
countryÂs Government and civil nuclear industry took their responsibilities for ensuring safety at 
nuclear installations very seriously, both with regard to the workforce and the wider public. It was also 
a top priority for his country to ensure that very high standards of safety were developed and applied 
to the transport of radioactive material. People had to be informed of the facts regarding transport 
activities, particularly transport of nuclear material by sea, in order to allay their concerns. The United 
Kingdom had therefore welcomed the recent International Conference on the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material which had reached clear and reassuring conclusions. It hoped that, in addition to 
the extensive international research undertaken on the safety of transport of nuclear material, the 
positive conclusions of the recent TranSAS mission to the United Kingdom would serve to reassure 
people that the shipments carried out by his country posed no significant risk. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 13 

88. The United Kingdom had again shown its commitment to technical cooperation by paying its 
full share of the TCF target. In the Technical Co-operation Report for 2002, concern had been 
expressed about the declining level of actual payments being made by Member States. The AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation activities should not be hampered by a lack of financial commitment from 
Member States. He therefore urged all Member States to pay their shares of the TCF target in full and 
on time and, where appropriate, to pay back arrears in assessed programme costs as soon as possible. 
89. For the Agency to achieve its objectives, it had to be an effective, efficient and forward-looking 
body. His country had been actively involved in efforts to identify the scope for internal efficiencies 
and managed change within the Agency and had been one of the countries to contribute to the cost of 
the management consultancy study undertaken. It was pleased that the Agency was taking account of 
the recommendations made and it was prepared to offer an amount of up to $100 000 by March 2004 
for further consultancy work , on receiving specific proposals from the Secretariat. 
90. The preceding year had been a difficult one for the Agency and it should be congratulated on 
the way in which it had risen to the challenges before it. The United Kingdom welcomed the Director 
GeneralÂs ideas about future developments in counter-proliferation techniques, including the suggested 
new approaches to the design and management of the nuclear fuel cycle which deserved further study. 
91. In the coming year, a significant increase was to be expected in the number of Member States 
with additional protocols in force. The United KingdomÂs own additional protocol, which his country 
had followed in practice for some time, would formally come into force. The Agency would therefore 
be in a better position to provide assurances about the non-diversion of nuclear material. His country 
looked forward to the Agency becoming even more effective in its work to prevent nuclear 
proliferation, and also to continued internal change that would enhance the effectiveness of all its 
activities. 
92. Mr. BENDJABALLAH (Algeria) said that the international community was currently facing 
multiple challenges and would need to find the necessary political determination and resources to deal 
with them. 
93. The third conference to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT had recently been held in 
Vienna and had provided an opportunity for several countries to reaffirm the importance of that 
Treaty. Algeria had deposited its instruments of ratification with the United Nations Secretary-General 
on 11 July 2003 and it urged all other States whose ratification was necessary for the Treaty to enter 
into force to do the same. His country was also playing an active role in the work of the Preparatory 
Commission for the CTBTO, especially with respect to the establishment of the verification regime 
provided for by the Treaty. 
94. The Agency needed to play an objective role in the implementation of the non-proliferation 
regime and in the prevention of illicit activities involving the use of nuclear material for non-peaceful 
purposes. His country was a party to all international instruments relating to the prohibition of 
weapons of mass destruction and nuclear non-proliferation and, even before it joined the NPT in 
January 1995, it had opened its nuclear facilities to Agency inspections. For almost ten years all its 
nuclear activities had been subject to Agency monitoring and it had recently concluded Subsidiary 
Arrangements to its safeguards agreement. Having fulfilled its obligations, Algeria reaffirmed its 
legitimate right to access nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and wished to see international 
cooperation strengthened in that area. 
95. Algeria had always given its full support to Agency activities in the fields of safety and security, 
as demonstrated by its ratification of the CPPNM in April 2003. It had also made significant progress 
in the ratification process for the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the 
Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 14 

96. The AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen safety and security were justified in the light of the 
unprecedented growth of international terrorism. Algeria supported the measures taken by the Agency 
to combat nuclear terrorism, especially the establishment of instruments related to nuclear safety and 
the security of nuclear installations and material, and the action plan for the prevention of nuclear 
terrorism approved by the Board of Governors in 2002. A firm commitment by all Member States was 
needed to achieve that goal. 
97. The Agency continued to achieve important results in the area of technical cooperation in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, despite the lack of resources for that statutory activity. It should try to 
ensure that the necessary balance between its various activities was maintained and that funding of 
technical cooperation activities was assured. 
98. Algeria attached considerable importance to the strengthening of technical cooperation 
activities, particularly those aimed at promoting socio-economic development through the effective 
use of nuclear techniques. It welcomed the fact that efforts in the fields of health, agriculture and water 
resources enjoyed permanent Agency support. His countryÂs projected needs and activities in those 
areas had been identified in the preliminary draft of its Country Programme Framework. Areas of 
particular importance to Algeria were combating of desertification and integration of isotope 
techniques in water resource management. 
99. His country, which had held the Chairmanship of AFRA since September 2002, had carried out 
a number of activities under that agreement. In particular, it had contributed to the evaluation of the 
African human resources development programme in the field of nuclear science and technology and 
had held consultations with NEPAD managers with a view to establishing an effective partnership. On 
the national level, it had cooperated closely with the Agency on the organization of several regional 
AFRA scientific events in such fields as nuclear security, information and communications 
technology, and nuclear cardiology. It continued to provide the regional programme with specialist 
and expert services in such diverse areas as radioactive waste management, the development of 
nuclear medicine techniques, use of isotope hydrology techniques to detect dam leaks, and nuclear 
instrumentation. It also participated actively in the management programme run by the AFRA Field 
Management Committee. He urged all Agency Member States and regional and international 
organizations to strengthen their support for AFRA and to continue contributing to the funding of 
programmes developed on the African continent with a view to improving its socio-economic 
development. 
100. The threat to international peace and security arising from the situation in the Middle East was a 
source of profound concern for Algeria and the international community. IsraelÂs refusal to adhere to 
the NPT and submit its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards had exacerbated the situation. It was 
regrettable that progress had still not been made on the important issue of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities 
and threat which had been on the agenda of the General Conference for several years. 
101. IsraelÂs refusal to submit to international law had also prevented the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region, which was essential for regional as well as international 
security. Such zones, which had already been established elsewhere by the Tlatelolco, Rarotonga and 
Pelindaba Treaties, constituted a significant step towards nuclear disarmament on a global scale. It was 
therefore of the utmost importance for the Agency to ensure that Israel joined the NPT and submitted 
its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards. 
102. Algeria supported the efforts undertaken by the Agency since 1994 to find a balanced solution 
to the DPRK nuclear crisis. Any diplomatic step aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the situation 
was to be encouraged and he called on all parties concerned to persevere with the dialogue that had 
been initiated. 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 15 

103. Algeria welcomed the AgencyÂs decision to include an additional item in the agenda on the 
amendment of Article VI of the Statute and thanked the Republic of Korea for initiating that action. 
Algeria had been the first country to request the amendment in question with a view to achieving more 
balanced representation of developing countries on the Board of Governors. Furthermore, it was 
during AlgeriaÂs presidency at the 43rd regular session of the General Conference that a consensus 
solution had been found and the amendment voted on. Algeria had already deposited its instruments of 
ratification for the amendment and called upon all Member States that had not yet done so to follow 
suit. 
104. Ms. ESPINOSA (Mexico) said that concern over the preservation and strengthening of the 
global nuclear non-proliferation regime was growing and her country supported the measures that had 
been taken by the Agency to ensure that the international safeguards system was effective, efficient 
and universally applied. It also valued the AgencyÂs efforts to carry out the tasks assigned to it by the 
Security Council as well as its statutory verification functions and urged all States to support those 
efforts. 
105. During the preceding year, the Agency had continued to carry out safeguards inspections in 
Mexico pursuant to the countryÂs safeguards agreement and had drawn satisfactory conclusions. 
Mexico was implementing the necessary technical and legal measures to enable it to sign an additional 
protocol. 
106. The Laguna Verde nuclear power plant had continued to operate in accordance with the 
AgencyÂs safety standards and had supplied 4.07% of the countryÂs total electricity output in 2002. 
107. With regard to the action plan to combat nuclear terrorism, Mexico supported all measures 
aimed at improving the security of nuclear material and installations. International cooperation was the 
most effective way to combat nuclear terrorism, based on the Charter of the United Nations and other 
instruments of international law, and maintaining full respect for human rights. Mexico therefore 
appreciated the AgencyÂs evaluation and advisory services and congratulated the Agency on its efforts 
to improve the detection of, and response to, illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. An 
IPPAS mission to Mexico was scheduled for December 2003. Mexico would also be hosting a 
regional training course on physical protection of nuclear material and facilities in November 2003. 
108. Her country had participated actively in the working group of legal and technical experts 
convened by the Director General to prepare a draft amendment to the CPPNM. A consensus needed 
to be reached on all outstanding issues before a diplomatic conference was convened to amend the 
Convention. 
109. The three basic tools of the AgencyÂs Technical Cooperation Strategy Â the central criterion, 
Country Programme Frameworks and thematic planning Â had helped improve project design and 
Government and institutional commitment. The plans to extend thematic planning to cover such areas 
as food irradiation, management of rainwater basins and control of transmissible diseases were 
welcome. By strengthening its efforts in priority areas such as the use of isotope and nuclear 
techniques in agriculture and the food industry, human health, water resources and environmental 
protection, the Agency could make a significant contribution to realizing the commitments made at the 
Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development. Mexico also supported the measures taken 
by the Secretariat to find additional financial resources for the technical cooperation programme and to 
establish partnerships with other specialized agencies and international bodies. 
110. The Mexican Secretary for Energy was developing, in collaboration with the Agency and major 
national nuclear institutions, an integrated public opinion programme on the peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy. As in many other countries, the general public in Mexico was playing an increasing 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 16 

role in the decision-making process. The aforementioned programme was designed to provide the 
public with objective and truthful information on the nuclear industry. 

111. In May 2003, the XIX Congress of the Latin American Association of Societies of Biology and 
Nuclear Medicine (ALASBIMN) had been held in Mexico. The Agency had organized a regional 
training course on paediatric nuclear medicine and had held the first project coordinators meeting for 
the establishment of a regional telemedicine network in Latin America. 
112. After difficult negotiations, the Board of Governors had approved a programme and budget 
package for 2004Â2005 in July. Looking to the future, while it was clearly desirable that as many 
States as possible sign an additional protocol, that would bring with it additional financial burdens. 
The expansion of the nuclear industry would also have financial implications for the Agency. Experts 
should therefore continue to analyse the application and funding of safeguards in order to ensure fair 
and equal distribution of the financial burden, taking into account the benefits reaped by each State 
from its nuclear industry. The shielding mechanism would continue to be necessary for developing 
countries. 
113. Mr. HOANG VAN HUAY (Vietnam) commended the achievements of the Agency over the 
preceding year. In the current complex international situation, the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system and create an effective verification regime for 
the NPT were welcome. His country remained committed to nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. 
114. A strong national regulatory infrastructure was essential for the safe and peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy. His country was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it had received with the 
implementation of its national programme on radiation protection and nuclear safety through the 
Model Project on upgrading radiation protection infrastructures. It hoped that that Model Project 
would be expanded to enable his country and others to reach the project milestones. 
115. Vietnam attached great importance to technology transfer and capacity-building through the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes. Its technical cooperation projects, which received 
adequate funding from the Government, had made a significant contribution to the spread of nuclear 
applications in such areas as food and agriculture, human health, management of water resources and 
the oil and gas industries. He expressed the hope that the Agency would continue to devote adequate 
resources to the technical cooperation programme. 
116. Nuclear power continued to expand in Asia where the energy demand was expected to increase 
greatly in the coming decades. The AgencyÂs INPRO project and the Generation IV Initiative of the 
United States Department of Energy had made remarkable progress. Vietnam had carried out a study 
on the introduction of nuclear power and had been encouraged by the priorities declared by the 
Director General in his opening address. 
117. Mr. HOFFMANN (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization) said that the CTBT was becoming increasingly universal in its status, having been 
signed by 168 States and ratified by 104. With AlgeriaÂs recent ratification, the ratifiers now included 
32 of the 44 States whose ratification was required for the TreatyÂs entry into force. 
118. The Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty held in early September 2003 had adopted a final declaration that had stressed the importance 
of a universal and effectively verifiable comprehensive treaty as a major instrument for all aspects of 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The Conference had reiterated that the cessation of nuclear 
weapons tests and other nuclear explosions, by constraining the development of nuclear weapons in 

GC(47)/OR.5 
17 September 2003, Page 17 

general and ending the development of advanced new types of nuclear weapons, constituted an 
effective nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation measure. 

119. The Preparatory Commission and its Provisional Technical Secretariat were actively continuing 
to prepare the effective implementation of the CTBT. As a primary obligation, each State party 
undertook not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion and to 
prohibit and prevent any such explosion at any place under its jurisdiction or control. The Treaty 
provided for the establishment of a global verification regime consisting of an international monitoring 
system, a consultation and clarification process, on-site inspections and confidence-building measures. 
Data from monitoring system stations around the world were analysed by the International Data 
Centre in Vienna. The monitoring data and the products of the International Data Centre were made 
available to Member States. They had the final responsibility for analysing the data. 
120. The programme budgets for establishing the international monitoring system approved by the 
Commission since 1997 included the cost of site surveys, the purchase of equipment, installation, final 
certification, and operation and maintenance of the facilities. The installation of the monitoring 
network was proceeding steadily. 
121. The International Data Centre supported the verification and civil and scientific interests of 
Member States by providing products and services needed for effective global monitoring through the 
establishment and testing of facilities to receive, collect, process, analyse, report on and archive data 
received from monitoring system stations. To date, about 85 such stations had been included in the 
CentreÂs operations. The CentreÂs work on the design, implementation and management of 
information security was progressing. About 70 secure signatory accounts had been established, with 
over 490 users authorized to access monitoring system data and the products of the International Data 
Centre and to receive technical support from the Centre. The global communications infrastructure 
transferred monitoring system data to the Centre and disseminated the data and products to signatory 
States. The Provisional Technical Secretariat operated the global communications infrastructure as a 
worldwide closed and secure satellite communications network. Once it was fully operational, the 
network was expected to carry some 11 gigabytes of data daily. 
122. The elaboration of the draft on-site inspection operational manual remained a priority task. The 
ninth on-site inspection workshop hosted by Japan in Hiroshima from 30 June to 4 July 2003 had 
discussed lessons learned from the 2002 field experiment in Kazakhstan. 
123. The Provisional Technical Secretariat currently had about 270 staff members from 70 countries, 
some 175 of them in the Professional category. The representation of women in Professional positions 
had increased to 27.6%. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (continued) 
(GC(47)/2) 
1. Mr. PAULINICH (Peru) said that since the previous session of the General Conference his 
country had made significant progress in using nuclear science and technology to address a number of 
national problems. With Agency assistance, the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute (IPEN) had drawn 
up and started implementation of its strategic plan, which provided for the peaceful use of atomic 
energy in such new areas as biotechnology, materials characterization, environmental protection and 
sustainable water resources management. 
2. The Agency was continuing to provide valuable support for the training of human resources 
through fellowships, scientific visits and expert missions. Of particular interest had been the training in 
the use of the logical framework methodology. For its part, Peru had continued to organize advanced 
courses on the use of nuclear techniques in biotechnology, medicine and other areas. 
3. With regard to the dissemination and promotion of nuclear science, IPEN and other national 
institutes had continued to organize events, such as the international scientific meetings held twice a 
year that provided a forum for discussion and analysis for Peruvian and foreign scientists. 
4. Peru was grateful to the Agency for its assistance in two new projects for the 2003Â2004 
biennium on isotopic techniques in mining and on the establishment of an infrastructure for the 
application of nuclear techniques for the analysis, conservation and dating of archaeological materials. 
Peru also appreciated the transfer of technology and knowledge through ARCAL and regional projects 
enabling successful management of underground water resources in arid zones in the north of the 
country, and strengthening of the capacities of IPEN and other institutions with respect to the peaceful 
uses of ionizing radiation. In the area of agriculture, technology transfer had made it possible to 
introduce a new variety of barley of high nutritional quality. Progress had also been made in the 
identification of disease-resistant varieties of wheat and of varieties of quinoa suitable for daily 
consumption. 
5. Turning to medicine he said that, in a binational project with Ecuador under Agency auspices, 
two nuclear medicine centres equipped with modern gamma cameras had recently been opened in the 
north of Paraguay. To ensure the smooth running of those centres, IPEN was providing training for the 
medical and maintenance staff. Furthermore, with Agency assistance, the national secondary standards 
dosimetry laboratory had been completed and was now providing diagnostic and therapeutic services 
for patients. A gamma irradiator had been installed at the RACSO nuclear centre for tissue irradiation 
and was ready to be commissioned. He expressed PeruÂs gratitude to the Government of France for its 
support for a national and regional project on industrial tracer applications. 
6. Peru had chaired the Technical Coordination Board of ARCAL in the previous year, and a 
number of activities had been organized by IPEN together with the Agency to promote cooperation in 
the region, including the final coordinators meeting for the project on quality control in the repair and 
maintenance of nuclear medicine instruments, and the final meeting for the project on the quality 
system for the production of irradiated sterilized grafts and related documentation. Peru had also 
received assistance from the Agency for technical and scientific research on such important issues as 
the control and eradication of foot-and-mouth disease and improvements in the SIT.

7. Conscious of its outstanding commitments to the Agency, including the payment of its APCs, 
over the previous year Peru had striven to pay back its arrears. It welcomed the SecretariatÂs efforts to 
strengthen the central criterion concept as the main indicator of a governmentÂs commitment to 
technical cooperation projects. 
8. Underlining the importance of the AgencyÂs verification activities, he said that Peru was proud 
to have co-chaired the informal consultations that had resulted in consensus on an increase in the 
AgencyÂs safeguards budget and the adoption of measures to reduce the financial impact on the 
developing countries while maintaining the balance among the major programmes. 
9. Although the Safeguards Implementation Report for 2002 had concluded that all material under 
safeguards had remained in peaceful uses, he expressed concern about certain developments that could 
undermine the safeguards system and international stability, in particular the attitude of the DPRK visÃ -
vis its safeguards agreement with the Agency. The Agency had not found any discrepancies in the 
safeguards reports submitted by Peru, nor any evidence of undeclared activities or the diversion of 
nuclear material in Peru. 
10. In the current international environment, it was imperative that Member States sign and 
implement comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols in order to make the 
integrated safeguards regime universal and facilitate the AgencyÂs verification tasks. As the first Latin 
American country to have ratified an additional protocol, Peru had taken part in the International 
Conference on IAEA Safeguards in Tokyo in December 2002, and was a member of the group of 
Friends of the Additional Protocol set up at that Conference to promote universality of the additional 
protocol. In that connection, Peru welcomed CubaÂs decision to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty and 
the NPT, and to sign a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol. 
11. Peru had participated actively in the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material held in Vienna in July 2003, and welcomed its recommendations and findings. It 
hoped that a relevant action plan would be developed as a matter of urgency by the Secretariat 
together with interested Member States. Also, Peru welcomed the Director GeneralÂs suggestion to 
convene a group of experts on nuclear liability and to promote dialogue in that regard. 
12. Efforts should be made to improve significantly the provisions of some international 
conventions, such as the CPPNM, and the Early Notification, Assistance and Vienna Conventions. It 
was also important to increase the number of contracting parties to those instruments and establish 
practical measures for their effective implementation. It was also vital to review the applicability of 
the AgencyÂs regulations concerning preparedness and response in the event of a maritime nuclear or 
radiological emergency. The current regime had been formulated for an emergency occurring on land 
where the jurisdiction was clear. The Agency should play a key role in establishing mechanisms for 
consultation, notification and the timely exchange of information Â under strict confidentiality Â 
between government authorities concerning international shipments of radioactive material. 
13. Mr. VOVERS (Latvia) said his country was fully aware of the importance of the safety and 
security of radiation sources and strongly supported the relevant action plan approved by the Board of 
Governors. The issues had been discussed in depth at the International Conference on Security of 
Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna in March 2003, and some Member States had already allocated 
additional financial resources to cope with the most urgent problems. He hoped that the draft safety 
standard for regulatory control of radiation sources would be finalized soon. 
14. In 2002, his Government had approved new regulations on the security of radiation sources and 
facilities, using experience accumulated by other Member States. He thanked the United States of 
America and Sweden for their help in strengthening LatviaÂs physical protection systems, particularly 
its border controls and the security systems at major facilities. Latvia fully endorsed the Code of 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 3 

Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and called on other Member States to do 
the same. 

15. Having completed a national technical cooperation project on feasibility studies for the use of 
positron emission tomography (PET), Latvia was planning to submit a full-scale project to the Agency 
later in the year. The project would not only improve the diagnostic capacity of the countryÂs oncology 
centres but also provide education in radiation safety and the use of radioisotopes in research. Latvia 
was also receiving valuable support in that area under regional technical cooperation projects with the 
Agency. 
16. His Government had launched an international call for tenders for decommissioning and spent 
fuel disposal at the Salaspils research facility, but it had not succeeded in appointing a 
decommissioning operator. It hoped instead to receive support from a trilateral initiative involving the 
Agency, the United States of America and the Russian Federation. Although dismantling of the reactor 
had been postponed for the time being because of budgetary constraints, his Government had allocated 
approximately Â0.65 million for assessment of the environmental impact, preparations for off-site dry 
storage if necessary, and the dismantling of components that had no impact on radiation safety. 
17. Latvia had recently adopted its first radioactive waste management strategy, which aimed to 
enhance safety at an existing disposal site. LatviaÂs report to the first Review Meeting of the Joint 
Convention, to be held in Vienna in November 2003, described the national waste management system 
in detail. Over the next seven years, the Government aimed to create new long-term storage for spent 
sealed sources and carry out feasibility studies for a geological disposal site. The latter would pose a 
challenge even for large countries, and Latvia would support any activities aimed at providing an 
international solution to the problem. 
18. Mr. PÃRÃVET (Cameroon) said the 47th Regular Session of the General Conference was taking 
place against a background of great international concern over terrorist acts and other atrocities being 
perpetrated worldwide. Those challenges had ushered in an era of new responsibilities for the Agency. 
More than ever before it would need the support of its Member States. 
19. It was necessary to strengthen the implementation and universality of the NPT through the 
additional protocol to enable the Agency to verify NPT compliance with greater effectiveness and 
efficiency. The measures developed within the framework of the AgencyÂs existing legal powers were 
essential in the fight against proliferation, illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material, and the 
risk of nuclear terrorist acts. They aimed, amongst other things, to broaden the range of information 
States had to provide on their nuclear materials and activities, and to facilitate inspections. That would 
enhance transparency in the nuclear sphere and strengthen international stability and security. In that 
regard, and reaffirming its active participation in Â and full compliance with Â the Agency 
safeguards system, Cameroon urged all States which had not yet done so to sign a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol thereto. 
20. Africa had set a fine example in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, with almost all African 
countries now party to the Pelindaba Treaty. He expressed the hope that the international community 
would help to protect that achievement and enable Africa to use its resources for sustainable 
development in future. 
21. The technical cooperation programme was also an important part of the AgencyÂs activities. 
Cameroon commended the positive results of cooperation with the Agency within its own strategy 
against poverty, particularly in the sectors of rural development, health, water resources and the 
industrial applications of nuclear technology. Thanks to the Agency, Cameroon now had a veterinary 
reference laboratory in Garoua and a nuclear medicine department equipped with a gamma camera at 
the YaoundÃ© General Hospital. The Hydrac company in Cameroon had, with Agency assistance, 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 4 

ensured much of the monitoring work involved in the laying of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, thereby 
setting an example in industrial radiography for the entire subregion. CameroonÂs short-term priorities 
were to improve plant varieties, develop soil improvement techniques, improve productivity in local 
ruminant breeds, improve access to potable water, improve nutrition for people living with the AIDS 
virus, optimize its nuclear medicine, radiotherapy and medical physics services, and improve radiation 
safety and security. 

22. Cameroon had a law on radiation protection and had established a national radiation protection 
agency in October 2002. CameroonÂs attendance at the majority of international meetings on nuclear 
safety and security was testimony to its constant efforts to reinforce its national radiation protection 
infrastructure in order to meet international standards and also to reassure its partners in the nuclear 
sector. 
23. One of the landmarks of CameroonÂs close cooperation with the Agency had been the signing 
on 16 September 2003 of its CPF. The document would offer a framework for prioritizing technical 
cooperation activities and elaborating projects. Preparing such CPFs would help African Member 
States to derive maximum benefit from the technical cooperation programme. 
24. The success of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme depended on Member StatesÂ 
determination to meet their financial obligations to the Agency and to participate in regional activities. 
The importance of that cooperation to the developing countries could not be underestimated and his 
Government urged all Member States to pay their arrears and make their regular contributions. 
25. In conclusion, he underlined the AgencyÂs crucial role in the promotion of socio-economic 
progress and international peace and security. 
26. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that the events of the previous year had demonstrated the central role 
played by the Agency in the international community at a time when there were threats to global and 
regional peace and security as a result of proliferation and terrorism, a growing demand for energy and 
concerns about health and safety. 
27. Israel supported the AgencyÂs activities to diminish the threat of nuclear terrorism. The alarming 
correlation between States currently seeking weapons of mass destruction and those supporting 
terrorism called for vigorous international efforts to block the spread of weapons of mass destruction 
to terrorist groups and to States supporting such groups. Israel had made a voluntary contribution to 
the NSF in the current year and was considering making an additional contribution in kind. 
28. To address the current challenges successfully, the Agency required financial resources. Israel 
therefore supported the budgetary increase to enhance the AgencyÂs safeguards capability. 
29. Nuclear energy presented one of the few viable options for meeting the growing energy 
demand, particularly in the developing countries. However, a new balance had to be struck between 
further development and improvement of nuclear power generation, on the one hand, and addressing 
proliferation concerns on the other. The AgencyÂs safeguards system Â however pivotal Â could not 
on its own guarantee the effective enforcement of non-proliferation obligations. One possible solution 
was the establishment of a standard whereby fresh fuel would only be supplied for nuclear power 
reactors by a recognized vendor on the understanding that the client undertook not to develop 
indigenous fuel cycle capabilities and that all the spent fuel was returned to the vendor. Such an 
arrangement would benefit countries planning to use nuclear power as they would not have to develop 
fuel cycle or storage facilities, and at the same time it would ensure safer and more secure 
management of the reactors and contain the proliferation risk. His delegation would support the 
establishment of a group of experts to consider the issue. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 5 

30. Turning to the ConferenceÂs agenda, he said that two draft resolutions concerning the Middle 
East stood out as extraneous to the AgencyÂs Statute and mission. Israel had made no secret of its 
fundamental reservations regarding the language and relevance of the resolution on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, and had formally distanced itself from the modalities of that 
resolution. However, in the interests of consensus, it would be prepared to endorse the language of the 
text of the previous yearÂs resolution, recognizing that a nuclear-weapon-free zone could serve as an 
important complement to overall peace and security in the region. By contrast, it saw no point and 
considerable danger in the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat. There had been many 
alarming proliferation developments in the Middle East and other regions, but none of them had 
involved his country. Israel had neither threatened its neighbours nor acted in defiance of any of its 
international commitments. Those that had requested the inclusion of the item on the agenda should 
recognize that there was no substitute for direct negotiation, reconciliation and agreements reached 
freely between the States of the region. Once good neighbourly relations had been established between 
all parties in the Middle East, the time would be right to move towards regional arms control and 
disarmament arrangements in conventional, chemical, biological and missile domains with a view to 
the establishment of a mutually verifiable nuclear-weapon-free zone. If any action were taken on that 
agenda item, his delegation would not be in a position to support the resolution on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East. 
31. Finally, he thanked the Agency for the technical assistance his country had received under a 
regional project on nuclear technology applications involving Israeli and Jordanian entrepreneurs. 
Also, the project on upgrading the area-wide control of the medfly using the SIT could serve as an 
excellent model for future regional cooperation. 
32. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) said the AgencyÂs importance in promoting international 
cooperation for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had been universally recognized. Also, it 
continued to play a crucial role with respect to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, as 
explicitly outlined in Article III of the NPT. His country was fully committed to the NPT regime, 
which was vital to the maintenance of international peace and stability. 
33. His delegation welcomed the six-party talks held recently in Beijing to discuss the DPRKÂs 
nuclear programme. The current crisis could be resolved peacefully through constructive dialogue 
with a view to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Nuclear proliferation was a matter of 
serious concern to the countries of that region, including his own. The Philippines therefore joined the 
international community in calling on the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons programmes in a 
verifiable manner and to return to the non-proliferation regime. He expressed support for the Director 
GeneralÂs determined efforts to resolve the issue. 
34. Referring to the resolution adopted by consensus by the Board of Governors 
on 12 September 2003 (document GOV/2003/69) on the implementation of the NPT safeguards 
agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran, he expressed the hope that Iran would cooperate fully with 
the Agency to resolve all the outstanding problems. All parties to the NPT had the inalienable right to 
develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination 
and in conformity with the TreatyÂs provisions. His delegation called on Iran to sign, conclude and 
implement an additional protocol promptly in order to allay the international communityÂs concerns 
about its nuclear programme. 
35. The technical cooperation projects undertaken between the Agency and the Philippines reflected 
his countryÂs human development policy objectives. The technical cooperation programme should be 
driven by the priorities defined by recipient Member States, in accordance with the principles laid 
down in document INFCIRC/267. The AgencyÂs activities continued to have a positive impact on the 
life of ordinary people in the Philippines. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 6 

36. In the area of agriculture, a four-year project on enhancing agricultural productivity through 
radiation technology on the island of Mindanao Â the prospective food basket of the nation Â aimed 
to develop new mutant varieties of rice and high-yielding fruit crops through the use of 
radiation-induced mutations and molecular techniques. 
37. In the field of human health, an ongoing project on neonatal screening for congenital 
hypothyroidism aimed to improve infant mortality in the first few weeks after birth. The programme 
had received substantial Agency support in addition to grants from the Philippine Council for 
Research and Development and the Canadian International Development Agency. Funding from the 
Agency over the previous three years had enhanced the capability of the PhilippineÂs Central 
Laboratory to undertake the project. The legal infrastructure for the procedure was being established 
by way of a congressional bill. The Newborn Screening Act would save an estimated 10 000 newborn 
babies annually from potential mental retardation and death. 
38. With respect to the environment, a project on nuclear analytical techniques for air quality 
management was generating data on air pollution sources and pollutant composition, and models for 
pollutant transport. The national environmental regulatory authorities would benefit from the project 
by acquiring a scientific basis for the formulation of air quality management plans and policies. Data 
from the project had already been used to supplement the national air quality status report. 
Furthermore, the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had made arrangements for Gent air samplers 
to be installed at two new sampling stations belonging to the Environmental Management Bureau of 
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and real-time monitors would be set up under 
the National Clear Air Act. 
39. The Philippines was continuing to work with the Agency to try to find a solution to problems 
with harmful algal blooms under the project on nuclear techniques to study the red tide problem. 
40. The International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources earlier in the year had 
produced welcome results that encouraged all States and the Secretariat not only to enhance national 
and international response arrangements but also to strengthen their mechanisms for the provision of 
assistance. The Philippines had incorporated those results into its own action plans. 
41. The recently revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources met 
the PhilippinesÂ need for enhanced security measures and thus had its wholehearted support. In that 
framework, the Agency was providing assistance in securing disused radioactive sources from three 
teletherapy units at two hospitals in the Philippines. 
42. Another project launched in 2003 on site selection and conceptual design of a near-surface 
disposal facility involved detailed site investigation, characterization, and evaluation of various 
nuclear waste disposal vulnerabilities and hazards. The project aimed to establish a disposal concept 
and repository design, including the completion of a repository safety assessment. 
43. The Philippines welcomed the outcome of the International Conference on the Safety of 
Transport of Radioactive Material, held in Vienna in July, and looked forward to further dialogue on 
the various issues that required cooperation among Member States. 
44. He thanked the Agency for assistance rendered for the project on human resource development 
and nuclear technology support, which aimed to upgrade and strengthen the skills and capabilities of 
human resources in the Philippines. 
45. The project on gas isotope geochemistry for geothermal resources management was generating 
primary data on the role of noble gases in water reservoir processes. Since few studies tackled the 
effects of field exploitation on noble gas composition and isotopic ratios, the findings would be 
beneficial in planning future reservoir management. Isotope and chemical techniques had led to a 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 7 

better understanding of the countryÂs aquifer systems. Progress had also been made in determining the 
relationship between aquifer systems and groundwater/surface water and in assessing aquifer 
vulnerability to contamination. End-users in Mindanao had already agreed to continue the study of 
groundwater contamination in support of their own water management efforts, and other districts were 
expected to follow suit. 

46. Mr. ZNIBER (Morocco), reiterating his countryÂs support for the AgencyÂs three pillars, namely 
verification, safety and security, and technology transfer, underlined the importance of the Agency to 
global peace and security, as well as to sustainable development. Given the recent problems it had had 
to face, particularly in the sphere of verification, the Agency needed more than ever the support of its 
Member States in terms of both personnel and finance in order to accomplish its tasks. 
47. The NPT had demonstrated that a strict and universal non-proliferation regime was justified. He 
urged all Member States that had not already done so to adhere to the Treaty and conclude safeguards 
agreements with the Agency. 
48. He reiterated his countryÂs support for the diplomatic efforts to establish peace on the Korean 
Peninsula. That objective could be obtained only through dialogue and within the framework of 
international law. He appealed to the DPRK to review its decision to withdraw from the NPT and to 
resume talks with the Agency and the other parties concerned with a view to full compliance with its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
49. Morocco shared the international communityÂs concerns regarding the continued threat of the 
deployment of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. It was disappointed at the lack of progress 
following the adoption of resolution GC(46)/RES/16 on the application of IAEA safeguards in that 
region. Israel still refused to submit all its installations and nuclear activities to Agency safeguards. 
That constituted a serious obstacle to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East. He therefore urged Israel, as a confidence-building measure, to adhere to the NPT and to accept 
Agency verification of its nuclear installations. Morocco supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to 
set up a forum with the participation of all the countries of the region to discuss the experiences of 
other regions in establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Security in the Middle East would not be 
achieved through the use of force, terror or nuclear threat. 
50. The Secretariat should increase its efforts to inform the public about the advantages of the 
application of nuclear techniques in the agricultural, health, hydrology and energy sectors. At the same 
time, the public should be made aware of the need for appropriate levels of safety and security. The 
Agency should do more to support countries in preparing emergency action plans in the event of a 
nuclear accident. 
51. The threat of nuclear terrorism must be taken very seriously. For that reason, all States should 
benefit from cooperation in putting nuclear safety and security infrastructures in place. Most of the 
AgencyÂs budget for the fight against nuclear terrorism should be allocated to that objective. 
52. With the help of the Agency, Morocco intended to draw up a national nuclear strategy aimed at 
establishing the necessary legislative and regulatory infrastructure and strengthening its regulatory 
authorities. Morocco was grateful for the bilateral cooperation it had received, which would soon lead 
to the official inauguration of the National Centre for Nuclear Energy and the siting of a nuclear 
reactor. 
53. Within the framework of its cooperation with the Agency in 2003, Morocco had organized a 
post-graduate course on radioprotection for specialists from French-speaking Africa and a second 
course would be held in Rabat in October 2004. Morocco had decided to extend cooperation with the 
Agency in that area to include English-speaking African countries. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 8 

54. In September 2003, in collaboration with the Agency and other organizations, Morocco had 
hosted the International Conference on National Infrastructures for Radiation Safety. That Conference 
had recommended assistance be given in the establishment of national infrastructures for radiation 
safety and the security of radioactive sources and had also emphasized the importance of training 
personnel in that regard. He urged the Director General to prepare an Agency action plan based on the 
conclusions of that Conference. 
55. The consensus obtained on the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2004Â2005 would 
contribute to a better balance between the AgencyÂs verification and technical cooperation activities. 
Although some matters remained unresolved, he was sure that the SecretariatÂs efforts would ensure 
that any difficulties could be overcome. He encouraged all Member States to increase, where possible, 
their voluntary contributions to the TCF. 
56. Morocco needed more Agency cooperation in the application of nuclear techniques for water 
resource management to combat drought and desertification, by which it was particularly affected, and 
also in the health sector. 
57. The amendment to Article VI of the Statute had still not entered into force although it had been 
adopted at the 43rd Regular Session of the General Conference in 1999. To date only 36 countries, 
including Morocco, had deposited their instruments of acceptance. That slow rate of acceptance was 
damaging democratization within the international institutions and so he proposed that the matter be 
included on the list of priority texts for the United Nations. 
58. Mr. BARIEV (Belarus) said that transition to sustainable development was of vital ecological 
importance in the modern world. Continued population growth and the growing needs of the 
developing world would certainly mean an increasing energy demand and Belarus had not ruled out 
the possibility of developing its own nuclear energy programme. With a view to the possible 
construction of a nuclear power plant in 2005, site selection, a feasibility study and a safety assessment 
of various types of modern reactor had already been carried out. 
59. His delegation shared the AgencyÂs concerns with regard to the decreasing number of qualified 
nuclear energy specialists and the potential loss of nuclear knowledge as a result of the ageing nuclear 
workforce. Belarus was doing everything within its powers to remedy the situation by participating in 
expert meetings on nuclear knowledge management and was implementing training programmes 
jointly with the Agency, including three-month regional postgraduate courses on radiation protection 
and the safe use of ionizing radiation sources. 
60. Belarus scientists were continuing research in the nuclear field within the framework of 
cooperation with the International Science and Technology Center (ISTC), and those endeavours were 
supported by the Government. 
61. Recognizing that the safe management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste remained 
very much a topical issue worldwide, Belarus had acceded in 2002 to the Joint Convention. 
62. Reconstruction of the Ekores radioactive waste disposal facility was still in progress, and 
substantial improvements to the national regulatory requirements for waste management were needed. 
Belarus hoped that it could count on Agency support in resolving outstanding problems. 
63. He reiterated his countryÂs interest in participating in the Tripartite Initiative, not only for the 
return of spent research reactor fuel given the lack of scope for long-term storage or reprocessing in 
Belarus, but also for dealing with the radioactive waste disposal sites that still remained in areas of 
Belarus where Soviet troops had been deployed and for which no technical documents were available. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 9 

64. Nuclear and radiation security were key AgencyÂs activities and presented a challenge to all 
States. The March 2003 International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources had underscored 
the importance of international cooperation to ensure the security of sources and prevention of 
unauthorized trafficking in them in the context of the war on terrorism. 
65. In 2003 the Government of Belarus had passed a decree requiring that provision be made for the 
return of spent radiation sources to the manufacturer. Like many other countries, Belarus faced the 
problem of locating orphaned sources in order to avert the threat to public health and possible 
economic damage. Forty-six orphaned sources had been found in Belarus in 2003 alone. 
66. The physical protection of nuclear material was crucial to ensuring nuclear and radiation safety 
and the security of nuclear material, and to combating international terrorism. Belarus welcomed the 
AgencyÂs efforts in that area, including the process to amend the CPPNM. Belarus had been an active 
participant in that process and looked forward to the convening of a diplomatic conference to adopt the 
amendments. 
67. BelarusÂ own physical protection system was set up in 1996 with the support of Japan, Sweden 
and the USA. The assistance of donor States was still needed to support its continued operation. 
68. In connection with nuclear non-proliferation, Belarus had voluntarily renounced nuclear 
weapons and ensured their withdrawal from national territory. Also, it had signed the NPT as a 
non-nuclear-weapon State party and an agreement for the application of safeguards. In June 2003, the 
President of Belarus had passed a decision to initiate negotiations on the text of an additional protocol 
to that agreement, which would hopefully be submitted to the Board of Governors in the near future. 
69. A significant hindrance to the development of nuclear power was public concerns about the 
possible consequences of accidents. The Chernobyl disaster had had a significant impact in that regard 
and it was important for the international community that its consequences be thoroughly investigated 
and that practical approaches to overcoming them be found. His delegation welcomed the recent 
creation of an International Scientific Forum on Chernobyl, an initiative proposed by the Director 
General during his visit to Belarus in August 2001. The Forum had an important role to play in 
assessing the radioecological and medical consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. That assessment 
would serve as the basis for an action plan to mitigate the negative effects on mankind and the 
environment of what had been the worst incident in the history of the nuclear industry. Belarus hoped 
that an international conference would be convened in 2004 to draw together the conclusions of the 
ForumÂs work, with a view to developing a clear strategy for future action and to mobilizing the 
financial resources needed to rehabilitate the affected territories and achieve economic revival and 
sustainable development. The work of the Forum should be conducted in a spirit of constructive 
cooperation with the International Chernobyl Research and Information Network (ICRIN) under the 
aegis of the United Nations. 
70. Belarus was developing and implementing new Chernobyl initiatives, one of which was the 
Cooperation for Rehabilitation Programme, begun in 2003. It envisaged a comprehensive and 
integrated solution to problems relating to radiation protection, health care, environmental protection, 
economic development in the affected areas and education. It had broad support from European 
countries and international organizations, including UNESCO and the OSCE. Belarus hoped that the 
Agency would also take part in the Programme. 
71. Stressing the importance of technical cooperation between the Agency and Belarus, he said that 
his countryÂs CPF had been approved in March 2003. 
72. Finally, he said that in 2003 Belarus had met its financial obligations to the Agency in full and 
would strive to do so in future. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 10 

73. Mr. OLMOS (Bolivia) underlined the importance his country attached to its ties with the 
Agency, particularly with regard to technical cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. 
Two projects were being implemented in 2003Â2004 on radiotherapy and water contamination, with 
an allocated budget of more than $400 000. He expressed the hope that the Agency would be able to 
contribute funds towards implementation of a third project relating to the control of pesticide residues, 
to which the Bolivian Government had made an extrabudgetary contribution of $22 000. The total 
estimated budget for the project was $150 000. 
74. Despite BoliviaÂs difficult economic situation, it continued to make its assessed contributions to 
the Regular Budget in full and on time. As part of its contributions to the TCF it had recently 
allocated $100 000 for the acquisition of a cobalt machine for a project to upgrade radiotherapy 
services (BOL/6/024). In addition, during the previous programme cycle, it had paid $80 000 to a 
project supporting the nuclear medicine centres in Cochabamba and Sucre (BOL/6/022). His 
delegation commended the innovative approach of the Latin America Section in the Department of 
Technical Cooperation to strengthening project management and had proposed that the city of Santa Cruz 
de la Sierra host a regional seminar for the submission of projects proposals for the 2005Â2006 cycle 
using that methodology. In the same context, the recent workshop on the planning and design of technical 
cooperation projects with the Agency using the logical framework methodology had been a great success. 
It would not only facilitate project planning, selection and implementation but also optimize the use of 
resources. 
75. To avoid the accumulation of debts as had occurred in the past, the Bolivian Institute for 
Nuclear Science and Technology had been instructed, as the national regulatory authority, to transfer 
responsibility for meeting those obligations to the institutions or bodies benefiting from cooperation 
projects. 
76. Within the framework of ARCAL, Bolivia was participating in 13 projects, related primarily to 
nuclear chemistry, nuclear medicine, agriculture and radiation protection. 
77. The Office of Nuclear Security was to be commended for its active promotion of a regional 
seminar for representatives of MERCOSUR, Chile and Bolivia on the detection and control of radioactive 
materials at border crossings, to be held in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay, in October 2003. The goal of the 
seminar was to discuss illicit trafficking in radioactive materials, to optimize detection methods and to 
coordinate control and security mechanisms. Bolivia had offered to host a similar event in collaboration 
with the Agency and with the involvement of the Andean countries, possibly in the first quarter of 2004. 
78. He thanked the Agency for its help in dealing with incidents involving radioactive materials which 
had been reported in Bolivia over the past year. 
79. In August 2003, Bolivia had deposited its instruments of accession to the Assistance Convention 
and the Early Notification Convention, a further demonstration of the importance it attached to 
strengthening its relations with the Agency. 
Mr. Alang Md. Rashid (Malaysia) took the Chair. 

80. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey) congratulated the Agency on its achievements during the preceding 
year. Projects on new generation nuclear reactors and fuel cycles, such as INPRO Â which aimed to 
support safe, sustainable, economic and proliferation resistant use of nuclear technology to meet 21st 
century energy needs Â would provide significant help to countries retaining nuclear energy as a 
long-term option. The Agency should continue those activities, finding synergies between INPRO and 
the Generation IV International Forum, and encourage cooperation between Member States under the 
framework of INPRO.

81. Turkey supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and 
verification mechanisms. It was gratifying that the Agency had concluded that all the nuclear material 
and other items placed under safeguards had been accounted for, with the exception of the nuclear 
material in the DPRK. The developments of the past year had shown there was a need to take further 
concrete measures to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
82. Universal adherence to the additional protocol was essential and Turkey, which had ratified an 
additional protocol, supported all Agency initiatives to that end. He called on all Member States that 
had not yet done so to ratify and implement such a protocol without delay. 
83. Concerned that the Agency had been unable to verify the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, his 
delegation supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to negotiate with the DPRK requirements and 
modalities for compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement. It welcomed the six-party talks held 
recently in Beijing and supported diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the DPRK nuclear 
issue. 
84. While the Islamic Republic of Iran had shown increased cooperation in providing information to 
the Agency, full and unconditional cooperation on its part, as spelled out in the resolution contained in 
document GOV/2003/69, was needed for prompt resolution of the outstanding issues. Iran should 
conclude and bring into force an additional protocol as soon as possible, thereby demonstrating its 
commitment to non-proliferation. 
85. He commended the work of the Director General and the Secretariat in implementing the 
Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq. However, more needed to be done for a full and complete 
verification of IraqÂs nuclear programme. The Agency should remain ready to resume its verification 
activities and await further guidance from the Security Council. 
86. Nuclear security and protection against nuclear terrorism were high priorities for Turkey. As 
part of its continuing efforts to enhance its capability to combat the threat of nuclear terrorism, Turkey 
had invited the Agency to carry out an IPPAS mission in July 2003 and would duly consider the 
recommendations of that mission. 
87. The safety of nuclear and radioactive materials was crucial to the credibility of nuclear 
technology. He welcomed the progress made in recent years with respect to nuclear, radiation, waste 
and transport safety, and in the revision of safety standards. The revised action plans for the safety and 
security of radioactive sources and on occupational radiation protection should be implemented 
widely. The adoption of the revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources had also been a positive step. All those measures would enhance the global safety and security 
culture and would provide a basis for cooperation in that field. 
88. Another priority was the safe transport of nuclear and radioactive materials and Turkey 
welcomed the progress made in that field as envisaged in resolution GC(46)/RES/9B. A TranSAS 
mission had visited Turkey in March 2003 and its recommendations would benefit future work on 
transport safety, including the possible modification of national legislative and institutional structures. 
TranSAS was the best mechanism to assess the degree of implementation of internationally recognized 
standards by Member States and its reports would have a positive impact on international efforts to 
establish an overall transport safety culture. The International Conference on the Safety of Transport 
of Radioactive Material, held in July 2003 in Vienna, had examined all aspects of the topic and had 
served as a platform to develop ideas and recommendations for future work. Turkey was willing to 
participate in the preparation of an action plan based on the findings and recommendations of that 
Conference. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 12 

89. Turkey had supported the recent consensus on the AgencyÂs budget, believing that it would 
enable the Agency to carry out its activities in a balanced manner. He hoped that in future all of its 
core programmes could be funded from the Regular Budget. His delegation was confident that the 
Secretariat would continue to find ways of achieving efficiency and effectiveness in all of its activities, 
especially safeguards. 
90. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were an essential part of the sustainable 
development process. Turkey was pleased with the achievements of its national and regional 
cooperation projects in 2002. Work remained to be done to increase project implementation rates. His 
delegation supported the central criterion approach, and felt that the new technical cooperation 
strategy was key to programme planning, a crucial part of the technical cooperation programme. 
91. Mr. MURPHY (Ireland) said that the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction had 
acquired new urgency and the associated challenges needed to be addressed and resolved. Common 
challenges were best met by a common response and Ireland was firmly committed to the principle of 
shared responsibility with respect to global peace and security. 
92. Nowhere was the multilateral approach more important than in the area of nuclear 
non-proliferation. The NPT, as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, was essential in 
the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. The Agency played a vital role in that regime and it was essential 
that it received the fullest and broadest support from its Member States. 
93. The NPT had faced several critical challenges from within and without, namely the DPRKÂs 
defiance of its NPT safeguard obligations, the unresolved questions over IranÂs nuclear programme, 
the effort to verify IraqÂs nuclear capabilities, the failure of some countries to conclude and bring into 
force NPT safeguards agreements, and stagnation as regards nuclear disarmament and universality. 
Efforts must be redoubled to resolve those matters and to strengthen the non-proliferation system. 
94. The DPRK nuclear issue demonstrated the need for the multilateral verification system provided 
by the Agency. Ireland welcomed the recent six-party talks in Beijing and hoped that progress would 
be made in resolving the issue. His delegation urged Iran to provide accelerated cooperation with the 
Agency and full transparency in relation to its nuclear programme. As for Iraq, the Agency continued 
to have responsibilities under the terms of that countryÂs NPT safeguards agreement; he hoped it 
would be in a position to discharge them soon. 
95. The relationship between nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament lay at the core of 
the NPT and those two concepts were mutually reinforcing. The right to develop atomic energy for 
peaceful purposes brought with it certain responsibilities regarding the need to ensure that nuclear 
material and equipment intended for peaceful use were not used for the production of nuclear weapons 
and regarding the need to follow best practise in relation to security, safety and transport matters. 
96. Ireland had benefited considerably from its 30-year membership of the Agency, and valued the 
AgencyÂs research and publications and the opportunity to participate in its work. Specialists from 
IrelandÂs Radiological Protection Institute had participated in training courses, both as contributors 
and participants. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to share and transfer nuclear technology, 
particularly where it could provide safe, sustainable and long-term solutions in such areas as 
agriculture, human health and water resources. 
97. IrelandÂs policy vis-Ã -vis nuclear energy and associated activities, such as reprocessing, was 
unambiguous. Nuclear energy could not provide a sustainable energy resource and its benefits were 
significantly outweighed by the risks it posed to public health and the environment. Despite the threat 
of global warming, there were no grounds for a re-evaluation of the nuclear energy option. The 
problems associated with nuclear energy and greenhouse gas emissions were two distinct 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 13 

environmental challenges. Not all countries shared those views, but all Member States had a joint 
interest in managing and reducing the risks associated with nuclear energy. A global approach was 
necessary in view of the transboundary and international issues raised by its use. 

98. Ireland was concerned about the fact that nuclear energy continued to be promoted although the 
matter of nuclear waste management remained unresolved. It was wrong for radioactive waste to be 
discharged deliberately into the terrestrial and marine environment. 
99. The transport of radioactive materials through a shared marine environment was another cause 
for concern. Thus, the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, 
held in Vienna in July 2003, had been timely. Ireland, which had participated actively in that 
Conference, welcomed as one of its outcomes the creation of an international expert group on nuclear 
liability. Further, it supported the ConferenceÂs recommendation that informal discussions should 
continue on communication between governments with the involvement of the Agency. Also, it 
endorsed the finding that further discussion was needed to develop an international response 
capability. Those outcomes provided a platform on which to build the mutual confidence needed 
between nuclear and non-nuclear States. He therefore encouraged all States to participate 
constructively and proactively in those activities. 
100. Ireland continued to support the TCF and acknowledged the important role the technical 
cooperation programme played in upgrading safety in recipient States. That programmeÂs main focus 
should be on nuclear safety and radiation protection, and not the development of nuclear power. 
Ireland had paid in full its share of the TCF target for 2003 and had also made a contribution to the 
NSF. 
101. Ms. MELIN (Sweden) said weapons of mass destruction remained one of the greatest threats to 
international peace and security and there was also a risk of their proliferation. Chief amongst current 
concerns were the DPRKÂs announcement that it intended to withdraw from the NPT and its repeated 
threats to develop nuclear weapons; the continued refusal by India, Israel and Pakistan to accede to the 
NPT; the serious questions raised regarding the intention behind IranÂs ambitious nuclear programme; 
the lack of progress in nuclear disarmament and the failure to bring the CTBT into force; and the risk of 
nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists. 
102. Those were common threats and as such required common solutions. A strong multilateral 
framework with strong international cooperation to implement it was necessary, as well as the 
creativity to envisage new situations. The European Union had recently adopted a set of basic 
measures and an action plan to combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Sweden had 
initiated an independent international commission on disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction to be chaired by Dr. Hans Blix. 
103. Universal adherence to the NPT and its full implementation, including additional protocols in 
force in all States, would increase global safety. She called on all States that had not yet done so to 
conclude and bring into force additional protocols. That would give the Agency the enhanced 
authority it needed and build trust within the international community. In that context, she welcomed 
the agreement that had been reached on the AgencyÂs budget providing additional resources for 
verification. 
104. Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) expressed the intention to revisit the mandates of the 
Agency and UNMOVIC. Sweden felt that should be done as soon as possible. Agency inspections still 
needed to be completed to resolve the remaining questions about IraqÂs nuclear programme. 
Irrespective of the Security Council resolutions, the Agency had a continuing responsibility under 
IraqÂs NPT safeguards agreement to ensure that Iraq had declared all its nuclear activities and that they 
were all for peaceful purposes. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 14 

105. Her delegation supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at protection against nuclear terrorism, 
which complemented national efforts. Her Government had decided to make an additional 
contribution of 200 000 Swedish krona to the AgencyÂs NSF. 
106. Sweden supported the proposed amendment to expand the scope of the CPPNM, agreed in 
March 2003, and hoped that the amendment would enter into force soon. 
107. The organizational meeting of the Joint Convention, held in April 2003, had been successful. 
The Swedish national report had been submitted in May and preparations were progressing well for 
the first Review Meeting under that Convention. Her country was confident that the meeting would 
bring about safety improvements comparable to those achieved under the Nuclear Safety Convention. 
108. Global nuclear safety needed to be continuously improved through exchanges of experience 
between countries. Sweden was a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs programme to develop safety 
standards and to provide for their application as they formed a solid basis for national safety 
regulations. 
109. Inadequately protected radioactive sources were a potential cause of fatal accidents and were 
prone to theft, illicit trafficking and other malevolent acts. Sweden welcomed the recent approval by 
the Board of Governors of the Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the 
revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
110. The AgencyÂs greater focus on protection of the environment from the effects of ionizing 
radiation was another step in the right direction. An international conference on that topic would be 
held in Stockholm in October 2003 in cooperation with the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority. 
Sweden hoped that it would achieve significant results. 
111. The final disposal of radioactive waste would be the subject of the Stockholm International 
Conference on Geological Repositories to be held in December 2003. Hosted by the Swedish Nuclear 
Fuel and Waste Management Company in conjunction with the Agency, the OECD/NEA and the 
European Commission, it would provide a forum for the discussion of issues relating to geological 
disposal. 
112. Sweden was completing the design of an encapsulation plant for spent nuclear fuel and aimed to 
finish work on the design of the major components in the next few years. It was participating in the 
AgencyÂs work to develop a safeguards approach for an encapsulation plant and for a final repository 
for spent nuclear fuel. An early outcome of that work was essential if Sweden, and other Member 
States, were to incorporate that approach in its final design. 
113. Sweden and Canada were about to hand over a digital Cerenkov viewing device (DCVD) to the 
Agency. It had been developed within the safeguards support programme and would enable inspectors 
to identify spent fuel that had been cooled for 40 years and to store the information for future analysis. 
114. In conclusion, she said that Sweden had pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2004 in 
recognition of the importance it attached to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. 
115. Monsignor BOCCARDI (Holy See), having expressed appreciation for the Director GeneralÂs 
leadership in the past important year for the Agency, said there was an increased sense of 
precariousness and fear in society due, among other things, to terrorism, to the current situation in Iraq 
and the Holy Land, and to some dangerous trends in nuclear safety and security. The Agency, which 
had always been dedicated to the ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ vision, was facing new challenges and 
opportunities. In the global pursuit of a culture of peace, it was essential to foster a climate of trust, 
cooperation and respect between all States and to maintain a readiness for dialogue 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 15 

116. Highlighting the professionalism of the AgencyÂs safeguards inspectors, he called on all parties 
to facilitate their mission by providing them with enough time, material assistance, intelligence 
information and scientific support. A strengthened safeguards system would increase the likelihood of 
detecting any clandestine nuclear weapons programme. Agency verification was crucial to the 
international communityÂs efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Verification must be 
done through impartial, international inspections in order to guarantee credibility. Verification on its 
own was, however, not enough; the nuclear disarmament process needed to be invigorated. 
117. The increase in poverty, which was caused in part by the lack of access to drinking and other 
water supplies, called for new and innovative solutions in water resource management. He 
commended the AgencyÂs chairmanship of UN Water, an inter-agency coordination committee for 
fresh water, for the period 2002Â2004. The Agency had held its first international symposium on water 
resources 40 years previously, and since then had organized some 150 projects in 60 countries to 
improve water management using isotope hydrology. Also, he urged the Agency to continue its 
nuclear seawater desalination activities in cooperation with interested Member States. 
118. Nuclear installations were getting older every day and the decommissioning of nuclear plants 
and facilities was becoming a significant global activity. Open questions remained and there was a 
lack of agreement on some of the key Âend pointsÂ for decommissioning, in particular criteria for 
recycling or the disposal of large amounts of very lightly contaminated construction materials and for 
the release of decontaminated land or buildings for general reuse. He urged the Agency to take an 
active part in the international negotiations under way in that regard, offering its vast experience and 
excellent human resources to bring them to a successful conclusion. 
119. Ms. SIMOPOULOU (Greece) said the AgencyÂs nuclear safety activities were of paramount 
importance to her country. Greece had always played an active role in that regard, joining the IRSRR, 
ratifying the Convention on Nuclear Safety and participating in its third Review Conference, which 
had brought considerable progress on a number of very important issues. Nevertheless, work remained 
to be done and greater cooperation and transparency were required. To promote nuclear safety, the 
Greek Atomic Energy Commission would be signing a bilateral agreement with the US Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission on the exchange of technical information and cooperation in nuclear safety 
matters. 
120. Greece supported efforts aimed at developing and strengthening the safety standards for fuel 
cycle facilities, especially the AgencyÂs efforts to establish and maintain a global safety regime 
through the adoption of a number of action plans. In that connection, it was regrettable that as yet no 
draft action plan on the safety of decommissioning of nuclear activities had been submitted by the 
Secretariat. She encouraged the Secretariat to increase its efforts to ensure the implementation of its 
standards by all States in close cooperation with other international and regional organizations. 
121. Greece also supported the drafting of an international action plan for occupational radiation 
protection, the revision of the Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and 
establishment of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, as well as 
the BoardÂs decision to establish safety standards on site evaluation for nuclear installations and on 
remediation of areas contaminated by past activities and accidents. 
122. In 2003, the Greek Atomic Energy Commission had hosted an Agency postgraduate educational 
course on radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources, and was in the process of becoming 
a regional postgraduate educational centre in radiation protection to serve the needs of Member States 
in Europe. 
123. Her Government also attached great importance to nuclear security issues and had provided 
financial and in-kind voluntary contributions to the NSF. In July 2003, it had agreed to a 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 16 

comprehensive cooperation programme in the field of nuclear and radiological security, including a 
project focusing on the forthcoming 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. The first international mission to 
Greece under that project had recently been completed and others were scheduled to follow. 

124. A strengthened safeguards system, with the universal application of the additional protocol, 
adequate amendment of the CPPNM and an export control regime Â properly adapted to current 
conditions Â that was applied and respected by all would help prevent potential terrorist threats. Her 
country hoped that the amendment to the CPPNM would be finalized and that a diplomatic conference 
would soon be convened in that regard. 
125. Greece, which was strongly committed to the universal non-proliferation regime and the 
AgencyÂs verification role in it, welcomed completion of the conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards. What was required now was the rapid conclusion of additional protocols, which 
unfortunately had been concluded by only some 35 countries to date. Greece had concluded its 
additional protocol and had taken the appropriate steps for its implementation. 
126. The evaluation of information about a StateÂs nuclear programme was becoming an important 
part of the safeguards conclusions process and her delegation also noted the progress made in 
increasing the AgencyÂs remote monitoring system. 
127. The universal application of the safeguards system remained one of the basic components of 
international nuclear security, holding nuclear terrorism at bay, providing assurances and 
re-establishing faith in the peaceful uses of atomic energy in accordance with the NPT and the 
AgencyÂs Statute. Greece supported the recent resolution on the Islamic Republic of Iran, contained in 
document GOV/2003/69, and encouraged Iran to conclude an additional protocol without delay. 
128. As both a donor and recipient country of technical assistance, Greece fully appreciated the 
contribution of technical cooperation to the promotion of the scientific, technological and regulatory 
capabilities of participating Member States. It had contributed its full share of the TCF target for 2002 
and 2003 and intended to do so for 2004 and 2005. Greece offered training places in laboratories for 
Agency fellows, provided experts to participate in Agency activities, and hosted and supported events 
under the technical cooperation programme. For example, the Greek Atomic Energy Commission 
would be co-financing the upcoming meeting on subregional projects for the European Mediterranean 
countries addressing environmental issues. She commended the staff of the Department of Technical 
Cooperation, in particular the Europe Section, on their outstanding efforts. 
129. Mr. MOREJÃN-ALMEIDA (Ecuador) underlined the AgencyÂs increasingly important role 
with respect to global security. In controlling nuclear materials it helped prevent the possible 
consequences of their accidental or malicious use, and in transferring nuclear technologies for peaceful 
uses it helped encourage global development. 
130. Since the previous General Conference, many significant world events had occurred. In view of 
the great challenges facing the international community, it was more vital than ever that States 
participated actively in all the relevant forums to promote peaceful co-habitation, cooperation between 
States, firm commitment to encouraging the development of all of the worldÂs populations, and efforts 
to preserve multilateralism in international relations. 
131. Ecuador endorsed the need for the Agency to maintain a reliable verification system as an 
integral part of the security of Member States. Security was also linked to development and the 
Agency played a significant role in the struggle against poverty, in sustainable development and in the 
areas of health, agriculture, energy, nutrition and the environment. Ecuador therefore unconditionally 
supported the AgencyÂs activities under its three pillars: the transfer of technology, safety and 
verification. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 17 

132. With regard to the AgencyÂs programme and budget, particular attention should be paid to 
strengthening the TCF, which had a direct impact on developing countries. 
133. Ecuador was a pioneer in upholding the rights of coastal States. It was co-founder of and 
provided the seat for the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific (CPPS) and made every effort 
to preserve the sea both as an integral part of the environment and as a resource for future generations. 
His delegation had welcomed the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive 
Material held in Vienna in July 2003. Ecuador encouraged the AgencyÂs efforts regarding the transport 
of radioactive material, in particular on maritime routes and concerning liability and communication 
between States. The establishment of a group of experts by the Director General to explore and advise 
on issues related to nuclear liability was a step in the right direction. 
134. His country was a co-sponsor of the resolution on strengthening the effectiveness and improving 
the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the Model Additional Protocols, which was 
an essential tool to ensuring greater security. It also supported other resolutions, especially those 
related to strengthening the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, and strengthening its activities 
related to nuclear science, technology and applications. 
135. As a country benefiting from Agency technical cooperation, Ecuador was grateful to the 
Secretariat for its efforts in that regard. He hoped there would be an increased focus on assistance in 
the fields of radiation safety, nuclear medicine and training. The Agency was also carrying out 
valuable work under ARCAL. 
136. Ecuador had requested and received assistance in the past year relating to the security of 
radiation sources under the Assistance Convention. As a result of that emergency, the Ecuadorian 
Government had taken immediate steps to strengthen its regulatory and control mechanisms for 
radiation sources. He commended the Agency on its dynamic efforts in that regard, in particular in 
organizing the International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources in March 2003 and in 
revision of the relevant Code of Conduct. 
137. His country had also adopted measures to strengthen the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy 
Commission, including making progress in preparing the national radiological emergency plan, in 
identifying potential areas for nuclear applications such as in water management, and in strengthening 
national capabilities through the training of specialists. 
138. Mr. DJEKSHENKULOV (Kyrgyzstan) said that, since joining the Agency the previous year, 
his country had ratified a law adopting the AgencyÂs Statute and had sent its ratification papers to 
New York. As a full Member State of the Agency, he hoped that Kyrgyzstan would contribute to the 
international nuclear non-proliferation regime and help strengthen global peace and stability. 
139. Since becoming an independent State, KyrgyzstanÂs atomic energy policy had always been in 
line with the AgencyÂs basic principles, giving particular importance to the non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. Kyrgyzstan had also taken measures to prevent the illicit trafficking of 
nuclear materials in Kyrgyzstan. 
140. His country was working actively towards the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central 
Asia. That would constitute a major positive step at both the regional and subregional level. With the 
help of the international community, the Central Asian countries had established a group of experts 
from their region, which had been working hard to attain consensus on the text of a treaty on the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. He was confident that those joint efforts 
would bring the matter to its logical conclusion. 
141. Kyrgyzstan had been experiencing grave ecological problems, which had a serious impact on 
Central Asia as a whole. Uranium mining in Kyrgyzstan in the 1960s during the Soviet era had 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 18 

left 35 tailings dumps containing radioactive waste and 25 mining waste dumps containing 
unprocessed uranium ore which, if nothing were done, threatened to contaminate the Fergana Valley, 
the most densely populated valley in Central Asia, affecting not only Kyrgyzstan but also Uzbekistan, 
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. His Government was taking all possible measures to resolve the situation. 
It had established a legislative basis for the rehabilitation of the tailings dumps and mining waste 
dumps, had compiled design, technical and operational documentation, had drawn up preliminary 
maps of the transboundary ecological risk posed by the tailings dumps, and had carried out emergency 
repair work. Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were collaborating in a joint work plan to rehabilitate the 
tailings dumps in the town of Majluu-Suu, which included inspections, monitoring and the 
development and implementation of plans for rehabilitation and recultivation of the sites. 

142. During its ten years of independence, Kyrgyzstan had participated in numerous international 
forums and had initiated several expert meetings, conferences and seminars relating to ecological 
problems resulting from uranium waste. 
143. Kyrgyzstan could not solve the problem alone; it was in need of urgent international help in 
terms of resources and expert assistance. His delegation hoped that the Agency would offer its 
assistance in that regard. 
144. Mr. ARIYAPRUCHYA (Thailand) said that over the previous year the Agency had made 
considerable progress in the three pillars of its work. The benefits gained by Member States would 
enhance global security and promote sustainable development. 
145. The AgencyÂs verification efforts in Iraq had been commendable. The security situation there 
must be stabilized as soon as possible to ensure the safety of ground personnel working in Iraq and for 
the Iraqi people to live a normal life. With regard to the situation in the DPRK, Thailand commended 
the six-party talks held in Beijing in August 2003. As for the Islamic Republic of Iran, he hoped that 
that country would continue to cooperate with the Agency with a view to full clarification of its 
uranium enrichment programme. 
146. Thailand supported the AgencyÂs strengthened safeguards system. It was taking appropriate 
steps to ratify its additional protocol and was grateful to the Agency for the helpful activities it had 
undertaken in that regard, particularly the international seminar on strengthened safeguards held in 
December 2002, and the national workshop on the additional protocol and the regional workshop on 
the same topic held in March and April 2003, respectively. 
147. The Agency had made substantial progress in nuclear safety and security and his delegation 
welcomed the initiatives on codes of conduct and action plans. Thailand was prepared to fully 
cooperate with the Agency and its Member States in the implementation of Agency activities, 
especially on capacity building and preparedness in the Southeast Asia region. Thai experts had 
participated in the International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna in 
March, and the International Conference on National Infrastructures for Radiation Safety, held in 
Morocco in September 2003. 
148. At a national level, changes in government structure had resulted in the former Office of Atomic 
Energy for Peace (OAEP), ThailandÂs counterpart institution with the Agency, being renamed the 
Office of Atoms for Peace (OAP). Its new mandate was to act as the regulatory authority for nuclear 
and radiation safety and safeguards. Research and development in the field of nuclear science and 
technology would be transferred to a new entity. 
149. Thailand had participated actively in model projects on upgrading radiation protection 
infrastructure, which had been instrumental in developing an effective regulatory authority. The OAP 
was carrying out its regulatory function in line with the Basic Safety Standards and with the guidance 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 19 

of those model projects. Furthermore, those projects had contributed to the drafting of new nuclear 
legislation. 

150. He called on the Agency to continue working closely with Member States to develop their 
national safety regulatory infrastructure and to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear 
radiation, transport and waste safety. Thailand was grateful to the Agency for the support and 
expertise it had provided in that regard. 
151. Sustained development of atomic energy safety regulations in developing countries required the 
support of the political and technical authorities in those countries, as well as from various United 
Nations organizations. He urged the Agency to make its activities in safety more well known and 
suggested that the Director General make an annual statement at the General Assembly on safety, and 
not just verification, achievements. 
152. Thailand had benefited from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme in the areas of 
human health, agriculture and industrial development through both national and regional projects, 
including those under the RCA. The Agency should continue providing tangible and sustainable 
technical cooperation to developing Member States and said that projects should be geared to 
supporting the economic development of such States. 
153. Specific areas in which Thailand had obtained Agency assistance were nuclear medicine; 
research and development on nutrition through food fortification and the bio-availability of indigenous 
food; the use of the SIT in mango crops; and industrial radiation technology for sterilizing medical 
supplies and for industrial gauges. In addition, a number of Thai research contract holders were 
learning about new areas of application in priority areas. He thanked the Departments of Technical 
Cooperation and of Nuclear Sciences and Applications for their cooperation. 
154. He commended and supported the AgencyÂs programme on fellowships and scientific visits for 
on-the-job training in agriculture and medicine, particularly under the long-standing concept of TCDC. 
155. Thailand attached high importance to the promotion of a global safety culture and encouraged 
the Agency to promote safety in its technical cooperation programmes especially in the areas of health, 
education and training. There was also a need for the Agency to identify specific projects on radiation 
protection infrastructure, quality assurance in medical applications, food safety, the application of 
isotopic and nuclear techniques is nutrition research and water resource development, public 
information and knowledge management as part of its core activities. 
156. Finally, he announced that Thailand wished to pledge $209 300 to the TCF for 2004. 
157. Mr. CABELLO SARUBBI (Paraguay) said that the reasons underlying the creation of the 
Agency fifty years previously were still valid, namely the desire to control nuclear weapons and the 
need for all nations to benefit from the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The AgencyÂs security 
and cooperation missions had continued to grow and the needs of Member States had still not been 
completely fulfilled. Given the limited resources available, especially in poorer countries, a constant 
debate about priorities was unavoidable. However, there was also a minimum level of resources below 
which any organization would not be able to work effectively. In the past, the Agency had maintained 
a balance between its core activities. Now, however, Paraguay was concerned that that balance could 
be affected and there would be a negative impact on the promotion of peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy. 
158. Paraguay acknowledged that there were serious challenges to global security from the possible 
use of radioactive sources or nuclear weapons by terrorist organizations or from governments 
influenced by fanatics or ideological extremists.

159. The International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources, held in Vienna earlier in the 
year, had highlighted the possible illicit uses of radioactive sources by people with malicious 
intentions and the accidents that could occur when using such sources. His delegation therefore 
supported any measures aimed at better control of radioactive sources. The recently established NSF, 
to which Paraguay was willing to contribute, would encourage good practices and agreed procedures 
for enhancing security in countries with few financial and technological resources. 
160. Paraguay was grateful to the Agency for its assistance in the convening of the first regional 
seminar on the control and detection of radioactive material at border crossings. By hosting that 
seminar, it was clear that his Government was committed to global security and that it hoped that 
Paraguay and its neighbouring countries would not be used for the illicit transport or handling of 
radioactive sources. 
161. He expressed concern that some States possessing advanced nuclear technology could avoid, or 
wilfully not comply with, their Agency safeguards agreements, therefore casting doubt on the intended 
purpose of their nuclear programmes. 
162. The growing threat of terrorism in recent years and the possibility that terrorist organizations 
could obtain mass destruction technologies was alarming. The AgencyÂs security activities should 
enjoy the full support of all the Member States and adequate resources. 
163. However, that should never be to the detriment of each StateÂs need to acquire nuclear energy 
for health, food, or conservation of its vital resources. Although consensus had been reached on the 
budget by the Board of Governors and a seeming balance was being maintained, Paraguay was 
concerned that growing inroads were being made on the limited resources of the developing countries 
on account of the real growth of the AgencyÂs budget. That gradual growth would become more 
difficult for developing economies to sustain. An additional factor was payment in euros for countries 
whose national budgets were tied to the United States dollar. 
164. The assistance provided by the Agency in previous decades had been vital for promoting the 
peaceful use of atomic energy and its concomitant benefits, notably in the fields of medicine and 
agriculture. As such, it was an activity that should be strengthened. The results of the research work 
carried out at the AgencyÂs laboratories in Seibersdorf in the context of CRPs and the training 
opportunities offered should be accessible to all nations and benefit all humanity. 
165. He thanked the Secretariat for the efforts being made to encourage the peaceful uses of nuclear 
technology in the crucial areas of health, agriculture, and quality assessment and control of such 
natural resources as water. Also worth noting was the role played by the regional model project on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure in developing and implementing ParaguayÂs national 
safety regulations. His delegation hoped that the project would be extended for at least two years to 
consolidate the progress made and to enable Paraguay and other countries to meet all the milestones. 
Mr. GonzÃ¡lez Aninat (Chile) took the Chair. 

166. Ms. STOKES (Australia) expressed her countryÂs appreciation for the Director GeneralÂs 
leadership of the Agency in the previous year. She commended the Agency for the progress that had 
been made so far in tackling the increasing concerns over the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the 
threat of nuclear or radiological terrorist attacks. However, the Agency and its Member States still had 
a lot of work to do in that regard. 
167. Australia continued to prioritize rigorous implementation of export controls and had joined the 
Proliferation Security Initiative, which was developing practical ways to prevent illicit trafficking in 
weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and related materials. Australia was confident that 
States committed to non-proliferation would lend their support. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 21 

168. The global implementation of effective strengthened safeguards would bring universal security 
benefits. The long-term viability of nuclear science and technology was inextricably linked to the 
AgencyÂs ability to provide the international community with credible assurances that it was inhibiting 
the spread of nuclear weapons. That credibility was under scrutiny. Any perceived lack of credibility 
would have severe consequences for international security, the nuclear industry and the AgencyÂs role 
in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. 
169. The AgencyÂs verification and promotional activities were mutually reinforcing. Strengthening 
the credibility of the former promoted confidence in nuclear science and technology, while widening 
nuclear applications to address environmental, health and other developmental issues promoted 
acceptance of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The concept of balance between verification and 
promotion was not appropriate; the relationship was rather one of mutual interdependence. 
170. The wide application of the AgencyÂs additional protocol was a priority for Australia. 
Strengthened safeguards was the latest stage in the evolution of the AgencyÂs verification system. 
Three-quarters of comprehensive safeguards States with significant nuclear activities had now ratified 
or signed an additional protocol. 
171. Australia had been the first State to ratify an additional protocol and was one of only three 
countries in which integrated safeguards were being applied. The Agency had gained practical 
experience in Australia through implementing such measures as unannounced inspections, 
complementary access and managed access, which would be invaluable as integrated safeguards were 
extended to other countries. Australia was pleased that its certified laboratories had been used by the 
Agency to deliver innovative environmental analyses. She hoped that AustraliaÂs experience would 
demonstrate the increased efficiency and effectiveness of the integrated system. She urged those States 
that had not yet done so to sign and ratify an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
172. She expressed concern that the DPRK had given notice of withdrawal from the NPT and had 
removed its nuclear facilities from Agency safeguards. That was a direct challenge to the 
non-proliferation regime and had resulted in serious security concerns on the Korean Peninsula and 
beyond. The continued pursuit of nuclear weapons would only isolate the DPRK further from the 
international community and from the economic and other benefits it desperately needed. Her 
delegation urged the DPRK to reconsider and allow Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities to 
resume. Dialogue was the key to a peaceful resolution and Australia appreciated the role being played 
by China in the six-party talks. 
173. Her country commended the AgencyÂs cooperation with the Coalition Provisional Authority in 
Iraq to ensure the physical protection of IraqÂs nuclear material inventory. 
174. IranÂs nuclear programme was potentially destabilizing for regional and international security. 
Iran had however said it was committed to full NPT and Agency safeguards compliance. The 
credibility of that commitment was now at stake and she encouraged Iran to cooperate fully with the 
Agency in complete transparency and to conclude an additional protocol without delay or 
precondition. 
175. The Agency had a central role to play in nuclear and radiological security, particularly in 
responding to the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism. That was a natural extension of the 
AgencyÂs work in nuclear safeguards and the security and physical protection of such material and 
facilities. Australia had been pleased to contribute to the development of international guidance and 
research into enhanced methods of detection. 
176. She commended the Agency for its swift response to the threat of nuclear terrorism, including 
the creation of the NSF. She urged all Member States which had not done so to contribute to that 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 22 

Fund, financially and in kind. Australia did not share the view of some Member States that nuclear 
security projects should not be given priority over traditional technical cooperation. Security projects 
should have precedence given the widespread use of nuclear materials in industry, agriculture and 
medicine, and the reality that terrorism knew no borders. 

177. Australia had been pleased to chair the expert group which had developed and revised the Code 
of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, considering that Code to be an 
important step in protecting against radiological terrorism. It welcomed the AgencyÂs plans to assist 
Member States in implementing the Code. She encouraged the Agency to continue cooperating with 
manufacturers, regulators and users to enhance control over radioactive sources throughout their life 
cycle. 
178. Australia also supported early revision of the CPPNM now that the open-ended group of legal 
and technical experts had submitted its final report. 
179. Having played an extensive role in the development of the AgencyÂs safety standards, Australia 
supported efforts to have them accepted and implemented worldwide as the global reference for 
protecting people and the environment. Australia had also contributed to regional and international 
efforts to enhance the understanding of how to achieve a positive safety culture in nuclear 
organizations. It looked forward to finalization of the code of conduct on the safety of research 
reactors in the near future. 
180. Australia continued to promote dialogue on the safe transport of radioactive material and had 
chaired the International Conference on that topic held in Vienna in July 2003. The transfer of nuclear 
technology and development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy depended on the global transport of 
radioactive material. Such transport had an excellent safety record underpinned by the AgencyÂs 
regulations. Aware of the concerns of coastal States, her delegation welcomed more dialogue between 
shipping and coastal States and the transparency shown by the shipping States. 
181. Nuclear science and technology applications were assisting the social and economic 
development of many countries and Australia fully supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization played an active part in 
Agency CRPs. Her country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen partnerships with other 
development organizations and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the technical 
cooperation programme. It had contributed experts to international projects and also strong financial 
and technical support to the RCA, and supported the moves aimed at increased management and 
ownership of the programme by Member States. Australia had exceeded the target rate of attainment 
for the voluntary TCF in 2003 and was likely to do so in 2004. 
182. Mr. ARÃVALO (Colombia) said his country firmly believed in the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and the application of nuclear science and technology for development. Colombia supported 
nuclear non-proliferation and was committed to the NPT and the Treaty of Tlatelolco as well as to the 
establishment of a reliable integrated safeguards regime. 
183. Colombia was convinced of the need to strengthen multilateral cooperation in the three pillars of 
the AgencyÂs activity. Non-proliferation efforts should be a global priority with a view to the 
implementation of disarmament commitments, in particular those under the NPT. Colombia was 
committed to reversing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and ensuring that nuclear science was 
not used for terrorist purposes. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to identify needs relating to 
strengthening the physical security of nuclear installations and radiation sources, including technical and 
legal evaluation and training. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 23 

184. Since joining the Agency in 1960, Colombia had benefited from many national and regional 
technical cooperation projects, primarily in human health, mining, radiation protection, agriculture and 
nuclear medicine. Colombia now provided experts in nuclear applications and doctors specializing in 
nuclear medicine for Agency projects at both the national and regional level. 
185. Colombia had enhanced its institutional capacity and in recent years had restructured its nuclear 
regulatory and operational entities, thereby raising awareness of the benefits of using nuclear science and 
technology. 
186. Aware of the importance of good management of technical cooperation with the Agency, Colombia 
had strengthened its National Liaison Office. Several projects begun in 2003 included training in 
management tools for both project executors and Liaison Office staff, which would ensure optimum use 
of funds. Colombia had been chosen to pilot a self-evaluation project in the area of technical cooperation, 
the results of which would be presented in October 2003. Project monitoring and evaluation would be an 
invaluable tool for Member States in the appropriate management of their resources. 
187. Complying with its constitutional duty to protect the health of its citizens and its environment and 
its commitments as an Agency Member State, Colombia had continued to create a regulatory framework 
for the safe use of radioactive and nuclear material in accordance with national legislation and 
international recommendations. The Colombian Government had also taken the necessary legal steps to 
accede to the Assistance Convention. 
188. The safety and security of radioactive sources was a national priority in view of concerns about 
the lack of control over such material. There was a need to strengthen control mechanisms, national 
regulations and international cooperation structures in order to reduce to a minimum the risk posed by 
radiation sources. Another area of concern was the transport of radioactive waste. Colombia had 
therefore welcomed the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, 
held in Vienna in July 2003. It was important that the action plan based on the ConferenceÂs 
conclusions be elaborated in consultation with all interested States, and Colombia was co-sponsoring 
the draft resolution currently being drawn up on that issue. In addition, he emphasized the importance 
of international cooperation, the exchange of information between shipping States and coastal States, 
and of the AgencyÂs role in promoting those activities. Dialogue and consultation were crucial to 
achieving better mutual understanding, greater confidence and improved communication with regard 
to the safe maritime transport of radioactive material. 
189. His Government was concerned about the continued imbalance between the AgencyÂs 
verification and technology transfer activities. The latter were fundamental for developing countries. 
He emphasized the need to maintain a balance between the AgencyÂs three pillars. 
190. Mr. MAZI (Albania) said that the many important events of the previous year had raised the 
AgencyÂs profile and prestige on the international stage. Albania fully supported all Agency efforts 
under its three pillars of activity. Albania had signed and ratified most of the AgencyÂs conventions 
and was about to sign an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. It was confident that 
parliamentary ratification would follow soon. The Albanian Government would continue to fulfil its 
obligations to the Agency, including its contributions to the TCF and the NSF. 
191. Over the years Albania had participated in and benefited from both national and regional 
technical cooperation programmes, for which it was extremely grateful. Areas of cooperation had 
included a wide range of sectors: industry and oil exploration, agriculture, hydrology, environmental 
monitoring, medicine and radiopharmaceutical production. Under the current cycle the focus was on 
emergencies, waste and medicine. Albania needed a proper waste management service to ensure the 
safe disposal of radioactive waste in view of the expansion in the use of sealed sources. It hoped that 
the national project on waste management would be completed during the current cycle. The priority 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 24 

would then shift to human health, in particular radiotherapy services and nuclear medicine, where 
upgrading was essential. Albania was counting on the AgencyÂs assistance in that regard, and hoped 
that the countryÂs other needs, especially with respect to environmental monitoring and emergencies, 
would not be forgotten. 

192. Albania had been one of the first countries to sign a CPF and had already benefited from it. 
CPFs enhanced dialogue on technical cooperation between the Member State and the Agency, helped 
to identify high-priority areas and focus on real problems and needs, promoted a better understanding 
of those needs and priorities, and helped Member States to think nationally thereby ensuring better 
long-term commitment from governments. Also, the CPF process strengthened technical cooperation 
programme planning, project design, formulation and implementation. Albania urged all Member 
States receiving assistance to complete their CPFs. 
193. Albania was also participating in projects under the European regional programme. That 
programme reflected the needs of the countries of the region and, despite the fact that there was no 
formal regional agreement, it was both efficient and effective and allowed ownership by States of their 
programmes. 
194. The Department of Technical Cooperation had a very high workload and he suggested that the 
Director General consider involving Member States in assessment of it and of work processes. That 
would create a better common understanding, avoid possible inequalities, increase efficiency and 
ensure good and reliable results. 
195. The Agency would continue to play a vital role in all its core competences and he expressed his 
countryÂs appreciation for the work it did to benefit its Member States and in ensuring a better future 
for the international community as a whole. 
196. Mr. TABIBIAN (Armenia) said that the international community was facing new challenges 
and that the past year had been crucial for the United Nations and in particular for the Agency. In view 
of the AgencyÂs important role, he urged Member States to continue to support its activities so that it 
could accomplish its long-standing aims. He particularly supported further improvements in the nonproliferation 
regime and in nuclear verification, and accordingly also the proposed budget increase. 
197. Armenia was a recipient country and had benefited significantly from the Agency and its 
Member States. However, it had also tried to share the financial burden by presenting a payment plan 
to cover its arrears, and the first payment had been made. He appreciated the support of Member 
States for ArmeniaÂs request to have its voting rights restored. 
198. It had been fifty years since President EisenhowerÂs ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ speech on the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy. Armenia still considered nuclear energy to be vital for its socio-economic 
development, and its commitment to the NPT and the non-proliferation regime remained strong. 
Armenia had been one of the first to sign the additional protocol and was in the process of ratification, 
delayed only by the volume of new legislation. 
199. In ArmeniaÂs cooperation with the Agency, priority had been given to nuclear safety and 
verification. The Armenian nuclear power plant had benefited from many missions and consequently 
had succeeding in improving its safety, although he understood that the improvement process would 
never end. Armenia also attached great importance to bilateral cooperation and wished to thank the 
countries that were providing the Armenian nuclear power plant and Nuclear Regulatory Authority 
with continuing assistance. 
200. Combating threats of nuclear terrorism should be a priority for the Agency, so he welcomed the 
creation of the NSF and the related action plan. Armenia had invited the Agency to start a new 
programme on the physical protection of the Armenian nuclear power plant and was awaiting an 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 25 

IPPAS mission. In response to concerns expressed by neighbouring countries about that plant, he said 
that Armenia was committed to the safety of the plant and the protection of its own people and others. 
It was open to expert visits and missions from other countries, under the auspices of the Agency, to 
investigate and assess the plantÂs safety. 

201. He regretted that one delegation had raised the issues of trafficking in nuclear material and the 
possible use of such material by terrorists, because that implied a lack of trust in the Agency. It was 
naÃ¯ve to believe that such acts would affect only local territories or people. 
202. Many projects financed from the TCF had been implemented and completed to the deep 
satisfaction of Armenia, which had signed a CPF covering national projects for 2004Â2005 in nuclear 
safety, legislation, and regulation, physical protection, radioactive waste management and nuclear 
medicine. Regional and subregional projects also allowed for experience to be shared between 
professionals. 
203. The Agency had assisted Armenia in preparing an energy strategy up to 2020; although 
refinements still needed to be made, it was clear that nuclear energy was essential for ArmeniaÂs 
further socio-economic development, and so he wished to suggest that one of the 700 new 1000 MW 
reactors which the Director General had said would be needed by the year 2050 should be constructed 
in Armenia, which would seek to operate it to the highest technological, regulatory and professional 
standards. 
204. Mr. KINGÂORIAH (Kenya) said that his countryÂs new Government was strongly committed to 
fighting all forms of terrorism and would continue to support bilateral and multilateral efforts in that 
area. An anti-terrorism bill had been published for debate by Parliament and two anti-corruption bills 
had been passed. 
205. The Government was in the process of concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement and 
an additional protocol with the Agency. Kenya had acceded to the CPPNM and had ratified the CTBT; 
it continued to support the establishment of the latterÂs global verification regime and encouraged 
Member States that had not done so to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
206. Nuclear disarmament must be seen as the ultimate goal for the safety of mankind and the 
environment. The Agency had continued to play a leading role in the implementation of the NPT, in 
particular through its safeguards system. He joined other Member States in supporting the safeguards 
programme and called for its expansion through the establishment of regional nuclear safeguards 
inspection centres. That would enhance the efficiency of the existing programme, thereby reducing the 
risk of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other radiation sources. 
207. Kenya was committed to surveillance activities to identify radioactive and nuclear materials 
entering or leaving the country illegally. It had formulated a comprehensive national project to identify 
and secure orphaned sources under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme for 2005Â2006. In 
order to cope with increasing threats of illicit activities, there was a need for continued training and the 
acquisition of appropriate equipment. 
208. Kenya appreciated the benefits it had received from the use of nuclear techniques in science and 
technology and supported the implementation of a pro-nuclear-safety society, with the aim of 
educating and informing the public of the benefits of nuclear techniques. The GovernmentÂs priority 
was to revitalize the primary economic base, and there were many important sectors in which safe 
nuclear techniques could have a positive impact. 
209. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was of global importance and had benefited his 
country specifically. Kenya had hosted two regional events in collaboration with the Agency and had 
offered local expertise and resources to ensure their success. Kenya had been pleased with the success 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 26 

of the regional model projects. There had been a significant improvement in technical capabilities 
among Member States and a balance in resource allocation to them. He therefore supported that 
approach to technical cooperation while still seeing a need for individual national projects. The 
Kenyan Government was committed to meeting its financial obligations to the Agency and had 
increased allocations to technical cooperation projects. It was formulating a CPF for the 
period 2004-2009. 

210. Recognizing the need for regulation to control the use and advancement of nuclear technology, 
Kenya had already passed a law on radiation protection, and a bill on the control of illegal use of 
nuclear material was to be presented to Parliament shortly. There was also a competent authority to 
deal with the registration and licensing of practices involving the use of ionizing radiation. The 
number of inspectors attached to that authority had been doubled and the facilities of the Radiation 
Protection Inspectorate were being upgraded. The authority had been involved in the AgencyÂs model 
project on development of technical capabilities for sustainable radiation and waste safety, which he 
believed should be considered for support in the next funding cycle. Also, a facility had been 
constructed at the Kenya Bureau of Standards with a view to establishing a secondary standards 
dosimetry laboratory, and technical cooperation would be sought from the Agency to make the facility 
operational. The Government further continued to promote the peaceful use of nuclear techniques 
through the National Council for Science and Technology and other agencies, and there was specific 
legislation to that effect, in addition to the radiation protection law. 
211. Kenya had five active national projects, some of which would have a far-reaching positive 
effect in the East African region. They were therefore particularly important in terms of overall 
efficiency and cost-effectiveness. He proposed that regular regional meetings should take place to 
discuss transboundary projects. 
212. Kenya was involved in a project to make the Lambwe Valley tsetse-free using the SIT, and the 
success of that project would have an impact on the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis 
Eradication Campaign. Kenya hoped to extend that project to encompass the country as a whole. 
Another project Â in crop improvement and management through the application of nuclear 
techniques and biotechnology Â was under way which would assist Kenya in providing food security 
and alleviating poverty. Treatment of cervical cancer Â which was the leading cause of morbidity 
among young women in Kenya Â and collection of relevant statistics had also been made possible by 
technical cooperation with the Agency. Finally, the Government was preparing a strategy paper with a 
view to providing comprehensive radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services throughout the country 
and hoped for the AgencyÂs assistance in preparing a feasible programme. 
213. Mr. ESTEVES DOS SANTOS (ABACC) recalled that in 1991, the Brazilian and Argentine 
Governments had signed the Agreement for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, 
continuing a history of cooperation of more than one hundred years. The economic, political, 
technological and cultural integration of the two countries was an important step for the peace and 
prosperity of the region, and ABACC was proud to be a part of that process. 
214. The achievements of ABACC in its mandate to safeguard 76 nuclear facilities and all nuclear 
material in both countries had been made possible by the work of technical officers, inspectors, 
consultants and laboratories in Brazil and Argentina. Considerable efforts had been made by ABACC 
to ensure proper inspections and verification activities were carried out. It could therefore guarantee 
that all nuclear material was being used exclusively for peaceful purposes or was otherwise accounted 
for. No indication had been found of the existence of undeclared nuclear materials or activities in 
either country. 

GC(47)/OR.6 
17 September 2003, Page 27 

215. As new fuel cycle installations came into operation in both countries, ABACC expected an 
increase in inspection, accounting and control efforts. It was committed to improving efficiency and 
effectiveness to maintain the high standards and quality of its work and to avoid unnecessary budget 
increases. 
216. In Brazil and Argentina, 126 inspections had been carried out and 2 training courses had been 
held in collaboration with the Agency in the areas of containment and surveillance and unannounced 
inspections. Autonomy had been attained in non-destructive measurements and in containment and 
surveillance equipment through the expenditure of more than $250 000 on latest-generation 
equipment. 
217. ABACC had cooperated with the Agency, the US Department of Energy and Euratom in the 
areas of non-destructive analysis, containment and surveillance, training courses and safeguards 
approaches. The cooperation for the application of safeguards under the Quadripartite Agreement also 
deserved mention. ABACC had been working with the Agency to develop guidelines for joint 
safeguards activities, procedures for unannounced inspections and common use of safeguards 
equipment, safeguards approaches, modern and secure communication systems, and inspector training. 
Much had been achieved, although improvements were still needed in all areas. 
218. Brazil and Argentina had both stressed the importance of cooperation between ABACC and the 
Agency and of coordination to achieve cost-effectiveness in safeguards activities by avoiding 
duplication of effort. ABACC was committed to improving itself in all areas to preserve the 
confidentiality of safeguards information in a way that was transparent for both countries and for the 
international community. It understood its commitment to non-proliferation as the best way to pay 
tribute to the late Dr. Dan Beninson, who had been one of the most influential personalities in the 
nuclear sector for decades and had encouraged and supported ABACCÂs work for over six years as a 
member of its Commission. 
The meeting rose at 7.45 p.m.

General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (continued) 
(GC(47)/2) 
1. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that, since the call for ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ had first been 
launched almost fifty years ago, the pace of development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had 
been accelerating and the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme had become one of the most 
important pillars of the AgencyÂs work, promoting national capacity building and nuclear technology 
transfer for the purposes of social and economic development in developing countries. It was therefore 
essential to maintain an appropriate balance between the AgencyÂs promotional and other statutory 
activities, and to make TCF resources assured and predictable. 
2. The holding of technical co-operation programme events in Member States played an important 
role in promoting a thorough understanding of various nuclear techniques and applications at national 
and regional level. Kuwait was intending to host a second training course on radiation protection in 
diagnostic and interventional radiology, encouraged by the success of the first course it had hosted on 
that topic. The holding of such training courses helped support the development of radiation protection 
programmes and projects in Kuwait and other participating States. 
3. Energy was one of the cornerstones of sustainable development. What energy sources a State 
opted for depended on national policies and needs. Kuwait saw nuclear energy as complementing, not 
competing with, other energy sources. 
4. Nuclear techniques had a useful role to play in the sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Her country therefore welcomed the meeting of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, held in 
the United States in June 2003, which had approved a framework for international co-operation in 
research and development in that field. Kuwait was intending to organize a scientific workshop at the 
beginning of 2004 on sequestration of greenhouse gas emissions, with the participation of international 
experts and the Agency. The Agency should play a leading role in nuclear technology applications in 
that area with a view to helping Member States meet their developmental and environmental goals. 
5. At the BoardÂs meetings in March 2003 an informal open-ended working group on the 
programme and budget had been established under the co-chairmanship of the Ambassadors of Peru 
and Spain. After intensive consultations with Member States, that group had agreed on a package 
proposal that addressed the basic concerns of all regional groups and had, happily, recently been 
approved by the Committee of Whole. The package was a well-balanced compromise solution. 
6. Global safety could be enhanced by setting up mechanisms and developing standards, and by 
adopting binding international agreements. Kuwait had recently ratified the Convention on Early 
Notification on a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear 
Accident or a Radiological Emergency. 
7. The AgencyÂs measures to protect against nuclear terrorism were of great importance, including 
activities relating to the physical protection of nuclear material and installations, the detection of and 
response to illicit trafficking in nuclear material, and protection against nuclear accidents and the 
acquisition of nuclear material by irresponsible individuals or parties leading to serious consequences 
as a result of misuse. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 2 

8. While Kuwait appreciated the efforts of the Advisory Group on Nuclear Security, that Group 
should respect the need for balance between the AgencyÂs various activities in considering future 
activities. 
9. Her country appreciated the Director GeneralÂs and the SecretariatÂs efforts to strengthen the 
effectiveness and efficiency of Agency safeguards. Kuwait had recently ratified an additional protocol 
and she urged all States to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency and 
additional protocols. 
10. The accession of all States in the Middle East to the international non-proliferation regime, 
including the NPT, and the implementation of their obligations under that Treaty, were crucial to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region, an initiative which Kuwait supported as 
the first step towards the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. The most 
important challenge and impediment to that goal was IsraelÂs failure to accede to the NPT and to 
subject its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards. 
11. Noting the AgencyÂs safeguards inspection mission to Iraq in June 2003, she stressed the 
importance of recovering all dispersed uranium compounds in the country, securing the nuclear 
material inventory, and placing it under Agency safeguards and effective physical protection and 
security measures, in the interests of protecting public health and the environment. She also welcomed 
paragraph 11 of Security Council resolution 1483 (2003) which announced the Security CouncilÂs 
intention to revisit the AgencyÂs mandate in Iraq. It was essential that the Agency maintain its existing 
expertise and capabilities in order to ensure it was able to implement effectively an ongoing 
monitoring and verification regime. 
12. Her country was concerned at the DPRKÂs non-compliance with its safeguards agreement and 
the AgencyÂs inability to verify the non-diversion of the nuclear material subject to that agreement. 
She expressed the hope that the DPRK would take all necessary corrective measures to ensure its 
compliance with the NPT, its safeguard agreement and all other relevant measures in order to avoid 
exposing the Korean Peninsula and the world to nuclear threats and risks. She also expressed 
appreciation for the diplomatic efforts which were being made to find a solution to the problem. 
13. The Agency was regarded as one of the most reliable international organizations and it played a 
vital role in maintaining the non-proliferation regime. It was essential to support and enhance the 
AgencyÂs objective and impartial role in that regard. 
14. Finally, though Kuwait did not object to the inclusion in the agenda of the additional item on the 
amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, it did not think it wise to debate that matter during 
the current session since that might undermine the consensus reached in 1999. 
15. Mr. BORG (Malta) said that his country subscribed to the need for a strong system of 
international safeguards to promote collective security. To that end, it had signed an additional 
protocol to its safeguards agreement earlier in the year and was in the process of ratifying it. He 
encouraged all States that had not already done so to conclude safeguards agreements and additional 
protocols. 
16. At a time when the misuse of nuclear material could pose a serious threat to millions of people 
around the world, the AgencyÂs endeavours to promote nuclear safety were taking on ever greater 
importance. His Government had enacted legislation on radiation protection and nuclear safety, and on 
the establishment of a national regulatory authority. It was anticipated that Malta would be in a 
position to become a party to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in the 
near future. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 3 

17. In his statement, the Director General had emphasized the AgencyÂs determination to continue 
with the development of an ever increasing number of non-power applications of nuclear energy in 
such areas as seawater desalination, sterile insect techniques, the mutation and breeding of food crops, 
and nuclear medicine. Such applications were of particular interest to Malta which did not use nuclear 
power. 
18. The Director General had also referred to the growing demand for Agency co-ordinated 
research projects on a variety of nuclear applications. Widespread participation in such programmes 
would go a long way towards promoting the spread of nuclear knowledge and nuclear applications for 
development purposes, thereby increasing the AgencyÂs contribution to sustainable development 
worldwide. 
19. The Maltese Government welcomed the launch of the World Nuclear University. That body was 
very important to small countries like Malta which were not in a position to provide education in 
nuclear science at home. It was to be hoped that it would help redress the problem of the shortage of 
nuclear scientists, and that it would prove an efficient instrument for promoting sustainable 
development. 
20. Malta expressed appreciation for the assistance it had received from the Agency with medical 
uses of nuclear radiation, national preparedness in case of a radiological accident, and other non-power 
applications. In the 2003-2004 biennium, the Agency was providing support through projects on 
emergency response, quality assurance and quality control in diagnostic radiology, and capacity 
building at the Malta national laboratory. Malta was also participating in a number of regional projects 
which had provided many opportunities for Government officials to take part in training programmes 
and international conferences related to their professional work. All such assistance was made 
available under the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme. 
21. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs attempts to improve the effectiveness of its technical 
co-operation programmes through more dialogue with Member States and by focusing on fewer, 
higher-quality technical co-operation projects. It also welcomed the planned increased co-operation 
with other institutions aimed at rendering the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme more 
effective, and the growing interest in promoting regional and interregional co-operation among 
Member States on sharing of nuclear knowledge. In that context, Malta would like to see more such 
co-operation in the Mediterranean region. 
22. Mr. CHARLES (Haiti) said that co-operation between Haiti and the Agency had resumed 
following an initial exploratory mission in June 2001. Two major projects were being implemented in 
the 2003-2004 cycle: one on the development and implementation of a national energy plan and one 
on the management of one of the countryÂs main aquifers in the Cul-de-Sac plain. Agency assistance 
had been most extensive in the medical field and had included such initiatives as training of technical 
staff, the establishment of a dosimetry and radiation protection unit, and the drafting of a law on 
radiological safety and the management of radioactive waste. Haiti was also actively involved in 
regional projects on occupational and medical radiation protection and the Government was working 
closely with the Agency to secure orphan sources in Haiti. The regional programme was crucial to 
harmonizing radiation protection activities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Haitian 
Government was preparing to submit projects for the 2005-2006 cycle on radiotherapy, aquifer 
management and agriculture, and it counted on Agency support for their implementation. 
23. Haiti was taking steps to ratify its safeguards agreement, an additional protocol, the Convention 
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and the ARCAL agreement. It also firmly supported the 
international communityÂs efforts to combat terrorism in general and nuclear terrorism in particular. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 4 

24. Referring to the AgencyÂs Technical Co-operation Report for 2002, he welcomed the many 
initiatives aimed at developing current strategies for the efficient implementation of programmes, 
building new partnerships, establishing sustainable regional and national co-operation institutions, and 
strengthening means of communication. He also stressed the importance of promoting public 
awareness of the benefits to be reaped from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in developing 
countries. 
25. Referring to the recommendation that Member States should not submit more than five projects 
per cycle, he urged the Secretariat to show some flexibility in that regard because LDCs like Haiti 
might need to submit a larger number of projects to catch up with other countries in the peaceful uses 
of nuclear technology. Special allowances should be made for LDCs both as regards national and 
regional co-operation projects. 
26. The Haitian Government was taking steps, within the limits of its financial resources, to settle 
its arrears in contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF. The question of voting rights was 
particularly important for countries whose means were limited and the current five-year payment plan 
imposed harsh conditions on small countries like Haiti. A solution to that problem that was acceptable 
to all parties should be sought. 
27. Global peace was a prerequisite for sustainable development and the Agency had a vital role to 
play in promoting peace. Hence, all Member States should provide it with the resources it needed to 
carry out its mission, and States that could afford to do so should increase their voluntary 
contributions. 
28. Mr. ZAMBESI (Zambia) noted the measures which had been taken by the Agency to strengthen 
technical co-operation activities in Member States, which were of critical importance to developing 
countries, and to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and waste safety, which 
were crucial to consolidating public confidence in the use of nuclear science and technology and to 
avoiding nuclear catastrophes. 
29. He commended the Director General and his staff for their tireless efforts to establish whether 
Iraq had resumed the production of weapons of mass destruction. The Director GeneralÂs 
forthrightness and truthfulness under intense pressure had provided reassuring confirmation of the 
integrity and professionalism of the AgencyÂs staff and the uncompromised independence and 
scientific integrity of the organization. He also paid special tribute to the Director General and his 
predecessor, Dr. Hans Blix, for their achievements in the radiation safety and safeguards fields, and 
urged the Agency to remain resolute in its quest for a peaceful world. 
30. Non-proliferation would remain a pipedream unless those with the weaponry that threatened the 
very existence of mankind responded to the calls to dismantle their arsenals. The international 
community should also not ignore research into new weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, acts of 
violence and terrorism committed by one State against another on any pretext, even that of enforcing 
or safeguarding the NPT, were an unwise and unworthy course of action. 
31. Zambia had taken measures to address illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radiation 
sources by strengthening the relevant legal framework with the participation of stakeholders. Draft 
legislation was in the final stages of consideration. In addition, some officials at border checkpoints 
had received training in the identification of possible radioactive material. 
32. He welcomed the focus of the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2004 on strengthening of 
the technical co-operation programme. That programme had always benefited Member States, 
especially those wishing to improve the living standards of their populations. The revised CPF 
submitted by Zambia would facilitate the elaboration of the much needed, mutually agreed programme 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 5 

of co-operation between Zambia and the Agency and he thanked the Secretariat for the guidance it had 
provided with the development of that document. 

33. His country continued to build on the benefits gained from the increased use of infrastructure 
and from human resources development achieved through the technical co-operation programme. 
Developments since the preceding session of the General Conference included the initiation of the 
construction of a cancer treatment centre and the strengthening of the nuclear medicine unit at the 
University Teaching Hospital. Future activities centred on the actual construction of the cancer 
treatment centre and training of doctors and technologists to ensure the sustainability of the project. 
Some training was already being provided in South Africa. 
34. The neonatal hypothyroidism monitoring facilities at the University Teaching Hospital were 
allowing early remedial measures to be implemented and their diagnostic services were also being 
made available to adults. He thanked the Agency for providing materials and experts for the recent 
training course for technicians on issues relating to neonatal hypothyroidism and expressed the hope 
that more assistance could be provided, especially in the expanded phase of the preliminary survey 
which aimed at covering at least 20 000 neonates. 
35. The facilities for monitoring drug-resistant malaria and tuberculosis at the Tropical Diseases 
Research Centre in Ndola, and the training that had been provided in the detection of those diseases 
which were a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Zambia, had helped strengthen efforts in that 
field. The results of those activities had been used to update the national drug policy. Monitoring of 
cholera epidemics had also benefited from those facilities. 
36. The Plant Tissue Culture Facility continued to provide inputs for the national potato seed supply 
and food security initiatives. Several varieties of cassava, a drought-tolerant food crop, were being 
micro-propagated for use as disease-free planting material for farmers in rural areas. Research into the 
use of radiation-induced plant mutations continued to yield results in the national millet development 
programme, and research on pumpkins with special characteristics was making satisfactory and steady 
progress. 
37. Monitoring of industrial aerosols and radon in mines and work places was being consolidated 
with more work being undertaken in underground mines. Training of technical team members through 
fellowships had been of great assistance, and occupational health and safety should improve as a result 
of those activities. 
38. Zambia supported AFRA and had finally acceded to that agreement. Work under AFRA on 
radiotherapy, use of isotopes in nutrition monitoring, isotope hydrology, nuclear medicine and other 
areas addressed the problems of poverty in AFRA member States using expertise and capacity 
available within the region. Since the preceding General Conference, his country had received AFRA 
missions in human resource development and training. Zambian scientists and technical staff had 
participated in training courses and seminars, and in co-ordination meetings and programmes in 
various fields. He expressed the hope that sufficient resources would be forthcoming for the various 
projects proposed for 2004-2005. 
39. Finally, Zambia pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2004. 
Mr. Berdennikov (Russian Federation) took the chair. 

40. Mr. MENDIS (Sri Lanka) said that, like many other Member States from the developing world, 
his country had benefited greatly from the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme which had 
enabled Sri Lanka to utilize nuclear technology effectively to promote its socio-economic 
development, particularly in the areas of health, agriculture and industry. Those efforts were crucial to 
the national peace process and to meeting the challenges of globalization and liberalization of trade. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 6 

His country therefore welcomed the fact that the total budget for the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programme in 2002 had reached a peak of US $98.1 million. Any further expansion of technical 
co-operation programmes would require additional budgetary commitments from developed countries. 
Sri Lanka was making a concerted effort to honour its APC obligations and was paying more than its 
APC dues in the current year in an attempt to pay off its arrears. 

41. Sri LankaÂs Atomic Energy Authority had been able to generate 45% of its operational expenses 
on its own in 2002, in line with the AgencyÂs aim of promoting self-reliance and sustainability. 
42. His country appreciated the Agency project on upgrading radiation protection and waste 
management infrastructure which was being implemented in Sri Lanka. It had been involved in that 
project since the launching of the original interregional model project. Sri Lanka had attained the first 
two project milestones and needed further assistance to attain milestones 3-5. It would therefore like 
the Agency to review the project with a view to its providing further assistance. 
43. Sri Lanka thoroughly supported the AgencyÂs continued efforts to foster regional co-operation. 
It had acceded to the RCA in 1976 and had been actively participating in its programmes and projects. 
The RCA had been instrumental in establishing national programmes and projects involving the use of 
nuclear technology in health, agriculture and industry, and the people of Sri Lanka had benefited 
immensely from regional projects in those areas. Promoting regional co-operation through regional 
mechanisms was necessary not only to enable developing countries to acquire nuclear technology in a 
cost-effective manner, but also to address transboundary safety and security issues. He thanked RCA 
members and the Agency for giving Sri Lanka the opportunity to host the 25th meeting of RCA 
national representatives in Colombo in 2003, although Sri Lanka had been officially designated to host 
that event in 2004. 
44. The threat of terrorism had an adverse impact not only on the internal security of States but also 
on international peace and security. Faced with the danger of terroristsÂ acquiring nuclear weapons, 
there was an urgent need for international co-operation to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. His country welcomed the measures the Agency had already taken to combat nuclear 
terrorism, including the revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources 
and the proposed amendments to the 1980 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
Sri Lanka would review those IAEA conventions to which it had not yet become a party and take 
appropriate steps to ratify them. 
45. The effective implementation of safeguards in the Middle East could consolidate the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. He called upon States in the region that had concluded safeguards 
agreements to demonstrate transparency and co-operate fully with the Agency. It was regrettable that 
the Agency had had to suspend all its verification activities in the DPRK and he expressed the hope 
that the DPRK would comply with its safeguard agreement without delay and return to the NPT 
regime. 
46. Security doctrines based on the nuclear deterrent theory would only lead to further proliferation, 
and a multilateral approach was the best as a way of achieving greater security for all countries. Sri 
Lanka therefore supported the establishment of an ad hoc committee at the Conference on 
Disarmament to negotiate a non-discriminatory, multilateral, and internationally effective and 
verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or explosive devices, 
taking into consideration both disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives. 
47. Mr. KAMANDA WA KAMANDA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) said that the 
establishment of the new Government in his country in June 2003 had marked the end of a six-year 
political and institutional crisis. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was committed to nuclear 
non-proliferation, unconditional adherence to the provisions of the NPT, the peaceful use of nuclear 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 7 

energy for sustainable development, international co-operation in nuclear, radiation and transport 
safety and waste management, prevention of nuclear terrorism, improving the efficiency of the 
safeguards system, and technical co-operation in nuclear science, technology and applications. 

48. His countryÂs presence at the General Conference after a gap of several years showed its 
willingness to shoulder its international obligations once more. His Government was committed to 
clearing the countryÂs arrears in contributions to the Agency and had confirmed that it would be 
paying its contribution to the TCF for 2004. It was grateful to the Agency for its continued support at a 
difficult time, when other bilateral and multilateral partners had broken off relations with it. 
49. The Democratic Republic of Congo had two nuclear research reactor facilities which it had 
acquired in 1959 and 1972. It had been a member of the Agency since 1961, a party to the NPT 
since 1962, and had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement in April 2003. It planned 
to accede to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material in the near future. Those 
instruments were crucial to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and formed the essential basis for 
peaceful nuclear co-operation and sustainable development. 
50. In 2002, his country had adopted a law on protection against the dangers of ionizing radiation 
and the physical protection of nuclear material and installations. It was now able to keep track of 
possible illicit trafficking in fissile and radioactive material and recover any radioactive material and 
sources circulating in the country, thus enhancing the safety of its people and the environment. 
51. His Government intended to establish a national nuclear security council to prevent, detect and 
respond to sabotage and theft of, unauthorized access to, or illegal transfer of nuclear and radioactive 
material and facilities. At regional level, it intended to work with nine neighbouring countries to 
strengthen physical protection of nuclear facilities and combat trafficking in nuclear material, as a 
proof of its desire to maintain a climate of peace and security and respect its international 
commitments. 
52. His countryÂs priorities in the technical co-operation areas lay in the areas of health 
(establishment of a national radiotherapy centre, detection of resistance to malaria and tuberculosis, 
use of the SIT to eradicate the tsetse fly), water and energy (sustainable development of groundwater 
resources, use of isotope hydrology in water resource management) and industry (non-destructive 
testing). In conclusion, he thanked the Agency for the training and expert services it had provided, and 
invited the Director General to visit the Democratic Republic of the Congo to see for himself the 
progress of Agency technical co-operation projects. 
53. Mr. QASHUT (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) commended the AgencyÂs efforts to promote and 
expand the peaceful uses of atomic energy and to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, 
radiation and transport safety and waste management. 
54. The AgencyÂs safety standards programme was of great importance to his country, particularly 
as it related to research reactor safety, since the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya possessed a 10 MW research 
reactor which a highly qualified and experienced national team had been ably operating and 
maintaining in accordance with the AgencyÂs safety standards, as confirmed by several Agency 
experts who had visited the reactor. 
55. His country had been one of the first developing countries to enact, in 1982, a law on protection 
against radiation hazards, which had been applied to workers in various peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy and to patients undergoing radiotherapy. Certain operational units had been applying 
the AgencyÂs radiation dosimetry regimes to both radiation workers and patients. His country had been 
carefully monitoring and controlling movement of radiation sources within its territory and a stringent 
regulatory system was in place for the import and re-export of sources, and licensing of radioactive

instrumentation and operators thereof. It had also been analysing food components and construction 
materials to verify the absence of radiation, especially long-lived radionuclides. 

56. Operative paragraph 3 of General Conference resolution GC/(46)/RES/11.B on nuclear 
knowledge requested the Secretariat to assist Member States in their efforts to ensure the preservation 
of nuclear education and training for peaceful purposes. Education and training in the nuclear safety 
area formed an integral part of the AgencyÂs education and training programmes and he urged it to 
increase participation by the developing countries in those programmes. 
57. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had met its obligations to the TCF up to the end of 2002 and he 
called on all States that had not paid their contributions to the TCF to do so at the earliest possible time 
so as to enable the Agency to meet its obligations in the technical co-operation field in accordance 
with Article II of its Statute. 
58. He commended the SecretariatÂs efforts to implement the Technical Co-operation Strategy and 
ensure the compatibility of projects with Member StatesÂ national priorities through their respective 
CPFs. The Agency should develop a mechanism to foster and encourage the conclusion of 
partnerships and agreements among developed and developing Member States on human resource 
development through education and training programmes and the provision of expert services and 
equipment, in order to ensure sustainability. 
59. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities in such areas as the use of isotope hydrology in 
water resource management and the use of radiation techniques to service urgent human needs helped 
enhance economic and social development and had a direct impact on quality of life. In particular, he 
thanked the Agency for the support it was giving to PATTEC. 
60. The Agency should take appropriate measures to provide the necessary financial resources for 
education and training, maintaining and preserving nuclear knowledge, and facilitating the acquisition 
of equipment and instrumentation through technology transfer programmes. 
61. He commended the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts to implement the safeguards programme in order 
to provide the international community as effectively and efficiently as possible with credible 
assurances that States were complying with their obligations. Current safeguards were discriminatory 
and based on double standards for, while nuclear material in non-nuclear-weapon states with 
comprehensive safeguards agreements was accounted for, inspected, verified and controlled in order to 
ensure non-diversion, no measures were applied to compel nuclear-weapon states to eliminate such 
weapons or to discontinue nuclear-weapon research and development programmes. Such weapons 
posed a threat to international peace and security and increased the risk of nuclear terrorism. It was 
high time that the international community put an end to such double standards and worked towards 
the elimination of nuclear weapons. 
62. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was a member of Pelindaba Treaty and it welcomed the initiatives 
aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Israel was the main impediment 
to those efforts as it was the only State possessing nuclear weapons in the region, had not acceded to 
the NPT or concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement, refused to subject its nuclear 
installations to Agency inspection and control, and had not complied with the international appeals to 
that effect. He called on the international community to apply pressure to Israel to accept safeguards 
on all its nuclear activities as a necessary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. 
63. In conclusion, he commended the AgencyÂs efforts aimed at protecting against nuclear terrorism 
and called for a rejection of all forms of terrorism 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 9 

64. Mr. POPOVSKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said that his country had made 
significant steps in the field of radiation safety and had assigned priority to the establishment of an 
independent regulatory authority, the preparation of sub-laws and a code of practice for the countryÂs 
radiation source programme, and the building of capacity for improved physical protection of 
radioactive and nuclear material, with special emphasis on preventing illegal possession of and the 
illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. It had undertaken complex activities to install 
equipment and develop the required operating procedures at national level and hoped for continuing 
Agency support in those areas. Projects for the forthcoming cycle would be defined jointly with the 
Agency, in line with the new CPF soon to be signed. They would be aimed at further strengthening the 
regulatory infrastructure and applications in the fields of human health, the environment, illicit 
trafficking, and agriculture. 
65. The Republic of Macedonia continued to support the strengthening of regional co-operation. It 
benefited from the comprehensive regional programme for Europe and, under the current project on 
regional control of brucellosis in sheep and goats, it had hosted a co-ordination meeting earlier in the 
year. That meeting had been attended by 11 countries interested in developing a joint strategic 
approach to combat the disease. It was the first such meeting where all Balkan countries had been able 
to participate. The AgencyÂs inputs had been greatly appreciated. There were plans to hold 
inter-laboratory exercises and a training course at the Veterinary Institute in Skopje. 
66. He thanked the Agency for the valuable assistance it provided through its technical co-operation 
programme. The Republic of Macedonia was making every effort to meet its financial obligations to 
the Agency, despite budgetary constraints. It had demonstrated its commitment to the technical 
co-operation programme through two voluntary contributions to the TCF for priority national projects. 
67. Mr. NYUNT MAUNG SHEIN (Myanmar) commended the AgencyÂs role in international 
co-operation on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, and its work on nuclear safety and security 
and safeguards, which were crucial to protecting the public from the hazards of ionizing radiation. He 
also welcomed its efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system to 
ensure the smooth functioning of the non-proliferation regime. 
68. Myanmar had embarked on a programme of promoting and developing nuclear applications and 
was well aware of the need for adequate radiation protection and a waste safety infrastructure. He 
thanked the Agency for providing assistance through the interregional model project on radiation 
protection. Myanmar was participating actively in interregional projects on legislation for safe and 
peaceful nuclear applications, national regulatory control and occupational radiation protection 
programmes, and the development of technical capabilities for sustainable radiation and waste safety 
infrastructure. 
69. Stressing the importance of predictable and assured funding for technical co-operation, he noted 
that the largest proportion of the assistance provided to Myanmar was in medicine, followed by 
agriculture, human resource development and nuclear technology support, nuclear engineering and 
technology, and nuclear safety. Some assistance was also being provided in nuclear physics, industry 
and hydrology, nuclear chemistry and energy development. Under one Agency project, the Central 
Agriculture Research Institute was developing varieties of rice that were suitable for cultivation in 
drought-prone areas and on saline land, employing radiation-induced mutation and in vitro techniques. 
Isotopic and non-isotopic techniques were being used to evaluate locally available animal fodder 
resources and to develop fodder supplementation strategies. The Livestock Breeding and Veterinary 
Department was working on Agency projects aimed at controlling cattle diseases such as 
foot-and-mouth disease. A National Centre for Nuclear Instrumentation Maintenance had been 
established under another project. Radiation therapy facilities had been set up using national funding 
and a simulator had been installed in Mandalay General Hospital. The Agency had provided 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 10 

equipment and assisted with the introduction of quality assurance and quality control in teletherapy 
and brachytherapy treatment. A national radiotracer group had been established to introduce routine 
use of radiotracers and sealed sources in the petroleum industry. Those facilities were being sustained 
by Agency contributions of equipment, experts and training. 

70. Myanmar appreciated the role played by regional agreements in enhancing the AgencyÂs 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It benefited from its membership in the RCA and 
would like to see further enhancement of RCA activities. 
71. Mr. KOHI (United Republic of Tanzania) thanked the Agency for the valuable technical 
assistance his country had received. Special attention should be given to the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programmes in Africa as most LDCs were to be found on that continent. Efforts should 
focus on the application of nuclear techniques to fight infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria 
and tuberculosis, which continued to hamper the continentÂs development. 
72. Tsetse infestation, trypanosomosis and sleeping sickness were major constraints in the United 
Republic of Tanzania, affecting both humans and livestock in over 60% of the country. The situation 
was similar in the rest of Africa. Over 90% of the continent was infested with various species of tsetse, 
making it very difficult to reduce poverty. Tanzania therefore welcomed the efforts of the international 
community, through the Agency, to help African Member States deal with the tsetse problem, 
particularly through PATTEC. The use of the SIT to eradicate tsetse species in various parts of Africa 
was gaining momentum, and the support of Member States in that regard was much appreciated. 
73. In the preceding year, his country had concluded a contract with the Agency under which the 
Tsetse and Trypansomiasis Research Institute in Tanga was to rear females of two different species to 
support tsetse control activities in the Okavango Delta in Botswana and in the Southern Rift Valley in 
Ethiopia. Funds donated by the United States of America had been used to rehabilitate the fly-proofing 
of the InstituteÂs rearing facility. Construction work had been completed and the installation of the 
equipment was in progress. Unfortunately, the establishment of one colony had fallen behind schedule, 
but it was expected to pick up following remedial measures. The Institute was playing a critical role in 
the training of technical staff for the campaign and had already trained 44 fellows from the African 
region. A national development strategy document on application of the SIT and other conventional 
methods to eradicate the tsetse fly in Tanzania was being formulated, and he appealed to all those who 
wished Africa well to support the PATTEC initiative. 
74. His country had received valuable support from the Agency through the technical co-operation 
programme in the areas of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. The nuclear medicine and radiotherapy 
services at the only cancer hospital in Tanzania had been greatly improved. The agreed programme to 
expand further and consolidate those services through a cost-sharing scheme with the Agency, to 
which his country had contributed $600 000, was expected to bring those services in line with 
international standards. He appealed for increased support so that the people of Tanzania could have 
access to high-quality nuclear medicine and radiotherapy services. 
75. Tanzania had finished revising its radiation protection legislation with a view to providing for 
effective regulation and promotion of nuclear technology, including the implementation of 
international treaties and conventions. Good international co-operation should enable LDCs like 
Tanzania to derive maximum benefit from nuclear technology, including nuclear power. Thus, his 
country welcomed the recent research and development initiatives on low-cost power reactor units that 
were cost-effective, viable, affordable and safer. The nuclear power option would contribute to 
poverty reduction by providing an assured energy source. In revising its nuclear law, Tanzania had 
opened the door for increased promotional activities, including consideration of the nuclear power 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 11 

option. Human resources development in that area and a study of the appropriateness of the nuclear 
power option in Tanzania would be a priority in his countryÂs development plans. 

76. Unfortunately, the increased threat of international terrorism and illicit trafficking in radioactive 
material had had a negative impact on nuclear technology applications. There had been a major shift 
of resources to verification activities at the expense of promotional activities, posing a significant 
challenge to the AgencyÂs statutory objectives. 
77. Nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety was another challenge facing the Member States 
of the Agency. Tanzania fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international co-operation 
and capabilities in nuclear, radiation and waste safety and security. It had recently promulgated an 
atomic energy law which sought to maximize the peaceful use of nuclear technology while ensuring 
safety and security. 
78. In conclusion, he endorsed the proposed budget increase, noting that the bulk of the increase 
would go to the AgencyÂs verification programme which, apparently, had been experiencing the 
greatest demand for additional resources and been chronically underfunded for a number years. His 
country would be pledging its full share of the TCF. 
79. Mr. UMAR (Nigeria) said that the Agency served as a catalyst for the transfer of nuclear 
technology for peaceful uses in such fields as food production, disease control, water resource 
management and environmental protection. 
80. Africa continued to benefit from the AgencyÂs SIT programme and his country was grateful to 
the Agency for the technical co-operation funding and extrabudgetary contributions which had been 
made available for PATTEC. Africa had begun to take effective ownership of that programme. A 
PATTEC Co-ordinating Office had been set up in Addis Ababa, and the meeting of Ministers of 
Agriculture of the African Union in Maputo in July had directed Member States of the Union to 
allocate adequate resources to the eradication of tsetse flies and other livestock diseases, and to 
identify national and regional focal points in order to ensure the successful implementation of 
PATTEC. The Agency and the PATTEC Co-ordinating Office had agreed on modalities for 
incorporating PATTEC activities in the agenda of NEPAD. As one of the leading initiators of 
NEPAD, Nigeria had identified water and human health as one of its priority areas. Thus, the Agency 
was being invited to assist in the development of an isotope hydrology laboratory to enhance the 
exploration and sustainable management of water resources not only in Nigeria but in the entire West 
African subregion. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme might also collaborate with 
NEPAD in the field of cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
81. Together with the WHO, Nigeria had spearheaded the Roll Back Malaria campaign. His 
Government welcomed the inauguration of the SIT research project on the eradication of 
malaria-transmitting mosquitoes and was grateful to the Agency and donor countries, especially the 
United States of America, Germany and France for their support. Malaria was the leading cause of 
death in Africa, and he appealed to all countries, especially wealthy ones, to fund that research project 
generously. 
82. His country was committed to AFRA as a means of providing Agency assistance to the African 
region. Within the framework of AFRA, Nigeria had hosted a regional workshop for sub-Saharan 
Africa on electricity generation expansion planning using the WASP package. That workshop, which 
had attracted 34 participants from 14 countries in the subregion, had been successfully concluded and 
had undoubtedly added to the usefulness of the project on sustainable energy development in 
sub-Saharan Africa. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 12 

83. The Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA), established in May 2001, had 
immediately begun receiving technical assistance from the Agency through the model project on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure. That project had been very effective and his country 
would like to see it extended for another biennium. 
84. Between January 2002 and February 2003, the NNRA had carried out an audit inspection of 
radiation protection in radiotherapy practice in the country. The results of that exercise, which had 
provided a benchmark not only for radiation safety but also for the effectiveness of radiotherapy 
practice in Nigeria, had been presented in February 2003 at a national workshop on radiation 
protection in medical exposure organized by the NNRA, the Federal Ministry of Health and the 
Agency for senior managers in hospitals. The audit report was currently being used by his Government 
to develop a work plan for sustainable development of radiotherapy practice. The NNRA had also held 
a national workshop on the safety and security of radiation sources and radiation protection in the 
petroleum industry in June 2003, in co-operation with the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the 
Agency. 
85. In December 2002, two americium-beryllium sources had been reported as lost or stolen in a 
nuclear well logging company in the petroleum industry. The Agency had been duly informed and had 
promptly sent an emergency response team to Nigeria in February 2003. Nigeria appreciated the 
AgencyÂs support and its useful recommendations. Reports had been received that the sources had 
been found, and that information had been confirmed by the Agency. 
86. In June 2003, a peer review mission had visited the NNRA. The mission had been timely, 
because three major nuclear application facilities were about to be commissioned: a miniature neutron 
source reactor supplied under an Agency technical co-operation project; a multi-purpose gamma 
irradiation facility and a tandem linear accelerator. The latter two projects had been developed 
exclusively by Nigeria. His Government was awaiting the reports and recommendations from that 
mission. 
87. In December 2003, the Agency would be holding a regional training course in Nigeria on 
radiation protection and management of radioactive waste in the oil and gas industry. That course 
should further improve national awareness of radiation protection and safety. 
88. The research reactor project at the Centre for Research and Development had started with the 
signing of a contract in 1996 for the delivery and installation by the Chinese Nuclear Energy Industry 
Corporation of a miniature neutron source reactor. The construction of the necessary infrastructure and 
the installation of the reactor equipment had been completed in March 1999, but the Agency had not 
permitted the shipment of nuclear fuel at the time owing to the absence of an adequate nuclear 
regulatory framework. In August 2002, an assessment mission from the Agency had found that the 
NNRA was functioning normally and that the requisite regulatory framework was in place. The 
Agency had therefore authorized the shipment of the fuel to Nigeria in October 2002. Since then, a 
number of inexplicable problems had delayed the shipment. He urged the Agency to put pressure on 
the suppliers to fulfil their contractual obligations and ship the fuel to Nigeria so that the research 
reactor could be commissioned before the end of the year. 
89. His country had always been appreciative of the AgencyÂs excellent work and the technical 
assistance it provided. However, it was forced to note that, at a time of economic difficulty, its 
assessed contribution to the Agency was increasing whereas the level of technical co-operation it was 
receiving had been declining in real terms since 1998. That trend should be reversed. Nevertheless, 
Nigeria was still pledging its full share of the TCF for 2004. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 13 

90. The increase in the AgencyÂs budget would enable it to serve the international community 
better. Nigeria would like to see an even distribution of funds between the three pillars of the 
AgencyÂs activities in view of the fact that the majority of Member States were developing countries. 
91. A cardinal function of the Agency was to prevent the use of nuclear energy for other than 
peaceful purposes and to help maintain the nuclear non-proliferation regime, whose main pillar was 
the NPT. Nuclear non-proliferation could only be meaningfully sustained if the nuclear-weapon States 
fulfilled their legally binding obligations, especially under Article VI of the NPT; and the commitment 
to nuclear non-proliferation, whether vertical or horizontal, which they had voluntarily undertaken at 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
7. Election of Members to the Board of Governors 
(GC(47)/5 and 16) 

92. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a procedure 
whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a particular area, no 
secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas where no candidate had 
been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the rational use of the General ConferenceÂs 
time. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, 
which provided that elections to the Board should be by secret ballot, be suspended in respect of those 
areas for which there was agreement. 
93. He was happy to report that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their candidates 
for the vacancies to be filled. 
94. Drawing attention to document GC(47)/5, containing a list of the Agency Member States which 
the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the ConferenceÂs current 
session until the end of the 48th (2004) regular session, he recalled that, under Rule 83 of the Rules of 
Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the elective places on the Board which had to 
be filled. To that end, document GC(47)/16 had been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to 
elect eleven Members of the Board from the seven categories listed. 
95. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Mexico and Peru to the two vacant seats 
for Latin America. 
96. Mexico and Peru were duly elected. 
97. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Belgium and Italy to the 
two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
98. Belgium and Italy were duly elected. 
99. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Hungary and Poland to 
the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
100. Hungary and Poland were duly elected. 
101. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Nigeria and Tunisia to the 
two vacant seats for Africa. 
102. Nigeria and Tunisia were duly elected. 

GC(47)/OR.7 
18 September 2003, Page 14 

103. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Pakistan to the vacant seat 
for the Middle East and South Asia. 
104. Pakistan was duly elected. 
105. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Vietnam to the vacant seat 
for the Far East. 
106. Vietnam was duly elected. 
107. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Republic of Korea to 
the floating seat for the Far East/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from the Far East to 
fill. 
108. The Republic of Korea was duly elected. 
109. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India), speaking as the Chairman of the MESA Group, said that the 
election of Pakistan to the Board of Governors had been made possible by YemenÂs decision to 
withdraw in a spirit of compromise. MESA had therefore decided to endorse the candidacy of Yemen 
as a Member of the Board for the 2004-2005 period. 
-Requests for the restoration of voting rights 

(GC(47)/INF/9 and 10) 

110. The PRESIDENT noted that the General Committee had had before it requests from Armenia 
and Kazakhstan for the restoration of their voting rights. It had recommended that both countries be 
permitted to vote during the current session of the Conference because it was of the view that those 
States had failed to pay the amount necessary to avoid the application of Article XIX.A of the Statute 
owing to conditions beyond their control. 
111. He took it that the Conference accepted the recommendations of the General Committee. 
112. It was so decided. 
The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.

10. Appointment of the External Auditor 
(GC(47)/15 

11. The PRESIDENT said that the tenure of the AgencyÂs current External Auditor would end with 
the completion of the audit of the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial year 2003. It would therefore be 
necessary to appoint an External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for 2004 and 2005. 
12. At its June session, the Board of Governors had agreed to recommend to the General 
Conference the appointment of the Vice-President of the German Supreme Audit Institution as the 
External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial years 2004 and 2005. 
13. He took it that the General Conference wished to appoint the Vice-President of the German 
Supreme Audit Institution as the External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the 2004 
and 2005. 
14. It was so decided. 
15. Mr. HONSOWITZ (Germany) thanked the General Conference for appointing the Vice-
President of the German Supreme Audit Institution, Mr. Norbert Hauser, as the External Auditor to 
audit the AgencyÂs accounts for 2004 and 2005. The ConferenceÂs decision had been facilitated by the 
fact that the nominations made by Spain and India had been withdrawn in favour of GermanyÂs 
nomination, and his Government was grateful to those two countries for their co-operation. 
16. The German Supreme Audit Institution would strive to accomplish the task assigned to it 
diligently and with the AgencyÂs and Member StatesÂ best interests in mind, and Mr. Hauser was 
looking forward to establishing personal contacts with members of the Secretariat and representatives 
of Member States. 
6. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2002 (resumed) 
(GC(47)/2) 
17. Mr. ERDENE (Mongolia) expressed appreciation of the AgencyÂs assistance to Member States 
in using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and said that his country attached great importance to 
the strengthening of Agency safeguards through the implementation of additional protocols to 
safeguards agreements. 
18. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation projects in Mongolia were focused on Â inter alia Â 
applications of science, education and training, human health, agriculture and geology. Under the 
Model Project on upgrading radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure, progress had been 
made in establishing a legal framework for radiation protection in Mongolia, strengthening the 
countryÂs independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority and training specialists in radiation protection. 
19. An additional protocol to MongoliaÂs NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency had been 
signed in December 2001 and had entered into force on 12 May 2003. 
20. Mr. HALPHEN PÃREZ (Panama) said that his country, although not engaged in nuclear power 
generation, had benefited greatly from technical assistance provided through the Agency. 

GC(47)/OR.8 
18 September 2003, Page 3 

21. It had also benefited greatly from the TranSAS mission to Panama that had taken place in 
June 2002 and the focus of which had been on the transport of radioactive material through the 
Panama Canal. 
22. Among the technical assistance being provided through the Agency was support for the 
establishment of a cancer diagnosis unit at a hospital complex, for efforts to control the Mediterranean 
fruit fly, for seed irradiation designed to boost crop yields, and for the irradiation of foodstuffs in order 
to increase their shelf life. 
23. Panama, which was grateful to the Agency, would continue to support it in its efforts to ensure 
that atomic energy was used only for peaceful purposes 
24. Mr. ANDREADIS (Greece), referring to the statement made during the previous meeting by the 
representative of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, said that he wished to remind the 
aforementioned representative that his countryÂs name within the United Nations framework was ÂThe 
Former Yugoslav Republic of MacedoniaÂ pending the resolution of litigation between his country 
and Greece. 
The meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.

24. Examination of delegatesÂ credentials 
(GC(47)/24) 

1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met the previous day to examine the 
credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. The report of the 
Committee was contained in document GC(47)/24. Since the report had been issued, the Secretariat 
had received credentials satisfying the requirements of Rule 27 from Belarus, Indonesia, Kuwait and 
Yemen. After discussion, the Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the 
draft resolution contained in paragraph 8 of its report. 
2. Mr. IBRAHIM (Egypt) said that his delegation did not consider the report contained in 
document GC(47)/24 to be relevant to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, especially 
Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. In his countryÂs view, Israel as a State meant the one with the 
borders as at 4 June 1967 and as defined in the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. 
3. Mr. LASSEL (Morocco) said that the examination of the credentials of the Israeli delegate, 
issued in Jerusalem, did not in any way prejudge the status of that city, which remained under 
occupation in flagrant violation of international law and the relevant United Nations resolutions. He 
expressed regret that the issue had arisen once again in spite of observations and reservations made in 
the past. 
4. Mr. SAEIDI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that, in line with his delegationÂs position on 
previous reports on delegatesÂ credentials, the fact that his delegation would not block a consensus on 
the report under consideration should not be interpreted as recognition of Israel by his country. 
5. Mr. KAMANDA WA KAMANDA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) requested that the 
report be corrected, since, according to paragraph 4, only a copy of original credentials had been 
received from his country, whereas in fact original credentials had been submitted. 
6. Mr. MANUHUTU (Indonesia) said that original credentials had been submitted for the delegate 
of his country the previous day and requested that Indonesia be removed from among the Member 
States referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 4 of the report. 
7. Mr. TAJOURI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his delegationÂs decision to join the 
consensus on the report did not constitute recognition of Israel by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. 
8. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 8 of document GC(47)/24. 
9. It was so decided. 

GC(47)/OR.9 
19 September 2003, Page 2 

18. Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between 
the Agency and the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea 
(GC(47)/19; GC(47)/L.4) 

10. Ms. HALL (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document GC(47)/L.4, said it 
was the product of intensive consultations with the countries most directly involved in efforts to 
achieve a peaceful resolution to the DPRK nuclear issue. It had wide support, as indicated by the long 
list of co-sponsors contained in document GC(47)/L.4/Add.4, to which the delegations of Kazakhstan, 
Latvia and Lithuania had asked that their countries be added. 
11. Since the General Conference had last considered the DRPK nuclear issue, circumstances had 
changed fundamentally, and the issue had been the subject of three Board resolutions. The draft 
resolution before the Conference underscored the continuing interest of the Agency and its governing 
bodies in the issue. 
12. Referring to operative paragraph 8 of the draft resolution, she expressed appreciation of the role 
which China was playing in the search for a peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue. 
13. She hoped that the General Conference would adopt the draft resolution without a vote, thereby 
expressing the international communityÂs united resolve to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free Korean 
Peninsula. 
14. Mr. SEMMEL (United States of America), having expressed appreciation of the efforts of the 
Canadian delegation in crafting the draft resolution under consideration, said that the DPRK should 
reconsider its actions and make the right choices. 
15. The General Conference had formally addressed the DPRK nuclear issue at every session since 
1992, when it had become clear that the DPRK was violating its NPT safeguards agreement. Now, the 
international community had more reason than ever before to be concerned about that issue. 
16. Since the General ConferenceÂs 2002 session, the DPRK had taken a series of dramatic steps: 
in October 2002 it had admitted, during bilateral talks with his country, that it had a uranium 
enrichment programme; it had responded to a resolution in which the Board had, in November 2002, 
called on it to co-operate immediately with the Agency and abandon its nuclear weapons programme 
by breaking Agency seals, disabling monitoring cameras and expelling inspectors, who had not been 
permitted to return to the DPRK; given one last chance to rectify its mistakes by the Board in 
January 2003, it had announced its withdrawal from the NPT and had reopened nuclear facilities 
frozen under the Agreed Framework; and, after the Board had, on 12 February 2003 declared it to be 
in Âfurther non-complianceÂ with its safeguards agreement and reported the matter to the United 
Nations Security Council, it had continued to respond to the international community with defiant and 
provocative rhetoric and threats, including the admission that it was pursuing a nuclear deterrent 
capability. 
17. In taking those steps, the DPRK had contravened the 1992 Joint Declaration on the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the Agreed Framework, its NPT safeguards agreement with 
the Agency, and the NPT itself. The Conference must respond unambiguously to a challenge that was 
unprecedented in the history of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 

GC(47)/OR.9 
19 September 2003, Page 3 

18. His Government, which was grateful to the Government of China for organizing and hosting 
two rounds of talks in Beijing and making preparations for a third had, while not renouncing any 
option, been consistently pursuing diplomacy with a view to achieving a complete, irreversible and 
verifiable end to the DPRKÂs nuclear weapons programme. With its friends and partners, it considered 
the Âsix-party talksÂ process - involving both States on the Korean Peninsula, China, Japan, Russia and 
the United States - to be the best diplomatic approach to the achievement of that goal. 
19. The United States had made it clear that it was prepared to address the stated security concerns 
of the DPRK in the context of the complete, irreversible and verifiable dismantlement of the DPRKÂs 
nuclear weapons programme. Moreover, it had stated that after the programme had been dismantled it 
would be prepared to enter into negotiations with the DPRK on all issues of bilateral concern, with a 
view to resolving those issues and normalizing its relations with the DPRK. 
20. Against the background of the Âsix-party talksÂ process, the international community should 
speak with one voice, sending to the DPRK the clearest possible signal that its behaviour could not be 
tolerated. 
21. The draft resolution before the Conference demonstrated the international communityÂs 
continuing serious concern about the threat to international peace, security and stability posed by the 
DPRK nuclear issue and underscored the AgencyÂs essential verification role. 
22. Mr. Chang-beom CHO (Republic of Korea), having thanked the delegation of Canada for 
submitting the draft resolution under consideration and welcomed the large number of co-sponsors, 
said that the General Conference and the Board of Governors had adopted numerous resolutions 
expressing serious concern about the non-compliance of the DPRK with its safeguards agreement. 
Regrettably, those resolutions had not been fully implemented owing to a lack of co-operation on the 
DPRKÂs part, and the Agency remained unable to provide any level of assurance about the nondiversion 
of nuclear material to nuclear weapons in the DPRK. 
23. Moreover, since December 2002 the DPRK had taken a number of further steps in violation of 
its NPT safeguards agreement and of other voluntarily assumed commitments, those steps culminating 
in the announcement of its decision to withdraw from the NPT - a serious and immediate challenge to 
the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
24. The DPRK should retract its announced withdrawal from the NPT and comply with all its 
obligations arising out of the NPT; it should dismantle its nuclear weapons programme in a complete, 
irreversible and verifiable manner; it should co-operate fully with the Agency in bringing about the 
earliest possible implementation of comprehensive Agency safeguards within its territory; and it 
should honour its obligations under the 1992 Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula. 
25. The six-party talks held in Beijing from 27 to 29 August 2003 had been a meaningful step 
towards a peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue, and his country was grateful to the Chinese 
Government for hosting them. 
26. It was particularly encouraging that the six-party talks had led to consensus on the ultimate goal, 
a nuclear weapon-free Korean Peninsula, and on the achievement of that goal by peaceful, diplomatic 
means - by dialogue. 
27. If the DPRK abandoned its nuclear weapons programme, the international community would be 
prepared to seriously address its concerns, which could lead to a more peaceful and prosperous future 
for the entire Korean people. A peaceful resolution of the DPRK would facilitate the establishment of 
permanent peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, leading to stronger peace and greater 
prosperity in north-east Asia and beyond. The momentum created by the six-party talks should 

GC(47)/OR.9 
19 September 2003, Page 4 

therefore be maintained, with a view to solving all problems in a comprehensive manner before it was 
too late. 

28. How the international community responded to the challenge posed by the DPRKÂs nuclear 
weapons programme would have a lasting effect on the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The General 
Conference should therefore send the right message to the DPRK and to potential future proliferators. 
The language of the draft resolution before the Conference was loud and clear, and in his delegationÂs 
view the draft resolution sent the right message. His delegation hoped that the General Conference 
would adopt the draft resolution without a vote, in accordance with what it had done at its four 
previous sessions. 
29. Mr. MORIMOTO (Japan) said that his country was deeply concerned about the situation 
described by the Director General in his report. 
30. Following a statement in April 2003 about the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel rods, the 
DPRK had been issuing statements about the possession of a nuclear deterrent, and recently it had 
declared that it had no option but to keep and strengthen its nuclear deterrent force. 
31. Although the six-party talks in Beijing had led to a consensus on resolving the DPRK nuclear 
issue through dialogue and on not taking action that would aggravate the situation, differences of 
opinion had been evident. Continuation of the Âsix-party talksÂ process was therefore vital. 
32. Japan - which could not, under any circumstances, accept the development, acquisition, 
possession, testing or transfer of nuclear weapons by the DPRK - wanted the DPRK to promptly and 
completely dismantle all its nuclear development programmes in an irreversible and verifiable manner 
and to allow its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency to be fully implemented. 
33. Believing that the DPRK nuclear issue should be resolved peacefully, through diplomatic 
means, Japan attached great importance to the AgencyÂs role and would like the Director General to 
continue his efforts to bring about full implementation of the DPRKÂs safeguards agreement with the 
Agency. The DPRK should co-operate with the Agency as a matter of urgency, holding talks 
immediately with the relevant Agency officials. 
34. In JapanÂs view, it was essential to arrive at a comprehensive solution to the DPRK nuclear 
issue on the basis of the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration on weapons of mass destruction 
(including nuclear weapons) ballistic missiles and abduction. 
35. If the DPRK behaved responsibly, the international community would respond positively in the 
areas of security, diplomacy and economics. It should respond immediately and constructively to the 
calls of the international community. 
36. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) said his country attached great importance to the implementation of 
the NPT safeguards agreement between the Agency and the DPRK and had therefore welcomed the 
six-party talks held in Beijing in August 2003. It believed that the DPRK nuclear issue could be 
resolved peacefully, through continued dialogue leading ultimately to the denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula. 
37. The DPRK nuclear issue was a matter of great concern to the Philippines, which would like to 
see the DPRK abandoning its nuclear weapons programme in an irreversible and verifiable manner 
and returning to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
38. Having expressed support for the efforts of the Director General, he said that his delegation 
fully agreed with the major thrust of the draft resolution and wished to be added to the list of cosponsors. 

GC(47)/OR.9

39. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(47)/L.4 without a vote. 
40. It was so decided. 
41. Mr. ZHANG Yan (China) said that his delegation had from the outset had doubt about the need, 
at the present juncture, for a resolution, and it had expressed its doubts during consultations. 
42. In his delegationÂs view, the draft resolution just adopted was not properly balanced. At the sixparty 
talks held in Beijing there had been a consensus on two key points - the need to take account of 
the DPRKÂs legitimate concerns and the need to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The draft 
resolution did not strike a proper balance between those two points - it ignored one while emphasizing 
the other. 
43. There was general agreement that the six-party talks had been a step in the right direction, but it 
had not been easy to achieve the progress made and maintaining the momentum would be crucial. All 
parties, and also the Agency, should exercise restraint and avoid actions or words that might have a 
negative impact on the situation. 
44. The denuclearization and security of the Korean Peninsula was an objective for which China 
would continue its efforts in concert with the rest of the international community. That objective could 
only be achieved by diplomatic means. The six-party talks had been useful, leading to better mutual 
understanding and opening the way towards a solution acceptable to all the parties. 
45. Mr. KUCHINOV (Russian Federation) said that his delegation, which had not opposed the 
consensus in favour of adoption of the draft resolution contained in document GC(47)/L.4, was 
pleased that, in operative paragraph 7 of the draft resolution, the General Conference stressed its desire 
for a peaceful resolution through dialogue to the DPRK nuclear issue and that, in operative 
paragraph 7, the Conference expressed support for the international communityÂs peaceful efforts Âin 
all available and appropriate forumsÂ to address the challenge posed by the DPRK nuclear issue. It 
was particularly pleased that in operative paragraph 8 the six-party talks held in Beijing and the 
consensus that had emerged from them were described as Âa clear step in the right directionÂ. 
46. With regard to the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, his country continued to be strongly in favour 
of ensuring the nuclear-weapon-free status of the Korean Peninsula and opposed to the appearance for 
whatever motive - of weapons of mass destruction there. It believed that the resolution of the 
DPRK nuclear issue should be a long-term one involving reinstatement of the implementation of the 
NPT throughout the Korean Peninsula. It therefore wished the DPRK to dismantle any nuclear 
weapons programme it might have in an irreversible and verifiable manner. 
47. His country, which would like to see the DPRK nuclear issue resolved through diplomatic 
means and in a comprehensive manner, believed that the six-party talks held in Beijing had led to 
better mutual understanding, thereby opening the way for a package solution to be arrived at gradually 
through the synchronized taking - in parallel - of agreed measures by the interested parties. 
48. Now, more than ever, it was essential to employ all diplomatic means, with respect for the 
legitimate interests of all participants as regards their security and socio-economic development. 
49. Mr. MORENO (Italy), speaking on behalf of the European Union and the acceding countries 
Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and 
Slovenia, said that the associated countries Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey endorsed his statement. 
50. The European Union had welcomed the recent six-party talks and the resulting consensus, 
which it hoped would serve as the framework for diplomatic efforts directed towards a peaceful 

GC(47)/OR.9 
19 September 2003, Page 6 

resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue. It was committed to developing its relations with the DPRK, 
provided that the DPRK continued to participate in talks aimed achieving substantive progress and did 
nothing to exacerbate the present situation. 

51. The DPRK should abandon its confrontational stance, so that the mutually beneficial 
co-operation between it and the European Union might be resumed, and reconsider its position vis-Ã vis 
the Agency, with which it should co-operate fully. It should continue the current dialogue with all 
interested parties and, on the basis of the results of the six-party talks, help in building a lasting peace 
on the Korean Peninsula. 
19. Implementation of United Nations Security Council 
resolutions relating to Iraq 
(GC/47/10) 

52. The PRESIDENT said that, as a result of consultations, it had been agreed that he should read 
out - for endorsement by the General Conference - the following statement, which reflected a delicate 
compromise: 
ÂThe General Conference took note with appreciation of the report in document GC(47)/10 and 
commended the Agency for its verification activities in Iraq under the mandate provided by 
United Nations Security Council resolutions from November 2002 to March 2003. 

ÂThe Conference expressed its appreciation for the activities undertaken by the Agency as 
reported in document GOV/2003/46 and noted with satisfaction that there is no proliferation 
risk from the type and quality of uranium compounds at the Baghdad Yellowcake Facility. 

ÂThe Conference further expressed appreciation for the continuation by the Agency of its NPT 
safeguards activities in Iraq. 

ÂThe General Conference noted the Security CouncilÂs intention, as expressed in resolution 
1483, to revisit the mandates of the Agency and UNMOVIC.Â 

53. The PRESIDENT asked whether the Conference was prepared to endorse the statement which 
he had read out. 
54. The Conference endorsed the statement. 
55. Mr. THIEBAUD (France) said his delegation fully shared the views expressed by the Director 
General in his statement to Conference, in which he had underlined the responsibilities of the Agency, 
under the relevant Security Council resolutions and its NPT safeguards agreement with Iraq. The 
Agency was to be commended on the way in which it had been fulfilling its responsibilities and 
maintaining its operational preparedness through the Iraq Nuclear Verification Office. 
56. His delegation hoped that, when the AgencyÂs mandate was revisited, the role of the Agency in 
verifying that Iraq was fulfilling its obligations would be confirmed.

Report to the 47th regular session of the IAEA General Conference 

th

from the 6 Scientific Forum 

1. The 6th Scientific Forum, organized during the 47th regular session of the IAEA General 
Conference, took place in the Austria Center Vienna on 16Â17 September 2003 under the general title 
of ÂNew Horizons: Nuclear Energy in a Changing WorldÂ. The four sessions focused on: Innovative 
Approaches: Nuclear Power, Innovative Approaches: Nuclear Medicine and Self-reliant Institutions, 
IAEA Safety Standards: Towards Global Application, and Safeguards Technology: Challenges and 
Limitations. Each of the sessions consisted of an introduction by a moderator knowledgeable in the 
specific field and presentations by leading experts followed by panellistsÂ comments and discussion 
with participants. 
2. In Session 1, it was noted that world demand for energy is growing at a rate of 2.3% per year 
and will increase by 43% by 2025. Although no large increase in the use of nuclear energy is foreseen 
in the near and medium term, in the longer term an increased use of nuclear energy is generally 
predicted as a solution to meet the needs of global sustainable development, especially if significant 
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are required. 
3. The outcome of the International Conference on Innovative Technologies for Nuclear Fuel 
Cycles and Nuclear Power held in June in Vienna recognized a lack of understanding between the 
nuclear community and the public. Communication has to be substantially improved both within the 
nuclear community and with the public. Nuclear energy has a major role to play, and a major longterm 
shift in the market for nuclear energy towards todayÂs developing countries was anticipated. 
Although the current nuclear industry has reached the level of maturity, innovation would be required 
for further improvement of safety, economy, sustainability, and proliferation resistance even for the 
near term deployment of nuclear technology. It is necessary that nuclear power generation should be 
within the acceptable range of costs. For the developing countries to harness the potential of nuclear 
power appropriate solutions need to be found such as establishment of a special international fund etc. 
Nuclear system modelling may help for drawing conclusions about the future direction of research and 
development and there was general agreement that extensive international co-operation is necessary. 
The need to have synergy between various international initiatives particularly between INPRO and 
Generation IV was stressed. 
4. INPRO project was started by IAEA by asking whether nuclear energy could be a key, 
substantial part of meeting the energy needs for sustainable development particularly for developing 
countries. INPRO studied the new scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), particularly their conclusions about nuclear power and nuclear generated hydrogen, and the 
answer is that nuclear energy does have a major role to play, and the scenarios anticipate a major longterm 
shift in the market for nuclear energy toward todayÂs developing countries. 
5. An outline of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) programme was presented. The GIF 
member countries prepared a Generation IV technology roadmap, which identified the six most 
promising reactor systems and fuel cycle concepts and the R&D necessary to improve these concepts 
for commercialization by 2030. Furthermore, the Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative was initiated to 
reduce the volume of spent nuclear fuel and thereby reduce the cost of geological disposal, reclaim 
valuable energy in spent fuel and reduce inventories of civilian plutonium, and reduce radiotoxicity of 
spent fuel. 
6. The report of the interdisciplinary group from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA 
on the future of nuclear power was presented. The economics, safety, waste management and 

GC(47)/OR.9 
Annex 
19 September 2003, Page 2 

non-proliferation challenges of enabling a global mid-century deployment of about 1000 GW(e) were 
addressed through a set of findings and policy recommendations, including that such a mid-century 
growth scenario should be based primarily on thermal reactors operated in a once through mode. It 
suggests that a major international effort should be launched to develop the analytical tools and to 
collect essential scientific and engineering data for integrated assessment of fuel cycles. 

7. Early opportunities may exist for demonstration and implementation of nuclear-generated 
hydrogen. The refining industry could see the first large-scale use of nuclear energy for hydrogen 
production Â an initial but critical step to the Âhydrogen economyÂ. The increased demand for 
hydrogen is the result of using heavier crude oils in the manufacture of gasoline and other petroleum 
products. If the price of natural gas, the main feedstock for hydrogen production, remains at current 
levels or rises, alternative approaches to hydrogen production will become attractive. 
8. On the topic of nuclear power from fusion the advantages identified are inexhaustible fuel 
resources, ecological benefits, improved safety, a significantly lower level of radioactive waste, and an 
absence of materials that could be used for weapons. An engineering design for a 500 MW thermal 
reactor was completed in 2001. The negotiations concerning ITER construction have been started. 
Canada, Japan, France and Spain proposed options for site selection. 
9. There was general consensus that consideration should be given to the feasibility of multilateral 
co-operation on key aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle, particularly in view of the increasing 
non-proliferation, safety, security and technical challenges facing nuclear power. This consideration 
could include the merits of adopting a multilateral approach to the use of weapon-usable material in 
civilian nuclear programmes such as processing and production of such material in international 
centres with appropriate rules of transparency, control and assurance of supply. 
10. There was a broad agreement among the participants that international collaboration in general 
should be improved and substantially expanded. The IAEA is expected to play a key role in coordinating 
international efforts to develop innovative technologies. 
11. Session 2 on innovative approaches on nuclear medicine was introduced by referring to the 
advantages that tele-nuclear medicine techniques could bring to nuclear medicine. Reference was 
made in particular to the need to get public acceptance of nuclear medicine and for a better 
understanding of the risks. The advantages were clearly seen in areas of distance learning and uniform 
reporting between centres, providing a measure of quality assurance in nuclear medicine techniques. 
12. Development of internet-based study materials in Thailand for teaching and training in nuclear 
medicine was undertaken in the frame of an IAEA co-ordinated research project. The aim of the 
project was to create an information resource and database of nuclear medicine case studies, 
facilitating self-study by participating nuclear medicine practitioners. The major problems in 
developing countries for developing regional tele-nuclear medicine software are a lack of equipment, 
human resources and gamma cameras. To overcome these problems it is necessary to digitize 
analogue gamma cameras so that they can be used for and benefit from tele-nuclear medicine. 
13. Examples of the use of tele-nuclear medicine in Namibia and Latin America were presented. 
Patient data needs to be kept separate from scan data and virtual private networks are one solution for 
confidentiality of data transmission. The issue of fees for service was mentioned along with legal 
liability and the broader issue of acceptance of nuclear medicine. 
14. A demonstration of tele-nuclear medicine software was given and the Forum debated the levels 
of skills needed to implement and sustain a tele-nuclear medicine network. The AgencyÂs project 
experience showed that the regional server system needed the services of an informatics specialist, but 

GC(47)/OR.9 
Annex 
19 September 2003, Page 3 

in local hospitals generally a physicist could be trained in the technology. As regards data collection, it 
was recommended that dedicated boards be created to oversee and select website material. 

15. The session participants concluded that the Agency has a central role to play in promoting and 
implementing tele-nuclear medicine. 
16. The second part of Session 2 dealt with the development of greater self-reliance within nuclear 
institutions. An important topic was the concept of increasing self-reliance within nuclear institutions 
to reduce their financial dependence on state funding and, hence, to ensure their sustainability. Since 
the middle 1980s and particularly in the 1990s, the pressures experienced by many nuclear institutions 
to curtail their dependence on funding from government, has shaped the strategies and policies in these 
organizations. 
17. The Nuclear and Energy Research Institute (IPEN), Brazil, is a non-profit organization wholly 
owned by the National Commission of Nuclear Energy (CNEN). Although it focuses on domestic 
supply of radioisotopes, a few orders have also been produced for other countries within Latin 
America. CNEN also has the sole responsibility in Brazil to regulate the import of 
radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine and this ensures a high level of oversight of both imported 
and nationally produced radioisotopes. 
18. A wider scope of activities directed towards increasing self-reliance has been introduced at the 
Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology Research (MINT). MINTÂs three long-term strategies are: 
first, the relevance of the national nuclear institution in the context of mainstream socio-economic 
development; second, the need for the nuclear institution to fulfil social obligations; third, improving 
the image and acceptance of nuclear technology by the general public. As in the case of Brazil, the 
current scope of self-reliance activities is founded on extensive experience and development gained 
with the IAEA since the inception of MINT in 1972. 
19. The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) has carried out a critical evaluation of its 
R&D activities, defined its core competencies, restructured its two institutes and five centres, and 
established strategic business and marketing plans. Progress towards establishing commercial 
income-generating units has led to self-funding levels of between 20% and 40% of annual operating 
expenses within the various commercialising centres. The very rapid progress achieved by GAEC in 
its commercialisation programme shows the benefits of the co-operation with other centres within the 
region that have had more experience with their own commercialisation programmes, which has been 
carried through the IAEAÂs regional AFRA programme. 
20. The third session was devoted to the IAEA Safety Standards and their global application. Since 
the early days of the IAEA, the promulgation of standards, covering the areas of radiation and 
transport safety, the safe management of radioactive waste and the safety of nuclear installations, has 
been one of the statutory functions of the organization. 
21. The safety standards on radiation and transport have been instrumental in bringing about 
excellent safety records in these areas. Although the first set of standards on radioactive waste and 
nuclear safety acquired the poor reputation of being developed according to the lowest common 
denominator, the situation now is entirely different in this regard: all IAEA standards are now being 
developed and revised with the goal of enhancing safety in all Member States. A general agreement 
has emerged that all IAEA safety standards reflect a high level of safety and should serve as the global 
reference for the protection of people and the environment. Many regulatory bodies already use the 
IAEA standards as reference, but global implementation is still a challenge. 
22. Keynote speakers characterized the process of the development and review of the standards as a 
consensus-building process with heavy involvement of experts and stakeholders from Member States. 

GC(47)/OR.9 
Annex 
19 September 2003, Page 4 

This consensus should pave the way for their ultimate acceptability and application by all users. The 
discussion underlined the need for the Agency and its Member States to seek more opportunities for 
involving stakeholders in the various stages of the process. An example that was discussed is the 
IAEA transport regulations, covering an area that by its very nature is international, which are 
developed in close consultation with the national regulators and parties subject to the regulations. As a 
result, the regulations are widely applied in maritime, air, road and rail transport and incorporated by 
the international organizations like the International Maritime Organization and the International Civil 
Aviation Organization in their rules and assimilated in national regulations and practices. 

23. Co-sponsoring of safety standards, by involving other international organizations, is seen as 
another mechanism to promote worldwide acceptance. The example of the International Labour 
Organization shows the inclusion of organizations of employers and workers as major stakeholders. 
24. In the radiation protection area one of the keynote speakers illustrated the incorporation of 
relevant IAEA safety standards in a national system of legislation and regulatory requirements and 
guides, an example of a State where the AgencyÂs Model project on Upgrading Radiation Protection 
Infrastructure has been very successful. Over 80 countries are currently receiving assistance in 
developing relevant national rules and regulations. 
25. A proposal was presented for a regional approach in Europe for adopting the IAEA safety 
standards in the areas of nuclear installation safety and waste management. There was considerable 
debate on the added value and actual implementation of European standards. Regardless the outcome 
of the debate on European standards, there is a clear consensus that the IAEA safety standards will 
serve as their basis. Alternative mechanisms were suggested, such as using the national reporting and 
peer review under the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, in order to establish to what 
extent States have adequate national rules and regulations in place. 
26. International standards organizations develop industrial standards that complement the IAEA 
safety standards by specifying detailed requirements for design and operation of components and 
procedures. It would be desirable for these types of standards, developed by the International 
Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission, to use a common 
structure and share the glossaries of terms together with the IAEA safety standards. 
27. Professional societies, especially those in the medical area, are considered as stakeholders that 
could play an important role in the development and review of IAEA safety standards. They could 
subsequently assist in the dissemination of these standards amongst a wide audience of potential users 
of nuclear technology, channel feedback on the use of the standards, and contribute to updating and 
the continuous improvement of the standards. 
28. The fourth session highlighted the technological challenges posed by the implementation of 
measures for strengthening safeguards, including the SecretariatÂs efforts to keep abreast of 
technological development and to implement new technology to optimize the effectiveness and 
cost-efficiency of safeguards implementation. It also focused on some of the limitations of the 
AgencyÂs current safeguards technology in terms of both capability and resources. 
29. The four presentations given in the Session covered two broad aspects of safeguards 
technology: information handling and analysis and in-field verification activities. Particular emphasis 
was given to the use of technology for the safeguards State evaluation process, specifically the 
collection and analysis of open source information including satellite imagery; the use of 
environmental sampling techniques, and future safeguards equipment needs and technology. Speakers 
and panellists highlighted some salient points associated with the development of safeguards 
technology against the backdrop of the strengthened safeguards system, for example: a large volume 

GC(47)/OR.9 
Annex 
19 September 2003, Page 5 

of information, equipment and safeguards samples; the built-in obsolescence of much new equipment; 
the long lead-time for new technology; unique boundary conditions and limited financial resources. 

30. On the first point, the introduction of safeguards strengthening measures means that the Agency 
needs to handle a more extensive volume of information, equipment and safeguards samples than ever 
before. This requires specific underpinning infrastructure such as new databases and other tools; new 
skills and training, which must be dynamic to respond to changing requirements. Safeguards 
development is continually aiming at a moving target. 
31. The issue of obsolescence derives from a rapidly changing technological environment. There is 
built-in obsolescence in such areas as information technology systems and in-field equipment. The 
Agency needs to cope with all of that and is attempting to do so. In that regard, the Session noted, 
inter alia, that a major project is underway to modernize the safeguards information system and that an 
equipment-upgrading programme is in place. 
32. The Session also noted that the Department of Safeguards must try to envisage future equipment 
and technology needs early on, in view of the long lead-time required for development. 
33. New measures for strengthening safeguards mean recourse to new techniques and 
methodologies. The Agency needs to continue to keep abreast of state-of-the art technology and to 
incorporate it properly in its development programme. One constraint it faces is its heavy dependence 
on the capability of others, due to the fact that it does not, in itself, have all of the necessary technical 
capabilities. This is essentially a resource problem. 
34. The development of safeguards technology is carried out under unique boundary conditions. 
The market for dedicated equipment for safeguards use is small and manufacturers cannot easily 
recover the huge development costs involved. Hence, the development of safeguards equipment is 
frequently an unattractive option commercially. Other examples of unique boundary conditions are 
that: 
Â 
In-field equipment must operate in harsh environments with sufficient reliability; 
Â 
Instrumentation must be non-intrusive and acceptable to State authorities and facility 
operators; 
Â 
Data authentication and tamper-proof measures needs to be incorporated; and 
Â 
The confidentiality of information needs to be protected. 
35. Because of the zero real-growth Agency budgets that have characterized the last decade, the 
Secretariat does not have sufficient resources to enable it to address its many challenges in full. In this 
context, the Member State Support Programmes for Agency Safeguards (MSSP) have been major 
contributors to the personnel, financial and technical resources required. 
36. During discussion on how to cope with the kinds of challenges and limitations 
recommendations made were: 
Â 
Given that it is neither technically nor financially possible for the Agency to be selfsufficient 
technologically, it should try to identify specific areas in which support from 
States would be useful and beneficial. An example of this is the establishment of the 
Network of Analytical Laboratories. Other possible areas of co-operation should also be 
investigated; 

GC(47)/OR.9 
Annex 
19 September 2003, Page 6 

Â 
Member States should continue to support the Department of Safeguards in keeping up to 
date with appropriate technology. In particular, on-going MSSP support is essential to 
equipment development; 
Â 
The Department of Safeguards should make greater use of the capabilities of State 
Systems for the Accounting and Control of Nuclear Material (SSAC). More use of SSAC 
effectiveness leads to greater efficiency in safeguards implementation; 
Â 
A key priority is the further development and refinement of integrated safeguards. This 
should be aimed not only at increasing safeguards effectiveness but also efficiency. 
37. Thus, the 6th Scientific Forum addressed a number of key issues for the nuclear community. 
Proposals have been made for several actions by the Agency and these are commended to you.
