Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2, 
GC(52)/L.8) 
1. The PRESIDENT asked the representative of Algeria for an update regarding her suggestion for 
amending the proposal contained in document GC/(52)/L.8. 
2. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that her delegation had hoped to avoid a vote both on that 
proposal and on the amended version suggested by her, but that did not seem possible as one 
delegation had requested a vote. She was therefore proposing a new paragraph for the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2 Â it read ÂEmphasizes the importance of the peace process 
and the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East in promoting mutual confidence and security in 
the regionÂ. The proposal was co-sponsored by Egypt and Jordan. 
3. The PRESIDENT asked the representative of Algeria whether her proposal was meant to 
replace the proposal made in document GC)52)/L.8. 
4. 
Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that it was. 
5. The PRESIDENT asked whether the proposal made in document GC(52)/L.8 was being 
withdrawn. 
6. 
Mr ZNIBER (Morocco) said that it was. 
7. The PRESIDENT requested the representative of Algeria to indicate where her proposal should 
appear as an operative paragraph in the draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2. 
8. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) indicated that it should be placed immediately after operative 
paragraph 8. 
9. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that, in his delegationÂs opinion, the wording just proposed by the 
representative of Algeria constituted an amendment to existing paragraph 9 of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2, which had been adopted the previous day. He invoked 
Rule 66 of the Rules of Procedure (Reconsideration of proposals and amendments), under which a 
two-thirds majority would be required for any reconsideration. 
10. 
The PRESIDENT agreed that Rule 66 applied. 
11. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that she had not proposed that an approved amendment be 
amended; she had proposed the insertion of a new paragraph into the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2. Accordingly, there was no reason to apply Rule 66. 
12. The PRESIDENT said that, if he understood correctly, the representative of Algeria had 
proposed not that paragraph 9 be replaced but that a new paragraph be inserted, so that both 
paragraphs would appear in the text. 
13. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that Rule 66 did not apply as the purpose of her proposal was to 
replace, not to amend, paragraph 9. 
14. The PRESIDENT, having consulted with the Secretariat, said he concluded that the proposal 
made by the representative of Algeria, to replace the existing paragraph 9, would in fact constitute

reconsideration of that paragraph, which had been adopted the previous day, and that Rule 66 was 
therefore applicable. 

15. He asked the representative of Algeria whether she agreed. 
16. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that she did. 
17. The PRESIDENT confirmed the need for a two-thirds majority pursuant to Rule 66 and said he 
took it that delegations were ready to vote on the proposal made by the representative of Algeria. 
18. Mr DENIAU (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, requested a suspension of the 
meeting for consultations. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
6 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
6.10 
p.m. 


19. Mr RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs) said that, pursuant to Rule 66, there 
should first be a procedural vote, requiring a two-thirds majority, on whether to reconsider the 
decision taken the previous day on paragraph 9. If a two-thirds majority decided in favour, a vote 
would then need to be held on the substance of the proposal made by the representative of Algeria, and 
that required a simple majority for adoption. 
20. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that the purpose of her proposal was not to amend a paragraph 
approved the previous day, but to insert a new paragraph. 
21. Mr DANIELI (Israel), speaking on a point of order, said that in the view of his delegation the 
voting had already commenced. 
22. The PRESIDENT said that he had not yet called for a vote. 
23. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) reiterated that the purpose of her proposal was to insert a new 
paragraph and said that therefore Rule 66 did not apply. 
24. The PRESIDENT recalled that the representative of Algeria had earlier said that the purpose of 
her proposal was to replace paragraph 9, approved the previous day. 
25. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) confirmed the PresidentÂs recollection of that earlier statement. 
However, after looking at Rule 66, she had taken the floor again in order to state that the purpose of 
her proposal was the addition of a new paragraph and not the amendment of an existing one. Thus, a 
two-thirds majority was not necessary. 
26. The PRESIDENT, responding to a question put by the representative of FRANCE, said that, as 
he saw it, Rule 66 applied. 
27. The PRESIDENT suspended the meeting in order to consult with the representative of Algeria. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
6.20 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
6.25 
p.m. 


28. The PRESIDENT confirmed his ruling that the Conference would consider the proposal made 
by the representative of Algeria in the context of Rule 66. He was grateful to the representative of 
Algeria for her understanding. 
29. Mr DENIAU (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, and pursuant to Rule 66, 
which accorded permission to speak on a motion to reconsider a proposal or amendment to two 
speakers opposing the motion, said that there was no reason to reconsider a paragraph which had been 
adopted the previous day.

30. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that it was clear from what the representative 
of Algeria had said that she had withdrawn her proposal calling for the replacement of a paragraph 
approved the previous day and had made a new proposal, to add a new paragraph. Thus, Rule 66 did 
not apply. 
31. The PRESIDENT said that two contradictory proposals had been made by the same delegation. 
He had discussed the matter with the representative of Algeria and with the Secretariat, and, based on 
his judgment of the content of the paragraph, the representative of Algeria had agreed to revert to her 
initial proposal. He hoped that the delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran could go along with that 
explanation. 
32. A vote would now be held on the motion to reconsider paragraph 9 of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2, which read ÂEmphasizes the importance of the peace 
process in the Middle East in promoting mutual confidence and security in the region, including the 
establishment of a NWFZÂ. In order to save time, he asked delegations whether they would agree to 
voting by a show of hands. 
33. It was so agreed. 
34. The motion was rejected by 35 votes in favour to 38 against, with 21 abstentions. 
35. Mr DANIELI (Israel) requested a vote on the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2. 
36. The PRESIDENT asked whether a vote by show of hands was acceptable to the delegation of 
Israel. 
37. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that it was. 
38. Mr FAWZY (Egypt) requested a roll-call vote. 
39. At the request of Mr Fawzy (Egypt) a roll-call vote was taken. 
40. France, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
41. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 
Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, 
China, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt,

42. There were 82 votes in favour and none against, with 13 abstentions. The draft resolution was 
adopted. 
43. Mr KUMAR (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had abstained 
because the language used in the draft resolution went beyond the purview of the AgencyÂs Statute. 
44. Mr HASTOWO (Indonesia), having associated himself with the statement made the previous 
day by the representative of Cuba on behalf of NAM, said that his country continued to favour the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Although the issue had been 
discussed in various United Nations fora for over thirty years, a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East had not yet materialized, and the Director General had remarked in his opening statement 
that no further progress had been made regarding the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle 
East. 
45. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed that Israel would have to accede to the NPT 
and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards before a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone could be established in the Middle East. The prospect of such a zone 
seemed to be a distant one, however, as the region remained unsettled, and the situation was 
exacerbated by IsraelÂs continued development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons, which posed the 
risk of a destructive arms race. Moreover, the continued threat to the security of neighbouring 
countries was having a negative impact on efforts to curb proliferation in the region. 
46. He welcomed the progress made towards the convening of a forum in which States in other 
regions might share their experience of nuclear-weapon-free zones with the States of the Middle East, 
and he hoped that consultations with Member States in the Middle East would result in a consensus 
regarding the modalities and agenda of the forum. 
47. He urged Israel to respond positively to the demands of the international community and place 
all its nuclear activities under full-scope Agency safeguards. 
48. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of vote, said that he had 
voted in favour of the draft resolution in the light of his countryÂs position regarding the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
49. His country would continue to support all measures aimed at pressuring on the Zionist regime of 
Israel into destroying its nuclear weapons and placing all its nuclear facilities under full-scope Agency 
safeguards, as IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities continued to pose a threat to the security of the Middle East 
and the world at large. 
50. The adoption, by an overwhelming majority, of paragraph 2 of the draft resolution, reading 
ÂCalls upon all States in the region to accede to the Non-Proliferation TreatyÂ, was a clarion call for 
Israel to accede to the NPT. The international community would not tolerate the status quo, and the 
United States and Israel had isolated themselves still further by voting against the adoption of that 
paragraph. 
51. Although it had voted in favour of adoption of the draft resolution as a whole, his delegation 
had reservations regarding paragraph 9, the inclusion of which it had voted against. 
52. Mr DANIELI (Israel), in explanation of his request for a vote on the draft resolution, said that 
his delegation had strived for a text that would enable the General Conference to regain the consensus 
it had lost three years previously. However, the spirit of compromise and good faith shown by his 
delegation had met with repeated attempts to exclude Israel.

53. The adoption of the redundant amendment proposed by the representative of Algeria had left his 
delegation with no choice but to request a vote on a draft resolution it would otherwise have 
supported. That was regrettable, because Israel attached great importance to the Middle East peace 
process, which was an indispensable step towards the eventual establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East, and to compliance by all States in the region with international obligations 
and commitments relating to safeguards. 
54. Operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution was inconsistent with IsraelÂs position that the 
applicability of the NPT in the Middle East was at best limited. It was important to bear in mind that 
three of the four widely recognized cases of non-compliance with the NPT had taken place in Middle 
East States party to the NPT. 
55. His delegation greatly appreciated the support shown by Member States for the amendments 
proposed by Israel in document GC(52)/L.6, and it hoped that, in future, a new balance would be 
found; that would benefit both the Middle East and the Agency. 
56. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his delegation had abstained in the vote on the 
draft resolution because it was disappointed with the way in which various proposed amendments had 
been dealt with. The General Conference had once again failed to adopt by consensus the most 
important draft resolution before it. 
57. In order for a nuclear-weapon-free zone to be established in the Middle East, Israel must first 
accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards. All other 
States in the region had done so in good faith as a confidence-building measure, but the international 
community had shown total disregard for their actions by condoning IsraelÂs refusal to take measures 
that would contribute to international peace and security. 
58. Moreover, it was inappropriate to criticize States in the Middle East for politicizing the 
AgencyÂs mandate: the real politicization lay in the implication that a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East would be possible only once peace had been established there. Nothing would be 
achieved by making peace a precondition for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
59. International obligations and commitments relating to safeguards should be complied with by 
all States, including Israel, and to claim that it was exempt because it had not acceded to the NPT 
created a double standard. Instead of adopting amendments proposed by Israel, which gave the 
erroneous impression that it was committed to compliance with international obligations and 
commitments while others were not, the General Conference should have called upon Israel to accede 
to the NPT. 
60. Mr CONCHOLA GUTIERREZ (Mexico) said that his country, which was strongly in favour of 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, would have preferred the 
adoption of the more balanced draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/L.1. 
61. Ms GOICOCHEA ESTENOZ (Cuba) said that her delegation had voted in favour of the draft 
resolution despite a number of serious reservations, particularly with regard to paragraphs 3 
and 9, which her delegation would have voted against had each paragraph been voted on separately. 
62. With regard to paragraph 3, the country that had proposed its inclusion had not acceded to the 
NPT or placed all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. That was a matter of particular 
concern given that the Israeli Prime Minister had said on 11 December 2006 that Israel possessed 
nuclear weapons. His comments had in September 2007 been condemned by NAM at a ministerial 
meeting held in Tehran. Her delegation fully supported the statements made regarding those comments 
at the ministerial meeting.

63. With regard to operative paragraph 9, it referred to aspects of the Middle East peace process that 
had no place in the draft resolution contained in document CG(52)/L.1/Mod.2. 
64. Cuba, which strongly supported the application of Agency safeguards, would very much like to 
see the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. In order for that to happen 
however, Israel must accede to the NPT. 
65. Her delegation hoped that at the next session of the General Conference a balanced draft 
resolution would be adopted. 
66. Mr ELDIN ELAMIN (Sudan) said that, although his delegation had voted in favour of the draft 
resolution, it was strongly opposed to paragraphs 3 and 9. Those paragraphs, proposed by the Israeli 
delegation, ran counter to the basic principles of the Agency and were not conducive to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
67. His delegation had favoured the original draft resolution proposed by Egypt in document 
GC(52)/L.1. 
68. The international community should press for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East, with the accession of Israel to the NPT. Failure to do so would have serious 
consequences. 
69. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that it was regrettable that the draft resolution had not been 
adopted by consensus. 
70. Her delegation had voted in favour of it because the inclusion of paragraph 2, reading ÂCalls 
upon all States in the region to accede to the Non-Proliferation TreatyÂ, made for a better balance. 
71. Her country hoped that Israel would accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under 
Agency safeguards. 
72. With regard to paragraph 9, the Agency should avoid politicization and continue its efforts 
aimed at the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Her delegation had 
every confidence that the Director General would successfully implement his mandate in that 
connection. 
73. Mr MENESI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) said that his delegation had abstained in the vote 
because paragraphs 3 and 9 had changed the spirit of the draft resolution proposed by Egypt in 
document GC(52)/L.1. In particular, paragraph 9 politicized a very important issue. By declaring 
peace to be a precondition for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, the 
General Conference was sending a signal to one of the States in the region that it could continue to 
acquire weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, until peace was achieved. That was 
contrary to the aims of the Agency. 
74. In 2003 his country had voluntarily renounced all weapons of mass destruction, including 
nuclear weapons, and it would like to see Israel following suit and acceding to the NPT. 
75. Mr ENKHSAIKHAN (Mongolia) said that his delegation had voted in favour of the draft 
resolution because Mongolia attached great importance to the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones as a practical regional measure for strengthening the non-proliferation regime and promoting 
confidence and cooperation. 
76. The establishment of such zones was particularly important in regions prone to conflict, and the 
accession of all States in the Middle East to the NPT, with the application of full-scope Agency 
safeguards, would represent an important milestone in that region.

77. His delegation hoped that the persistent efforts of the Director General would soon result in the 
convening of a forum for sharing experiences of existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and thereby 
creating the political environment required for pursuing the establishment of such a zone in the Middle 
East. In the meantime, all States in the region should refrain from taking any action that might hinder 
the attainment of that objective. 
78. Mr SCHULTE (United States of America), speaking in explanation of vote, said that great 
efforts had been made during the ConferenceÂs current session to find a consensus approach to the 
package of Middle East issues. Regrettably, no consensus had been reached, and the United States had 
abstained in the vote. However, it endorsed the principal aims of the draft resolution just adopted Â 
universal adherence to the NPT and a Middle East free of all weapons of mass destruction, including 
nuclear weapons, within the context of a stable and comprehensive regional peace. It therefore agreed 
with the General ConferenceÂs calling upon all States in the Middle East to comply with their 
international obligations and commitments relating to safeguards and to cooperate fully with the 
Agency. 
79. Mr QUEISI (Jordan), speaking in explanation of vote and having recalled that his country had 
voted against the amendments proposed by Israel the previous day, said that Jordan had voted in 
favour of the draft resolution given its interest in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in 
the Middle East. In its view, Israel should accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards, as envisaged in the draft resolution just adopted.

80. The PRESIDENT said that item 21 had been included in the ConferenceÂs agenda pursuant to a 
request by the Arab States that were members of the Agency. An explanatory memorandum was 
contained in document GC(52)/1/Add.1. The Conference also had before it documents GC(52)/16, 
GC(52)/17, GC(52)/20 and GC(52)/26. 
81. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco), speaking on behalf of the Member States of the League of Arab States, 
said that it was unacceptable for any country in one of the most volatile regions of the world to possess 
nuclear weapons. The Arab countries had adopted a unified position in support of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and had, without exception, acceded to the NPT and embraced the initiative 
for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. Mutual security remained 
absent in that region, however, owing to the refusal of Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its 
nuclear facilities under international safeguards. IsraelÂs refusal to join the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime would only exacerbate tensions in the Middle East and could lead to an arms race. 
82. The Arab countries were seeking not simply to highlight a dangerous situation, but also to 
present practical solutions. A solution could be found only through the adoption of a comprehensive 
approach that took into account the security of all countries in the Middle East rather than dealing 
separately with each country, since that suggested selectivity, bias and double standards. As a result of 
Arab endeavours during the past three decades, resolutions had been adopted within the framework of 
the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, the NPT Review Conferences and the 
Agency calling upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards. Despite those resolutions, Israel continued to ignore international 

GC(52)/OR.10

calls for it to accede to the NPT Â a prerequisite for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East. 

83. Impartial reports had indicated that Israel possessed an enormous nuclear arsenal; the Arab 
countries and the international community at large could not disregard such a state of affairs. It was 
incomprehensible that Israel could pursue the development of its nuclear capabilities thanks to the 
absence of genuine international pressure on it to desist. Moreover, the situation had evolved to the 
point where all possible means were being used in order to prevent the adoption of any General 
Conference resolution mentioning Israel, at a time when accusations were being arbitrarily directed at 
other States. 
84. The problem of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East would never be resolved as long as 
Israel rejected adherence to the relevant treaties, and the international community should call upon 
Israel to accede immediately to the NPT as a prelude to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. 
85. He wished to address the reasons put forward by some countries as a pretext for trying to 
prevent the inclusion of the item now under consideration in the ConferenceÂs agenda and all 
discussion under that item. 
86. Firstly, in response to the view that the Agency was a technical body that should not meddle in 
political issues, he said that the item had been discussed during previous sessions of the General 
Conference and that several resolutions with language more forceful than that in the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(52)/L.2 had been adopted. Indeed, the draft resolution now before the 
Conference was the result of modifications made in response to concerns expressed by some Member 
States, and the agenda item title ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ had become ÂIsraeli nuclear 
capabilitiesÂ. 
87. Secondly, regarding the view that one resolution on the Middle East would suffice, he said that 
the resolutions entitled ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ and ÂIsraeli nuclear 
capabilitiesÂ related to two separate agenda items and differed substantially in content. The first dealt 
generally with the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, without making explicit 
reference to particular countries, whereas the second focused on Israel as the only country in the 
region that had refrained from acceding to the NPT and placing all its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards. There was no procedural impediment to the adoption by the General Conference of two or 
more resolutions relating to just one region. 
88. Thirdly, regarding the view that naming Israel would be tantamount to singling it out and 
pressurising it, he said that Israel had chosen to single itself out by insisting on remaining the only 
country in the Middle East that refused to accede to the NPT. 
89. Fourthly, regarding the frequently heard call for compromise, he said that the Arab Member 
States had again demonstrated their interest in preserving the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ when preparing the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/L.2. 
90. He called on the General Conference to give the ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ issue the attention 
it deserved with a view to ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons and laying the foundations for 
peace and security in the region and the world at large, and thanked those who had supported the Arab 
position and the inclusion of the item in the agenda of the Conference Â particularly NAM and the 
Organisation of the Islamic Conference. 
91. Ms GOICOCHEA ESTENOZ (Cuba) said that her country attached the utmost importance to 
the agenda item under consideration as it related to an issue which had grave negative implications for 
peace and security in the Middle East and the world at large. Through its actions, Israel was violating 

GC(52)/OR.10 
4 
October 
2008, 
Page 
9 


the spirit of the Agency's Statute, and Cuba did not accept the view that the issue did not fall within 
the purview of the Agency. 

92. As regards the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ, the past 24 hours had underlined the absence of any such 
spirit, with delegations being called upon to respect the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ precisely by those 
delegations which failed to do so themselves. Cuba rejected such hypocrisy. 
93. Israel, which was the only country in the Middle East that was not a party to the NPT, and 
which had not expressed any intention to become one, should accede to that treaty without delay and 
place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. That would be a significant 
contribution to the cause of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
94. In the interests of peace and stability, the transfer to Israel of all nuclear equipment, information, 
material, facilities, resources and devices should be stopped, along with the provision of scientific and 
technological assistance of use in the nuclear field. At a NAM ministerial conference held in Tehran in 
July 2008, ministers had expressed serious concern at the fact that a nuclear-weapon State was 
continuing to grant Israeli scientists access to its nuclear facilities, as such action could have serious 
negative implications for security in the Middle East and the viability of the global non-proliferation 
regime. 
95. Real political will was necessary if the Middle East was to become a region of peace. An end 
must be put to the double standards in nuclear-related matters demonstrated by the Government of the 
United States and others that accused some States in the region of non-compliance with safeguards 
obligations while continuing to provide Israel with assistance in the nuclear field. The United States 
and its allies should adopt a consistent position and call for the controlled destruction, under 
international supervision, of IsraelÂs nuclear weapons. 
96. Ms CALCINARI (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that her country was concerned at the 
continuing refusal of Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards despite repeated calls from the international community. Its concern had grown 
considerably when the Israeli Prime Minister had admitted publicly that Israel possessed nuclear 
weapons. 
97. The world could not remain indifferent to the knowledge that a State that had for decades been 
disregarding United Nations resolutions and the basic rights of the Palestinian people was conducting 
an advanced nuclear programme not subject to any Agency safeguards. Nor could the world ignore the 
fact that a State capable of attacking two of its neighbours, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic, in 
open violation of the basic principles of international humanitarian law and the United Nations Charter 
was in possession of nuclear weapons not subject to any international supervision. 
98. The existence in the Middle East of a State with an advanced nuclear programme not subject to 
Agency safeguards was clearly the greatest obstacle to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the region. The refusal of Israel to accede to the NPT was a clear challenge to the international 
community, and called into question the willingness of its Government to achieve a lasting peace with 
its neighbours. 
99. It was unacceptable that some Member States purporting to be defenders of freedom and justice 
should refuse to deplore the fact that a State with a history of aggression within its region had a 
nuclear programme outside international law. 
100. Mr FAWZY (Egypt) said that the preservation of international peace and security and the 
implementation of the principles of non-proliferation and disarmament were closely interrelated goals. 
The persistence of double standards regarding IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities constituted a serious threat 
to peace and security in the Middle East. The international silence in the face of that threat and the 

GC(52)/OR.10

Page 
10 


willingness to provide political cover for it were undermining the non-proliferation regime and the 
efforts being made to achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East. That silence was 
persisting despite the existence of binding resolutions of the Security Council and resolutions of the 
General Assembly, the General Conference and the NPT Review Conferences held in 1995 and 2000, 
all of which supported the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and called upon 
Israel to renounce the nuclear option, to accede to the NPT, to place all its nuclear facilities under 
full-scope Agency safeguards and to work with its neighbours for the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone. It was persisting also despite significant indications that Israel, with the 
public announcement of its possession of military nuclear capabilities, had moved away from a policy 
of nuclear ambiguity. 

101. It was bewildering that Israel had, under the agenda item ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in 
the Middle EastÂ, proposed the addition to the draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/L.1 of a 
paragraph reading ÂCalls upon all States in the region of the Middle East to comply with their 
international obligations and commitments relating to safeguardsÂ while itself refusing to comply. 
102. Regrettably, neither Israel nor some other countries had appreciated the Arab StatesÂ concession 
in refraining in previous years from submitting a draft resolution under the agenda item ÂIsraeli 
nuclear capabilities and threatÂ. Israel was taking advantage of the cover that some States were 
continuing to provide, advancing the unacceptable argument that the possession of nuclear weapons 
guaranteed peace and security. 
103. Member States should give balanced consideration to the issue now before the Conference, 
demonstrating an international commitment to work for the implementation of all the aforementioned 
resolutions and for the continued credibility of the non-proliferation regime as embodied in the 
AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system. 
104. The international community should send a clear message to Israel under the current agenda 
item by addressing the serious threat to international peace and security posed by IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities. That would help to restore the credibility of the international community, and more 
particularly that of the five nuclear-weapon States when they called for the universality of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 
105. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), reviewing past events that had a bearing on the 
item under discussion, said that the Zionist regime of Israel was the only regime to have attacked 
nuclear facilities, threatening peace and security and also public health. In 1982, a draft resolution had 
been submitted to the General Conference condemning that inhuman violation of international law. 
The United States had threatened to leave the Agency if the draft resolution was adopted, which would 
have caused a major financial crisis. The Islamic Republic of Iran had undertaken to offset the 
financial deficit. Although the draft resolution had been adopted, the United States had remained a 
member of the Agency. Later, in 1990, the General Conference had adopted resolution 
GC (XXXIV)/RES/533, in which it was stated that any attack on or threat of armed attack against 
nuclear facilities devoted to peaceful purposes, whether under construction or in operation, constituted 
a violation of the United Nations Charter, international law and the Statute of the Agency and that, in 
the event of such an attack or threat of attack, the Security Council would have to act immediately. 
106. What was regrettable was not only IsraelÂs continuing violations of the spirit and letter of the 
Agency's Statute and numerous General Conference resolutions, but also the double standards and 
shameful silence of Western countries Â particularly the United States Â that claimed to be the 
proponents of the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards and nuclear safety and security regimes. The 
United States, the United Kingdom and France had continuously cooperated with Israel, violating their 
obligations under Article I of the NPT by transferring nuclear weapons technology and materials to it. 

GC(52)/OR.10

Such action had led to the announcement by Israel of its possession of nuclear weapons. While the 
majority of the AgencyÂs Member States had condemned that announcement, the United States and the 
European Union had failed to do so. 

107. His country welcomed the solidarity of NAM vis-Ã -vis the Zionist regime of Israel. At a NAM 
ministerial conference held in Tehran in July, ministers had reiterated that the only country in the 
Middle East that had not acceded to the NPT, or declared its intention to do so, should renounce its 
possession of nuclear weapons, accede to the NPT without delay, promptly place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency full-scope safeguards in accordance with Security Council 
resolution 487 (1981) and conduct all its nuclear-related activities in conformity with the 
non-proliferation regime. The ministers had called for the prompt implementation of the General 
ConferenceÂs resolutions on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East and had 
expressed great concern regarding IsraelÂs acquisition of nuclear capabilities, which posed a serious 
continuing threat to the security of neighbouring and other States. In addition, they had condemned 
Israel for continuing to develop and stockpile nuclear weapons, and also the statement made by the 
Prime Minister of Israel on 11 December 2006 relating to IsraelÂs possession of such weapons. The 
ministers had called for the continuing consideration of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities within the context 
of the Agency since stability could not be achieved in a region where massive imbalances in military 
capacity persisted, particularly owing to one StateÂs possession of nuclear weapons. They had also 
called for a complete prohibition of the transfer to Israel of nuclear-related equipment, information, 
material, facilities, resources and devices and for termination of the provision to Israel of scientific and 
technological assistance useful in the nuclear field. They had expressed serious concern about the fact 
that Israeli scientists were still being granted access to the nuclear facilities of nuclear-weapon States, 
which could have serious negative implications for security in the Middle East and for the global 
non-proliferation regime. The ministers had underscored NAMÂs position of principle regarding the 
use, or threat of use, of force against the territorial integrity of any State and had condemned the Israeli 
attack on a Syrian facility carried out on 6 September 2007, while welcoming SyriaÂs cooperation with 
the Agency in that connection. 
108. A lasting peace could not be achieved in the region while the threat of IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities persisted. 
109. Mr DENIAU (France) said that the European UnionÂs position in support of universalization of 
the NPT and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear 
weapons, in the Middle East was well known. That position was reflected in General Conference 
resolutions adopted between 1993 and 2005. The fact that the Conference had not managed to reach a 
consensus regarding such resolutions since 2005 did not mean that the desire to achieve those 
objectives had diminished in any way. 
110. The resolution just adopted on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East called 
for the universalization of the NPT in the Middle East. In the European Union's opinion, however, the 
draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities went far beyond that objective, and consequently the 
European Union could not support it. 
111. For over ten years, the European Union had been cooperating with the Southern Mediterranean 
States within the framework of the Barcelona Process, one of the objectives of which was to promote 
the establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction and means of carrying such 
weapons in the Middle East. On 13 July 2008, in Paris, the Union for the Mediterranean had been 
launched with the objective of promoting Â inter alia Â the establishment of a zone free of weapons 
of mass destruction in the Mediterranean region. Other initiatives relating to the establishment of a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East had included the organization by the 
European Union Institute for Security Studies earlier in 2008 of an informal forum that had been 

GC(52)/OR.10

October 
2008, 
Page 
12 


attended by representatives of the European Union, the League of Arab States, the Council of the 
European Union, national nuclear authorities, universities and think tanks. 

112. A zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East could not be established 
without dialogue among the parties concerned, confidence-building measures and peace negotiations. 
All States in the region had to be convinced that the establishment of such a zone would enhance their 
security, not diminish it. Also, any nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would have to be 
verifiable. The Agency would have to be able to verify compliance with safeguards agreements, the 
non-diversion of declared material to military purposes, and the absence of undeclared nuclear 
material and activities. Accordingly, all States in the region would have to sign, ratify and implement 
an additional protocol and cooperate fully with the Agency, and cases of violation of non-proliferation 
obligations would have to be resolved. 
113. The General Conference should strive to achieve consensus and preserve the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ, 
but the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities could only divide it. The Agency was, and 
should remain, a technical body, and the draft resolution dealt with issues that went beyond the 
purview of the Agency. His delegation hoped that Member States would work together to find and 
acceptably resolve the issue now before the Conference. 
114. Mr HASTOWO (Indonesia) said that the Israeli Prime Minister had, in December 2006, 
acknowledged that Israel possessed nuclear weapons. Such weapons were a matter of grave concern 
for the international community, posing a serious threat to the security of the Middle East and beyond. 
NAM had called for the transfer of nuclear material, information, equipment and facilities and the 
provision of nuclear-related scientific and technical assistance to Israel to be prohibited. NAMÂs call 
should be respected in order to maintain the status of the NPT. 
115. Indonesia was deeply concerned about the present unfeasibility of establishing a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East due to the non-compliant attitude of Israel in refusing to 
accede to the NPT and accept Agency safeguards on all its nuclear facilities. A change in that attitude 
was a prerequisite for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and would contribute greatly 
to peace and security in the Middle East. 
116. Indonesia continued to favour discussion of the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities within the 
framework of the Agency, particularly in the General Conference, and the adoption of a draft 
resolution on the issue. 
117. Mr ELDIN ELAMIN (Sudan) said that his country was greatly concerned about IsraelÂs nuclear 
programme, which was not under Agency safeguards and put peace and security in the Middle East at 
risk, and about the fact that the Israeli Prime Minister had acknowledged the possession by Israel of a 
nuclear arsenal. 
118. The General Conference had not been able to adopt a resolution on IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities 
since 1999, although interest in the issue, and in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East, had grown. Given the security situation in the region, the adoption of a resolution by 
the General Conference was necessary now more than ever, and Sudan hoped that the General 
Conference would assume its responsibilities in that respect. 
119. The draft resolution submitted in document GC(52)/L.2, which spelled out basic principles 
agreed on by all Member States, called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear 
facilities under comprehensive safeguards Â actions already taken by all other States in the Middle 
East. 
120. Over a quarter of a century before, in its resolution 487 (1981), the United Nations Security 
Council had called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and submit all its nuclear facilities to safeguards, 

GC(52)/OR.10

13 


but Israel had ignored the voice of the international community, and no one had since then been able 
to force Israel to heed it. Rather, Israel had been helped to remain an exception. Sudan would like to 
see a just and balanced policy adopted vis-Ã -vis Israel given the importance of the nuclear issue. 

121. In that context, his country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in support of peace, stability 
and security in the Middle East. 
122. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) said that his country welcomed the presence of the present item on 
the agenda of the General Conference, since the nuclear activities of Israel posed a threat to its 
neighbours and undermined peace and security in the Middle East. 
123. During its history, Lebanon had on numerous occasions been subject to Israeli aggression 
directed against its people and its infrastructure, with serious negative consequences for his country. 
Lebanon was still struggling to recover from the act of aggression that had taken place in July 2006. 
124. At the end of the previous General Conference session, his delegation had hoped that the 
year 2008 would give concerned Member States time to re-examine the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities, with Arab States endeavouring to convince other States to change their position. It 
remained convinced of the importance of reaching agreement on basic principles relating to that issue, 
particularly the principle that States were entitled to express their concerns about countries that 
produced and were in possession of nuclear weapons. 
125. In the opinion of Lebanon, which had unconditional respect for the NPT and for the relevant 
resolutions adopted within the United Nations framework, it was essential that Israel accede to the 
NPT and give the Agency access to all its nuclear facilities. 
126. It appeared that a consensus on the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2 would not 
materialize. Lebanon, which greatly regretted that fact, would like to see Member States in all regions 
ensuring that no political pressure was brought to bear and no political compromises were made in 
such an important matter. 
127. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his country was greatly concerned about the 
fact that the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities was not receiving the attention it warranted. All Arab 
States had acceded to the NPT, while Israel remained outside the NPT regime despite the calls made 
by the international community, particularly in United Nations Security Council resolution 487 (1981). 
It was surprising that the worldÂs major Powers were not inquiring about the fate of that resolution, 
particularly as in September 2008 the United Nations General Assembly had again stressed the need 
for Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
128. In all relevant international fora, the international community had been calling for 
universalization of the NPT, but Israel had been using flimsy pretexts to justify its refusal to accede to 
the NPT, thereby undermining the efforts being made to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East. His delegation would like to see the General Conference adopting a resolution in which 
the finger was pointed at the disregard for international law displayed by Israel thanks to the protection 
from accountability afforded by the United States of America. However, the draft resolution now 
before the General Conference was very mild Â for example, in order to address the concerns of a 
number of States, the sponsors had used the title ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ instead of ÂIsrael nuclear 
capabilities and threatÂ. 
129. The most important step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East would be for Israel to show full transparency by acceding to the NPT and submitting all its 
nuclear facilities unconditionally to Agency verification, thereby demonstrating to the international 
community that it sought a just and comprehensive peace in the region. In his view, the statements 
made by the representatives of Israel in the General Conference amounted to no more than a 

GC(52)/OR.10

October 
2008, 
Page 
14 


smokescreen. Member States, particularly those which bore a special responsibility under the NPT, 
should consider the facts of the matter fairly and adopt a balanced policy without double standards. 

130. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2 related to 
matters within the AgencyÂs verification mandate and was in line with international commitments 
arising out of relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and with decisions of the 
1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences. The General Conference was a very appropriate forum for 
discussing the subject of Israeli nuclear capabilities, which was directly relevant to the security of the 
Middle East. 
131. Algeria, which had participated in the launching of the Union for the Mediterranean and 
believed in its aims, considered the situation in the Middle East to be imbalanced owing to the refusal 
of Israel to accede to the NPT and submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency verification. With the next 
NPT Review Conference set to take place in 2010, it was important to work now towards 
universalizing the NPT by, in particular, persuading Israel to change its policy. 
132. The support of Algeria for the draft resolution was based on its commitment to the principles of 
non-proliferation and to strengthening the role of the Agency with respect to a country which 
possessed nuclear weapons, as admitted by its own Prime Minister. 
133. Mr AL-SAUD (Saudi Arabia) said that his country attached great importance to universalization 
of the NPT and that Israel was the only State in the Middle East which had not acceded to that treaty. 
Adoption of the draft resolution by the General Conference, particularly with the support of those 
Member States which had a special responsibility for ensuring international peace and security, would 
help greatly in addressing a situation which posed a serious threat to peace, stability and security both 
in the Middle East and in the world at large. 
134. Mr AL-DOBHANY (Yemen) said that IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities were a source of concern for 
all other countries in the Middle East, particularly since Israel, which had refused to accede to the NPT 
and submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, was continuing to expand its nuclear arsenal 
without any form of accountability. 
135. The least that those other countries could expect was that the subject of IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities be addressed by the General Conference and a draft resolution relating to that subject be 
considered. 
136. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East presupposed the 
application of Agency safeguards throughout the region without double standards. That presupposed 
the accession of Israel to the NPT and the acceptance by Israel of the application of Agency 
safeguards to all its nuclear facilities. 
137. Mr AYOUB (Iraq) said that the situation in the Middle East was imbalanced because Israel had 
an advanced military nuclear programme and ignored international resolutions calling upon it to 
accede to the NPT and submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. The General Conference 
was an ideal international forum for consideration of the question of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities, and 
Arab States for many years had been working for the adoption of a General Conference resolution on 
that question. 
138. Iraq regretted that a group of States was endeavouring to prevent the adoption of such a 
resolution, even though the States in question attached great importance to non-proliferation Â except 
in the case of Israel. Such a double standard did not further the cause of regional Â or international Â 
peace and security. Those States should act in line with the principles which they advocated and not 
prevent the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2 from being adopted.

139. Mr AL-JASEM (Kuwait) said that all States in the Middle East except Israel had acceded to the 
NPT and accepted comprehensive Agency safeguards and that the international community should 
increase its efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Israeli nuclear issue. Success in those 
efforts would be an important step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East, and adoption of the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2 would be an important step 
towards universalization of the NPT. 
140. Mr BEN AYED (Tunisia) said that his country, which was supporting all efforts of the 
international community to limit nuclear proliferation, would like to see a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
established in the Middle East with a minimum of delay, as an important confidence-building step. 
141. Tunisia, which considered that the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was 
relevant to the AgencyÂs mandate, hoped that the General Conference would help to ensure that Israel 
acceded to the NPT and submitted all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. 
142. Mr TOUKAN (Jordan) said that the existence of nuclear weapons presented a serious threat to 
peace and security, particularly in the Middle East. Accordingly, it was important that Israel accede to 
the NPT. With IsraelÂs accession to the NPT, other States in the region could invest in development 
and not in an arms race that would only heighten regional tensions. 
143. Ms GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE (Canada) said that her delegation regretted that fact that, at the 
current General Conference session, the traditional procedure of addressing issues of verification in 
the Middle East as a package had again been abandoned. 
144. Canada had not opposed the holding of a debate under the agenda item ÂIsraeli nuclear 
capabilitiesÂ, but now that the sponsors of the draft resolution in document GC (52)/L.2 and other 
States had had an opportunity to express their views, her delegation wished to move the adjournment 
of the debate under Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure, with no action to be taken on the draft 
resolution, which, in the view of her delegation, was very divisive. 
145. Her delegation hoped that Member States would revert to a consensual approach at future 
sessions of the General Conference, so as to avoid politicizing a forum which should remain a 
technical one. 
146. The PRESIDENT noted that under Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure two delegates were 
permitted to speak in favour of and two delegates against a motion before it was put to the vote. 
147. Ms GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE (Canada) requested that a roll-call vote be held on the motion. 
148. Ms GOICOCHEA ESTENOZ (Cuba), speaking against the motion, said that her delegation 
rejected the suggestion that the draft resolution represented an effort to politicize the General 
Conference Â a forum in which double standards were frequently applied. 
149. Mr DENIAU (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union and in favour of the motion, 
said that a useful debate had taken place and expressed the hope that, at the next General Conference 
session, the subject of the debate would be addressed under the item entitled ÂApplication of IAEA 
safeguards in the Middle EastÂ. 
150. At its present session, the General Conference had adopted a resolution under that item in which 
it called upon all States in the Middle East to accede to the NPT, but the draft resolution now under 
consideration went beyond that and could therefore not be supported by the European Union. 
151. The European Union regretted the fact that consensus could not be achieved, despite the efforts 
of the President, and believed that the General Conference should concentrate on the AgencyÂs 
essential technical functions and avoid divisive initiatives.

152. Mr MENESI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), speaking against the motion, said that Israel continued 
to possess nuclear weapon capabilities and was disregarding the will of the international community, a 
matter of great concern which had been raised in many other international forums. To oppose further 
discussion of the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2 was to deny States the right to express their 
views on proliferation in the Middle East, which was a volatile region in danger of being engulfed by 
an arms race. To take no action in the matter would be, once more, to apply double standards and 
would be inconsistent with the aims of the Agency. 
153. Mr GALANXHI (Albania), speaking in favour of the motion, endorsed the statement just made 
by the representative of France on behalf of the European Union. 
154. Albania, which considered that a well thought-out solution, free of emotions of the moment, 
was needed in order to achieve long-term stability and peace in the Middle East, was committed to 
making its modest contribution to the achievement of that goal. It believed that the General 
Conference was the right forum for exchanging opinions with a view to solving existing problems, not 
for nourishing new ones. 
155. The PRESIDENT invited the General Conference to proceed to a roll-call vote on the motion to 
adjourn the debate under Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure, as requested by the delegate of Canada. 
156. Slovakia, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
157. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, 
Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Republic of 
Korea, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, 
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States 
of America. 
Against: Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, China, 
Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Ghana, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, 
Jordan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, 
Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Namibia, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, 
Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian 
Arab Republic, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, 
Vietnam, Yemen, Zimbabwe. 
Abstaining: Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russian Federation, Turkey, Uruguay, 
Zambia. 
158. The motion was adopted by 46 votes to 43, with 7 abstentions. 
159. Mr SKOKNIC (Chile) said that his country's vote against the motion should be understood as a 

vote on procedure, not on the substance of the draft resolution in document GC(52)/L.2. 

160. Mr KUMAR (India) said that his country, along with the other NAM members, had supported 
inscription of the item under consideration in the agenda of the General Conference in view of its 
importance, even though the explanatory memorandum submitted by the countries requesting its 
inscription had referred to matters extraneous to the Agency. India favoured all efforts aimed at 

GC(52)/OR.10

October

17 


reviving the traditional consensus on the issue now before the Conference, but, unfortunately, the 
efforts to that end had so far not met with success. 

161. India had voted for the motion because certain aspects of the draft resolution lay well outside 
the purview of the Agency's Statute. 
162. Mr BERDENNIKOV (Russian Federation) said his delegation would have been ready to 
support the draft resolution had it been put to the vote since, on the whole, it corresponded to Russia's 
consistent position with regard to promoting universalization of the NPT, the application of 
comprehensive safeguards and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. At the same time, Russia was in favour of reaching a consensus on the issue now before 
the Conference and avoiding further politicization of the discussion of it within the Agency. For that 
reason, his delegation had abstained in the vote on the motion. 
163. Mr SERRA (Spain) said that his country remained unequivocally committed to universalization 
of the NPT and to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, as witnessed by 
its consistent position regarding those issues in the United Nations General Assembly. It was also 
committed to the application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East and the 
pursuit of negotiations aimed at establishing a just and lasting peace in the region. The fact that the 
PresidentÂs efforts to bring about a consensus had not borne fruit had only strengthened SpainÂs 
resolve to vote in favour of the motion. 
164. Spain appealed to all interested parties to work towards the achievement in 2009 of a consensus 
in the General Conference as had been customary up until 2005. 
165. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), on a point of order, asked for clarification regarding the inclusion of 
item 21 in the agenda for the next General Conference session. 
166. The PRESIDENT, having consulted the legal adviser, said that the present situation was 
different from the situation at previous General Conference sessions, where a Âpackage solutionÂ had 
been adopted; namely, the draft resolution had been withdrawn and there had been a Presidential 
statement, including a request by several Member States for inclusion of the item in the provisional 
agenda for the following General Conference session. Now, the debate on the item under discussion 
had simply been adjourned. Any Member State had the right to propose the item, like any other, for 
inclusion in the agenda for the 2009 General Conference session. 
24. 
Report 
on

to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2009 
167. The PRESIDENT said that document GC(52)/22/Rev.4 contained details of the pledges and 
contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2009 which governments had made to the 
Director General by 10:30 p.m. on 3 October 2008. By that time, Member States had pledged a total of 
US $14 291 828, or 16.91% of the target for 2009. That was 46% higher than the percentage of 
pledges received by the corresponding time in the preceding year. Since that document had been sent 
for printing, further Member States had communicated pledges to the Director General: China had 
pledged $2 187 050 and Kuwait had pledged $149 600. That brought the total amount pledged to 
$16 628 478/469, or 19.56% of the 2009 Technical Cooperation Fund target.

168. He urged all delegations which had not yet down so to make their 2009 pledges and to pay their 
contributions in full at the earliest opportunity in order that the Secretariat might submit to the 
Technical Assistance and Cooperation Committee in November a proposed 2010 technical 
cooperation programme based on the level of pledges received, and thereafter implement the approved 
programme without hindrance or uncertainty.

Â 
Oral 
report 
by 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
169. Mr NIEWODNICZANSKI, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented the outcome 
of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 14, 15 and 18. 
170. Under item 14, ÂNuclear security Â measures to protect against nuclear terrorismÂ, the 
Committee was unable to recommend to the Conference the draft resolution in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.6/Rev.1, entitled "Nuclear security Â measures to protect against nuclear 
terrorism". 
171. Under item 15, ÂStrengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activitiesÂ, the Committee 
was unable to recommend to the Conference the draft resolution in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.10/Rev.2, entitled ÂStrengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activitiesÂ. 
172. During the CommitteeÂs consideration of the draft resolution in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.12, 
entitled ÂStrengthening of technical assistance to least developed countries in the peaceful applications 
of nuclear energyÂ, an understanding that the matter would be considered by the Conference at its 
fifty-third regular session had been reached. 
173. Under item 18, ÂStrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Additional ProtocolÂ, the Committee was unable to recommend 
to the Conference the draft resolution in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.2, entitled ÂStrengthening 
the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the Model 
Additional ProtocolÂ. 
174. He was grateful to all members of the Committee of the Whole for the cooperative spirit in 
which the CommitteeÂs deliberations had taken place. He was particularly grateful to the CommitteeÂs 
two Vice-Chairmen, Mr Steinmann, the delegate of Switzerland, and Mr Monawar, the delegate of 
Afghanistan, and to Mr Kessler, of the delegation of Switzerland, who had conducted consultations on 
a very important agenda item. 
175. Finally, he said that the CommitteeÂs deliberations had shown the extent to which the Agency 
had lately become politicized. 
Nuclear 
security 
Â 
measures 
to 
protect 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
(agenda item 14) 

176. Mr DENIAU (France) said that the objective of the draft resolution in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.6/Rev.1 was to provide for a global approach to nuclear security and measures to 
protect against nuclear terrorism. It reflected the efforts made by the international community since the 
previous General Conference session to promote the security of nuclear facilities and materials in the 
face of the major threat to international security represented by nuclear and radiological terrorism. It 

GC(52)/OR.10

19 


highlighted the calibre of the AgencyÂs work with regard to nuclear security and protection against 
nuclear terrorism and the importance of the forthcoming Nuclear Security Plan for 2010Â2013. 

177. The draft, elaborated by the European Union and sponsored by 58 Agency Member States, had 
been the subject of intensive consultations during the past few days, and only two countries had 
opposed consensus on it. It was for that reason that he requested that the text be considered by the 
Conference in plenary. 
178. Mr FAWZY requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution. 
179. He said that, unfortunately, his delegation, which had received the draft resolution only just 
before it was introduced, had noted that it included controversial wording on which Egypt had already 
expressed its views at the previous General Conference session. The draft resolution as currently 
formulated did not go far enough in dealing with the threats posed by the existence of unsafeguarded 
nuclear materials and facilities, which undermined the effectiveness of international cooperation in the 
area of nuclear security and combating nuclear terrorism. It was unfortunate that a balance had not 
been preserved on an issue of such crucial importance as nuclear security despite the fact that his 
delegation had submitted constructive proposals for additional language to make the draft text more 
balanced. The application of a double standard in dealing with the issue and attempts by some 
countries to impose their views on others rather than seeking consensus had become characteristic of 
the AgencyÂs work, threatening the efficiency of that work. He had called for a roll-call vote in order 
to draw attention to the serious nature of the situation, which must be addressed without delay. 
180. The PRESIDENT invited the General Conference to vote on the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(52)/COM.5/L.6/Rev.1. 
181. Madagascar, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. In the 
absence of a representative of Madagascar, the voting started with Malaysia. 
182. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 
Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, 
Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Republic of Korea, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, 
Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, 
Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Thailand, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 
United States of America, Uruguay, Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 
Vietnam, Zambia, Zimbabwe. 

Abstaining: 
Algeria, Egypt, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Qatar, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Yemen. 

183. There were 77 votes in favour and none against, with 10 abstentions. The draft resolution was 
adopted.

Strengthening 
of 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
(agenda item 15) 

184. Mr SHAHBAZ (Pakistan), speaking on behalf the Group of 77 and China, said, with reference 
to the draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.10/Rev.2, that technical cooperation 
contributed to the well-being of peoples, especially in developing countries, and gave them a sense of 
ownership of development activities. 
185. Unfortunately, it had not been possible to reach agreement on the draft resolution in the 
Committee of the Whole, but he still felt that it provided a good basis for a consensus on an important 
statutory function of the Agency. 
186. Mr SCHULTE (United States of America), Ms GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE (Canada) and 
Mr SMITH (United Kingdom) said that they would join a consensus on the draft resolution. 
187. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(52)/COM.5/L.10/Rev.2 without a vote. 
188. It was so decided. 
Strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
application 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
(agenda item 18) 

189. Mr BOECK (Austria) said that the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.2, originally submitted by the Member States of the Agency belonging to the 
European Union, reflected efforts since the previous General Conference session to promote the 
implementation of safeguards and encourage Member States to fulfil their safeguards obligations. It 
was the product of many hours of informal negotiations and represented, in his opinion, the best 
possible compromise. 
190. Unfortunately, the Committee of the Whole had been unable to reach a consensus on it, but he 
hoped that the General Conference would adopt it by consensus now. 
191. Mr KUMAR (India) said that his delegation would like to join a consensus on the draft 
resolution. In order to join a consensus, however, it would require a minor amendment to paragraph 3 
Â namely, the addition of the word ÂconcernedÂ, so that the paragraph would read Â... urges all 
concerned States which have yet to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreements to do so as 
soon as possibleÂ. The present version of the paragraph implied that every State had concluded a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement which it could bring into force if it wished, which was not the 
case. The amendment would remove the incorrect implication, and his delegation hoped that it would 
receive the support of all Member States present. 
192. If the amendment was not accepted, his delegation would request a roll-call vote on 
paragraph 3. 
193. Mr SHAHBAZ (Pakistan) expressed support for the amendment proposed by the representative 
of India. 
194. Mr FAWZY (Egypt), having requested a roll-call vote on the draft resolution as a whole, said 
that during the informal negotiations his delegation had proposed amendments relating to the need to 
implement safeguards agreements in a fair and balanced manner and to the role of a 
nuclear-free-weapon zone in the Middle East in supporting the safeguards regime. However, its 
proposals had not been accepted or even properly discussed.

195. The countries that supported the draft resolution were seeking to extend verification beyond the 
limits laid down in the AgencyÂs Statute and establish the Model Additional Protocol as the main basis 
for verification of a countryÂs nuclear activities. However, the draft did not address current cases of 
nuclear proliferation, did not propose practical measures to deal with countries that were not willing to 
make a clear safeguards commitment and did not emphasize the need to promote nuclear disarmament, 
which was the ultimate aim of the NPT. His country and other Arab countries could not accept 
attempts to strengthen a safeguards regime that was not being applied to countries not party to the 
NPT without any safeguards agreement in force. 
196. His country respected its safeguards commitments and was collaborating with the Agency in 
promoting international peace and security. However, the fact that Israel was still outside the 
safeguards regime was a threat to the national security of Egypt and other countries and created an 
imbalance that was the real source of all the verification problems encountered by the safeguards 
regime. That regime could not be strengthened merely by increasing the commitments required of 
States which were already committed to safeguards: the only solution was to resolve the imbalance 
between States which were not committed and those which were. 
197. His delegation would abstain in the vote on the draft resolution. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
11 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
11.05 
p.m. 
198. The PRESIDENT asked whether delegations were prepared to accept the amendment to 

paragraph 3 proposed by the representative of India. 

199. Mr FAWZY (Egypt) said that his delegation could not accept the proposed amendment, which it 
did not consider to be a minor one. 
200. Mr KUMAR (India) said that the purpose of the proposed amendment was merely to rectify an 
incorrect statement of fact. 
201. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia), Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), Mr TOUKAN 
(Jordan), Mr ZNIBER (Morocco) and Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that they could not accept the 
amendment proposed by the representative of India. 
202. Mr KUMAR (India) asked for a vote on the proposed amendment to paragraph 3. 
203. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) asked for a roll-call vote. 
204. Armenia, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
205. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 
India, Pakistan. 

Against: 
Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, Cuba, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Germany, 
Ghana, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Ireland, 
Italy, Japan, Jordan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libyan Arab

Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, 
Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, 
Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Vietnam, Yemen.

Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, United States of America, 
Zambia. 
206. There were 2 votes in favour and 65 against, with 23 abstentions. The amendment to 

paragraph 3 was rejected. 

207. Mr KUMAR (India) requested a roll-call vote on paragraph 3 of the draft resolution 
208. Mr RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs), following a request for clarification 
from Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia), said that, if any delegations objected to the request for a separate 
vote on paragraph 3, it would be necessary to take a vote on the request for division of the proposal in 
accordance with Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure. 
209. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia), supported by Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) and 
Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), requested a vote on IndiaÂs motion for a separate vote on 
paragraph 3. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
11.35 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
11.40 
p.m. 


210. The PRESIDENT, recalling the request made by the delegate of Malaysia for a vote on IndiaÂs 
motion for a separate vote on paragraph 3 of the draft resolution in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.2, put that motion to a vote by show of hands. 
211. There were 50 votes in favour of holding a separate vote on paragraph 3 and 33 against, with 
6 abstentions. 
212. The PRESIDENT then put paragraph 3 of the draft resolution to a separate vote by show of 
hands. 
213. There were 86 votes in favour of paragraph 3 and 2 against, with 2 abstentions. The paragraph 
was adopted. 
214. Mr SHAHBAZ (Pakistan), speaking in explanation of vote, said that Pakistan supported all 
activities of the Agency in every area of Agency responsibility, in accordance with the provisions of 
the Statute. Its support for the AgencyÂs safeguards manifested itself in the fulfilment of all its 
safeguard obligations and in its cooperation with the Agency in that regard. The commitment of 
Pakistan to the AgencyÂs safeguards was anchored in its firm belief that the role of those safeguards 
was to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy without discrimination based 
on political or strategic considerations. 
215. His delegation had been constrained to vote against operative paragraph 3 and in favour of the 
amendment thereto proposed by the delegation of India. It had voted in that way owing to the failure 
of the sponsors of the draft resolution to make paragraph 3 consistent with the letter and spirit of the 
Statute, which took into account the differentiated nature of the safeguards obligations of Member 
States and did not prescribe a particular safeguards model as the only standard for Agency verification. 
In calling for universalization of a particular safeguards model, adherence to which was not a legal 
obligation of all Member States, the draft resolution directly contradicted the practice and actions of 
the Board of Governors, which had recently approved a new safeguards model suited to the specifics 
of a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement.

216. His delegationÂs vote was a reflection of PakistanÂs commitment to upholding the AgencyÂs 
Statute in every respect. Pakistan would continue to support the AgencyÂs verification activities in a 
manner consistent with the framework provided for in the Statute. 
217. Mr SCHULTE (United States of America), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his 
delegation had abstained because the proposed amendment to paragraph 3 was ambiguous, and there 
had been insufficient time to seek instructions. The policy of the United States of America regarding 
the matter in question remained unchanged. 
218. Mr KUMAR (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that, as a founding member of the 
Agency, India had consistently supported all its activities falling within the framework of the Statute. 
It attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards activities in particular and had contributed to 
improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system Â inter alia through participation 
in the recent past in the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of 
the IAEA Statute. 
219. India would accordingly have much preferred that the draft resolution in document 
GC(52)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.2 be adopted by consensus, and in the Committee of the Whole his 
delegation had striven hard to make that possible. He regretted that his delegationÂs concerns had not 
been accommodated. Until 2000, resolutions on safeguards issues had been adopted by consensus. 
In 2001, however, there had been added an operative paragraph urging all States to bring into force 
comprehensive safeguards agreements, the specifics of different States and the voluntary nature of 
safeguards agreements being overlooked. The consensus had thus been broken. 
220. It was well known that safeguards agreements, whether comprehensive or not, stemmed from a 
StateÂs sovereign decision. Paragraph 3 of the draft resolution under consideration did not reflect that 
basic feature of safeguards. His delegation had therefore had no option but to vote against paragraph 3. 
221. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had voted 
against the holding of a separate vote on paragraph 3 on procedural grounds. Had an amendment to 
paragraph 3 not been proposed, it would have agreed that a separate vote be taken. 
222. The PRESIDENT, recalling the request for a roll-call vote made by the delegate of Egypt, put 
the draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.2/Rev.2 to the vote. 
223. 
first. 
The Republic of Moldova, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote 
224. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, 
Germany, Ghana, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
Kazakhstan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, 
Luxembourg, Malaysia, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova,

Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom,

Zambia. 

225. There were 71 votes in favour and none against, with 19 abstentions. The draft resolution was 
adopted. 
226. Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), speaking in explanation of vote, said that the draft 
resolution had totally ignored serious security concerns regarding sensitive nuclear materials not 
subject to safeguards in non-parties to the NPT and in the nuclear-weapon States. 
227. Also, serious concerns with regard to the non-mentioning of nuclear disarmament in the draft 
resolution had been expressed by his delegation during the informal negotiations on the draft 
resolution. They had been shared by many like-minded delegations but unfortunately not reflected in 
the draft resolution. Discriminating between States by categorizing them as non-nuclear-weapon States 
parties to the NPT, non-parties to the NPT and nuclear-weapon States hampered efforts to strengthen 
the safeguards system. 
228. In addition, his delegation had expressed serious concerns about safeguards implementation 
going beyond legal obligations, but those concerns had also not been reflected in the draft resolution. 
229. His delegation had had similar concerns about the draft resolution on nuclear security 
(contained in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.6/Rev.1) and, in the informal discussions on it, had 
expressed its dissatisfaction with provisions in the text that went beyond the AgencyÂs statutory 
mandate and also with the failure of the text to cover all nuclear facilities and materials not subject to 
Agency safeguards, since such facilities and materials were highly sensitive from the standpoint not 
only of nuclear safety but also of nuclear security. 
230. Mr SHAHBAZ (Pakistan), speaking in explanation of vote, recalled that in 2007 his country 
had voted in favour of adoption of the corresponding resolution (GC(51)/1/RES/15) notwithstanding 
its objection to one of the operative paragraphs. In doing so, it had hoped that in 2008 the sponsors of 
the draft resolution on the safeguards system would endeavour to produce a text that addressed the 
concerns of all Member States. Regrettably, the text just voted on once again failed to reflect the 
common interests of the AgencyÂs membership, and that was a symptom of an unhealthy trend that 
needed to be reversed. 
231. Pakistan would like to see all Member States, and particularly the traditional sponsors of the 
draft resolutions on the safeguards system, displaying in future consultations the flexibility and 
openness necessary for the production of a consensus text. Achieving consensus should not be 
difficult. It required only the recognition by all Member States of the differentiated nature of StatesÂ 
safeguards obligations, as provided for in the AgencyÂs Statute. 
232. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), speaking in explanation of vote, said that her delegation had 
abstained because of the manner in which the draft resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities, submitted 
by the Arab Group, had been handled. 
233. Preventing the General Conference from taking action on that draft resolution ran counter to the 
General ConferenceÂs democratic traditions. 
234. As a party to the NPT and related instruments, Algeria, which had provided the Chairperson of 
the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute, 
remained deeply committed to the safeguards system of the Agency. In its view, however, the system 

GC(52)/OR.10

2008, 
Page 
25 


should be applied without discrimination, particularly in the Middle East, where there was a country 
with significant nuclear activities that was not a party to the NPT. 

235. Mr AL-SAUD (Saudi Arabia), speaking in explanation of vote, said that in the implementation 
of safeguards no exceptions should be made Â the same standards should be applied to all States. It 
was essential that efforts to universalize the NPT and application of the AgencyÂs safeguards system 
continue. 
236. Mr NSEMUKILA (Zambia) said that he had abstained from voting because he had not received 
instructions from his Government. 
Â 
Closing 
of 
the 
session 
237. The PRESIDENT said that the current session of the General Conference had been well 
attended by high-level representatives of Member States, including 32 ministers. During the general 
debate, 113 speakers had taken the floor. 
238. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) expressed appreciation for the efforts of the President during the 
current session of the General Conference. The President had shown objectivity and neutrality in his 
focus on reaching consensus decisions on all issues before the Conference, and his efforts had 
contributed greatly to the success of its work. The Conference had demonstrated its awareness of the 
fact that the Agency was a precious gift, to be cherished and allowed to move forward in fulfilment of 
its important objectives. All Member States should cooperate in the spirit that had characterized the 
ConferenceÂs work in the interests of the fulfilment of those objectives. 
239. The PRESIDENT said that he was grateful for the kind words addressed to him on behalf of the 
Conference. It had been an honour and privilege for him and his country that he had been elected to 
serve as President of the General Conference at its fifty-second session. 
240. He thanked all delegates for their cooperation, which had allowed the problems encountered 
during the conduct of business to be dealt with. 
241. On behalf of the Conference, he thanked the Austrian authorities and the City of Vienna for 
their hospitality during the past week. He also thanked the Director General and his staff for their 
valuable support. 
242. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, and in 
commemoration of the International Day of Peace celebrated earlier that week, he invited the 
Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All 
present

Â 
Opening 
of 
the 
session 
1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the 52nd regular session of the General 
Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he invited 
delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All 
present 
rose 
and 
stood 
in 
silence 
for 
one 
minute. 


3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that in 2007 he had had the honour to be entrusted by the 
General Conference with the task of presiding over its 51st regular session. Like his predecessors, he 
had done his best to bring about the highest level of agreement on the technical and political questions 
that had long faced the Agency. Thanks to the support of all delegations, the General Conference had 
adopted the best possible resolutions, but further efforts were needed worldwide in acting upon them, 
in order to enhance the AgencyÂs role in preserving global peace. 
4. It could hardly be claimed that the General Conference was in a position to resolve regional and 
international issues to which the United Nations and other international bodies had been unable to find 
just solutions. That did not, however, diminish the responsibility of the General Conference to take the 
initiative and, applying the AgencyÂs rules and regulations in a fair and balanced manner, to address 
the issues of direct concern to the Agency Â in particular, halting the nuclear arms race and moving 
towards universalization of the NPT without delay. 
5. Since the end of the Second World War, the Middle East had experienced recurrent wars and 
conflicts that had caused its peoples great destruction and misery. There was now an acute need for it 
to be declared a zone free of weapons of mass destruction. A brave and unambiguous stance needed to 
be taken against any exception to the adherence of all countries in the region to the NPT. There was 
also an acute need to provide technical incentives for developing the resources of the countries in the 
region with regard to the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. 
6. During the past year there had been an increase in the number of developing countries that had 
announced their desire to launch, in collaboration with advanced countries, national programmes for 
the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. Their aims were to use nuclear energy in electricity 
generation, seawater desalination, industry, medicine, agriculture and environmental protection. That 
right could not be denied to any country in the world provided it was exercised in a transparent manner 
and subject to the safeguards of the Agency and to its regulations concerning nuclear safety and 
security. The Agency was playing a leading role in striking what was a delicate balance, and no 
country could have an interest in rejecting or failing to comply with its requirements. Delegations 
would no doubt pay close attention to that important issue. 
7. He hoped that, at its current session, the Conference would make breakthroughs towards solving 
the problems that had confronted the Agency for more than two decades. Dealing with matters fairly 
was the basic means of achieving sustainable peace in the world. That meant mobilizing human and 
material resources for development purposes rather than holding them hostage to tensions and wasting 
them on endless crises. Allocating more resources to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes 
would provide developing countries with essential support, something that deserved everyoneÂs 
continued commitment.

8. On behalf of Lebanon and the MESA Group, he thanked the Director General for his 
exceptional efforts in confronting the challenges that faced the Agency and for the role he was playing 
with the highest professionalism and impartiality. 
9. 
He wished the incoming President every success. 
1. 
Election 
of 
officers 
and 
appointment 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
10. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President of the 
Conference. 
11. Mr COGAN (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the Western Europe Group, proposed Mr Ghisi 
(Italy). 
12. 
Mr Ghisi (Italy) was elected President by acclamation. 
13. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr Ghisi on his election and wished him every 
success in his task. 
Mr 
Ghisi 
(Italy) 
took 
the 
Chair. 


14. The PRESIDENT said that his being elected President of the General Conference for its 52nd 
regular session as a great honour both for him and for Italy. He was grateful to the Conference for the 
confidence placed in him and to the Western Europe Group for nominating him. 
15. He expressed the General ConferenceÂs gratitude to the Temporary President, Mr Hamze of 
Lebanon, for the commitment and wisdom demonstrated by him as President of the Conference during 
its 51st session. 
16. With the full cooperation of all delegations and the Secretariat, on which he was sure that he 
could count, he would endeavour to bring the current session of the General Conference to a 
successful conclusion. He would pursue to the very end the intensive consultations with Member 
States that he had started informally before the beginning of the session. Also, he would spare no 
effort in fostering dialogue among delegations and regional groups so that the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ 
prevailed and the objectives of the General Conference were achieved in full. 
17. He was confident that all would bear in mind the need to progress further along the ÂAtoms for 
PeaceÂ path on which the Agency had embarked 51 years earlier. At its current session, the General 
Conference would have the opportunity to strengthen the AgencyÂs three pillars Â safety and security, 
science and technology, and safeguards and verification. Also, it would have to review what the 
Agency was doing to assist Member States with the application of peaceful nuclear technologies for 
economic and social development while ensuring that those technologies were used in a safe and 
secure manner. 
18. The international community was engaged in a tremendous effort to achieve the Millennium 
Development Goals Â the only way to ensure a decent future for humanity. Within that context, 
development and peace were the two faces of the coin. The AgencyÂs role was crucial for international 
peace and security and for addressing poverty, hunger and disease in the developing world through the

use of nuclear energy. The importance of that role had not diminished; on the contrary, it had 
increased, with new challenges, stresses and risks constantly appearing. 

19. In the general debate, the Conference would hear how many States Â including developed 
countries like Italy Â had decided to count more and more on nuclear energy for their development; 
the ever-increasing costs of fossil fuels, the impending threat of climate change and the worsening of 
the food security situation were all factors making for a likely Ânuclear renaissanceÂ. The expanded use 
of nuclear technologies had immense potential for meeting important development needs, but it also 
posed complex and wide-ranging safety and security challenges that needed to be addressed 
effectively. A global resurgence of nuclear power depended on the safe and secure use of nuclear 
technologies, with the application of rigorous nuclear safety and security standards worldwide. 
20. As the Director General had said, the Agency would clearly be needed more and more in the 
coming decades. Member States had been invited to discuss the future role of the Agency in a 
scientific forum that would be taking place in parallel with the current General Conference session, as 
a follow-up to the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons appointed by the Director General. In 
wishing that important forum every success, he hoped that an equally important forum, on the 
establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East, requested by the General Conference in 2000, would be 
held at the latest alongside the 2009 session of the General Conference. 
21. The 14 scientific side-events and the numerous technical cooperation meetings due to take place 
during the current week at the Austria Center were an impressive indication of the vitality of the 
Agency and the organizationÂs usefulness not only for policymakers but also for scientists, the 
business community and civil society worldwide. 
22. Member States were ÂshareholdersÂ in the Agency Â a solid, efficient and prestigious company 
that, under the wise and courageous management of its Director General, had been awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 2005. As ÂshareholdersÂ, they had received their dividends Â a share of that prize. They 
should be proud of that and act accordingly, in the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ. 
23. Recalling that Thursday, 2 October was an official Agency holiday, due to Eid al-Fitr, he said 
that the proceedings of the Conference would be suspended on Wednesday, 1 October and resumed on 
Friday, 3 October if so decided by the Conference pursuant to Rule 8 of its Rules of Procedure 
24. It was so agreed. 
25. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of its Rules of Procedure, the 
Conference had to elect eight Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, and five 
additional members of the General Committee Â resulting in a General Committee of 15 members. 
26. He proposed that the delegates of Brazil, Canada, Iceland, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Kenya, Mongolia and the Russian Federation be elected as Vice-Presidents; that 
Mr Niewodniczanski (Poland) be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole; and that the 
delegates of Croatia, Morocco, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States of America and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela be elected as additional members of the General Committee. 
27. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
28. The PRESIDENT further proposed that the General Conference deal with items 2, 3, 4 and 
6 and take up item 7 Â in that order Â pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation 
on the provisional agenda. 
29. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted.

Applications 
for 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
(GC(52)/7, 
18 
and 
19) 


30. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(52)/7, GC(52)/18 and GC(52)/19 containing 
applications for membership made by the Sultanate of Oman, the Kingdom of Lesotho and the 
Independent State of Papua New Guinea respectively. The three applications had been endorsed by the 
Board of Governors, which had also submitted three draft resolutions for adoption by the General 
Conference. 
31. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt the three draft resolutions. 
32. It was so decided. 
3. 
Message 
from 
the 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
33. Mr DUARTE (United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs) read out the 
following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my greetings to the fifty-second session of the General Conference of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 

ÂAs the world responds to the challenges associated with the expansion of nuclear energy and 
technologies for its peaceful use, the Agency continues its diverse efforts to help States develop 
effective nuclear infrastructures, promote nuclear safety and security and implement safeguards 
at nuclear facilities around the world. Future progress in nuclear disarmament may also bring 
opportunities for the Agency in the area of verification, transparency and irreversibility. 

ÂThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the AgencyÂs nuclear safety 
standards, which have well served the interests of humanity and the environment. I call upon 
States that have not yet done so to adhere to them as soon as possible. 

ÂThe Agency continues to be engaged with the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea and 
Iran. Its contributions in both of these areas stand to benefit the global nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. 

ÂFinally, the Agency is also looking constructively towards its future. The recent report of the 
Commission of Eminent Persons on the Future of the Agency underlined the need to 
reinvigorate the global nuclear order, and to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation while 
expanding the contribution of nuclear technologies to human welfare. 

ÂI am strongly committed to working in partnership with the Agency, Member States and the 
international community to promote the benefits of peaceful nuclear energy and pursue further 
progress in nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Please accept my best wishes for a 
successful conference.Â

Statement 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
34. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that he was proud of the excellent work done by his 
colleagues during the past 12 months, but all was not well with the Agency. As he had told the Board 
of Governors in June, there was a disconnect between what Member States were asking the Secretariat 
to do and the legal authority and resources available to it. He would elaborate on that issue after 
presenting a general overview of the work done by the Agency since the 2007 session of the General 
Conference. 
35. The surge in global food prices had pushed millions of people deeper into poverty and hunger. 
A World Bank report published in August had shown that there were more poor people in the world 
than previously thought. Some 1.4 billion people in the developing world lived on less than 
US $1.25 a day. The number of poor people in sub-Saharan Africa had nearly doubled since 1981, to 
around 380 million. 
36. That made the work being done by the Joint Division Â of FAO and the Agency Â even more 
important. One aspect of its work was the use of nuclear techniques to make food crops more resistant 
to disease, to boost crop yields and to combat pests and animal diseases. Regrettably, FAO had taken 
steps towards ending its involvement in the Joint Division, which would be unfortunate. The FAO 
Conference might take a decision in November. The Secretariat was hoping for a decision that would 
ensure the continuation of the valuable cooperation between FAO and the Agency. 
37. Cancer claimed millions of lives every year, but the work being done within the framework of 
PACT had helped to ensure that cancer patients in developing countries had access to radiation 
treatment. The need was vast, and PACT was only scratching the surface, but, for the individual 
cancer patients who benefited, the limited assistance provided could mean the difference between life 
and death. 
38. The benefits of nuclear applications were potentially huge in relation to the costs, and he hoped 
that the Agency would be able to further increase its efforts in that field in the decades to come. 
39. There were currently 439 nuclear power reactors operating in 30 countries, and the number 
under construction stood at 36. The AgencyÂs updated projections continued to show a significant 
increase in the use of nuclear power by 2030, with capacity possibly doubling. 
40. Nuclear power had obvious attractions for developing as well as developed countries. 
Developing countries needed access to electricity in order to help lift their peoples out of poverty, and 
many were turning to the Agency for guidance on how to proceed. They were concerned about the 
fluctuating prices of oil and other fossil fuels and about uncertainty of supply, and also about climate 
change. 
41. Every country had the right to introduce nuclear power, but also the responsibility to do it right. 
During the past two years, some 50 Member States had expressed an interest in considering the 
possible introduction of nuclear power and had asked for Agency support. Twelve countries were 
actively preparing to introduce nuclear power. The demand for Agency assistance was increasing. It 
was particularly strong among developing countries seeking impartial advice as regards their options 
and the choice of optimum energy mix. Naturally, the Agency was not the sole source of expertise, but 
for many countries its impartial advice was essential. 
42. An expansion of nuclear power would create new demands in the areas of spent fuel 
management and radioactive waste disposal. Experts agreed that the geological disposal of high-level 
radioactive waste was safe and technologically feasible. However, public opinion would remain 
sceptical at least until the first deep geological repositories were operational, in a decade or so.

43. The world of nuclear safeguards had changed considerably over the previous few years. 
Non-State actors had played an active role in several proliferation cases, while a number of States had 
made efforts to develop nuclear fuel cycles clandestinely. The focus of safeguards was therefore 
continuing to shift from the mechanistic verification of declared nuclear material to an 
information-driven system that aimed to understand and assess the consistency of information on a 
StateÂs nuclear programme as a whole. 
44. As he had said many times, there were four essential prerequisites for effective nuclear 
verification: adequate legal authority; state-of-the-art technology; timely access to all relevant 
information; and sufficient human and financial resources. Despite some progress, shortcomings 
remained in respect of all four. 
45. With regard to legal authority, it was more than ten years since the Model Additional Protocol 
had been approved by the Board of Governors. Of the 163 States having safeguards agreements with 
the Agency, 88 now had additional protocols in force Â barely more than half. Regrettably, progress 
had not been as fast as expected. Also, it was disconcerting that 30 States party to the NPT had not 
even brought into force the required comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. All 
States that had not yet brought comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols into 
force should do so without delay. 
46. He had on several occasions expressed concern about the ageing technical infrastructure and 
equipment at the AgencyÂs Safeguards Analytical Laboratory, which was key to the effectiveness and 
independence of the Agency in performing its verification mission. With the support of the Board of 
Governors, a project for renovating the Laboratory had been initiated. However, full project funding 
had still not been secured. The project was core Agency business that needed to be put on a sound 
long-term financial footing. 
47. Monitoring and verification of the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities in the DPRK 
had continued, with the cooperation of the DPRK. 
48. The previous week, however, the DPRK authorities had asked the AgencyÂs inspectors to 
remove seals and surveillance equipment so as to enable them to carry out tests at the reprocessing 
plant. Also, they had informed the inspectors that they planned to introduce nuclear material into the 
reprocessing plant in a weekÂs time Â in other words, during the current week Â and that the 
inspectors would have no further access to the reprocessing plant. 
49. Nevertheless, he hoped for conditions to be created such that the DPRK might return to the NPT 
soon and for the resumption by the Agency of comprehensive safeguards. 
50. Six years had elapsed since the Agency had begun intensive work aimed at clarifying the 
nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Substantial progress had been made, especially 
regarding the scope and nature of IranÂs uranium enrichment programme, and the Agency had been 
able to continue verifying the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. 
51. He regretted, however, that the Agency could still not make progress regarding the absence of 
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. He urged Iran to implement all the transparency 
measures, including the additional protocol, required in order to build confidence in the exclusively 
peaceful nature of its nuclear programme at the earliest possible date. That would be good for Iran, for 
the Middle East region and for the whole world. 
52. As delegates would recall, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had acknowledged that from the 
mid-1980s until 2003 its nuclear programme had been aimed at the development of nuclear weapons 
but had stated that it had not proceeded with the design of nuclear weapons and that it had not had a 
complete fissile material production capability.

53. The Agency had not found any indications of work relating to nuclear weapons development in 
Libya, where it was now able to implement safeguards in a routine manner. 
54. The Agency had been rather disturbed, however, to learn that sensitive information provided by the 
clandestine supply network to Libya, some of it relating to uranium centrifuge enrichment and Â even 
more worryingly Â nuclear weapon design, existed in electronic form and hence could easily be 
disseminated. Clearly, that was a matter of very serious concern. 
55. In line with the mandate given to him by the General Conference, he had continued his 
consultations with the States of the Middle East on the application of full-scope safeguards to all 
nuclear activities in the region and on the development of model safeguards agreements as a necessary 
step towards establishing an NWFZ there. Regrettably, he could not report progress on either front. 
56. Overall, nuclear safety had improved significantly, but the risk of accidents persisted. It was 
essential to ensure that a true safety culture took root worldwide, not least in countries new to nuclear 
power. The Agency was continuing to upgrade its safety standards, including those for addressing 
threats to nuclear installations from extreme natural hazards such as volcanoes and tsunamis. Also, it 
had strengthened its programme for protecting patients and staff during the use of ionizing radiation in 
medicine. 
57. During the past year, the Agency had focused on enhancing physical security arrangements at 
nuclear facilities and at other locations where there were nuclear or other radioactive materials. In 
addition, it had provided assistance to States in repatriating HEU research reactor fuel and vulnerable 
radioactive sources, in establishing effective border controls and in developing comprehensive 
approaches to national nuclear security. Moreover, it had supported security at major public events, 
including the Beijing Olympic Games. 
58. As everyone knew, however, the potential for a malicious act involving nuclear or other 
radioactive materials remained real. The number of incidents reported to the Agency indicated 
continuing weaknesses and vulnerabilities. 
59. As the use of nuclear energy expanded, the international community must enhance its ability to 
respond to nuclear and radiation emergencies caused by accidents or malicious acts. The AgencyÂs 
Incident and Emergency Centre had been created in 2005 to meet that challenge. However, he was 
concerned about the AgencyÂs ability to respond effectively to a major nuclear accident. The Incident 
and Emergency Centre needed additional capacity in order that it might respond to large-scale 
accidents and assist more Member States in building their own emergency response capability. 
Funding for that was urgently required. 
60. Development activities remained central to the AgencyÂs work. The demand for technical 
cooperation from developing countries was continuing to grow. However, the AgencyÂs resources had 
long been insufficient for meeting the demand, and the Agency had increasingly been making use of 
partnerships with other organizations, regional collaborative arrangements and country-to-country 
support. 
61. A new technical cooperation programme, covering three years, had been finalized. It pointed to 
a trend, especially in Europe, for Member States to focus less on national and more on regional 
projects. In general, regional programming had been strengthened and was more clearly targeted on 
common priorities. Member States with more developed nuclear sectors were playing a key role in 
supporting regional projects, by sharing their expertise with other countries in the region. 
62. In the new programme there was an emphasis on food and agriculture, human health and natural 
resources. Also, the number of requests for support with energy planning and for nuclear energy 
projects was increasing, and safety was a constant element in all projects.

63. It should be emphasized, once again, that technical cooperation was not a bargaining chip Â part 
of a political ÂbalanceÂ between the development and safeguards activities of the Agency. Nuclear 
applications provided immense benefits and yielded clearly measurable results. The Agency had 
shown itself to be a reliable partner across a wide range of activities. 
64. As to the future of the Agency, in its first 50 years the Agency had proved its value as a key 
instrument both for enabling developing countries to use science and technology in support of 
development and for maintaining international security. It had shown itself capable of adapting to 
changing circumstances and to the diverse needs of Member States. 
65. However, years of zero-growth budgeting had left the Agency with a failing infrastructure and 
with a troubling dependence on voluntary support, which invariably had conditions attached. For 
example, no less than 90% of its nuclear security programme, which was aimed in part at stopping 
terrorists from obtaining nuclear material, depended on voluntary funding; and the corresponding 
figures for nuclear safety and verification were 30% and 15% respectively. Also, technical cooperation 
resources were continuing to lag well behind the pressing needs of developing countries. 
66. All of the activities in question were core Agency activities, and it was imperative that the 
resources for them be adequate, stable and predictable. From that situation, together with the AgencyÂs 
insufficient legal authority in key areas such as verification, safety and security, it was clear that 
ability of the Agency to do its job properly was being seriously compromised. 
67. Against that background, about which he had voiced concerns on many occasions, he had in 
2007 appointed an independent Commission of Eminent Persons to examine the AgencyÂs work and 
make recommendations for the future of the Agency up to 2020 and beyond. The report of the 
Commission had been published in May. The Commission members, under the able leadership of 
former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, had not disappointed. Their recommendations Â some of 
them bold and far-reaching Â related to all aspects of the AgencyÂs work. 
68. His aim in appointing the Commission had been to trigger discussion among Member States, 
and in the international community at large, on how the Agency could best contribute to the 
achievement of their common goals of development, peace and security in the decades ahead. The 
CommissionÂs recommendations deserved serious scrutiny. He would highlight just a few. 
69. First, the Commission said that the Agency, working with supplier and donor States, should 
help ÂnewcomerÂ States to put in place the infrastructure necessary for launching peaceful nuclear 
energy programmes safely and securely. Also, the Agency should give high priority to the 
establishment of multilateral nuclear fuel cycle arrangements covering both the front and the back end 
of the cycle. 
70. Second, the Commission said that the resources of the TCF should be increased substantially. 
The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes, focusing on nuclear applications in areas such as 
food and agriculture, human health and natural resources, needed to be expanded. 
71. Third, the Commission said that, in order to help address the threat of nuclear terrorism, the 
AgencyÂs Member States should negotiate binding agreements to set effective global nuclear security 
standards and give the Agency the tools and authority necessary for helping to ensure that they were 
implemented. 
72. Fourth, the Commission said that the Agency should lead an international effort to establish a 
global nuclear safety network, also based on binding agreements, and that countries should submit to 
mandatory international nuclear safety peer reviews.

73. Fifth, the Commission said that the AgencyÂs safeguards activities should be strengthened 
Â which meant better equipment, more staff and funding, and greater legal authority. 
74. In connection with safeguards, it might be noted that nuclear disarmament Â the core of the 
NPT Â had been Âon the back burnerÂ for far too long. 
75. The Commission noted that the Agency was not the lead organization in matters of nuclear 
disarmament, but it added that ÂProgress towards disarmament, or the lack of it, will deeply affect the 
success of the IAEAÂs non-proliferation mission.Â 
76. As the Commission acknowledged, the agenda proposed by it was a bold one. It was now up to 
Member States to decide what kind of Agency they wanted. With a continuation of Âbusiness as usualÂ, 
the effectiveness of the Agency and the value of the services it provided to Member States would 
gradually be eroded. 
77. The sums envisaged by the Commission for putting things right were modest when weighed 
against the costs of a nuclear accident Â which could total untold billions of dollars, as in the case of 
the Chernobyl accident Â or of a terrorist attack involving nuclear material. Likewise, the potential 
benefit to developing countries from nuclear applications was huge. 
78. However, it was not just a matter of money. The Agency did not work in a vacuum. Political 
commitment to the goals of the Agency needed to be renewed at the highest level so as to encourage 
the transfer of nuclear technology to the developing world and to strengthen safety and security, 
non-proliferation and disarmament. 
79. The problems facing the world in the nuclear arena were plain for all to see. The Agency could 
do much to address them, however, if given the authority, resources, personnel and technology, and it 
would be a tragedy of epic proportions if the Agency failed to act until after a nuclear conflagration, 
accident or terrorist attack that could have been prevented. 
80. Making the Agency more effective was therefore critical to international security and to 
development. The report of the Commission of Eminent Persons spelled out what needed to be done, 
and it was now time to think big and to think long-term. 
6. 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2009 
(GC(52)/22) 


81. The PRESIDENT recalled that on 1 August 2008 the Board of Governors had recommended a 
figure of $85 million as the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF for the year 2009. Attached 
to document GC(52)/22 was a table showing the contributions which each Member State would need 
to make in order to meet its share of that target. 
82. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in 
planning the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes. All delegations in a position to do so 
should therefore notify the Secretariat during the current session of the General Conference of the 
contributions that their Governments would be making to the TCF in 2009. 
83. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions that 
had been pledged up to that time. He hoped that he would be in a position to report favourably on the 
percentage of the 2009 target figure already pledged.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(GC(52)/9) 


84. Mr BODMAN (United States of America), having expressed appreciation of the Director 
GeneralÂs leadership of the Agency, said that for half a century the Agency had been leading the 
international effort to make nuclear power safe for the world. Although significant progress had been 
made in that regard, a great deal remained to be done. 
85. The Agency was critical to the global effort to enhance energy security. In a world where fossil 
fuels alone could not meet the projected growth in energy demand and where energy production and 
consumption needed to be balanced against environmental concerns as never before, nuclear power 
was clearly a major part of the energy future. Member States should therefore continue their efforts, 
forthrightly, in a spirit of cooperation Â the alternatives were simply not acceptable. 
86. He read out the following message from President George W. Bush. 
ÂI send greetings to those gathered for the 52nd annual General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and congratulate the Agency on its long and distinguished record of 
accomplishments, both in helping bring nuclear technology to improve lives around the world 
and in seeking to ensure that nuclear energy is not diverted from peaceful use. 

ÂEarlier this year, a Commission of Eminent Persons led by former Mexican President Ernesto 
Zedillo produced a comprehensive report on the future of the Agency. 

ÂThe Commission underscored the need for the international community to work together to 
strengthen safeguards against nuclear proliferation, to promote nuclear safety and security, and 
to promote the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the 
world. 

ÂWe support these goals. 

ÂMember States must also do their part. The United States will act to make the advantages of 
emission-free nuclear energy and technology available to a wide range of States, particularly 
developing countries, consistent with non-proliferation, safety, and security principles. 

ÂWe are prepared to provide assistance in the peaceful development of nuclear energy, by 
facilitating access to nuclear reactors and assisting with the necessary financing; helping 
countries build nuclear energy infrastructures that conform to the highest standards for safety, 
security and non-proliferation; developing solutions for managing spent fuel and waste; and 
bolstering the international fuel services market to ensure reliable access to nuclear fuel. 

ÂThe United States also will work to ensure that the Agency has the technical and political tools 
necessary to meet its safeguards responsibilities to ensure that expansion of the benefits of 
nuclear energy does not contribute to nuclear proliferation. 

ÂPlease accept my best wishes for a successful conference.Â 

87. President Bush was a strong proponent of nuclear energy and the chief driver behind a number 
of initiatives on which he would like to report during the present meeting. 
88. In the view of the United States, only a considerable increase in the use of commercial nuclear 
power would enable the worldÂs largest economies to meet the 50% increase in energy demand by the 
year 2030 which the Agency projected and the carbon reduction goals agreed to at the most recent 
G8 Summit.

89. The power of the atom should be available to every nation that was committed to its peaceful 
use and accepted the highest standards of safety, security and non-proliferation. 
90. Together, States must address three critical challenges to nuclear powerÂs peaceful 
expansion Â cost, waste and proliferation Â and they must address them soon, given the growing 
interest in nuclear power being expressed in so many parts of the world. 
91. The development of a global commercial nuclear infrastructure must be made a high priority, 
and financing for the capital-intensive projects in question must be arranged. 
92. The United States had been revitalizing its nuclear industry through loan guarantees, risk 
insurance and streamlining of the licensing process. A little more than a year earlier there had been no 
applications for nuclear power plant construction licences before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; 
now there were 15 combined construction-and-operation licence applications being considered, with 
nine being prepared for consideration. Also, the United States was addressing the issue of nuclear 
waste, with a licence application filed for the long-term waste storage facility at Yucca Mountain. 
93. The world needed a nuclear liability regime based on the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage, which would widen opportunities for commercial nuclear trade, 
make a broader range of technologies available to nations seeking to introduce nuclear power and 
protect citizens and nuclear industries. The United States had ratified the Convention earlier that year 
and would like to see other countries ratifying it promptly. 
94. He would be travelling to Paris the next day for a ministerial-level GNEP meeting. A year 
previously, GNEP had had 16 partners; now it had 21, and he expected that there would be more after 
the meeting. 
95. GNEP was the best pathway towards the availability of commercial nuclear power on a global 
scale. Its members were committed to the promotion of nuclear energy as a clean source of power 
generated in a way that reduced proliferation risks and nuclear waste burdens. Those countries which 
shared the vision and values expressed in the GNEP Statement of Principles should support the effort 
to establish a new framework for the commercial use of nuclear power without the furtherance of any 
military purpose. 
96. GNEPÂs goals were ambitious, but they could be achieved. The necessary technologies had been 
identified, at least conceptually, and the question of a mechanism for the assured supply of nuclear 
fuel was being examined within the Agency framework. In his countryÂs view, nuclear fuel supply 
assurances based on the market and back-up reserves would provide a viable alternative to the spread 
of sensitive technologies. 
97. In that connection, he was pleased to announce that the United States would be contributing 
US $50 million towards the establishment of an international nuclear fuel bank under Agency 
auspices. His Government welcomed the $10 million contribution made by the United Arab Emirates 
and the earlier commitment made by Norway. 
98. A good start had been made, but his country would like to see many more Member States 
contributing in order that the Board of Governors might be able to establish the international nuclear 
fuel bank before the end of the year. 
99. The National Nuclear Security Administration of the United States Department of Energy was 
helping to strengthen international safeguards through its Next Generation Safeguards Initiative Â part 
of a United States effort to, inter alia, reassess the existing international safeguards system with an view 
to making it more effective and more relevant to current and future challenges.

100. Not all nations would play by the rules, even though the vast majority of nations insisted that 
the rules be respected. It was therefore important that the vast majority have the means to assure itself 
that nuclear programmes declared to be peaceful did not mask military ambitions. 
101. Unless international safeguards were strengthened, so as to promote security and confidence, 
there was a risk of losing the present opportunity for the commercial use of nuclear power on a global 
scale, and it would become more difficult to bring about an energy-secure future in line with concerns 
about the global environment. 
102. The universal implementation of additional protocols was essential in that context. For its part, 
the United States hoped to deposit its instrument of ratification of an additional protocol before the end 
of the year. 
103. The world was on the verge of a promising future, in which the peaceful, clean use of 
commercial nuclear energy would power both developed and developing economies, raising living 
standards and strictly controlling the nuclear materials sought by proliferators and terrorists. 
104. It was important to continue focusing on the military aspects of nuclear energy. Thanks to 
President BushÂs leadership, the United States had achieved historic reductions in its strategic nuclear 
forces. Four years earlier, the President had ordered a 50% reduction in the United States nuclear 
stockpile in addition to the warhead reductions agreed to in the 2002 Moscow Treaty. That objective 
had been achieved five years sooner than planned, and the United States would achieve a further 
15% reduction by 2012. Today, the size of the nuclear stockpile of the United States was roughly what 
it had been when President Eisenhower had been in office. 
105. In addition, more safeguards agreements were in force and more nuclear material and borders 
were secure against illicit trafficking now than ever before, and the international consensus against 
nuclear proliferation and terrorism had never been stronger. 
106. There were those who believed that the fabric of the nuclear non-proliferation regime was 
coming apart. His country disagreed. Through joint efforts, solid progress had been made in reducing 
dangers, and the NPT regime was stronger as a result. By any objective measure, the world was safer 
from nuclear terrorism than ten years earlier. 
107. The work foreseen under the United StatesÂRussia Bratislava Nuclear Security Cooperation 
Initiative was near completion. The United States had purchased more than 300 tonnes of Russian 
weapons-grade HEU for down-blending and converted 51 reactors in 31 countries to the use of LEU, 
thereby securing two tonnes of weapons-usable material, and work was continuing on the disposal of 
34 tonnes each of United States and Russian weapons-grade plutonium. 
108. From the establishment of GNEP to the decision of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to end its 
nuclear development programme, from the securing of hundreds of tonnes of nuclear-weapons 
material in the former Soviet Union through the Bratislava Initiative to the United States-India Civil 
Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, progress was being made towards the future envisaged when the 
Agency had been founded half a century earlier; but there was still much to be done. 
109. If States continued to act with decisiveness today, when the world had its best opportunity ever 
to restructure the international nuclear fuel cycle in ways that strengthened non-proliferation, they 
could prevent the emergence of further nuclear-weapon States and realize the economic and 
environmental benefits of nuclear power on a global scale. 
110. The agenda was a bold one, developed out of necessity, but States could Â and must Â take 
the ongoing nuclear renaissance to a global level and thereby usher in an era of worldwide prosperity.

111. Mr CHEN Qiufa (China) said that the AgencyÂs activities in areas such as energy supply, 
environmental protection, non-proliferation, prevention of nuclear terrorism and nuclear safety were 
greatly appreciated by the international community. In the past year, the Agency had provided strong 
support for the establishment of national nuclear power infrastructures and for continued research into 
innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles and had contributed to activities in the areas of water 
resources management and cancer therapy. In the areas of nuclear safety and nuclear security, it had 
promoted the establishment of a global nuclear safety network, conducted IRRS missions and nuclear 
security training, and assisted countries in upgrading their physical protection systems. Also, the 
Agency had implemented safeguards in over 160 countries and had promoted the conclusion of 
additional protocols by Member States in order to strengthen the integrated safeguards approach. 
Member States, the Secretariat and the Director General were to be commended for their joint efforts. 
112. His Government was grateful to the Agency and to a number of Member States for helping to 
ensure nuclear security at the 2008 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games, held in Beijing, by 
providing radiation detection equipment, expert advice and training. 
113. His Government had done its utmost to ensure the safety of local nuclear facilities in the 
aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Sichuan Province in May 2008. The China Atomic Energy 
Authority, the National Nuclear Safety Administration and other relevant Chinese organizations had 
monitored nuclear facilities in the quake-affected areas and had confirmed that all were in a safe 
condition; no leakages of radioactive material had been detected. Many other governments and many 
international organizations had provided greatly appreciated disaster relief assistance, and his 
Government was grateful to the Agency for providing radiation detection equipment and training that 
had played a critical role in the post-quake recovery process. 
114. Because of soaring oil prices and global warming, many countries were beginning to view 
nuclear power as an important energy option. Over 50 years of practical experience had shown that 
nuclear power was a safe, clean and economical energy source. The Chinese Government had decided 
to harness nuclear power for development, with a 2020 target of 40 GW of installed capacity and 
18 GW under construction. 
115. Besides accelerating nuclear power plant construction, China was continuing to promote fast 
reactor and nuclear fusion R&D, where good progress was being made. Also, to keep pace with the 
rapid expansion of nuclear power, it had stepped up its support for uranium prospecting and mining. 
116. China stood ready to share its experience in the nuclear power area with other Member States, 
especially developing countries. 
117. Many countries, including several developing ones, were thinking of embarking on nuclear 
power programmes. That was creating both opportunities and challenges for the Agency. The way in 
which the Agency assisted those countries would be very important. 
118. The Agency should, drawing on its professional advantages, continue to support the 
establishment of sound infrastructures for nuclear power generation and other nuclear energy 
applications. Also, it should promote the establishment of nuclear fuel supply assurance arrangements, 
as, in ChinaÂs view, all countries had the right to enjoy the benefits of nuclear energy applications, 
provided that they complied with their non-proliferation obligations. A balanced approach was 
required, with joint efforts in examining possible multilateral nuclear fuel cycle arrangements. In the 
meantime, the Agency should continue to foster nuclear technology application in the areas of human 
health, water resources management, food and agriculture, and environmental protection. 
119. The Agency should continue to promote nuclear safety culture and to assist States in 
establishing effective nuclear security systems. With recent incidents at nuclear facilities making it 

GC(52)/OR.1 
29 
September 
2008, 
Page 
14 


clear that there was no room for complacency in the nuclear safety area, the Agency should promote 
the exchange of nuclear safety-related knowledge among States and help to strengthen the 
international nuclear emergency response system. 

120. The use of nuclear and other radioactive materials was becoming increasingly widespread, and 
every country engaged in peaceful nuclear activities should ensure that the materials being used by 
them were not diverted for non-peaceful uses or malicious acts. For its part, the Agency should 
encourage international cooperation in the field of nuclear security and help States to establish sound 
nuclear security systems. 
121. The Agency should continue to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards 
system, making optimum use of the limited resources available in dealing with verification issues in an 
impartial, objective and balanced manner under the authority granted to it by international treaties. It 
should expand its cooperation with and draw on the expertise of Member States, subject to the 
precondition of guaranteed independent verification. Resource allocation should be optimized, with 
the focus on weak points in the safeguards system. At the same time, a balance should be maintained 
between promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy and ensuring nuclear non-proliferation. 
122. As host of the Agency-sponsored International Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Energy in the 
21st Century scheduled to be held in April 2009, China looked forward to the participation of senior 
officials from many other countries in the examination of major issues relating to the sustainable 
development of nuclear energy applications. 
123. Very much aware of the importance of the AgencyÂs statutory role in seeking Âto accelerate and 
enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the worldÂ, China 
would continue to support the efforts being made by the Agency in fulfilling that role. 
124. Mr CHATEL (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that the candidate 
countries Croatia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Turkey, the countries of the 
stabilization and association process and potential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
Montenegro, Iceland, member of the European Economic Area, and the Republic of Moldova, Georgia 
and Ukraine associated themselves with the statement he was about to make. 
125. The Agency was an organization of crucial importance for the European Union. Not 
surprisingly, therefore, its Member States together constituted the prime contributor to the AgencyÂs 
Regular Budget, the TCF and the NSF and one of two key contributors to PACT. The financial 
resources made available by them demonstrated the high priority that the European Union accorded to 
the AgencyÂs work in increasing the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity, 
preventing the diversion of nuclear activities for military purposes, spreading nuclear safety culture 
through the application of rigorous safety standards, and averting the risk of nuclear terrorism. 
126. Since 2003, the Agency had been at the heart of efforts to deal with one of the main challenges 
to international security Â the Iranian nuclear programme. The prospect of Iran acquiring nuclear 
weapons was simply unacceptable to the international community. The Agency had a mandate to 
continue its investigation into 20 years of concealment and to enlighten the international community 
regarding the nature and possible military dimensions of that programme. However, the Agency could 
not resolve the crisis alone. It was for Iran to shed light on its nuclear programme, revert to 
implementation of the additional protocol, open the doors of its facilities, provide access to persons 
and documents, and answer all the questions put by the AgencyÂs inspectors. Iran must implement the 
resolutions of the Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council relating to it and 
suspend its uranium enrichment activities. The task of Member States was to provide the Agency with 
the solid support that it needed, by ensuring that the additional protocol, the modified Code 3.1 and 
transparency were not dangerously eroded. The Agency should intensify its activities in Iran, and all

15 


efforts should converge in Vienna, New York and elsewhere. In that connection, the adoption by the 
Security Council of resolution 1835 (2008) two days previously was very welcome. 

127. Another country that had violated its safeguards agreement was the DPRK. Once its clandestine 
programme had been revealed, it also had engaged in multilateral negotiations. At the same time, 
however, it had continued working on a military nuclear programme in secret. It had fuelled the 
international nuclear black market, pursued a ballistic missile programme and then declared its 
withdrawal from the NPT. The Six-Party Talks had brought about some progress, marked particularly 
by the 2005 Joint Declaration, but in October 2006 the DPRK had announced that it had carried out a 
nuclear weapon test. Since the, the international community Â and particularly the five countries that 
were engaged in a dialogue with the DPRK Â had been trying to prevent the worst from happening. 
The DPRK must implement the Security Council decisions relating to it, irreversibly dismantle its 
nuclear facilities in a verifiable manner and give up its military-grade fissile material, with full Agency 
involvement in the process. 
128. With regard to the Director GeneralÂs reports to the Board about Agency fact-finding in Syria, 
the European Union was concerned about the fact that Syria had not yet responded to all of the 
requests made by the Agency. Syria should grant to the Agency any access requested by it and answer 
all the questions put by it. The Secretariat should pursue its investigations until such time as it could 
provide the Board with a full report. 
129. Positive developments had taken place in the case of Libya, whose leaders had courageously 
decided to abandon their clandestine military nuclear programme and cooperate with the Agency. 
Libya was implementing an additional protocol and had agreed to transparency beyond what the 
additional protocol required. The European Union welcomed the Libyan leaderÂs decision and 
congratulated Libya on the positive elements in the Director GeneralÂs latest report. However, that 
report shed light on the worrying phenomenon of clandestine nuclear supply networks. Member States 
should bear in mind that, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), every State must take 
the measures necessary in order to prevent and interdict illegal nuclear transfers. 
130. The European Union was continuing to call for the universalization of comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols, which Â in its view Â together constituted the 
verification standard. Without an additional protocol in force in every Member State, the Agency 
could not completely exercise its safeguards functions. Also, the Agency must have the human and 
technical resources necessary for its verification activities Â for example, in the Seibersdorf 
laboratories. The European Union was supporting the AgencyÂs safeguards system through eight 
national programmes and one programme organized by the European Commission. 
131. The Agency needed to be able to act effectively in order to carry out the verification mission 
assigned to it by the NPT, which remained the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime and the 
essential basis for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and for the development of nuclear energy for 
peaceful uses. Nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
were mutually supporting, which was why the European Union was attached to the idea of progress in 
respect of all three. It wished every success to the 2010 NPT Review Conference, in which it would be 
participating. 
132. As guarantor of international peace and security, the United Nations Security Council was 
required to take the necessary measures when a State failed to comply with its NPT commitments and 
fulfil its safeguards obligations. It was, de 
facto 
and de 
jure, an indispensable partner of the Agency. 
For their part, Member States needed to act upstream in order to eliminate the risks of nuclear 
proliferation and illegal nuclear transfers. At a time when the number of countries exporting nuclear 
and dual-use technology was increasing, States must strengthen their export control capabilities. 

GC(52)/OR.1

2008,

16 


Against that background, supplier groups were playing an important role in ensuring a common and 
transparent framework for export policies. 

133. In response to concerns about energy security and climate change, a number of countries were 
re-examining their energy policies. Also, while stressing that every country was free to determine its 
own energy strategy, the European Council had adopted an energy action plan for the period 
2007Â2009 that referred to how nuclear power could help in meeting the challenges of energy 
security and climate change and to the requirements of nuclear safety, nuclear security and radioactive 
waste management. As a complement to the action plan, the European Commission would be 
producing a strategic report on energy before the end of November 2008. Also, it was revising the 
2007 Illustrative Nuclear Programme for the Community, which addressed, in particular, the issue of 
the responsible development of nuclear power. 
134. The European CommissionÂs High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Waste Management, 
established in 2007, was aiming to produce its final report in 2009, and meetings of the European 
Forum on Nuclear Energy had been held in Bratislava and Prague in November 2007 and May 2008 
respectively. 
135. The Agency remained the organization best qualified to ensure the responsible exercise of each 
countryÂs inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes Â a right predicated on 
compliance with non-proliferation commitments. In that context, it was to be commended for its 
assistance with the establishment of infrastructures required for the safe use of nuclear energy. 
136. The Agency was also to be commended for the way in which it was supporting INPRO, a 
project that could lead to significant improvements in the areas of non-proliferation and safety and to 
reductions in radioactive waste volumes. 
137. Nuclear safety was a subject of constant attention within the European Union, whose Member 
States were further intensifying their efforts in the nuclear safety field. The European Union welcomed 
the recent work in that field done within the Agency framework, particularly by the Commission on 
Safety Standards, of which it would be taking full account. It would like to see all States with nuclear 
facilities availing themselves of the AgencyÂs nuclear safety expertise and requesting OSART and 
IRRS missions. 
138. Pursuant to an Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation established by the European Council 
and backed by funds amounting to Â 524 million, the European Union intended to make nuclear safety 
expertise available to third countries with peaceful nuclear activities. Such expertise was already being 
made available by the Agency, and the European Union wished to avoid overlapping and to coordinate 
the funding of the actions taken. 
139. In the European UnionÂs opinion, all countries planning to launch nuclear power programmes 
should cooperate closely with the Agency and implement its relevant recommendations and should 
become parties to international instruments such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint 
Convention and the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Although 
nuclear safety remained the responsibility of individual States, nuclear power development should take 
place within the framework of international law. Accordingly, the European Union would like to see 
Iran Â the only country not party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety where a nuclear power plant 
was being built Â acceding to that instrument before the start-up of the Bushehr nuclear power plant. 
140. As regards safety and security in the transport of radioactive materials, including their 
transborder transport, the European Union greatly appreciated Agency activities such as the 
organization of TranSAS missions. Also, it welcomed the recent establishment of a European 
association of authorities competent in the field of radioactive material transport.

141. Constant vigilance was essential in the field of nuclear security, the strictest criteria being 
applied in securing all nuclear facilities and materials. States should take all measures necessary for 
preventing nuclear and other radioactive materials from falling into the hands of traffickers or 
terrorists. Among other things, they should ratify the Amendment to the CPPNM and become parties 
to the United Nations Convention on the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The European 
Union welcomed the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, in which all its Member States 
were participating. 
142. As the prime contributor to the NSF, the European Union was enlarging the geographic scope of 
its support for the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme to cover south-east Asia. Through its 
Stability Instrument for the period 2007Â2013, the European Commission intended to promote a true 
nuclear safety and security culture. 
143. All Member States of the Agency should participate in the AgencyÂs Illicit Trafficking Database 
and seriously consider contributing to the NSF. 
144. The European Union expected that the International Symposium on Nuclear Security due to be 
held in Vienna in MarchÂApril 2009 would lead to the establishment of priorities for future action by 
the Agency. 
145. Steps were being taken to establish, under the auspices of the Agency, a nuclear fuel bank from 
which Member States might benefit and whose existence would underline the right to use nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. The European Union was examining the possibility of making a 
financial contribution in support of what was an ambitious project, launched by the Nuclear Threat 
Initiative, and it hoped to participate in the formulation of the precise parameters for the nuclear fuel 
bankÂs operation. 
146. Another ambitious project in which the European Union was very interested was the ITER 
project, which had been launched under the AgencyÂs auspices and was now well under way. The 
European Union was both hosting the ITER project and participating very actively in it. 
147. The importance of technical cooperation was recognized by all Agency Member States. The 
European Union, which was strongly committed to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, 
believed that the necessary financial resources should be made available for them. It also believed that 
they should be adjusted whenever necessary in order to meet the changing needs of beneficiaries and 
to respond to nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation requirements. In its opinion, there should 
be a thorough substantive debate on Agency technical cooperation, with a view to further increasing 
its effectiveness and efficiency, and Agency technical cooperation should be relaunched on a 
partnership basis. In that connection, the European Commission welcomed the contacts established 
between the Director General and the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian 
Aid. 
148. The European Union believed that all developing Member States of the Agency, including the 
LDCs among them, should be able to benefit from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, the 
geographical distribution of which should be equitable. 
149. As regards nuclear applications, the European Union welcomed the efforts being made within 
the Agency framework to Â inter alia Â combat cancer and eradicate insect pests. 
150. As regards the future of the Agency, the Commission of Eminent Persons had made its 
recommendations and the European Union recognized the importance of looking ahead. It stood ready 
to participate in a dialogue on ways of strengthening the Agency within the framework of the Statute. 
Clearly, however, such a dialogue could not be a substitute for the work of the AgencyÂs 
policy-making organs.

151. The European Union would remain a strong supporter of the Agency, which it considered to be 
an organization essential to the responsible development of nuclear energy and to international 
security. It would also remain a partner open to cooperation in the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ. 
152. Mr KIRIENKO (Russian Federation) said that his delegation had come to the 52nd session of 
the General Conference ready to participate in it constructively. The main task for the immediate 
future was to ensure the conditions necessary in order that all Member States might, without 
hindrance, enjoy the full benefits of the peaceful utilization of atomic energy subject to the 
requirements of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
153. As regards nuclear power generation, decisions were currently being taken about the form it 
would take in the next stage of its development. There would undoubtedly continue to be fluctuations 
on the energy markets, with oil prices rising and falling, but clearly there was not going to be a return 
to the era of cheap energy. Moreover, CO2 
emissions should be kept as low as possible although there 
were grounds for scepticism about whether rising greenhouse gas levels were really affecting the 
worldÂs climate Â a question on which there would no doubt be further scientific discussion. 
154. Most renewable energy technologies could play only a complementary role, and some Â such 
as biofuel production Â had even more undesirable consequences than CO2 
emissions. Thus nuclear 
power generation was one of the few means, at the full-scale industrial level, of simultaneously 
meeting the challenge of energy security and the challenge of compliance with the requirements of the 
Kyoto Protocol. 
155. Accordingly, more and more additional countries were preparing to embark on nuclear power 
programmes. Everyone was now talking about a Ânuclear renaissanceÂ Â something that, ten years 
previously, only a few analysts were forecasting. 
156. However, as everyone knew, some of the technology involved in nuclear power generation was 
dual-use technology. 
157. Initially, the civilian use of nuclear technology and been accessible only for the States belonging 
to the Ânuclear clubÂ and a small number of developed countries closely linked to them politically. 
Now, there was a very wide range of States staking claims, nuclear power generation being regarded 
by them as a means of ensuring energy supply stability and so promoting further economic 
development and greater well-being for their peoples. 
158. The problem lay in the fact that, while there was no justification (especially in international law) 
for questioning their right to free access, without discrimination, to nuclear technology for peaceful 
uses, there was a political responsibility to take all measures necessary in order to prevent the spread 
of technology and materials that might be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or for nuclear 
terrorism. 
159. In Russia, the decision had been taken to step up nuclear power generation through the 
construction of 26 further large nuclear power plants by 2020 Â a doubling of the countryÂs nuclear 
power capacity. 
160. The programme would be implemented by ÂRosatomÂ, now a State Corporation, with 
competence in respect of all international commitments and agreements entered into by it when it had 
been a federal agency of RussiaÂs executive branch. ÂRosatomÂ was responsible for nuclear and 
radiation safety, the non-proliferation of nuclear materials and technology, nuclear power technology 
development and training in the nuclear field. In August, it had assumed responsibility also for 
RussiaÂs fleet of nuclear-power icebreakers.

161. The Government of the Russian Federation had designated the Ministry for National Resources 
and Ecology as the federal body responsible for the formulation of State policy, standards and 
regulations for ensuring safety in the use of atomic energy. Responsibility for day-to-day monitoring 
and supervision remained with Rostekhnadzor. 
162. A major feature of the programme would be large-scale training. A National Nuclear University 
was being established, with bases at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute and a number of 
regional educational institutions. 
163. ÂRosatomÂ would be pleased to accept students and specialists from other Member States for 
training and further training respectively, in order that they might participate in their countriesÂ nuclear 
power programmes. 
164. Increasing the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs safeguards system was essential for strengthening 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Additional protocols were very important in that connection, and 
they should become the universal basis for verifying compliance with NPT obligations and also a 
major new feature of nuclear export controls. 
165. Russia, which had ratified an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency in 
October 2007, would like to see all countries that had not yet signed an additional protocol Â especially 
countries engaged in significant nuclear activities Â signing one with the minimum of delay. 
166. His country would continue helping the Secretariat to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system through its safeguards support programme. 
167. Russia welcomed the BoardÂs approval of the agreement between the Agency and India for the 
application of safeguards to civilian nuclear facilities in that country. The conclusion of that 
agreement, together with the relevant decision of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, marked an important 
step towards broader cooperation with India in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. 
168. The most important factor in ensuring the security of individual States and of the international 
community as a whole was the ability to react adequately and promptly to threats of nuclear terrorism. 
There were now 75 States participating in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, which 
was a good example of how such threats could be addressed. 
169. The Russian Federation, which had ratified the Amendment to the CPPNM, would like to see 
many States signing and ratifying the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism and the CPPNM with its Amendment. 
170. His country, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs activities directed towards 
strengthening nuclear security throughout the world, was supporting the implementation of the 
Nuclear Security Plan for 2007Â2009. It stood ready to increase its practical support and had decided 
to significantly increase, as of 2009, its contributions to the NSF. 
171. His country attached great importance to Agency technical cooperation projects for the return of 
HEU fuel from research reactors of Soviet design and construction. In 2007, such fuel had been 
returned to Russia from the Czech Republic, Poland and Vietnam. 
172. The Russian Federation intended to assist Ukraine in enhancing safety at the site of the 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant and expediting the start of the plantÂs shutdown. To that end, it would 
be paying $17 million into the EBRDÂs Nuclear Safety Account and the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. 
173. Technical cooperation was an important area of Agency activity, and his country intended to 
continue paying its full TCF target shares.

174. The Russian Federation intended to assist Armenia in enhancing safety at its nuclear power 
plant through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, and it would be making $10 million 
available for that purpose. 
175. In the Russian Federation, assured access to nuclear fuel cycle services was considered essential 
for a major growth in nuclear power generation. His country greatly appreciated the role that the 
Agency was playing in promoting the examination of multilateral approaches to the provision of such 
services and would continue to support the AgencyÂs efforts. It stood ready to cooperate with other 
countries, wherever possible, in the elaboration and combining of initiatives relating to multilateral 
nuclear fuel cycle approaches. 
176. Work was going ahead on implementation of the initiative Â announced by the President of the 
Russian Federation Â for the establishment of a global nuclear power infrastructure that would 
ensure, for all interested countries, equal access to nuclear power on condition of consistent 
compliance with the requirements of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. In 2007, his country had 
established, together with Kazakhstan, an International Uranium Enrichment Centre at the site of the 
Angarsk Electrolytic Chemical Combine. It was grateful to the Agency for its positive response to the 
initiative and, in particular, to the establishment of the Centre. 
177. Membership of the Centre was open to other countries, without any political conditions. 
Already, Armenia and Ukraine had decided to join, and the legal documents relating to their 
membership of the Centre were currently being prepared. 
178. In January 2008, the Agency had been officially informed that the International Uranium 
Enrichment Centre was being included in the list of Russian nuclear fuel cycle facilities where Agency 
safeguards might be applied. 
179. It was expected that the Centre would have received all permits and licences necessary for 
operating as a supplier of material and provider of services before the end of 2008. 
180. In addition, his country was supporting the related initiative of the Director General and 
building up an LEU stock sufficient for two 1000-MW power reactor core loads that, with the 
AgencyÂs agreement, would be kept at the Centre. In its view, that LEU stock, administered by the 
Agency, would permit the startup of an Âassured supplyÂ mechanism. 
181. Many ideas regarding the establishment of such stocks were currently being examined, and 
clearly the time had come to think of working out common approaches and principles. As regards 
principles, his country considered it important that the existence and administration of such stocks: 
- 
help to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime without running counter to StatesÂ 
rights and obligations; 

- 
help to promote the spread of the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, especially in 
developing countries; 

- 
not undermine the market mechanisms in the area of the peaceful utilization of atomic 
energy; 

- 
be in line with the concept of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle; 

- 
not subject decisions regarding the release of LEU from the stock to political considerations; 
and 

- 
be in accordance with the AgencyÂs nuclear safety standards and physical protection rules.

182. His country hoped that its ideas would lead to a broad, constructive discussion and ultimately 
help to bring about a general consensus regarding the basic approaches to the establishment of 
Âassured supplyÂ stocks of LEU. 
183. INPRO, initiated by Russia, was a good example of cooperation, and his country welcomed the 
way in which it was evolving and the international recognition that it had gained. Russia, which 
greatly appreciated the efforts being made by the Secretariat with regard to budgeting support for 
INPRO, would like to see all INPRO member countries sharing in its direct financing. For its part, his 
country would continue its financial and other support for INPRO. 
184. Through INPRO, it was possible to bring together all interested Member States Â both 
technology holders and technology users Â for the joint examination of ways of meeting energy 
needs. 
185. During the second phase of INPRO, his country had supported projects relating to Â inter alia 
Â the assessment of innovate nuclear reactors and fuel cycles in national, regional and global nuclear 
power scenarios and the establishment of an international infrastructure for nuclear power. 
186. In that connection, his country, which welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States 
in developing the national infrastructure necessary for the introduction of nuclear power, believed that 
the proven INPRO methodology for assessing nuclear power systems could usefully be integrated into 
those efforts and that the ÂINPRO platformÂ could become the basis for new kinds of partnership 
among Member States in creating the conditions necessary for the introduction of innovative nuclear 
power systems. 
187. Regarding the response of the Commission of Eminent Persons to the Director GeneralÂs 
background report entitled Â20/20 Vision for the FutureÂ, Russia saw the Agency as an international 
centre helping Member States to acquire and use nuclear power technology, analysing the global 
prospects for nuclear power and developing scenarios for the development of nuclear power Â including 
the introduction of innovative technologies that were more proliferation-resistant and safer. 
188. Mr PRODAN (Ukraine), speaking on behalf of the GUAM countries, expressed satisfaction 
with the interaction between GUAM and the Agency in the area of technical cooperation. In 2007, the 
GUAM countries Â Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova Â had through the Agency received 
technical assistance worth more than $ 1.6 million. 
189. The GUAM countries, which were cooperating with the Agency in several areas, attached 
particular importance to their cooperation with the Agency in tackling common high-priority problems 
connected with the security of nuclear materials and highly active radioactive sources, with the 
development of legislation based on Agency standards and the application of nuclear technologies in 
medicine. 
190. The GUAM countries, which the Agency was helping to strengthen physical protection at 
nuclear facilities and to ensure the security of highly active radioactive sources, had in 2007 signed a 
memorandum of understanding about mutual assistance in matters of nuclear security and radiation 
protection. 
191. The GUAM countries greatly appreciated the way in which the Agency was helping States to 
comply with their international obligations, particularly those arising out of United Nations Security 
Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1673 (2006). 
192. The GUAM countries were complying fully with their obligations arising out of safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols, and all nuclear facilities and materials within their territories 
were subject to full-scope Agency safeguards. They were, therefore, not happy about the fact that 

GC(52)/OR.1 
29 
September 
2008, 
Page 
22 


many States party to the NPT had not yet concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the 
Agency and several of those which had concluded such agreements had not yet brought additional 
protocols into force. 

193. The GUAM countries would continue to cooperate with the Secretariat in implementing 
national and regional projects relating to areas such as nuclear medicine and radiation therapy and to 
the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. 
194. The GUAM countries would like the Director General and the Secretariat to continue their 
efforts to establish partnerships for the purpose of attracting additional resources for use in the 
accomplishment of statutory tasks. In that connection, they would welcome increased technical and 
political collaboration with the European Union. 
195. Speaking on behalf of just his own country, he said that Ukraine, which had voluntarily divested 
itself of the worldÂs third largest nuclear arsenal, regarded the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy as 
one of the principal ways of ensuring sustainable economic growth. 
196. In the interests of energy security, nuclear power would be an important component of 
UkraineÂs energy mix in the medium and long term. 
197. His country, which had considerable scientific potential in the field of nuclear technology and 
long-term plans for nuclear power expansion, was supporting the work relating to innovative and 
improved reactor designs being done within the framework of INPRO. Also, it attached great 
importance to the work being done within the framework of the Generation IV International Forum 
and the ITER International Fusion Energy Organization. 
198. In July 2008, at a meeting of the INPRO Steering Committee, the Ukrainian delegation had 
presented the results of a study on the use of the INPRO methodology, and on 24 September 2008 
UkraineÂs Ministry of Fuel and Energy had sent a report on those results to the Agency. 
199. Operational safety at UkraineÂs nuclear power plants remained high, in accordance with 
international standards and the requirements of the Convention on Nuclear Safety. With the AgencyÂs 
help, Ukraine was continuing to improve its nuclear safety legislation and strengthen its nuclear 
regulatory body. It was continuing to implement its nuclear safety plan for 2006Â2009 and was 
grateful to the donors that were supporting its efforts financially. 
200. The State Nuclear Regulatory Committee of Ukraine had greatly appreciated the IRRS mission 
organized by the Agency in June 2008, during which there had been very useful consultations on the 
design and operational safety of UkraineÂs nuclear power plants. Ukraine would welcome an 
expansion of such safety-related Agency activities, perhaps to some extent through the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programmes. 
201. The fact that the Chairperson of the State Nuclear Regulatory Committee of Ukraine was 
currently a member of the AgencyÂs Commission on Safety Standards was an indication of the 
excellent reputation enjoyed internationally by Ukrainian nuclear safety experts. 
202. Ukraine, which was aiming for a high level of safety in the management of spent nuclear fuel 
and radioactive waste, had completed the construction of the ÂVektorÂ radioactive waste storage 
facility Â the first such facility to be built in Ukraine since independence. 
203. Ukraine, which would like the regime for the physical protection of nuclear materials to be 
strengthened and whose Parliament had in September 2008 ratified the Amendment to the CPPNM, 
was taking a whole range of measures envisaged in the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 

GC(52)/OR.1

23 


Radioactive Sources and in the supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive 
Sources. 

204. His country was grateful to Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United 
States of America for the assistance provided to it by them within the framework of the Global 
Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction. It was also grateful to 
Sweden for its help in resolving problems with radioactive waste from earlier defence programmes. 
205. Wider international cooperation within the Agency framework was needed in order to address 
the global threat posed by the possible use of nuclear and other radioactive materials for terrorist 
purposes. Accordingly, Ukraine greatly appreciated the activities of the AgencyÂs Incident and 
Emergency Centre and welcomed the establishment, under the AgencyÂs auspices, of the Response 
Assistance Network (RANET). 
206. Wishing to help ensure that terrorists did not acquire nuclear or radiological weapons, Ukraine 
was supporting Â inter alia Â the G8Âs Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and 
Materials of Mass Destruction, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative and the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Along with 22 other countries, Ukraine was participating in the AgencyÂs 
Illicit Trafficking Database. 
207. Ukraine, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards system, believed that the 
documents developed during the two years in which the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and 
Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute had met would be very useful for the future 
safeguards activities of the Agency. 
208. Comprehensive safeguards agreements, when combined with additional protocols, enabled the 
Agency to verify not only the non-diversion of declared nuclear materials but also the absence of 
undeclared nuclear materials and activities. The universalization of additional protocols would 
therefore strengthen the international non-proliferation regime, to the benefit of all States. For its part, 
Ukraine was fulfilling all the obligations arising out of its additional protocol. 
209. In building up a universal system of comprehensive safeguards, the Agency should focus 
particularly on the application of safeguards in countries conducting intensive nuclear programmes. 
210. One such country was the DPRK, and Ukraine shared the deep concern of the international 
community with regard to recent developments relating to its nuclear programme. It was essential that 
the DPRK fulfil, without delay, all its obligations arising out of the Six-Party agreements and take 
steps to shut down the Yongbyon reactor irreversibly. 
211. Ukraine recognized the right of the Islamic Republic of Iran to use nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. At the same time, it attached great importance to the efforts of the Agency to assure itself of 
the peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. In his countryÂs view, the ÂIranian fileÂ could be 
closed if Iran provided exhaustive answers to the AgencyÂs outstanding questions. 
212. Overcoming the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was still an 
extremely important issue for Ukraine, which was counting on further Agency support in that 
connection. It greatly appreciated the support already provided by the Agency within the framework of 
the efforts promoted by the United Nations to expedite recovery and sustainable development in areas 
affected by the accident. It also greatly appreciated the support being provided, within the framework 
of the United Nations Action Plan on Chernobyl to 2016, for the International Chernobyl Research and 
Information Network and for the holding of an international Chernobyl conference on radiation 
protection and safety in 2011.

213. Ukraine was close to embarking on the construction of a stable confinement for reactor No.4 at 
Chernobyl. The project would have safeguards and nuclear material security implications, to which 
Ukraine and the Agency would have to pay close attention. 
214. Ukraine fully endorsed the priorities set for Agency technical cooperation in Europe, where the 
main emphasis was on human health, nuclear science, radioactive waste management and nuclear 
installation safety. Also, it welcomed the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities relating to the 
operational life extension of nuclear power plants, the preservation of nuclear knowledge and 
experience and the strengthening of nuclear regulatory bodies. 
215. Mr BOUOUNY (Tunisia) said that his country was promoting R&D as part of its overall 
development policy and that R&D workers now accounted for some 4.5% of the working population 
of Tunisia Â close to the average for developed countries. Its expenditure on R&D would account for 
1.25% of GDP in 2009. 
216. As its fossil fuel reserves were very limited, Tunisia had decided, in the light of the continuing 
rise in petroleum and natural gas prices on international markets, to embark on a nuclear power 
programme for electricity generation. It had launched feasibility studies in 2006 and was setting up a 
national legislative and regulatory regime based on international standards to govern the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. Also, it was preparing to ratify relevant international instruments Â in particular, 
an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
217. Tunisia, which had welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative in setting up the Commission of 
Eminent Persons, endorsed the CommissionÂs call for Âa global nuclear order that will reduce risks 
while allowing rapidly growing contributions to human well-being from nuclear technologiesÂ and 
agreed with the Commission about the importance of partnership and transparency in that connection. 
It also agreed with the Commission about the need for budgetary increases if the Agency was to meet 
future challenges. 
218. During the past year, Tunisia had benefited from numerous national, regional and interregional 
technical cooperation projects organized through the Agency, and it was counting on strong Agency 
support for its technical cooperation programme for the period 2009Â2011. Tunisia, for its part, would 
be paying its full TCF target share for 2009. 
219. Tunisia, which was participating in regional activities relating to the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy that were being carried out by the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, based in Tunis, would 
like to see the International Atomic Energy Agency supporting the efforts of its regional counterpart 
through Â for example Â the provision of training. 
220. Tunisia, which was continuing to cooperate with other African countries within the framework 
of AFRA, had in March 2008 hosted the 5th African Conference on Non-destructive Testing Â an 
event attended by experts from 30 African countries and from several European countries and by 
representatives of corporate stakeholders such as the oil industry and NDT service providers. 
221. Earlier in the current year, Tunisia had concluded with France an agreement on cooperation in 
the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. It was expected that the agreement would provide the basis 
for support for the construction of a reactor as part of TunisiaÂs envisaged nuclear power programme 
for electricity generation. Already, a nuclear science and technology programme for Tunisian students 
had been launched at French nuclear establishments. His country was very grateful for FranceÂs 
supportive attitude. 
222. Tunisia was of the view that countries wishing to enjoy the benefits of peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy should not be subject to constantly tightening restrictions. To achieve real progress in nuclear 
disarmament, it was essential to build confidence and to preserve the existing balance between StatesÂ 

GC(52)/OR.1 
29

2008, 
Page 
25 


rights and obligations under the NPT, and all States Â without exception Â should accede to that 
treaty. 

223. Tunisia continued to advocate the speedy establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, in the Middle East, with all nuclear facilities there under 
Agency safeguards. His delegation hoped that the General Conference would contribute towards the 
attainment of that goal.

Arrangements 
for 
the 
Conference 
(a) 
Adoption 
of 
the 
agenda 
and 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion 
1. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
following 
a 
discussion 
in 
which 
some 
delegations 
had 
expressed 
reservations, 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
current 
session 
consist 
of 
all 
the 
items 
on 
the 
provisional 
agenda 
set 
forth 
in 
documents 
GC(52)/1 
and 
Add.1. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion, 
it 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
items 
be 
taken 
up 
for 
discussion 
as 
indicated 
in 
those 
documents. 
It 
had 
also 
recommended 
that 
the 
order 
of 
items 
be 
as 
set 
out 
in 
those 
documents. 
2. 
Mr 
ZARKA 
(Israel) 
said 
that, 
regrettably, 
some 
States 
had 
again 
submitted 
an 
agenda 
item 
on 
the 
so-called 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat. 
Israel 
had 
once 
again 
chosen 
not 
to 
challenge 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
agenda 
in 
order 
not 
to 
politicize 
further 
the 
meeting. 
3. 
There 
had 
been 
many 
alarming 
proliferation 
developments 
in 
recent 
years 
in 
the 
Middle 
East; 
none 
of 
them 
had 
involved 
Israel, 
but 
all 
of 
them 
had 
challenged 
its 
security. 
The 
developments 
demonstrated 
the 
alarming 
attitude 
of 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
their 
international 
commitments 
in 
the 
nuclear 
domain. 
There 
was 
no 
basis 
for 
the 
agenda 
item, 
and 
IsraelÂs 
policy 
concerning 
the 
implications 
of 
the 
item 
remained 
unchanged. 
4. 
The 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendations 
were 
accepted. 
(b) 
Closing 
date 
of 
the 
session 
and 
opening 
date 
of 
the 
next 
session 
5. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that, 
owing 
to 
the 
adjournment 
of 
the 
Conference 
on 
Thursday, 
2 
October 
2008, 
for 
the 
official 
Agency 
holiday 
of 
Eid 
al-Fitr, 
the 
Conference 
set 
Saturday, 
4 
October 
2008, 
as 
the 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
fifty-second 
regular 
session 
and 
Monday, 
14 
September 
2009, 
as 
the 
opening 
date 
of 
the 
fifty-third 
regular 
session.

The 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendation 
was 
accepted. 
7. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(resumed) 
(GC(52)/9) 
7. 
Archbishop 
MAMBERTI 
(Holy 
See) 
said 
that, 
in 
his 
message 
for 
the 
2008 
World 
Day 
of 
Peace, 
Pope 
Benedict 
XVI 
had 
invited 
every 
man 
and 
woman 
Âto 
have 
a 
more 
lively 
sense 
of 
belonging 
to 
the 
one 
human 
family 
and 
to 
strive 
to 
make 
human 
coexistence 
increasingly 
reflect 
this 
conviction, 
which 
is 
essential 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
true 
and 
lasting 
peaceÂ. 
That 
recognition 
of 
the 
unity 
of 
the 
human 
family 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
responsibility 
to 
protect, 
which 
was 
characteristic 
of 
the 
activity 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
as 
a 
whole. 
At 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
his 
delegation 
had 
stressed 
that 
the 
use 
of 
force 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
sustainable 
solution. 
The 
world 
must 
redefine 
its 
priorities 
and 
hierarchy 
of 
values 
and 
launch 
a 
common 
effort 
to 
mobilize 
resources 
for 
moral, 
cultural 
and 
economic 
development. 
That 
would 
require 
a 
multilateralist 
approach 
based 
on 
a 
renewed 
collective 
sense 
of 
security 
and 
recognition 
that 
development, 
solidarity 
and 
justice 
were 
essential 
for 
lasting 
peace.

8. 
The 
Agency 
worked 
to 
protect 
and 
promote 
life 
in 
a 
crucial 
area 
of 
human 
endeavour 
Â 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
world 
must 
work 
together 
to 
deal 
constructively 
with 
that 
complex 
area, 
which 
offered 
possibilities 
for 
both 
good 
and 
bad 
in 
ways 
that 
previous 
generations 
had 
never 
had 
to 
face. 
It 
had 
an 
obligation 
to 
share 
expertise 
and 
build 
a 
consensus 
through 
common 
effort 
and 
commitment. 
The 
Agency 
must 
always 
aim 
to 
unite 
and 
associate, 
not 
to 
divide 
and 
oppose. 
9. 
The 
Holy 
See 
supported 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system, 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
develop 
a 
worldwide 
security 
regime 
based 
on 
conventions, 
standards 
and 
assistance. 
Those 
instruments 
would 
contribute 
both 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
culture 
of 
life 
and 
peace 
capable 
of 
promoting 
the 
integral 
development 
of 
peoples. 
10. 
The 
world 
must 
also 
work 
together 
for 
the 
use 
of 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
nuclear 
technology 
that 
respected 
the 
environment 
and 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
most 
disadvantaged. 
In 
an 
age 
of 
globalization 
and 
in 
view 
of 
the 
need 
to 
work 
for 
the 
common 
good, 
the 
Agency 
must 
measure 
the 
value 
of 
its 
projects 
by 
their 
impact 
not 
only 
on 
the 
economic 
or 
social 
well-being 
of 
a 
people 
or 
nation, 
but 
also 
by 
their 
impact 
on 
cultural 
and 
other 
human 
values. 
Promotion 
of 
the 
common 
good 
demanded 
respect 
for 
the 
cultures 
of 
nations 
and 
peoples, 
coupled 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
solidarity 
for 
all. 
11. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
an 
example 
of 
what 
could 
be 
achieved 
by 
working 
together. 
The 
Holy 
See 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
achievements 
of 
that 
programme, 
in 
particular 
in 
agriculture, 
hydrology, 
food 
security 
and 
medicine, 
and 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
its 
work 
in 
those 
areas. 
The 
Agency 
could 
also 
contribute 
in 
its 
own 
unique 
way 
to 
the 
solution 
of 
the 
urgent 
problem 
of 
access 
to 
safe 
drinking 
water, 
which 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
All 
development 
policies 
required 
genuine 
international 
cooperation 
based 
on 
joint 
decisions 
and 
a 
universal 
vision, 
working 
for 
the 
good 
of 
the 
human 
family 
now 
and 
for 
generations 
to 
come. 
12. 
The 
world 
must 
also 
work 
together 
for 
nuclear 
disarmament: 
the 
human 
race 
deserved 
no 
less 
than 
the 
full 
cooperation 
of 
all 
States 
in 
that 
endeavour. 
The 
NPT 
must 
not 
be 
weakened. 
Pope 
Benedict 
XVI 
had 
written 
in 
his 
message 
for 
the 
2008 
World 
Day 
of 
Peace 
of 
the 
division, 
conflict 
and 
increasing 
tension 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
of 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
States 
engaged 
in 
the 
arms 
race. 
He 
had 
concluded: 
ÂIn 
difficult 
times 
such 
as 
these, 
it 
is 
truly 
necessary 
for 
all 
persons 
of 
goodwill 
to 
come 
together 
to 
reach 
concrete 
agreements 
aimed 
at 
an 
effective 
demilitarization, 
especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
armsÂ. 
The 
Holy 
See 
called 
upon 
those 
in 
authority 
to 
resume 
with 
greater 
determination 
the 
progressive 
and 
mutually 
agreed 
dismantling 
of 
existing 
nuclear 
weapons. 
13. 
Global 
security 
must 
not 
rely 
on 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
signature, 
ratification 
and 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
would 
be 
a 
great 
step 
forward, 
and 
its 
International 
Monitoring 
System 
had 
many 
potential 
civil 
and 
scientific 
applications. 
The 
Holy 
See 
had 
endorsed 
the 
Joint 
Ministerial 
Statement 
issued 
after 
the 
Fourth 
Ministerial 
Meeting 
in 
support 
of 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
held 
in 
New 
York 
the 
previous 
week. 
14. 
In 
his 
Encyclical 
Letter, 
Spe 
Salvi, 
Pope 
Benedict 
XVI 
had 
stated 
that 
every 
generation 
had 
the 
task 
of 
engaging 
anew 
in 
the 
arduous 
search 
for 
the 
right 
way 
to 
order 
human 
affairs. 
The 
Holy 
See 
would 
continue 
to 
follow 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
with 
great 
interest, 
as 
an 
example 
of 
ways 
in 
which 
issues 
and 
conflicts 
could 
be 
subjected 
to 
common 
regulation 
if 
the 
world 
community 
worked 
together. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
for 
the 
security, 
development 
and 
wellbeing 
of 
the 
human 
family. 
15. 
Mr 
MATSUDA 
(Japan) 
said 
that 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
its 
current 
Director 
General, 
the 
Agency 
had 
gained 
an 
increased 
level 
of 
confidence 
from 
and 
wider 
recognition 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
Expressing 
JapanÂs 
sincere 
appreciation 
to 
Dr 
ElBaradei 
for 
his 
tireless 
work, 
he 

GC(52)/OR.2 
29 
September 
2008, 
Page

announced 
that 
his 
Government 
had 
taken 
the 
decision 
to 
nominate 
Mr 
Yukiya 
Amano, 
Permanent 
Representative 
of 
Japan 
to 
the 
International 
Organizations 
in 
Vienna, 
as 
a 
candidate 
to 
succeed 
him 
as 
Director 
General. 
Ambassador 
Amano 
was 
best 
suited 
to 
take 
on 
that 
role 
and 
those 
responsibilities; 
he 
was 
a 
man 
of 
remarkable 
achievements 
and 
had 
proved 
his 
competence 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
non-proliferation, 
including 
through 
his 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
2005Â2006 
session 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
of 
the 
first 
session 
of 
the 
NPT 
Preparatory 
Committee 
in 
2007. 
Expressing 
JapanÂs 
firm 
conviction 
that 
Ambassador 
Amano 
would 
further 
develop 
the 
Agency, 
he 
asked 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
his 
candidature. 


16. 
A 
growing 
number 
of 
countries 
had 
expressed 
interest 
in 
introducing 
or 
expanding 
nuclear 
power 
programmes. 
In 
order 
for 
them 
to 
do 
so 
in 
an 
appropriate 
manner, 
three 
elements 
had 
to 
be 
ensured, 
namely 
non-proliferation/safeguards, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
important. 
At 
the 
G8 
Hokkaido 
Toyako 
Summit 
in 
July 
2008, 
Japan 
had 
launched 
an 
international 
initiative 
on 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
infrastructure 
based 
on 
those 
three 
elements, 
and 
had, 
together 
with 
the 
Agency, 
had 
held 
a 
regional 
seminar 
in 
Hanoi, 
Vietnam, 
in 
August 
2008, 
as 
a 
follow-up 
activity. 
Japan 
continued 
to 
expand 
its 
assistance 
to 
countries 
planning 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power 
generation, 
for 
example, 
taking 
the 
decision 
to 
make 
an 
additional 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
bid 
to 
support 
infrastructure 
development, 
capacity 
building, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
legal 
framework, 
through 
the 
dispatch 
of 
international 
experts 
to 
countries 
planning 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power 
generation. 
17. 
In 
light 
of 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
efforts 
to 
combat 
global 
warming, 
Japan 
believed 
that 
nuclear 
power 
should 
be 
eligible 
for 
the 
Clean 
Development 
Mechanism, 
and 
had 
formulated 
concrete 
proposals 
in 
that 
regard 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
Ad 
Hoc 
Working 
Group 
on 
Further 
Commitments 
for 
Annex 
I 
Parties 
under 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol. 
18. 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
participate 
in 
such 
international 
initiatives 
as 
the 
GIF, 
GNEP, 
INPRO 
and 
ITER. 
It 
would 
also 
promote 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
development 
of 
generation 
IV 
reactors 
and 
medium 
and 
small 
reactors 
that 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
Japan 
would 
also 
continue 
to 
develop 
the 
Monju 
fast 
breeder 
reactor 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
research 
and 
development. 
19. 
Views 
had 
been 
expressed 
that 
initiatives 
concerning 
the 
assurance 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
might 
infringe 
upon 
the 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
Japan 
believed 
that 
further 
discussions 
were 
needed. 
At 
the 
fiftieth 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
it 
had 
announced 
its 
proposal 
on 
Agency 
Standby 
Arrangements 
System 
for 
the 
Assurance 
of 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
Supply, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
establishing 
a 
system 
within 
the 
Agency 
that 
would 
help 
to 
dispel 
uncertainties 
on 
fuel 
supply 
and 
prevent 
market 
disturbance, 
by 
registering 
the 
supply 
capacities 
of 
Member 
States 
in 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
whole 
front 
end 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
JapanÂs 
proposal 
was 
useful 
for 
all 
Member 
States 
wishing 
to 
enjoy 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
it 
contributed 
to 
enhancing 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
market. 
In 
order 
further 
to 
develop 
the 
proposal, 
Japan 
planned 
to 
hold 
a 
seminar 
on 
fuel 
market 
transparency 
during 
the 
current 
financial 
year. 
20. 
Japan 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
It 
had 
continuously 
contributed 
100% 
of 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target, 
and 
had 
made 
significant 
contributions 
in 
terms 
of 
financial 
and 
human 
resource 
assistance 
in 
the 
utilization 
of 
isotopes 
in 
medicine 
and 
industry, 
among 
other 
areas. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
the 
RCA 
and 
the 
current 
chairing 
country, 
Japan 
contributed 
to 
joint 
research, 
development 
and 
training 
on 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
developing 
countries 
in 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
region. 
It 
had 
also 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
Asia 
through 
the 
Forum 
for 
Nuclear 
Cooperation 
in 
Asia

21. 
Japan 
Â 
the 
only 
country 
that 
had 
suffered 
atomic 
bombings 
Â 
was 
determined 
to 
appeal 
continuously 
and 
strenuously 
to 
the 
world 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
all 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
was 
an 
extremely 
important 
milestone. 
The 
International 
Commission 
on 
Nuclear 
Non-proliferation 
and 
Disarmament, 
established 
by 
Japan 
and 
Australia 
in 
July 
2008, 
would 
be 
holding 
its 
first 
meeting 
in 
October 
2008, 
and 
Japan 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
present 
a 
meaningful 
and 
practical 
recommendation 
to 
the 
Review 
Conference. 
22. 
Japan 
had 
always 
ensured 
international 
confidence 
in 
its 
nuclear 
energy 
activities 
by 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
transparency, 
and 
the 
integrated 
safeguards 
system 
had 
now 
been 
implemented 
in 
Japan. 
Moreover, 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
site-level 
integrated 
safeguards 
approach 
had 
been 
introduced 
in 
his 
country 
in 
August 
2008 
for 
facilities 
including 
a 
reprocessing 
plant. 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
promote 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
where 
possible, 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
host 
Asian 
Senior-level 
Talks 
on 
Non-Proliferation 
meetings 
and 
Agency 
seminars 
to 
that 
end. 
Japan 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
ensuring 
and 
improving 
the 
AgencyÂs 
independent 
analytical 
capabilities, 
and 
had 
made 
an 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
to 
help 
strengthen 
the 
Safeguards 
Analytical 
Laboratory. 
23. 
The 
decision 
of 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
to 
abandon 
its 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
had 
set 
a 
good 
precedent 
and 
contributed 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Japan 
welcomed 
LibyaÂs 
active 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
doing 
everything 
possible 
to 
extend 
cooperation 
to 
Libya 
to 
enable 
that 
country 
to 
become 
a 
role 
model 
for 
others. 
24. 
The 
international 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime 
must 
not 
be 
weakened 
by 
civil 
nuclear 
cooperation 
with 
India, 
and 
Japan 
therefore 
called 
upon 
India 
to 
take 
further 
actions 
in 
order 
to 
maintain 
and 
strengthen 
that 
regime. 
It 
also 
requested 
India 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
as 
a 
non-
nuclear-weapon 
State, 
and 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
CTBT 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date. 
25. 
The 
nuclear 
development 
undertaken 
by 
the 
DPRK 
was 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
peace 
and 
security 
not 
only 
of 
Japan 
but 
also 
of 
East 
Asia 
and 
the 
entire 
international 
community, 
and 
represented 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
NPT 
regime. 
The 
DPRK 
had 
not 
yet 
agreed 
to 
a 
concrete 
framework 
of 
verifications; 
it 
had 
halted 
disablement 
and 
was 
now 
carrying 
out 
restoration 
activities 
at 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility, 
including 
having 
seals 
and 
surveillance 
equipment 
removed 
by 
Agency 
inspectors. 
Japan 
was 
concerned 
about 
the 
current 
status 
of 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Its 
policy 
was 
comprehensively 
to 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
concerning 
the 
DPRK, 
including 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
abduction 
of 
Japanese 
nationals, 
and 
nuclear 
and 
missile 
issues, 
and 
to 
achieve 
normalization 
of 
relations. 
It 
continued 
actively 
to 
work 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
nuclear 
issues 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
26. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
regrettably 
continued 
with, 
and 
even 
expanded, 
its 
uranium 
enrichment-related 
activities 
in 
defiance 
of 
calls 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
In 
order 
to 
remove 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
international 
community 
and 
to 
gain 
its 
confidence, 
Iran 
had 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
respond 
sincerely 
to 
the 
requirements 
set 
forth 
by 
the 
relevant 
Board 
and 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
Japan 
continued 
to 
work 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
and 
diplomatic 
resolution 
of 
the 
issues 
in 
concert 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
27. 
Noting 
that 
ensuring 
safety 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
fundamental 
safety 
functions 
had 
been 
ensured 
following 
the 
2007 
earthquake 
in 
the 
Niigata 
Prefecture 
and 
its 
effect 
on 
the 
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
and 
rigorous 
efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
confirm 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
reactors. 
In 
June 
2008, 
Japan 
had 
hosted 
an 
Agency 
workshop 
to 
share 
the 
lessons 
learned 
and 
had 
taken 
the 
decision 
to 
make 
a 
new 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
in 
that 
connection. 
It 
would 
also 
actively 
support 
the 
newly 
established 
Agency 
International 
Seismic 
Safety 
Centre.

28. 
The 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
was 
an 
essential 
aspect 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
right 
of 
freedom 
of 
navigation 
under 
international 
law, 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
conduct 
such 
transport, 
while 
employing 
the 
most 
stringent 
safety 
measures 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
standards. 
It 
would 
also 
engage 
in 
dialogue 
with 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
States, 
building 
confidence 
and 
enhancing 
mutual 
understanding. 
29. 
Japan 
had 
initiated 
projects 
to 
help 
bolster 
nuclear 
security, 
mainly 
in 
the 
Asian 
region, 
through 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
NSF. 
It 
also 
been 
participating 
in 
the 
drafting 
of 
Agency 
guidelines 
on 
nuclear 
security. 
30. 
Finally, 
he 
assured 
participants 
that 
Japan 
would 
play 
a 
leading 
role 
in 
further 
contributing 
to 
the 
Agency, 
and 
asked 
once 
again 
that 
support 
be 
given 
to 
Ambassador 
Amano 
as 
a 
candidate 
for 
the 
post 
of 
the 
next 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Agency. 
31. 
Mr 
NOVIC 
(Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina) 
said 
that 
a 
number 
of 
significant 
events 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
security 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
over 
the 
previous 
year. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
an 
adequate 
response 
to 
obligations 
arising 
from 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
Stabilisation 
and 
Association 
Agreement, 
and 
to 
implement 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
to 
harmonize 
Bosnia 
and 
HerzegovinaÂs 
legislation 
with 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
acquis 
communautaire, 
the 
Law 
on 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Security 
had 
come 
into 
force 
in 
2007, 
establishing 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency 
for 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Security 
as 
an 
independent 
administrative 
body. 
The 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
had 
appointed 
an 
acting 
director 
of 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency. 
Although 
a 
number 
of 
details 
still 
had 
to 
be 
determined, 
the 
Regulatory 
Agency 
would 
be 
responsible 
for 
framing 
State-level 
policy, 
ensuring 
nuclear 
security, 
and 
establishing 
a 
system 
for 
radiation 
protection 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
technical 
assistance 
it 
had 
provided 
during 
the 
legislative 
drafting 
procedure 
and 
for 
its 
suggestions 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
specific 
needs. 
32. 
It 
would 
take 
some 
time 
for 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency 
to 
become 
fully 
operational. 
The 
first 
step 
would 
be 
the 
employment 
of 
qualified 
staff. 
His 
country, 
which 
did 
not 
have 
an 
educational 
institution 
offering 
specialized 
training 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
protection, 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
offered 
with 
regard 
to 
staff 
training. 
The 
Bosnian 
authorities 
would 
also 
train 
staff 
through 
various 
schemes. 
The 
next 
step 
would 
be 
to 
frame 
the 
legislation 
(rules, 
guidelines 
and 
instructions) 
needed 
for 
the 
legal 
framework. 
Existing 
legislation 
in 
the 
field 
only 
partly 
met 
the 
Basic 
Safety 
Standards, 
as 
many 
important 
documents 
issued 
by 
the 
Agency 
had 
not 
been 
incorporated 
into 
Bosnian 
legislation. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
had 
found 
a 
partner, 
a 
Member 
State 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
that 
was 
ready 
to 
assist 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
in 
the 
process 
of 
drafting 
regulations, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
their 
experience. 
He 
thanked 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
Spanish 
Regulatory 
Authority 
for 
Nuclear 
Security, 
which 
had 
agreed 
to 
help 
them 
in 
the 
future, 
with 
the 
Agency 
playing 
the 
coordinating 
role. 
He 
hoped 
that, 
with 
such 
cooperation, 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency 
for 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Security 
would 
become 
fully 
operational 
in 
the 
near 
future 
so 
that 
it 
could 
begin 
work 
on 
its 
legally 
prescribed 
duties 
and 
successfully 
respond 
to 
obligations 
arising 
from 
the 
programme 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
HerzegovinaÂs 
integration 
into 
the 
European 
Union. 
33. 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
had 
shown 
itself 
to 
be 
totally 
willing 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
international 
instruments 
relating 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
so 
in 
the 
future. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
had 
initiated 
the 
procedure 
for 
adopting 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material, 
the 
Revised 
Supplementary 
Agreement 
concerning 
the 
provision 
of 
Technical 
Assistance 
to 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
of 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
and 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
which 
it 
hoped 
to 
ratify 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
On 
19 
September 
2008, 
the 
Presidency 
of 
Bosnia 
and 

GC(52)/OR.2 
29 
September

Herzegovina 
had 
made 
the 
decision 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Agreement 
on 
the 
Privileges 
and 
Immunities 
of 
the 
Agency. 


34. 
His 
country 
expected 
the 
regional 
and 
country 
projects 
under 
the 
European 
CommissionÂs 
Instrument 
for 
Pre-Accession 
Assistance 
to 
make 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
establishing 
the 
infrastructure 
needed 
for 
implementing 
Agency 
standards 
and 
European 
Union 
directives. 
The 
projects 
would 
help 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
to 
improve 
its 
legislation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
radiation 
protection 
and 
to 
establish 
or 
increase 
its 
capacities 
to 
incorporate 
Euratom 
directives 
and 
other 
international 
instruments, 
standards 
and 
recommendations 
into 
its 
own 
legislation. 
Since 
the 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
that 
process, 
the 
possibility 
of 
overlapping 
and 
duplicating 
projects 
was 
thus 
avoided, 
along 
with 
unreasonable 
spending 
of 
crucial 
funds. 
35. 
In 
developing 
its 
national 
policy, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
would 
focus 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
security. 
With 
the 
introduction 
of 
regulations, 
it 
would 
improve 
its 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
harmonize 
the 
relevant 
State 
infrastructure, 
thereby 
strengthening 
the 
legal 
basis 
for 
all 
related 
activities. 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
would 
continue 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations 
in 
terms 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
budget. 
36. 
His 
country 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
through 
various 
project 
activities 
that 
had 
had 
a 
very 
positive 
effect 
on 
the 
countryÂs 
health 
care 
system 
and 
public 
health. 
Projects 
concerning, 
in 
particular, 
radiotherapy, 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
environmental 
protection 
had 
been 
successfully 
implemented. 
Under 
the 
project 
on 
strengthening 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
continuous 
staff 
training 
was 
being 
provided 
and 
equipment 
had 
been 
donated. 
Since 
three 
gamma 
cameras 
had 
been 
installed 
in 
clinical 
centres, 
the 
waiting 
time 
for 
certain 
diagnoses 
had 
been 
significantly 
reduced. 
Moreover, 
staff 
had 
received 
training 
to 
work 
in 
the 
two 
therapy 
centres 
that 
had 
been 
constructed 
with 
State 
funds, 
so 
that 
patients 
did 
not 
have 
to 
use 
the 
services 
of 
clinical 
centres 
in 
neighbouring 
countries. 
Plans 
were 
being 
made 
to 
introduce 
positron 
emission 
tomography, 
and 
he 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
lending 
significant 
support 
in 
that 
regard. 
37. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
assistance 
in 
equipping 
the 
radiotherapy 
centre 
in 
Sarajevo 
and 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
cobalt-60 
unit 
and 
a 
complete 
system 
for 
high-dose-rate 
brachytherapy 
received 
under 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
The 
centre 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
modern 
radiotherapy 
centres 
in 
the 
region 
but 
unfortunately 
was 
unable 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
ever-increasing 
number 
of 
patients. 
Preparations 
were 
therefore 
being 
made 
to 
open 
two 
new 
radiotherapy 
centres 
in 
Banja 
Luka 
and 
Tuzla. 
38. 
In 
April 
2008, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
had 
welcomed 
a 
high-level 
Agency 
delegation, 
led 
by 
the 
Director 
General. 
The 
visit 
had 
served 
to 
define 
cooperation 
priorities 
between 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
extended 
to 
fields 
and 
programmes 
that 
did 
not 
yet 
exist 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
particularly 
in 
areas 
relating 
to 
agriculture, 
industry, 
the 
energy 
sector, 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
The 
need 
to 
speed 
up 
the 
equipping 
of 
border 
crossings 
with 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
to 
prevent 
the 
illegal 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
materials 
had 
been 
emphasized, 
as 
had 
the 
need 
to 
maintain 
activities 
for 
increasing 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
Agency 
had 
offered 
assistance 
in 
resolving 
the 
problem 
of 
brucellosis, 
which 
had 
become 
increasingly 
serious 
in 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina. 
39. 
Although 
an 
exporter 
of 
electricity, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
did 
not 
generate 
energy 
from 
nuclear 
plants, 
but 
its 
electric 
companies 
did 
use 
WASP 
software 
developed 
by 
Agency 
experts 
for 
planning 
needs 
and 
future 
development. 
40. 
A 
decision 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
create 
the 
new 
Country 
Programme 
Framework 
(CPF) 
for 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina. 
The 
existing 
CPF 
had 
been 
signed 
in 
early 
2004 
and 
the 
priorities 
for 
the 
next 
mid-
term 
period 
needed 
to 
be 
defined.

41. 
Noting 
that 
implementation 
of 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
concerning 
the 
action 
plan 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
regulations 
programme 
would 
be 
a 
priority 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
period, 
he 
said 
that, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
priorities 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina 
would 
continue 
to 
support, 
through 
the 
State 
Regulatory 
Agency, 
activities 
to 
combat 
the 
illegal 
trafficking 
of 
radioactive 
material. 
It 
would 
also 
remain 
fully 
committed 
to 
supporting 
programmes 
focused 
on 
human 
health. 
42. 
Mr 
CHOREV 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
fifty-second 
General 
Conference 
coincided 
with 
the 
Jewish 
New 
Year, 
which 
started 
with 
a 
ten-day 
period 
of 
reflection 
and 
profound 
introspection. 
Wishing 
all 
delegates 
and 
Agency 
staff 
a 
Happy 
New 
Year, 
he 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
New 
Year 
would 
bring 
achievements 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
43. 
The 
steep 
rise 
in 
energy 
demands 
and 
electricity 
consumption 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
coupled 
with 
rising 
oil 
prices 
and 
growing 
demand 
for 
environmentally 
friendly 
energy 
sources, 
had 
served 
to 
make 
nuclear 
power 
a 
more 
attractive 
energy 
option. 
The 
intensive 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
highly 
desirable; 
however, 
proliferation 
risks 
associated 
with 
inherently 
dual-use 
fuel 
cycle 
technologies 
must 
be 
minimized. 
With 
the 
universal 
recognition 
of 
the 
right 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
came 
the 
absolute 
duty 
of 
each 
State 
to 
honour 
its 
international 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
and 
commitments. 
44. 
The 
most 
practical 
approach 
to 
minimize 
proliferation 
risks 
was 
to 
supply 
nuclear 
reactors 
as 
a 
power-producing 
Âblack 
boxÂ; 
to 
supply 
fuel 
for 
the 
entire 
lifetime 
of 
the 
reactor, 
and 
to 
organize 
a 
scheme 
for 
the 
take-back 
of 
spent 
fuel 
by 
the 
supplier. 
His 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
issue 
of 
assurances 
of 
fuel 
supply 
had 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
global 
agenda 
and 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
among 
those 
making 
efforts 
to 
facilitate 
dialogue 
on 
that 
crucial 
topic. 
45. 
IsraelÂs 
advanced 
nuclear 
expertise 
and 
know-how 
could 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
shaping 
the 
future 
of 
its 
energy 
sources 
and 
needs. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime, 
although 
experience 
had 
shown 
that 
applicability 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was, 
at 
best, 
limited. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Israel 
had 
brought 
itself 
even 
closer 
to 
the 
regime, 
including 
by 
developing 
robust 
legislation 
on 
export 
controls. 
It 
endorsed 
the 
call 
to 
bring 
non-NPT 
States 
closer 
to 
the 
regime, 
and 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
United 
States-India 
civil 
nuclear 
cooperation 
initiative 
and 
its 
endorsement 
by 
the 
NSG. 
46. 
In 
1993, 
the 
Israeli 
Cabinet 
had 
approved 
a 
vision 
calling 
on 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
establish 
jointly 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
a 
mutually 
verifiable 
zone 
free 
of 
ground-to-ground 
missiles, 
and 
of 
chemical, 
biological 
or 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Fifteen 
years 
later, 
his 
country 
had 
not 
lost 
hope 
that 
States 
in 
the 
region 
would 
one 
day 
engage 
in 
multilateral 
cooperative 
dialogue 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal. 
However, 
in 
recent 
years 
the 
world 
had 
been 
witnessing 
significant 
and 
dangerous 
developments 
regarding 
nuclear 
proliferation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Some 
countries 
had 
been 
developing 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
total 
disregard 
of 
their 
international 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
and 
contrary 
to 
their 
stated 
policy. 
Israel, 
like 
others, 
was 
following 
those 
developments 
with 
great 
concern, 
and 
called 
on 
the 
countries 
in 
question 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
and 
to 
halt 
their 
military 
nuclear 
activities. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
able 
to 
investigate 
and 
clarify 
those 
activities, 
thus 
assisting 
the 
international 
community 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
dangerous 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
abuse 
of 
the 
right 
to 
nuclear 
energy. 
47. 
The 
implementation 
of 
an 
effective 
and 
timely 
inspection 
process 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
critical 
elements 
of 
international 
non-proliferation 
efforts. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
improve 
and 
enhance 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
capabilities. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
next 
generation 
safeguards 
initiative 
launched 
in 
September 
2008 
by 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
EnergyÂs 
National 
Nuclear 
Security 
Administration.

48. 
Adequate 
safety, 
physical 
security 
measures 
and 
national 
regulatory 
regimes 
were 
also 
essential 
for 
the 
international 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
Israel 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
sought 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation 
of 
strict 
safety 
standards 
in 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
centres, 
and 
measures 
and 
guidelines 
consistent 
with 
Agency 
safety 
requirements, 
guidelines 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct 
were 
applied. 
Israeli 
scientists 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
field. 
The 
National 
Radiation 
Protection 
Centre 
at 
the 
Soreq 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
the 
main 
centre 
in 
Israel 
for 
licensing 
and 
issues 
relating 
to 
protection 
against 
ionizing 
and 
non-ionizing 
radiation. 
49. 
No 
State 
alone 
could 
confront 
the 
global 
threat 
posed 
by 
transnational 
terrorist 
networks 
and 
supporting 
rogue 
regimes, 
where 
secret 
and 
sudden 
attacks 
with 
chemical, 
biological, 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
weapons 
could 
become 
a 
chilling 
reality. 
The 
unprecedented 
surge 
in 
global 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology 
made 
more 
urgent 
the 
common 
task 
of 
Agency 
Member 
States 
in 
preventing 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials 
becoming 
available 
to 
terrorists; 
no 
effort 
should 
be 
spared 
to 
that 
end. 
Israel 
had 
joined 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
in 
2007 
and 
planned 
to 
host 
an 
activity 
under 
that 
Initiative 
in 
2009. 
Having 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
materials, 
he 
said 
Israel 
had 
joined 
the 
Megaports 
Initiative 
led 
by 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
installing 
portals 
at 
points 
of 
entry 
into 
the 
country. 
50. 
Israel 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
and 
had 
been 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
most 
recent 
cycle 
to 
extend 
the 
benefits 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy 
applications 
to 
a 
greater 
number 
of 
Member 
States 
worldwide. 
51. 
Israel 
had 
also 
recently 
joint 
the 
INPRO 
project 
as 
an 
observer 
and 
had 
identified 
several 
INPRO 
collaborative 
projects 
to 
which 
Israeli 
scientists 
could 
contribute. 
His 
Government 
would 
also 
consider, 
in 
due 
course, 
joining 
that 
important 
initiative 
as 
a 
member. 
52. 
Compliance 
with 
legally 
binding 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
was 
a 
basic 
confidence-
building 
measure 
and 
vital 
for 
creating 
conditions 
that 
would 
facilitate 
the 
process 
of 
turning 
the 
Middle 
East 
into 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
WMDs. 
Three 
out 
of 
the 
four 
widely 
recognized 
cases 
of 
non-
compliance 
with 
such 
obligations 
concerned 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
were 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Unfortunately, 
instead 
of 
tackling 
those 
pressing 
issues, 
some 
countries 
were 
trying 
to 
impose 
on 
the 
General 
Conference 
an 
agenda 
item 
on 
the 
so-called 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat, 
an 
item 
that 
had 
been 
removed 
from 
the 
agenda 
in 
1993 
and 
never 
acted 
upon 
since. 
Some 
of 
the 
sponsors 
of 
the 
relevant 
draft 
resolution 
were 
States 
that 
did 
not 
recognize 
the 
State 
of 
Israel 
and 
even 
called 
for 
its 
annihilation. 
He 
would 
question 
the 
moral 
standing 
of 
those 
sponsors 
that 
did 
not 
recognize 
IsraelÂs 
right 
to 
exist 
while 
criticizing 
Israeli 
policies 
aimed 
at 
securing 
that 
very 
existence. 
53. 
Agenda 
item 
20 
concerned 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
NWFZ, 
to 
which 
his 
country 
remained 
committed. 
Such 
a 
zone 
could 
not 
be 
established 
out 
of 
context; 
it 
could 
only 
emerge 
from 
a 
gradual 
process 
of 
mutual 
acceptance, 
reconciliation 
and 
lasting 
peace, 
followed 
by 
more 
confidence-building 
and 
modest 
arms 
control 
measures. 
Israel 
had 
joined 
consensus 
on 
relevant 
resolutions 
for 
many 
years, 
despite 
its 
grave 
reservations 
about 
their 
modalities 
and 
about 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
as 
a 
forum 
to 
address 
the 
issue. 
Unfortunately, 
consensus 
had 
been 
lost 
on 
the 
resolution 
for 
the 
first 
time 
after 
14 
years 
in 
2006, 
because 
certain 
States 
had 
insisted 
on 
introducing 
amendments 
to 
the 
text 
that 
had 
not 
been 
negotiated. 
It 
was 
not 
too 
late 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus 
on 
the 
item, 
and 
Israel 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
of 
a 
number 
of 
delegations 
in 
that 
regard. 
54. 
Mr 
WICKS 
(United 
Kingdom) 
said 
that 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
white 
paper 
on 
meeting 
the 
energy 
challenge, 
which 
had 
been 
published 
by 
his 
Government 
in 
January 
and 
marked 
the 
end 
of 
a 
public 
consultation 
process, 
had 
announced 
the 
decision 
that 
civil 
nuclear 
power 
should 
play 
its 
part 
in 
a 

GC(52)/OR.2

balanced 
and 
diverse 
energy 
strategy 
for 
the 
United 
Kingdom. 
A 
new 
strategy 
had 
also 
been 
devised 
for 
the 
safe 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste, 
with 
deep 
geological 
disposal 
the 
preferred 
long-term 
solution. 


55. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
new 
civil 
nuclear 
power 
for 
two 
major 
reasons: 
climate 
change 
and 
energy 
security. 
There 
could 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
climate 
change 
Â 
global 
warming 
Â 
represented 
the 
major 
challenge 
facing 
the 
planet 
in 
the 
current 
century. 
If 
States 
did 
not 
tackle 
global 
warming, 
the 
consequences 
for 
nations, 
such 
as 
flooding, 
mass 
population 
migration 
and 
other 
phenomena, 
would 
be 
momentous. 
56. 
The 
current 
era 
was 
one 
of 
unprecedented 
global 
demand 
for 
energy 
and 
of 
growing 
geopolitical 
risks. 
With 
global 
energy 
prices 
becoming 
increasingly 
volatile, 
it 
had 
never 
been 
more 
imperative 
to 
increase 
the 
amount 
of 
energy 
obtained 
from 
secure 
and 
sustainable 
sources. 
57. 
His 
Government 
had 
embarked 
on 
a 
series 
of 
steps 
that 
would 
set 
a 
sound 
basis 
for 
a 
new 
phase 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
utility 
companies 
had 
shown 
a 
readiness 
to 
respond 
quickly 
to 
investment 
opportunities 
in 
that 
area.. 
58. 
The 
nuclear 
renaissance 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
was 
taking 
place 
within 
the 
context 
of 
over 
sixty 
years 
of 
experience. 
He 
would 
be 
joined 
at 
the 
British 
Embassy 
in 
Vienna 
the 
following 
day 
by 
top 
decision-makers 
from 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
industry 
to 
speak 
further 
on 
the 
subject 
at 
a 
seminar 
entitled 
Nuclear 
Power: 
the 
UK 
Experience. 
He 
looked 
forward 
to 
welcoming 
participants 
at 
that 
event. 
59. 
The 
number 
of 
new 
reactors 
built 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
would 
depend 
on 
commercial 
planning 
decisions 
taken 
by 
private 
sector 
utility 
companies. 
However, 
there 
was 
no 
doubt 
that 
there 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
a 
substantial 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
power 
worldwide, 
and 
strong 
international 
partnerships 
were 
an 
essential 
component 
of 
successful 
national 
strategies 
for 
the 
exploitation 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
significant 
and 
indispensable 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
had 
shown 
its 
strength 
in 
giving 
objective 
guidance, 
setting 
standards 
and 
monitoring; 
it 
must 
now 
actively 
address 
the 
challenges 
of 
a 
reinvigorated 
nuclear 
future. 
The 
recent 
report 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
Future 
of 
the 
Agency 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/INF/4 
was 
a 
timely 
publication 
in 
that 
regard, 
which 
sought 
to 
identify 
some 
of 
those 
challenges 
and 
initiate 
a 
debate 
among 
Member 
States. 
Although 
the 
Agency 
would 
not 
have 
the 
lead 
role 
in 
addressing 
all 
the 
varied 
challenges 
of 
a 
nuclear 
renaissance, 
it 
did 
have 
an 
important 
part 
to 
play, 
concentrating 
on 
its 
core 
mandate 
and 
prioritizing 
those 
activities 
where 
it 
could 
make 
a 
major 
and 
unique 
contribution. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
stood 
ready 
to 
be 
a 
full 
and 
active 
participant 
in 
helping 
to 
define 
the 
AgencyÂs 
strategic 
vision 
up 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond, 
and 
hoped 
that 
all 
Member 
States 
would 
be 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
shaping 
of 
an 
Agency 
fit 
to 
address 
the 
challenges 
of 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
the 
century. 
60. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
non-proliferation 
would 
remain 
of 
crucial 
importance 
in 
view 
of 
the 
need 
to 
maintain 
confidence 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
nuclear 
technologies 
were 
being 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only. 
The 
NPT, 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
in 
addressing 
threats 
to 
global 
security 
and 
stability. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
30 
non-
nuclear-weapon 
States 
still 
did 
not 
have 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
force, 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
called 
on 
those 
States 
to 
conclude 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
that 
were 
required 
of 
them. 
It 
also 
strongly 
urged 
those 
and 
all 
other 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
conclude 
and 
implement 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
strengthened 
safeguards 
system 
would 
be 
fully 
effective 
only 
when 
all 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
both 
measures 
in 
place. 
61. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
underscored 
its 
steadfast 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
work 
on 
specific 
urgent 
safeguards 
verification 
issues. 
His 
Government 
shared 
the 
serious 
concern 
expressed 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
about 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
ensure 
cooperation 
and 
transparency 
as 
the 
Agency 

GC(52)/OR.2

sought 
essential 
answers 
to 
questions 
about 
that 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
activities. 
It 
had 
joined 
the 
unanimous 
call 
in 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1835 
(2008) 
for 
Iran 
to 
comply 
fully 
and 
without 
delay 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
and 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Board 
of 
Governors. 


62. 
His 
delegation 
looked 
to 
the 
authorities 
of 
the 
DPRK 
to 
resume 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity 
and 
to 
implement 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
complete, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
dismantling 
of 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
63. 
The 
danger 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
being 
obtained 
by 
terrorists 
was 
one 
of 
the 
major 
issues 
facing 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
64. 
His 
Government 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regulations 
on 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
European 
association 
of 
competent 
authorities 
ensured 
even 
greater 
harmonization 
concerning 
transport 
regulations. 
65. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
placed 
strong 
emphasis 
on 
developing 
partnerships 
in 
both 
training 
and 
site 
security. 
It 
supported 
the 
Agency 
in 
facilitating 
substantial 
integrated 
physical 
protection 
upgrades 
at 
key 
locations 
and 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
working 
with 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
so 
effectively 
in 
areas 
including 
procurement 
and 
risk 
management. 
66. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
the 
voluntary 
NSF, 
having 
contributed 
more 
than 
US 
$7 
million. 
It 
called 
on 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
that 
vital 
area. 
67. 
In 
meeting 
the 
challenge 
of 
climate 
change, 
States 
should 
seek 
to 
use 
clean, 
green, 
secure 
and 
sustainable 
energy. 
For 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
nuclear 
energy 
formed 
part 
of 
the 
answer. 
That 
was 
not 
to 
suggest 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
a 
panacea: 
it 
involved 
major 
capital, 
long-term 
decisions, 
and 
risks 
that 
must 
be 
assessed 
and 
addressed. 
A 
reactor 
that 
ran 
for 
40, 
50 
or 
even 
60 
years 
required 
fuel 
to 
remain 
operational. 
Hence 
the 
importance 
of 
secure 
nuclear 
fuel 
supplies. 
Given 
the 
global 
interdependence 
of 
nuclear 
industries, 
all 
States 
should 
face 
the 
problem 
of 
fuel 
security 
together. 
A 
key 
part 
of 
the 
solution, 
as 
identified 
early 
on 
by 
the 
Agency, 
would 
be 
the 
development 
of 
multinational 
approaches 
to 
the 
fuel 
cycle. 
Several 
countries, 
individually 
and 
collectively, 
had 
put 
forward 
proposals 
to 
provide 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply. 
The 
United 
KingdomÂs 
own 
proposal 
was 
for 
a 
fuel 
enrichment 
assurance, 
or 
Âenrichment 
bondÂ 
Â 
a 
binding 
arrangement 
to 
underpin 
commercial 
contracts 
and 
assure 
supplies 
over 
a 
specific 
time 
frame. 
His 
Government 
intended 
to 
engage 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
interested 
countries 
to 
ensure 
that 
ideas 
were 
both 
fair 
and 
practical. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
intended 
to 
host 
a 
major 
international 
conference 
on 
nuclear 
fuel 
supplies 
before 
March 
2009. 
68. 
Mr 
KHELIL 
(Algeria) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
took 
note 
of 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
role 
of 
the 
IAEA 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/INF/4; 
the 
discussions 
taking 
place 
during 
the 
current 
Scientific 
Forum 
would 
undoubtedly 
help 
consolidate 
thinking 
on 
that 
subject. 
69. 
With 
regard 
to 
technical 
cooperation, 
he 
said 
that 
Algeria 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
in 
areas 
including 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
and 
for 
the 
fellowships 
and 
courses 
from 
which 
its 
national 
experts 
had 
benefited. 
Welcoming 
the 
fact 
that 
no 
fewer 
than 
122 
States 
benefited 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation, 
he 
said 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
establish 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
that 
financial 
resources 
for 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
were 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable. 
For 
its 
part, 
Algeria 
would 
continue 
to 
pay 
its 
contributions 
on 
time, 
including 
to 
the 
TCF.

Strategic 
Cooperative 
Framework 
for 
2008Â2013 
would 
improve 
the 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
AFRA 
programme. 
Algeria 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
make 
its 
contribution 
to 
implementation 
of 
the 
Plan 
of 
Action 
adopted 
by 
the 
High-Level 
Regional 
Conference 
on 
the 
Contribution 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy 
to 
Peace 
and 
Sustainable 
Development, 
organized 
in 
Algiers 
in 
January 
2007. 
Cooperation 
would 
also 
be 
useful 
with 
the 
African 
Energy 
Commission, 
officially 
launched 
in 
Algiers 
in 
February 
2008. 
Inter-Agency 
cooperation 
was 
also 
a 
gauge 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
programmes, 
and 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
strategic 
partnerships 
with 
other 
international 
organizations 
and 
national 
institutes. 


70. 
Algeria 
was 
continuing 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
the 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
for 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
order 
to 
comply 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
ensure 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Algeria 
remained 
committed 
to 
combating 
terrorism 
in 
all 
its 
forms, 
and 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
plan 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Algeria 
encouraged 
implementation 
of 
international 
instruments, 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material, 
both 
of 
which 
had 
been 
ratified 
by 
his 
country. 
71. 
Algeria 
continued 
to 
consider 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
body 
duly 
mandated 
to 
deal 
with 
safeguards 
and 
verification, 
and 
wished 
to 
express 
its 
confidence 
in 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
its 
impartiality 
and 
professionalism. 
His 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
serious 
discussions 
that 
had 
been 
held 
in 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification, 
which 
Algeria 
had 
had 
the 
privilege 
of 
chairing. 
His 
country 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
its 
assistance 
in 
support 
of 
national 
efforts 
to 
prepare 
for 
signature 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
72. 
Algeria 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
in-depth 
discussions 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
political, 
economic 
and 
legal 
implications 
arising 
from 
the 
proposals 
of 
Member 
States 
concerning 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply; 
such 
proposals 
should 
in 
no 
way 
jeopardize 
the 
inalienable 
rights 
of 
State 
Parties 
under 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Algeria 
remained 
committed 
to 
dialogue 
and 
cooperation 
as 
a 
means 
of 
resolving 
disputes, 
particularly 
of 
matters 
relating 
to 
collective 
peace 
and 
security. 
For 
Algeria, 
the 
concerns 
raised 
by 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
were 
just 
as 
legitimate 
as 
those 
raised 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
general 
and 
complete 
disarmament. 
There 
needed 
to 
be 
tangible 
progress 
in 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
NPT, 
the 
implementation 
of 
concrete 
and 
verifiable 
disarmament 
measures, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
legally 
binding 
international 
agreement 
on 
negative 
security 
assurances, 
the 
negotiation 
of 
a 
treaty 
banning 
the 
production 
of 
fissile 
material, 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
arms 
race 
in 
space, 
the 
rapid 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
73. 
Israel, 
whose 
authorities 
had 
publicly 
acknowledged 
that 
countryÂs 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
was 
the 
only 
State 
in 
the 
region 
that 
was 
not 
Party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
and 
its 
persistent 
refusal 
to 
accede 
to 
that 
Treaty 
unbalanced 
the 
regionÂs 
security. 
The 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
a 
crucial 
confidence-building 
measure 
for 
regional 
and 
international 
security. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
delegation 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
continue 
his 
efforts 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
forum 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
74. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
DPRK, 
Algeria 
called 
for 
the 
consolidation 
of 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
six-
party 
talks, 
leading 
eventually 
to 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations 
between 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Agency, 
and 
to 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
peninsula.

75. 
Algeria 
welcomed 
the 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
enabled 
remaining 
questions 
to 
be 
resolved 
and 
should 
be 
continued 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
confidence 
in 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
that 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
76. 
Finally, 
Algeria 
called 
on 
those 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
77. 
Ms 
SONJICA 
(South 
Africa) 
congratulated 
the 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
entry 
of 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Lesotho 
increased 
the 
number 
of 
African 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
Agency 
to 
39, 
indicating 
a 
heightened 
interest 
on 
the 
African 
continent 
in 
both 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
the 
benefits 
derived 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes. 
78. 
Safeguards 
and 
verification 
remained 
the 
key 
to 
facilitating 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
for 
development; 
however, 
additional 
work 
was 
needed. 
The 
Agency 
ought 
to 
be 
continuously 
equipped 
with 
the 
appropriate 
tools 
to 
ensure 
that 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
worldwide 
was 
fully 
accounted 
for. 
It 
should 
also 
be 
able 
to 
verify 
that 
nuclear 
capabilities 
were 
being 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only, 
and 
also 
to 
provide 
assurances 
regarding 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
activities. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
was 
a 
crucial 
instrument 
in 
that 
regard, 
and 
South 
Africa 
believed 
that 
it 
was 
incumbent 
upon 
all 
States 
to 
build 
confidence 
and 
provide 
assurance 
that 
their 
nuclear 
capability 
was 
being 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only. 
79. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
safeguards 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
South 
Africa 
had 
been 
following 
with 
a 
great 
sense 
of 
optimism 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
had 
observed 
with 
disappointment 
the 
recent 
developments 
in 
Pyongyang. 
She 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
work 
towards 
restoring 
its 
NPT 
status. 
80. 
South 
Africa 
welcomed 
IranÂs 
continued 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
Safeguards. 
It 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
the 
Agency 
with 
access 
to 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
would 
submit 
the 
required 
nuclear 
material 
accountancy 
reports 
in 
connection 
with 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
Through 
such 
cooperation, 
Iran 
would 
be 
able 
to 
build 
further 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
South 
Africa 
also 
believed 
that 
it 
was 
important 
for 
Iran 
continuously 
to 
commit 
itself 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
81. 
With 
regard 
to 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
safeguards, 
she 
said 
that 
those 
who 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
illicit 
network 
of 
proliferation 
activities 
had 
been 
prosecuted 
in 
South 
Africa. 
The 
accused 
had 
been 
convicted 
in 
the 
Pretoria 
High 
Court 
after 
pleading 
guilty 
to 
seven 
charges 
of 
contravening 
the 
Non-Proliferation 
of 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
Act 
and 
the 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Act. 
Such 
action 
attested 
to 
her 
countryÂs 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
82. 
Global 
issues 
had 
recently 
affected 
her 
countryÂs 
ability 
to 
achieve 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
The 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
poor 
of 
high 
fuel 
and 
food 
prices, 
the 
financial 
melt-
down 
and 
continuing 
concerns 
about 
energy 
security 
still 
posed 
some 
of 
the 
most 
pressing 
challenges 
that 
the 
world 
had 
to 
confront. 
While 
energy 
demand 
was 
increasing, 
the 
contribution 
of 
some 
primary 
energy 
sources 
to 
climate 
change 
presented 
new 
challenges. 
Energy 
supply 
should 
be 
diversified 
by 
developing 
advanced, 
non-polluting, 
more 
efficient, 
affordable 
and 
cost-effective 
energy 
technologies. 
The 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
power 
technology 
was 
one 
of 
the 
key 
sources 
of 
energy 
security. 
Her 
GovernmentÂs 
vision, 
strategic 
direction 
and 
framework 
for 
climate 
change 
policy, 
which 
covered 
a 
number 
of 
themes, 
had 
recently 
been 
published 
in 
the 
Long-Term 
Mitigation 
Scenarios 
document. 
The 
nuclear 
energy 
policy 
for 
the 
Republic 
of 
South 
Africa 
had 
been 
approved 
in 
June 
2008, 
and 
its 
main 
objectives 
included: 
promoting 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
an 
important 
electricity 
supply 
option 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
industrial 
capability 
for 
the 
design, 
manufacture 
and 
construction 
of

nuclear 
energy 
systems; 
contributing 
to 
the 
national 
programme 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
transformation, 
growth 
and 
development; 
attaining 
global 
leadership 
and 
self-sufficiency 
in 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
sector 
in 
the 
long 
term; 
and 
reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
The 
nuclear 
energy 
policy 
also 
set 
out 
a 
phased 
approach 
for 
the 
management, 
sustainability 
and 
expansion 
of 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
in 
South 
Africa. 
Under 
the 
policy, 
the 
current 
infrastructure 
would 
be 
maintained 
and 
upgraded 
until 
2010, 
when 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
nuclear 
plants 
was 
expected 
to 
commence. 


83. 
An 
extensive 
infrastructure 
was 
required 
for 
South 
AfricaÂs 
planned 
nuclear 
energy 
expansion 
programme. 
However, 
sustaining 
an 
appropriate 
level 
of 
nuclear 
technical 
capacity 
was 
a 
challenge 
globally. 
The 
introduction 
of 
new 
technologies, 
such 
as 
the 
Pebble 
Bed 
Modular 
Reactor, 
the 
proposed 
new 
build 
programme 
and 
the 
resurgence 
in 
uranium 
mining 
would 
result 
in 
increased 
competition 
for 
scarce 
skills. 
South 
Africa 
was 
already 
taking 
action 
to 
enhance 
its 
infrastructure 
with 
regard 
to 
skills, 
engineering 
capacity, 
manufacturing 
and 
regulation. 
In 
that 
regard, 
State-owned 
institutions 
had 
been 
engaged 
in 
strengthening 
national 
capacity 
and 
had 
launched 
a 
number 
of 
strategic 
initiatives. 
In 
addition, 
in 
response 
to 
the 
announced 
nuclear 
expansion 
programme, 
the 
national 
nuclear 
regulator 
had 
developed 
a 
strategy 
for 
the 
licensing 
of 
new 
plants, 
which 
included 
the 
development 
of 
safety 
criteria 
for 
the 
siting 
of 
new 
plants. 
84. 
The 
African 
continent 
had 
demonstrated 
that, 
by 
working 
together, 
much 
could 
be 
achieved 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
AFRA, 
South 
Africa 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
promotion 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
self-reliance 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
It 
had 
also 
taken 
part 
in 
expert 
missions 
in 
African 
Member 
States 
to 
address 
urgent 
needs, 
at 
the 
Member 
StatesÂ 
request. 
The 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Corporation 
of 
South 
Africa 
had 
conducted 
projects 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
conditioning 
and 
repatriation 
of 
spent 
sources. 
85. 
There 
was 
a 
heightened 
need 
to 
use 
regulatory 
forums 
to 
strengthen 
cooperation 
and 
coordination, 
information 
exchange 
and 
best 
practices, 
and 
address 
common 
problems 
within 
the 
African 
continent, 
and 
she 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Forum 
of 
African 
Regulators 
in 
that 
regard. 
86. 
With 
regard 
to 
strengthening 
the 
safety 
effectiveness 
of 
South 
AfricaÂs 
facilities, 
the 
Koeberg 
nuclear 
power 
station, 
owned 
and 
operated 
by 
the 
South 
African 
electricity 
utility 
Eskom, 
was 
now 
in 
its 
twenty-fourth 
year 
of 
safe 
operation. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations 
regarding 
ten-
yearly 
safety 
reviews, 
the 
scope 
for 
the 
second 
ten-year 
safety 
review 
had 
been 
agreed 
between 
Eskom 
and 
the 
national 
nuclear 
regulator 
and 
was 
being 
implemented. 
87. 
Participation 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
conventions 
was 
very 
important 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
through 
the 
process 
of 
peer 
review. 
The 
fourth 
national 
report 
concerning 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
which 
South 
Africa 
had 
submitted 
at 
the 
recent 
review 
meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties, 
held 
in 
Vienna, 
in 
April 
2008, 
had 
been 
well 
received. 
88. 
With 
regard 
to 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
policy 
and 
strategy, 
South 
Africa 
had 
undertaken 
to 
separate 
the 
generator 
of 
waste 
from 
management 
of 
disposal 
by 
establishing 
an 
agency 
to 
manage 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal 
on 
a 
national 
basis. 
The 
South 
African 
Parliament 
had 
recently 
approved 
legislation 
establishing 
the 
South 
African 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Disposal 
Institute, 
which 
would 
become 
operational 
during 
2009. 
South 
AfricaÂs 
report 
on 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
had 
also 
been 
finalized, 
and 
South 
Africa 
looked 
forward 
to 
a 
valuable 
exchange 
of 
information 
and 
experience. 
89. 
South 
Africa 
supported 
the 
current 
initiative 
on 
the 
rationalization 
and 
harmonization 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards, 
and 
continued 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
those 
standards 
by

serving 
in 
various 
capacities 
on 
all 
the 
safety 
standards 
committees. 
There 
should 
be 
greater 
harmonization 
between 
the 
requirements 
related 
to 
safety 
and 
those 
related 
to 
security. 


90. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
to 
address 
the 
challenges 
of 
ensuring 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
enhance 
its 
crucial 
contribution 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
living 
standards 
and 
combating 
poverty, 
which 
would 
strengthen 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
central 
role 
in 
the 
common 
endeavours 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
achieve 
a 
world 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
by 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
would 
also 
need 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
91. 
As 
a 
founding 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
South 
Africa 
had 
decided, 
with 
the 
endorsement 
of 
the 
African 
Union, 
to 
nominate 
Ambassador 
Abdul 
Samad 
Minty, 
a 
seasoned 
diplomat 
with 
decades 
of 
experience 
and 
dedication 
to 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
succeed 
Dr 
ElBaradei 
as 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Since 
South 
AfricaÂs 
democratic 
transformation 
in 
1994, 
it 
was 
the 
first 
time 
that 
a 
South 
African 
candidate 
was 
being 
nominated 
for 
such 
a 
post. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
at 
its 
helm 
a 
good 
manager, 
someone 
with 
integrity, 
fairness, 
experience 
and 
deep 
commitment 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Throughout 
the 
long 
liberation 
struggle 
and 
since 
1994 
South 
Africa 
had 
had 
a 
long 
record 
and 
principled 
position 
on 
advancing 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
Ambassador 
Minty 
had 
played 
a 
pioneering 
role 
in 
that 
regard. 
Africa 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
many 
countries 
all 
over 
the 
world 
believed 
that 
South 
AfricaÂs 
experience 
and 
knowledge 
of 
nuclear 
matters 
enabled 
it 
to 
share 
the 
perspectives 
of 
the 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries 
alike. 
Ambassador 
Minty 
was 
therefore 
eminently 
qualified 
for 
the 
post 
of 
Director 
General 
of 
the 
Agency. 
92. 
Mr 
VITARANA 
(Sri 
Lanka) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
mandate 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
heartening 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
withstood 
many 
of 
the 
pressures 
on 
it 
and 
had 
acted 
in 
an 
impartial 
and 
objective 
manner 
under 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
leadership. 
93. 
As 
the 
era 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
drew 
to 
a 
close 
and 
research 
into 
solar 
and 
other 
sources 
of 
renewable 
energy 
continued, 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
at 
present, 
the 
main, 
established 
technology 
that 
could 
meet 
the 
worldÂs 
increasing 
demands 
for 
power. 
He 
called 
upon 
the 
Agency 
to 
intensify 
its 
research 
in 
the 
promising 
field 
of 
nuclear 
fusion 
and, 
pending 
advances 
in 
that 
area, 
to 
support 
and 
supervise 
countriesÂ 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
using 
fission 
technology 
in 
a 
responsible 
manner. 
He 
urged 
all 
governments 
to 
work 
for 
a 
total 
ban 
on 
the 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT. 
94. 
Technical 
cooperation 
from 
the 
Agency 
had 
enabled 
Sri 
Lanka 
to 
develop 
its 
capacity 
in 
major 
sectors 
such 
as 
industry, 
agriculture, 
human 
health, 
nutrition 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
received 
technical 
assistance 
in 
improving 
the 
micronutrient 
health 
status 
of 
adolescent 
girls 
through 
dietary 
modification 
and 
in 
enhancing 
the 
quality 
of 
radiotherapy 
services. 
Technical 
assistance 
concerning 
the 
molecular 
diagnosis 
of 
major 
infectious 
diseases 
had 
been 
effectively 
utilized 
to 
diagnose 
outbreaks 
of 
diseases 
such 
as 
dengue, 
malaria 
and 
chikungunya. 
He 
commended 
the 
PACT 
programme 
and 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
curb 
and 
reduce 
cancer 
in 
Sri 
Lanka. 
Recalling 
that 
an 
imPACT 
mission 
had 
visited 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
January 
2008 
and 
had 
recognized 
Sri 
Lanka 
as 
a 
PACT 
Model 
Demonstration 
Site, 
he 
said 
that 
his 
Government 
had 
introduced 
a 
mandatory 
cancer 
screening 
programme 
for 
women 
over 
40 
years 
of 
age. 
All 
female 
teachers 
working 
in 
Government 
schools 
had 
already 
been 
screened 
free 
of 
charge. 
The 
Sri 
Lankan 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority 
worked 
closely 
with 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
the 
national 
cancer 
control 
programme 
to 
implement 
the 
recommendations 
given 
by 
the 
imPACT 
mission. 
Sri 
Lanka 
would 
welcome 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
future 
development 
initiatives. 
95. 
Since 
1976, 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
played 
an 
active 
role 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
RCA. 
RCA 
programmes 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
end-user 
oriented 
national 
programmes 
on 
the 
use 
of

nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
healthcare, 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
sectors. 
The 
Government 
required 
further 
technical 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
including 
nuclear 
power 
planning 
in 
view 
of 
the 
current 
energy 
crisis. 


96. 
His 
Government 
wished 
to 
strengthen 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
and 
had 
requested 
a 
visit 
from 
a 
team 
of 
experts 
to 
study 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
practical 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radiological 
materials. 
An 
International 
Nuclear 
Security 
Advisory 
Service 
(INSServ) 
mission 
was 
scheduled 
to 
visit 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
October 
2008. 
97. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
prevent 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
through 
Sri 
Lankan 
ports. 
It 
inspected 
and 
monitored 
radiation 
materials 
and 
adhered 
strictly 
to 
licensing 
procedures 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
such 
materials. 
98. 
His 
Government 
required 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
developing 
national 
capabilities 
to 
respond 
to 
radiological 
emergencies, 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
centre 
for 
environmental 
radiation 
and 
a 
monitoring 
facility. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
four 
countries 
to 
collaborate 
in 
coordinating 
international 
assistance 
in 
the 
event 
of 
radiological 
accidents. 
99. 
While 
noting 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
in 
2007, 
the 
programme 
implementation 
rate 
had 
been 
74.9% 
and 
that 
28.3% 
of 
funds 
had 
been 
allocated 
to 
programmes 
related 
to 
human 
health, 
he 
said 
that 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
the 
triennium 
2009Â2011 
was 
not 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
developing 
countries. 
The 
TCF 
must 
be 
allocated 
sufficient 
and 
predictable 
funds. 
100. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
national 
economic 
development 
was 
a 
major 
area 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activity. 
His 
Government 
had 
signed 
an 
agreement 
with 
an 
Indian 
supplier 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
a 
multipurpose 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility, 
which 
represented 
a 
milestone 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
harness 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
socioeconomic 
development. 
It 
hoped 
for 
Agency 
assistance 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
101. 
His 
country 
had 
met 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
promptly, 
and 
had 
hosted 
three 
international 
events 
related 
to 
Agency 
and 
RCA 
activities. 
It 
had 
sought 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
a 
number 
of 
nationally 
important 
projects 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
the 
period 
2009Â 
2011. 
102. 
The 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/INF/4 
expressed 
diverse 
and 
valuable 
opinions 
about 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
recommendations 
made 
should 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
greater 
discussion 
and 
debate. 
103. 
Mr 
NAMBURETE 
(Mozambique) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
had 
an 
increasing 
role 
to 
play 
in 
tackling 
major 
development 
challenges 
all 
over 
the 
world. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
in 
increasing, 
promoting 
and 
disseminating 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
and 
developmental 
purposes, 
particularly 
within 
the 
context 
of 
developing 
countriesÂ 
endeavours 
to 
eradicate 
poverty 
and 
disease, 
and 
eliminate 
the 
obstacles 
to 
economic, 
technological 
and 
social 
development. 
However, 
strengthened 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
would 
yield 
positive 
results 
only 
if 
the 
technological 
gap 
that 
existed 
between 
developed 
and 
developing 
nations 
was 
removed, 
or 
at 
least, 
narrowed. 
Atoms 
were 
needed 
not 
only 
for 
peace, 
but 
also 
to 
combat 
hunger, 
preventable 
diseases 
and 
poverty, 
and 
above 
all, 
for 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
In 
that 
regard, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuous 
efforts 
to 
support 
developing 
countries 
in 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications, 
and 
commended 
those 
countries 
that 
contributed 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund. 
104. 
Mozambique 
hoped 
that 
the 
five 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
that 
it 
had 
submitted 
for 
the 
period 
2009Â2011, 
which 
would 
contribute 
to 
national 
efforts 
to 
eradicate 
poverty 
and 
promote 
social

and 
economic 
development, 
would 
be 
approved 
by 
the 
Agency. 
The 
good 
interaction 
between 
Agency 
experts 
and 
officials 
from 
Mozambique 
involved 
in 
project 
design 
and 
implementation 
was 
an 
encouraging 
signal 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
positive 
and 
growing 
relationship 
with 
the 
organization. 


105. 
Mozambique 
had 
become 
a 
member 
of 
INIS, 
and 
was 
hopeful 
that 
the 
INIS 
centre 
to 
be 
set 
up 
in 
the 
country 
would 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
capacity 
building 
to 
improve 
knowledge 
and 
information 
on 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
and 
build 
the 
critical 
mass 
that 
the 
country 
required 
for 
its 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development. 
106. 
In 
order 
to 
strengthen 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
including 
at 
the 
regional 
level, 
Mozambique 
was 
at 
a 
very 
advanced 
stage 
in 
the 
process 
of 
joining 
AFRA. 
It 
was 
also 
acceding 
to 
additional 
instruments, 
including 
the 
Assistance 
Convention 
and 
Early 
Notification 
Convention, 
and 
the 
Agreement 
on 
the 
Privileges 
and 
Immunities 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Universalization 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
was 
essential 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
activities, 
and 
Mozambique 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
finalizing 
its 
accession 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 
107. 
Mozambique 
trusted 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
assistance 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
regulatory 
agency 
for 
the 
development 
of 
activities 
involving 
nuclear 
technology. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
forthcoming 
Agency 
mission 
that 
would 
assess 
the 
current 
status 
and 
advise 
the 
Government 
of 
Mozambique 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
institution. 
108. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
brought 
added 
responsibilities 
in 
regard 
to 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
work 
together 
to 
strengthen 
safeguards, 
promote 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
necessary 
balance 
between 
development 
needs 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
on 
the 
other. 
The 
challenges 
posed 
by 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
called 
for 
intensified 
international 
cooperation 
in 
a 
multilateral 
framework. 
To 
that 
end, 
States 
should 
comply 
fully 
with 
their 
legal 
obligations 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
demonstrate 
serious 
political 
will 
and 
commitment. 
109. 
Lastly, 
he 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
support 
for 
the 
candidacy 
of 
Mr 
Minty 
from 
South 
Africa 
for 
the 
office 
of 
Director 
General. 
110. 
Mr 
DILLO 
(Chad) 
said 
that 
since 
Chad 
had 
joined 
the 
Agency 
in 
November 
2005, 
it 
had 
sought 
to 
uphold 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives. 
His 
Government 
remained 
committed 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
and 
to 
ensuring 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
It 
had 
fulfilled 
a 
large 
part 
of 
its 
obligations 
concerning 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and

Working 
Capital 
Fund. 
Moreover, 
the 
national 
authorities 
were 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
signing 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
111. 
In 
Chad, 
activities 
associated 
with 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
were 
still 
at 
an 
embryonic 
stage, 
in 
particular 
the 
national 
radiation 
safety 
structure. 
Special 
attention 
should 
be 
given 
to 
Chad 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
reach 
a 
level 
enjoyed 
by 
other 
countries, 
in 
particular 
with 
regard 
to 
fighting 
cancer 
and 
infectious 
diseases, 
and 
ensuring 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
water 
and 
energy 
resources, 
and 
environmental 
preservation. 
It 
had 
submitted 
four 
project 
concepts 
for 
the 
period 
2009Â2011, 
namely 
a 
concept 
for 
a 
feasibility 
study 
concerning 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
radiotherapy 
centre 
at 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health; 
a 
concept 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
tsetse-free 
zone 
in 
the 
South 
of 
Chad; 
a 
concept 
concerning 
molecular 
techniques 
to 
combat 
malaria; 
and 
a 
concept 
for 
strengthening 
the 
capacities 
of 
the 
national 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructures.

Lastly, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
positive 
comments 
already 
expressed 
at 
the 
Conference 
regarding 
increased 
technical 
assistance 
for 
poorer 
and 
developing 
countries. 
113. 
Mr 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
recalled 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
established 
with 
a 
promotional 
objective, 
as 
stipulated 
in 
its 
Statute, 
and 
not 
with 
regulatory 
and 
verification 
mandates. 
The 
Agency 
had, 
on 
some 
occasions, 
been 
used 
with 
political 
motivation, 
by 
a 
few 
western 
countries 
interfering 
in 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
activities 
and 
undermining 
its 
authority 
and 
impartiality. 
In 
dealing 
with 
the 
Iranian 
issue, 
the 
Agency 
had 
gone 
beyond 
its 
statutory 
mandate, 
turning 
voluntary 
measures 
into 
legal 
obligations, 
and 
threatening 
national 
security 
on 
the 
pretext 
of 
verification. 
That 
could 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
continue, 
and 
he 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
remain 
vigilant 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
trend 
towards 
a 
shift 
from 
the 
spirit 
and 
letter 
of 
the 
Statute. 
114. 
Turning 
to 
Iranian 
nuclear 
policy 
and 
activities, 
he 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
embarking 
on 
a 
well-defined 
long-term 
nuclear 
energy 
plan. 
With 
an 
annual 
economic 
growth 
of 
6Â8% 
and 
speedy 
industrial 
development, 
some 
4000 
to 
6000 
MW(e) 
had 
to 
be 
added 
to 
the 
national 
grid 
annually. 
That 
requirement 
should 
surely 
be 
met 
in 
part 
using 
nuclear 
power, 
in 
view 
of 
environmental 
advantages 
and 
the 
limited 
capacity 
of 
other 
sources 
of 
energy. 
His 
Government 
had 
been 
entrusted 
to 
take 
serious 
steps 
for 
the 
production 
of 
2000 
MW(e) 
from 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
over 
the 
next 
20 
years, 
and 
potential 
international 
suppliers 
were 
invited 
to 
submit 
bids 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
that 
goal. 
Following 
an 
international 
tender, 
some 
companies 
had 
recently 
been 
chosen 
to 
begin 
site 
selection 
for 
future 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Intensive 
work 
had 
also 
commenced 
to 
design 
a 
360 
MW 
light 
water 
power 
plant. 
115. 
The 
Bushehr 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
supposed 
to 
have 
become 
operational 
almost 
three 
decades 
earlier. 
However, 
because 
of 
the 
western 
supplierÂs 
failure 
to 
meet 
its 
contractual 
and 
legal 
obligations, 
the 
project 
remained 
unfinished, 
and 
Iran 
had 
not 
received 
compensation 
for 
damages. 
116. 
Unjustified, 
unprecedented 
measures, 
such 
as 
the 
suspension 
of 
enrichment 
activities 
and 
robust 
verification 
measures 
beyond 
those 
stipulated 
in 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
had 
inflicted 
huge 
damage 
on 
Iran 
in 
terms 
of 
security, 
credibility 
and 
finances. 
Iran 
was 
determined 
to 
pursue 
the 
process 
for 
compensation. 
117. 
The 
absence 
of 
an 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
concern. 
In 
order 
to 
overcome 
the 
lack 
of 
confidence 
that 
existed 
among 
potential 
suppliers 
to 
Iran, 
a 
law 
had 
been 
passed 
enabling 
the 
Atomic 
Energy 
Organization 
of 
Iran 
to 
embark 
on 
indigenous 
enrichment 
for 
low-enriched 
uranium 
in 
order 
to 
fulfil 
part 
of 
the 
fuel 
requirement 
for 
its 
light 
water 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Iran 
had 
also 
taken 
serious 
steps 
in 
all 
parts 
of 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
including 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
Saghand 
and 
Gachin 
mines, 
uranium 
enrichment 
at 
Natanz, 
and 
the 
fuel 
fabrication 
plant 
that 
was 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
construction. 
118. 
Discussions 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
must 
take 
into 
account 
the 
concerns 
of 
developing 
countries, 
and 
any 
decisions 
on 
the 
subject 
must 
be 
taken 
by 
consensus 
without 
prejudice 
to 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
choose 
their 
own 
fuel 
options. 
Iran 
endorsed 
the 
views 
expressed 
in 
that 
regard 
by 
NAM 
and 
the 
G-77 
and 
China. 
119. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
principles 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
His 
Government 
remained 
seriously 
concerned 
regarding 
the 
non-compliance 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
spirit 
and 
letter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
The 
Agency 
should 
report 
on 
the 
latest 
situation 
regarding 
the 
non-compliance 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
France 
with 
Article 
I 
of 
the 
NPT, 
in 
accordance 
with 
which 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
Parties 
undertook 
not 
to 
transfer 
to 
any 
recipient 
whatsoever 
nuclear 
weapons 
or 
other 
nuclear 
explosive 
devices. 
His 
delegation 
had 
repeatedly 
requested 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
report 
on 
the 
nuclear 
capabilities 
of 
Israel 
by 
sending 
inspectors 
on 
a 
fact-finding 
mission.

The 
shameful 
silence 
of 
the 
western 
powers 
on 
the 
acknowledgement 
by 
Israel 
of 
its 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
IsraelÂs 
military 
aggression 
against 
other 
Member 
States 
left 
no 
doubt 
about 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
a 
reform 
in 
the 
United 
Nations, 
particularly 
the 
Security 
Council. 


120. 
Following 
robust 
inspections, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
repeatedly 
reported 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
not 
found 
any 
evidence 
in 
Iran 
of 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
activities 
to 
prohibited 
purposes. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
was 
determined 
to 
continue 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement. 
The 
illegal 
and 
unjustified 
involvement 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
would 
have 
no 
effect 
on 
IranÂs 
determination 
to 
pursue 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities, 
including 
enrichment. 
The 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
on 
punitive 
measures, 
such 
as 
sanctions, 
would 
strengthen 
IranÂs 
determination 
to 
pursue 
its 
righteous 
path 
and 
would 
create 
obstacles 
for 
the 
negotiations 
that 
Iran 
had 
initiated 
and 
had 
always 
advised 
other 
parties 
to 
enter 
into 
without 
precondition 
or 
delay.

7. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/9) 
1. Mr PARK Jong Koo (Republic of Korea) said that many countries had realized that nuclear 
energy was the only viable option for meeting the growing demands for fuel while addressing 
environmental concerns. Countries already operating nuclear power plants were seeking to expand 
existing programmes, while others with no past interest in nuclear energy were rethinking their policy 
and were turning their attention to nuclear technology. That trend clearly testified to the importance of 
nuclear energy now and in years to come. 
2. Aware of the significance of nuclear energy as a future energy source, the Republic of Korea 
had steadily increased its nuclear power activities since the first oil shock in the 1970s. The 20 nuclear 
power plants built since 1978 now met approximately 40% of the countryÂs electricity needs. Eight 
more plants would be in operation by 2016. His Government was also considering the construction of 
ten additional plants by 2030, each with a capacity of 1400 MW(e). Two next-generation advanced 
power reactors (APR-1400) Â which were safer and more economically efficient than the current 
Korean standard model OPR-1000 Â were currently under construction. In 2007, the Government had 
also approved the continuing operation of Kori-1 for a further ten years. 
3. Before any nuclear power programme could begin, infrastructure should be developed to ensure 
nuclear non-proliferation, safety and security. The AgencyÂs role in that regard had grown in 
importance. His Government noted with appreciation that the Agency had recently launched a project 
to assist infrastructure development in emerging nuclear energy countries, and welcomed the report of 
the Commission of Eminent Persons on the Future of the Agency. The Republic of Korea intended to 
cooperate actively with other Member States to share its 30 years of experience in designing and 
operating nuclear reactors. 
4. The Republic of Korea planned to design and initiate a long-term R&D programme entitled the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Action Plan for the Future by the end of the year as a means of promoting the 
expanded use of nuclear energy and meeting domestic energy demands. 
5. It was of the utmost importance for countries developing nuclear energy to participate in 
bilateral and multilateral efforts, and to share information and experience through international bodies 
in order to increase efficiency in terms of time and budget and reduce the risk associated with the 
introduction of nuclear energy. The Republic of Korea had been participating actively in the 
development of future nuclear energy systems such as the GIF, INPRO and the GNEP. It had also 
been working closely with the Agency since 2005 in operating a regional office for the RCA and 
conducting joint research and development programmes. 
6. Research and development on radiation technology had been moving ahead all over the world. 
In 2008, the Republic of Korea had hosted the Sixth International Conference on Isotopes, at which 
some 1000 experts from 35 countries had shared their knowledge and experience, and discussed ways 
of applying radiation technology to agriculture, medicine and industry. The Republic of Korea planned 
to promote the sustainable development of radiation so as to improve public health and quality of life. 
7. In view of the expanded use of nuclear energy, it was more important than ever to strengthen 
nuclear non-proliferation and tighten security measures. Given the urgent and grave challenges posed 
by nuclear proliferation and illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material, it was crucial to ensure 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
2 


universal adherence to and compliance with the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement and 
its additional protocol. His delegation called upon those States that had not signed and ratified or 
acceded to the comprehensive safeguards agreement and the additional protocol to do so at the earliest 
possible date. It welcomed the safeguards agreement concluded between the Agency and India and 
looked forward to its early entry into force, so that India could revitalize its nuclear activities in a 
peaceful manner. 

8. For the Republic of Korea, promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy was an ongoing 
policy which had top priority. In 1992, his Government had signed the Joint Declaration of the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and in 2004 it had proclaimed the four principles for the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, making a full commitment to non-proliferation. The Republic of Korea 
carefully implemented its comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, and his 
Government had also sought to strengthen the legal and institutional framework in order to reinforce 
the national nuclear energy control system. On 4 June 2008, the Board of Governors had recognized 
South KoreaÂs nuclear transparency by drawing the broader safeguards conclusion, and integrated 
safeguards had been applied in the Republic of Korea since July 2008. His delegation expressed 
appreciation to the Agency and the Member States for their support and cooperation in that regard. His 
Government had amended legislation of relevance to the performance of its nuclear regulatory 
activities under integrated safeguards. 
9. A peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue was vital to securing lasting peace and 
prosperity on the Korean Peninsula and in North East Asia and to maintaining the integrity of the nonproliferation 
regime. The Republic of Korea expressed serious concern over the DPRKÂs move to 
restart the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, including the reprocessing plant, and urged the DPRK to 
resume the disablement measures without delay. It hoped that the DPRK would fully implement its 
commitment to abandon all its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes and return to the 
NPT and to Agency safeguards at an early date, in accordance with the Joint Statement of the six-party 
talks of September 2005. The Agency would have an important role to play in that process, based on 
its expertise and experience in promoting non-proliferation and nuclear transparency, and his 
Government requested the continued support of Member States to achieve the denuclearization of the 
DPRK within the framework of the six-party talks. 
10. The peaceful use of nuclear energy should be based on safety and transparency. The Republic of 
Korea had complied in good faith with the terms of international treaties, standards and guidelines 
related to nuclear safety and security. His Government had had an exchange of views on the 
enhancement of international nuclear safety at the Fourth Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April 2008. It would cooperate in full in Agency activities 
aimed at securing nuclear safety and enhancing nuclear transparency throughout the world. His 
country had also welcomed the standards and preconditions required in connection with the overall 
safety review by OSART. 
11. With the AgencyÂs cooperation, the International Nuclear Safety School had been opened in the 
Republic of Korea to share with others the nationÂs advanced nuclear safety control technology and 
experience in all stages of nuclear power plant construction. Plans were being developed to set up onthe-
job training for each phase of construction for those nations that were starting or building new 
nuclear power plants. Additionally, an international training programme would be run in cooperation 
with national universities. His delegation hoped for interest and participation in that endeavour. 
12. In celebration of the 30th anniversary of the operation of Kori-1, the countryÂs first nuclear 
power plant, his Government had organized the Special Safety Review Team in 2008 to examine ways 
of improving safety, thereby demonstrating that nuclear safety had top priority for his country. Over 
the previous 30 years, the Republic of Korea had laid a sound foundation for the safe and secure 

GC(52)/OR.3

development of nuclear technology. Drawing on its experience, the Republic of Korea would enhance 
its nuclear energy capability by developing future nuclear technology with an even greater emphasis 
on non-proliferation, safety and economic efficiency, and by establishing an advanced safety 
regulatory system. In the decades ahead, it would further strengthen its relations with the Agency and 
Member States in order to promote the peaceful use of nuclear power. 

13. Mr KYRLE (Austria) said that, in the past year, the Agency had again demonstrated its 
reliability and efficiency on the international scene and reinforced its position as an indispensable 
institution in the global security architecture. More than ever, the international community needed 
institutions such as the Agency that contributed to building international confidence. Construction of 
numerous nuclear power plants was planned for the decades to come and many experts predicted a 
long-term renaissance of nuclear energy. Such a development would pose serious challenges for the 
international community and a thoughtful examination of those challenges and their implications for 
the AgencyÂs future work was thus urgently required. In that context, Austria thanked the Director 
General for having launched a timely discussion on the future of the Agency earlier in 2008, and took 
note of the background report by the Director General entitled 20/20 Vision for the Future and the 
subsequent report by the Commission of Eminent Persons. 
14. Austria was one of those countries to believe that the risks of nuclear energy far outweighed its 
advantages: in view of the high environmental and financial costs over time and the lack of a 
sustainable solution to the nuclear waste problem, nuclear energy could not make a sustainable 
contribution to the efforts to combat climate change. Nevertheless, Austria was aware of the global 
rise in energy demand and recognized the right of every State to choose its own energy mix. However 
the use of nuclear power for energy purposes was assessed, Member States should be united in 
urgently addressing and preventing: the potential misuse or careless use of nuclear technology; the 
risks of proliferation connected to the spread of nuclear technology; the existence of clandestine 
supplier networks; the production of dirty bombs by terrorists; the clandestine development of WMD 
programmes; and nuclear accidents. It must be the absolute priority of not only the Agency, but also of 
Member States, to deal with those challenges, in particular by: strengthening and universally 
implementing the AgencyÂs safeguards system, including the additional protocol; implementing and 
developing the most stringent security and safety tools; and advancing the multilateralization of the 
nuclear fuel cycle. 
15. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was an indispensable part of the international nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. Repeated cases of clandestine nuclear programmes that had gone undetected by 
traditional safeguards measures had demonstrated the need for a strengthened safeguards system. It 
was of the utmost importance for the Agency to be able to draw safeguards conclusions regarding the 
peaceful use of all nuclear material in States. The additional protocol provided the Agency with a 
much more complete insight into StatesÂ nuclear programmes, thereby making detection of clandestine 
activities possible. Austria therefore continued strongly to advocate adherence to the additional 
protocol, and called on all States to negotiate and conclude protocols additional to their safeguards 
agreements without further delay. In AustriaÂs view, the conclusion of an additional protocol was a 
legal obligation for non-nuclear-weapon States party to the NPT. It was pleased to note that the 
number of additional protocols continued to rise steadily, and welcomed the forthcoming conclusion 
of additional protocols with Iraq, Lesotho and Qatar. Nevertheless, progress remained too slow, since 
a number of important goals associated with the implementation of the additional protocol would only 
be realized once the system was universally applied. What is more, a number of non-nuclear-weapon 
States had still not even concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement. 
16. The international communityÂs vigilance with regard to nuclear safety and security was vital for 
protecting populations and the environment from exposure to harmful radiation. The AgencyÂs 
assistance to countries in upgrading nuclear safety and security and preparing for and responding to

emergencies therefore remained of utmost importance. The international community must remain alert 
to the potential of terrorists targeting nuclear facilities or using radioactive sources to incite panic, 
contaminate property and even cause the injury or death of civilians. In the twelve months leading up 
30 June 2008, 21 of the 243 incidents reported to the AgencyÂs Illicit Trafficking Database had 
involved the theft or loss of material that was not subsequently recovered. As radiation knew no 
frontiers, the security of nuclear material and facilities was a legitimate concern of all States, and 
countries must continue to demonstrate that strong security systems were in place. Austria commended 
the Agency for its efforts to implement the Nuclear Security Plan for 2006-2009. It looked forward to 
continuing activities in that regard, in particular in the context of the Nuclear Security Plan 2010-2013, 
and encouraged the Agency to continue cooperating with international nuclear-security-related 
initiatives, including the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 

17. Austria welcomed the Director GeneralÂs report on measures to strengthen international 
cooperation in nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste management contained in document 
GC(52)/2. In the field of nuclear safety, Austria welcomed the performance of the AgencyÂs SCART. 
However, recurring events in Europe and worldwide indicated that the safety culture was deteriorating 
in both operating organizations and in regulatory oversight. That was a cause of concern, and his 
delegation urged the Agency to increase its activities in that respect. It looked forward to the 
implementation of measures within the global nuclear safety regime, as proposed by INSAG, but was 
concerned that, after fifty years Agency safety standards were still not fully applied by the entire 
nuclear community. Austria therefore supported the AgencyÂs sustained efforts to ensure that all safety 
standards were applied in full, and encouraged the development of safety guidelines for nuclear 
installations other than nuclear power plants. His country was also concerned by moves to downgrade 
Agency safety standards from the highest to the average level. Those safety standards must continue to 
reflect the best international practices in order to serve as benchmarks for the highest level of nuclear 
safety. 
18. With regard to existing conventions dealing with liability for nuclear damage, he reiterated two 
of AustriaÂs major concerns: first, that the maximum liability amounts provided would be completely 
insufficient in the case of a major accident; and second, that the channelling of liability according to 
which only operators, not suppliers, could be held liable seemed inadequate. It was to be hoped that 
the ongoing discussions would focus more on potential damages and victims rather than on the interest 
of related industries and eventually lead to fair, obligatory, unlimited liability. 
19. The pressing issue of nuclear proliferation dominated political debate and was a major challenge 
for the international community. In her welcoming address to the previous session of the General 
Conference, AustriaÂs Foreign Minister Plassnik had called for a revitalization of the vision of a 
nuclear fuel cycle under multilateral control as one possible solution. Austria had since participated in 
the respective discussions in the Agency and continued to maintain that a multilateral approach could 
make a crucial contribution to overcoming international tensions regarding the potential misuse of 
sensitive technology. The long-term goal must be a new multilateral framework for nuclear energy 
that would eventually include converting enrichment and reprocessing facilities from national to 
multilateral operations and limiting such facilities to exclusively multilateral operations. 
20. No distinction should be made between the ÂhavesÂ and the Âhave-notsÂ, only between the 
ÂwantsÂ and the Âwant-notsÂ. For those that had chosen nuclear energy, access to nuclear fuel should be 
a strictly regulated but impartial and fair exercise. The creation of an international fuel reserve under 
the auspices of the Agency could be the first step in that approach. Austria intended to present a 
detailed outline of its proposal later in 2008. 
21. Over the 50 previous years, the Agency had made a vital contribution to many important 
projects related to the development agenda, including in the areas of increasing food production, 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30

fighting diseases and managing groundwater resources. Those activities were vitally important to 
many nations around the globe, and his Government had decided to contribute to the TCF for 2009, 
subject to budgetary authorization. The work of the Joint Division had been of great value to Member 
States, and Austria continued to hope that the FAO would not end its involvement in that Division. 

22. Austria was ready to work with other Member States and the Agency on a strategy to enable the 
Agency to deal with the many challenges ahead in the best possible manner. With political 
determination, openness to new multilateral partnerships and the reliable, trusted help of the Agency, 
his country was confident that progress could be made. 
23. Mr OMER (Sudan) stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs role not only in applying the 
safeguards regime and in creating nuclear-weapon-free zones but also in promoting nuclear energy as 
an option available to all Member States. 
24. He was pleased to announce that Sudan had ratified the amendment to Article VI of the 
AgencyÂs Statute. It had also signed the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Convention on Early 
Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear 
Accident or Radiological Emergency, and was taking steps to ensure their early ratification. 
25. Sudan was drafting a law on nuclear energy based on the AgencyÂs guidelines. An important 
aspect of the legislation was the clear-cut distinction it made between the regulatory authority and 
users of radiation for different purposes. 
26. Sudan was keen to use nuclear energy for electricity generation and hoped it could count on the 
AgencyÂs support in that regard. The Ministry of Energy and Mining had set up a national committee 
to undertake a feasibility study, and permission had been given for the establishment in the Ministry of 
a unit to implement a nuclear reactor project. 
27. Major progress had been made under the AFRA Agreement in the areas of food security, health 
and therapy, and the development of human resources. He also commended the regional projects 
implemented with Agency support and the coordination of activities involving the application of 
nuclear technology. Sudan had hosted the first African Conference on Clinical Nuclear Medicine and 
Medical Physics, which had attracted experts from more than 30 African countries. The Conference 
had emphasized the need for Africa to introduce advanced nuclear technology and to develop human 
resources in the area of medical physics. He was pleased to announce that the Sudan Academy of 
Sciences was launching a masterÂs programme in medical physics, which it hoped would shortly 
acquire the status of a regional programme. 
28. He called for support for the recommendations of the AFRA Regional High Level Policy 
Review Seminar held in Aswan, Egypt, in December 2007. The Aswan Declaration advocated closer 
cooperation among African countries, on the one hand, and between the Agency and African countries 
in the context of AFRA, on the other. He urged African States to allocate more budgetary funds to 
national science and technology programmes, to set up an AFRA fund for the development of science 
and technology in Africa, to build a national radiation safety infrastructure, and to comply with 
international waste disposal regulations. 
29. He commended the AgencyÂs increased support for technical cooperation activities, especially 
those pertaining to nuclear science and technology and their applications. There was an urgent need 
for joint action to develop the AgencyÂs water management programme, its programme for using small 
and medium-sized nuclear reactors to produce drinking water and the PACT programme, and to 
support its campaign to eradicate the tsetse fly in African countries. 
30. Isotopic studies in hydrology could lead to the identification of groundwater sources and could 
determine the relationship between such sources and surface water and rainwater, thereby ascertaining 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
6 


the quality of the water and ways of exploiting it, particularly in semi-arid regions such as sub-Saharan 
Africa. 

31. The Darfur problem was basically one of competition for limited rainwater resources, which had 
led to friction between pastoralists and farmers in the region. The problem could be solved in the long 
term by providing the people of Darfur with an adequate water supply. Fortunately, such a supply was 
available in the Nubian sandstone aquifer and other aquifers in the region. In that context, he drew 
attention to an Agency-supported joint project involving Sudan, Egypt, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya 
and Chad for the sustainable development of the Nubian sandstone aquifer, and a regional project to 
incorporate groundwater resources into the integrated Nile Basin water management programme. All 
such studies and projects made a direct contribution to national and regional peace and stability. He 
therefore called on the Agency to provide the resources and technical support required for their 
expansion. 
32. In general, he urged the Agency and its Member States to provide more financial resources for 
the technical cooperation programme, which was no less important than the implementation of 
safeguards agreements, verification activities and nuclear disarmament. While praising the work of the 
Commission of Eminent Persons on the AgencyÂs future role, he stressed the need for balance between 
the AgencyÂs activities so that all Member States could develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy and 
acquire the necessary skills. He further noted that responsibility for taking crucial decisions on how 
the Agency could best meet future challenges lay with the Member States. 
33. With regard to the AgencyÂs role in promoting international peace and security, he called on the 
international community to cure itself of its addiction to double standards by adopting policies based 
on fairness and equality. All Member States were aware of the nuclear proliferation threat in the 
Middle East region. Sudan shared the concern of Arab and other States about Israeli nuclear 
programmes, all of which escaped Agency supervision. He called on Israel to accede forthwith to the 
NPT and to place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. At the same time, Sudan supported 
the right of every country, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, to implement a nuclear programme 
for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of the NPT. In that context, he welcomed 
current cooperation between Iran and the Agency with a view to resolving the issue once and for all. 
34. Mr LÃDEKING (Germany) said that the background report by the Director General entitled 
20/20 Vision for the Future and the report by the Commission of Eminent Persons on the future of the 
Agency provided a number of valuable suggestions and insights, and Germany was ready to enter into 
focused and constructive discussion of the issues raised in those documents. It was clear that the 
Agency would have a key role to play, since a substantial increase in the use of nuclear energy could 
be expected in the decades to come. While the AgencyÂs current mandate was sufficiently broad and 
flexible to cover those future tasks, he said that financial implications must be borne in mind in 
determining the AgencyÂs future role. 
35. He hoped that the safeguards agreement concluded between India and the Agency would bring 
that country closer to the non-proliferation regime. GermanyÂs consent to the decisions of the Agency 
and the NSG was based on the premise that India would allow Agency safeguards to be applied to its 
civil nuclear facilities, as it had announced, and that it would refrain from any proliferation of sensitive 
technologies and from nuclear weapons tests. He called on India to accede to the CTBT, stop the 
production of fissile material for military purposes and commit unequivocally to nuclear disarmament. 
36. In the five years since it had become clear that Iran had been pursuing undeclared nuclear 
activities, the Agency had succeeded in clarifying a number of various open questions with respect to 
IranÂs nuclear programme. However, some questions relating to a possible military dimension needed 
to be clarified. Since Iran was not implementing the additional protocol, the Agency was unable to 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
7 


provide assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear activities and could not confirm the 
exclusively peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. It was deeply regrettable that Iran had 
not suspended sensitive nuclear activities despite calls from the Security Council to do so, thereby 
further increasing the lack of trust regarding its intentions. In June 2008, China, France, Germany, 
Russia the United Kingdom, and the United States had presented Iran with new proposals aimed 
facilitating negotiations, but had not yet received a clear answer. The six countries remained 
convinced that a solution must be achieved through negotiation, and were determined to continue their 
dual track approach. Recalling Security Council resolution 1835 (2008), which underlined the 
unwavering resolve and unity of the international community in the face of Iranian non-compliance 
and defiance, he said that Iran must fulfil its international obligations without exception or delay. 

37. The nuclear crisis on the North Korean peninsula remained a further source of serious 
international concern. While Germany welcomed the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, it 
deplored the fact that the denuclearization process had been halted recently with the removal of 
Agency inspectors from the Yongbyon facilities, and the announcement of plans to reintroduce nuclear 
material. Germany called on the DPRK to return to the six-party talks process. The DPRK must 
comply fully with its obligations and place all its nuclear activities under Agency safeguards. 
38. The lack of cooperation by the Syrian authorities concerning the alleged nuclear reactor in Al 
Kibar was cause for concern, and he called on Syria to cooperate fully with the Agency to clarify the 
issue. Such developments confirmed the need for an effective and efficient safeguards regime; 
comprehensive safeguards agreements together with the additional protocol must constitute the 
relevant verification standard. 
39. The prospect of rising demand for nuclear fuel, the high importance of its secure supply and the 
imminent proliferation risk associated with fuel cycle technologies had led to a growing debate on 
multilateral approaches. Germany agreed that any such mechanism should be non-discriminatory and 
available to all States that complied with their safeguards obligations. Germany welcomed the various 
proposals made on the issue, and had devised its own proposal for a Multilateral Enrichment 
Sanctuary Project, which it would continue to develop in consultation with interested States and the 
Agency. 
40. The 2005 amendments to the CPPNM made an important contribution to the global prevention 
of criminal acts involving nuclear materials. Germany had enacted the legal provisions required for 
ratification in June 2008. 
41. The AgencyÂs valuable assistance to Member States within the framework of the technical 
cooperation programme had led to noticeable improvements in important areas like health, water 
management, agriculture and environmental protection. Germany remained committed to supporting 
the AgencyÂs efforts in that regard. 
42. Ms KOSGEIZ (Kenya) said that the Annual Report for 2007 contained in document GC(52)/9 
reaffirmed the value of the tasks carried out by the Agency in many areas, including human health, 
water resources, industrial development and nuclear security. The safeguards and verification aspects 
of the AgencyÂs work attested to the importance of its vigilance and to its solid contribution to the 
maintenance of international peace and security. 
43. Kenya strongly supported the right of all States to have full use of nuclear technology and 
scientific applications as provided for in the NPT. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in 
Kenya had contributed significantly to the GovernmentÂs efforts towards developing the nuclear 
science and technology infrastructure. Kenya was in the process of developing a new CPF for the 
period 2011Â2016. It was participating in 11 national projects and 53 regional or interregional projects 

GC(52)/OR.3

covering human resources development, human health, agriculture, livestock production, industrial 
applications, energy planning, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. 

44. Kenyan scientists were pioneers of plant breeding for the development of crops essential to food 
security. A new variety of early maturing, high-yielding, drought-resistant wheat that had been 
developed using nuclear techniques was a tangible example of the success of the technical cooperation 
programme in Kenya, and a concrete manifestation of the AgencyÂs work in addressing the global 
food crisis. 
45. With reference to global efforts aimed at protecting against nuclear terrorism and nuclear 
proliferation, he said the Agency was in the process of upgrading the physical security for Category 1 
sources at research institutions in Kenya as a result of an IRRS mission. Kenya had specifically 
created security agencies with highly trained personnel to combat crime related to nuclear terrorism 
and had hosted regional training courses on information systems for combating illicit trafficking of 
nuclear and radioactive materials. 
46. Through increased manpower and radiation detection equipment, KenyaÂs competent authority 
had opened additional regional offices and had adopted the AgencyÂs Regulatory Authority 
Information System software for the control of radiation sources. An amendment proposing the 
autonomy of the Radiation Protection Board in line with the International Basic Safety Standards for 
Protection against Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources was now going through 
the countryÂs legislative processes. 
47. The AgencyÂs continued efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security in the transportation of 
radioactive sources and waste management were commendable. Kenya had improved its capability to 
detect the illicit trafficking of radioactive and nuclear materials through the training of border 
personnel and provision of radiation detectors. 
48. KenyaÂs accession to the Joint Convention was at an advanced stage. The designs for a central 
radioactive waste processing facility took into account the AgencyÂs Radioactive Waste Safety 
Standards and Principles of Radioactive Waste Management, and his Government had allocated US$ 
480 000 for the first phase of the project. The facility would also be used for the processing and safe 
storage of orphan sources and illicitly trafficked nuclear and radioactive materials. Kenya invited 
regional and international development partners to provide support in the full realization of that 
project. 
49. Energy was crucial not only to achieving the Millennium Development Goals but also to 
spurring national development and economic growth. Nuclear power could make a major contribution 
to meeting energy needs and sustaining KenyaÂs development in the twenty-first century. The 
Government was inviting assistance in the development of nuclear power plants in order to add 1000 
MW immediately to the current energy mix and significantly more capacity for the future, thus greatly 
reducing over-reliance on fossil fuels and biomass, and contributing to the protection of the 
environment. 
50. Tsetse and trypanosomosis posed a major threat to Kenyan communities and were a constraint 
to livestock production. The AgencyÂs provision of a gamma irradiator had made it possible to 
improve the mass-rearing of sterile males for the SIT, a technique to be applied by PATTEC in the 
final phases of the eradication of tsetse flies in Kenya and the region. 
51. In the area of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine, projects concerning the expansion of 
radiotherapy services and the improvement of the nuclear medicine service had been given high 
priority. Kenya commended the Agency for establishing PACT, under which radiotherapy services at 

GC(52)/OR.3

Kenyatta Hospital and Nyanza General Hospital were being modernized and expanded. Such services 
would be spread to cover other hospitals across the country. 

52. Skills development in the field of nuclear science and technology was crucial. Kenyan 
universities had been collaborating with the Agency in developing curricula in nuclear technology. 
The training courses, fellowships, scientific visits, expert missions and equipment provided by the 
Agency to Kenyan institutions were highly appreciated. Kenya supported technical cooperation for the 
2009Â2011 programme cycle within the framework of AFRA, and appreciated the efforts made in 
addressing the problems of the AFRA Member States. Kenya pledged its full share of the TCF target 
for 2009, and remained fully committed to supporting the work of the Agency. 
53. Mr YOUNIS (Egypt) said that Egypt had been cooperating closely with the Agency for more 
than fifty years on developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and noted that technical cooperation 
activities in his country covered areas such as the efficient use of research reactors and the training of 
human resources to operate such reactors and related facilities. 
54. As water shortages and poor water quality were major challenges in many countries, it was 
essential to study the impact of climate change on water resources to assist the countries concerned in 
water resource management. The Agency had been helping the countries of the Nile Basin, including 
Egypt, to assess groundwater replenishment from rainwater and surface water, and to detect sources of 
pollution. Egypt had been working closely with the Agency on water resource development and the 
use of isotope technology, particularly on a project for the integrated management of the Nubian 
sandstone aquifer. 
55. Egypt also continued to cooperate with the Agency on enhancing the quality of agricultural 
output through the use of gamma radiation to produce high-yield mutant crop varieties and the 
application of nuclear technology in the farming of desert regions, for instance through the use of an 
electronic accelerator to produce agricultural hydrogel from polymerized materials with a high 
moisture absorption capacity. 
56. Cooperation on the integrated management of radiation sources included a project to establish a 
database of depleted radiation sources in Egypt, the introduction of regulations to ensure high-quality 
management of radioactive waste, and the training of human resources to deal with any accident that 
might occur during the use, transport or storage of such waste. 
57. On 12 December 2006, President Mubarak had inaugurated a new stage in EgyptÂs use of 
nuclear energy as a strategic option for electricity generation and had launched a public dialogue on 
the subject. Egypt was cooperating with the Agency on the preparation of the necessary studies. An 
integrated cooperation plan had been drawn up with Egyptian experts with a view to assessing the 
required infrastructure and ways and means of putting it in place. It also covered support for the 
drafting of legislation pursuant to which an independent nuclear safety body would be established in 
accordance with international standards. In the light of the outcome of the studies and public dialogue, 
President Mubarak had announced on 29 October 2007 the strategic decision to build a number of 
nuclear power plants. Work on building the first plant would begin shortly in cooperation with 
international companies and the Agency. Egypt had called for tenders from international consultancy 
firms in February 2008 and had received seven bids, which were currently being assessed. Its 
cooperation with the Agency would ensure the transparency and efficiency of the project and would 
assist the authorities in restructuring nuclear bodies and the nuclear safety regime and in training 
human resources. 
58. Egypt supported plans to enhance the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme and to focus on projects having a tangible yield and an end-user. It also supported the idea 
of early consultations with Member States on project details, the preparation of a future project 

GC(52)/OR.3

10 


framework for each State, and the establishment of guidelines for national focal points in order to 
improve the quality of communication between stakeholders and the Secretariat. He emphasized, 
however, the need to ensure that the resources available for technical cooperation matched 
requirements, and kept pace with the ever-increasing appropriations for other Agency activities. The 
voluntary nature of contributions to the TCF was a major obstacle to efficient programme planning, 
and serious steps should be taken to remedy that shortcoming. 

59. The Agency should also seek to devise new arrangements that would ensure a fairer 
apportionment of the mounting costs of implementing safeguards. The wide gap in the approach to 
financing technical cooperation activities, on the one hand, and safeguards, on the other, raised basic 
questions about the AgencyÂs priorities. 
60. Egypt had opened up its facilities and reactors and shared its experience in peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy with other Arab and African countries. It strongly supported a whole range of projects 
under the AFRA Agreement. Moreover, it had hosted the AFRA Regional High Level Policy Review 
Seminar from 25 to 29 December 2007 in the city of Aswan. The Seminar, which was organized in 
cooperation with the Agency, had been attended by representatives of 32 African States in addition to 
Egypt, and had provided an opportunity to review AFRAÂs achievements and launch a dialogue on its 
strategic aims. 
61. The existing safeguards regime failed to ensure nuclear non-proliferation because 
comprehensive safeguards were not applied to States that had not acceded to the NPT, and because no 
serious steps had been taken by the five nuclear-weapon States to comply with Article VI of the Treaty 
concerning disarmament. It was essential to ensure the universality of the NPT and to apply 
comprehensive safeguards agreements to nuclear facilities in all nations of the world. Referring to 
continuing attempts to universalize the additional protocol and turn it into the prevailing standard for 
verification of the non-existence of undeclared nuclear activities, he reaffirmed EgyptÂs position that 
the additional protocol was an optional instrument whose implementation depended on a sovereign 
decision by Member States. No attempt should be made to universalize it until comprehensive 
safeguards agreements had been universalized. 
62. He expressed concern at the AgencyÂs diminishing role in supporting the international 
communityÂs efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament, although the Medium-Term Strategy for the 
period 2006Â2011 included among the goals of verification that the Agency should participate, as 
appropriate, in nuclear arms reduction and disarmament initiatives, in accordance with Article II of its 
Statute. He urged all States to address the issue with the requisite vigour. 
63. The current status of the non-proliferation and disarmament regime in the Middle East posed a 
serious threat to both regional and international security. Although 16 years had passed since the 
adoption by the General Conference of a resolution calling on all States in the Middle East to apply 
comprehensive safeguards, Israel had still failed to take any steps towards achieving that goal. The 
great powers had also failed to take action, although Egypt and all other Member States in the region 
had ratified the NPT and were implementing safeguards. As a result, the entire region was being 
drawn into an arms race because the continued possession by a single State of a huge arsenal of 
weapons of mass destruction gave the other countries of the region the right to seek means of 
countering the threat. The AgencyÂs credibility depended to a large extent on the seriousness with 
which its Member States sought to achieve an aim, the importance of which was a matter of 
consensus. The Conference must reaffirm the responsibility of the Agency, as the executive arm of the 
non-proliferation and disarmament regime, to deal fairly and in a balanced manner with the draft 
resolutions relating to the nuclear threat in the Middle East. Egypt had again sponsored a draft 
resolution, which had been adopted by consensus until the consensus had been broken at the last two 
sessions on unreasonable grounds. Moreover, a link had been forged with the Arab StatesÂ legitimate 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30

11 


efforts to have a resolution on IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities adopted. At the current session Egypt had 
sought to produce a text that took account of some of the comments on the resolutionÂs wording as 
evidence of its good intentions and its desire to restore consensus. He trusted that the Member States 
would respond favourably to those efforts. 

64. Mr MARTÃNEZ (Uruguay) said that the use of nuclear technology in Uruguay had considerable 
social impact; 80% of nuclear applications were used in medicine for both diagnosis and treatment, in 
particular in the fight against cancer. 
65. Uruguay complied in a transparent manner with its safeguards agreement and additional 
protocol, and had taken a series of steps relevant to its cooperation with the Agency. In 2005, it had 
established the National Regulatory Authority for Radiation Protection, approved a national 
radiological emergency response plan and ratified the Joint Convention. In 2006, it had joined the 
Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies and had ratified the ARCAL 
Agreement. Uruguay was the first Latin American country to approve a national strategy for 
radioactive waste management; it had drafted an INSSP and had hosted the first Latin American 
regional workshop on nuclear security in July 2008. A draft law on radiation protection was currently 
before the Senate. Uruguay also hoped to become a member of the Board of Governors shortly. 
66. Uruguay was grateful to the Agency for its ongoing assistance in the area of capacity-building 
and training activities and the provision of state-of-the-art equipment, which had helped the country to 
meet the requirements and challenges associated with the peaceful use of advanced nuclear 
technology. 
67. As one of the first signatories to the Tlatelolco Treaty, Uruguay was firmly committed to peace 
and nuclear disarmament, and considered that conflicts should always be resolved through dialogue 
without recourse to the use of force. Every possible effort should be made to rid the world of nuclear 
weapons; multilateralism should be seen as a fundamental tool for addressing an issue as sensitive as 
the use of nuclear energy. 
68. The Director GeneralÂs visit to Uruguay in December 2007 had been of great importance to his 
country. It had helped to strengthen the efforts to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
had deepened commitment to the AgencyÂs objectives at all levels. Uruguay had embarked on a study 
of the viability of using nuclear power to produce electricity. The possibility of nuclear power 
generation fell within UruguayÂs national strategic energy objectives, since it would contribute to 
diversifying the energy mix at a time of growing consumption. His Government had decided to adopt 
a transparent, scientifically substantiated and participatory approach that would yield the best strategic 
decisions. Uruguay looked to the Agency for support and reliable and objective cooperation in that 
process. 
69. Mr KAHUURE (Namibia) said that Namibia had concluded its second CPF with the Agency 
during the past year, thus laying the foundation for future technical cooperation. He trusted that the 
lessons learnt from implementing the first CPF would be exploited, and noted that the development of 
national capacity and capability was essential in order to achieve the CPFÂs objectives. Human 
resource development was considered to be key to the fulfilment of national development goals, and 
he called upon the Agency to assist Namibia in remedying shortcomings in that area. He hoped that 
the efforts being made in evaluating CPF processes would lead to reforms to enhance the continued 
monitoring and evaluation of bilateral cooperation, and result in improved operational practices both 
within the Agency and in Member States. Namibia was pleased that the Agency encouraged the 
development of CPFs that were consistent with national development goals. 
70. His country called upon the Agency to synchronize its operational practices with other United 
Nations agencies, particularly in areas of relevance to the Millennium Development Goals. A good

example of successful international cooperation was the Joint Division, which was currently being 
reviewed by FAO. The cooperative partnership between the Agency and the FAO was important to his 
country, which relied on the technical capabilities of both agencies to achieve national priorities in the 
areas of livestock disease management, soil conservation, improvement of crop varieties and water 
resources management. He appealed to the Agency to do its utmost to retain and strengthen 
cooperation with FAO, and urged it to undertake similar cooperative efforts with WHO in regard to 
cancer control, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria programmes. Radiation therapy and nuclear 
medicine unquestionably continued to contribute significantly to the management of noncommunicable 
diseases, and the Agency should continue to strengthen national capabilities in those 
areas. Furthermore, his Government would like to see better cooperation with WHO to ensure that 
nuclear applications played a meaningful role in addressing both communicable and noncommunicable 
diseases. 

71. Nuclear and radiation safety was an important pillar of the AgencyÂs mandate and the AgencyÂs 
guidance and capacity-building efforts in that area were commendable. It was vital to establish an 
effective and efficient regulatory framework to ensure that the peaceful use of nuclear technology did 
not pose any undue risk to the population. Namibia was working towards the implementation of a 
legislative and regulatory framework in compliance with international recommendations and 
standards, in particular the recommendations of the IRRS mission. Continued assistance from the 
Agency to help Namibia achieve that goal would be appreciated. His Government supported the 
collaborative efforts of Member States in the African Region and in the Southern African 
Development Community to strengthen collaborative efforts to develop common approaches and share 
resources for the enhancement and standardization of nuclear and radiation safety in the region. 
72. His Government was firmly committed to meeting its international obligations by ratifying 
treaties and conventions under the AgencyÂs auspices. The appropriate legislation was now in place in 
Namibia to provide for the establishment of a national entity responsible for facilitating the process of 
ratification of treaties and conventions pertaining to nuclear and radiation safety. A comprehensive 
safeguards agreement would be among the first international agreements considered for ratification by 
his country. 
73. The use of nuclear power in Namibia could help to address current and future electricity needs 
and might further stimulate industrial development for the benefit of the population, and was an option 
that would be vigorously investigated. With the nuclear renaissance, the uranium mining sector in 
Namibia was experiencing accelerated growth. His Government was committed to ensuring that the 
people of Namibia benefited from the countryÂs natural resources, and would develop the policies and 
necessary legislative framework and capacity to achieve that goal. National projects had been 
proposed to address those issues, and he hoped the Agency would respond adequately to the countryÂs 
needs. 
74. Mr FAHMI (Iraq) recalled that the growing demand for nuclear energy had prompted the 
Agency to set up a Commission of Eminent Persons to discuss the AgencyÂs role during the period up 
to 2020 and beyond. The recommendations in the CommissionÂs report contained many new ideas. 
While Iraq appreciated the work done, it felt that some of the subjects addressed called for further 
study and discussion in order to develop a balanced framework that would enable the Agency to meet 
the basic demands of its Member States. 
75. His Government commended the AgencyÂs support under the technical cooperation programme 
for projects in Member States, including Iraq, especially the clean-up of destroyed nuclear 
installations, agricultural pest control, enhancement of crop yields, soil improvement, groundwater 
studies and the development of human resources. While Iraq was grateful for the AgencyÂs assistance 
in developing its nuclear knowledge base, it required greater support for a number of national projects,

such as the use of nuclear technology to detect landmines, which had constituted a serious problem in 
Iraq since the 1980s and an obstacle to agricultural development in a large part of the country, not to 
mention the rising human toll. The number of landmines was currently estimated at 25 million. 

76. His Government appreciated the AgencyÂs humanitarian work as reflected in the PACT 
programme, under which nuclear technology had produced promising results in early cancer detection 
and therapy. Iraq was therefore seeking assistance in alleviating the suffering of the growing number 
of its citizens who had fallen victim to the disease in recent years for various reasons, particularly 
environmental pollution. Iraq also hoped for greater assistance in disposing of radioactive waste from 
destroyed nuclear installations and radiation pollution in the southern part of the country. 
77. In general, Iraq had strong expectations of closer cooperation with the Agency in the context of 
regional technical cooperation in the areas of health, water resources, agriculture, radiation prevention 
and training in medical physics. It also hoped for more training opportunities and scientific visits for 
Iraqi personnel. 
78. The Iraqi Government supported international action aimed at nuclear non-proliferation and 
prevention of the use of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes, especially in the Middle East. It 
therefore attached great importance to the AgencyÂs role in applying the comprehensive safeguards 
regime to all States without exception. It stressed the need for Israel to ratify the NPT and place all its 
nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards as a first step towards building confidence 
among the countries of the region and promoting a just and lasting peace. 
79. Iraq also attached great importance to the prevention of nuclear terrorism and had taken many 
steps of a legislative and technical nature to that end, in particular action to control radioactive sources 
and to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear material and radioactive sources, the development of 
controls at border crossings and the strengthening of the nuclear material accounting system. His 
Government urged the Agency to provide more assistance for the training of regulatory bodies in 
Member States and the strengthening of their protection systems. 
80. Iraq had taken steps during the current year to sign an additional protocol and the CTBT, and 
would shortly embark on the procedures necessary to sign the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material. 
Ms 
Gervais-Vidricaire 
(Canada), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


81. Mr EGUIGUREN (Chile) said that his country attached the utmost importance to, and 
participated actively in, the AgencyÂs activities in the areas of non-proliferation, safeguards, technical 
cooperation and nuclear safety. Chile agreed that nuclear energy must be used exclusively for peaceful 
purposes and advocated complete disarmament of weapons of mass destruction. It had signed and 
ratified international instruments pertaining to safety, disarmament and non-proliferation, including 
the NPT, and the Tlatelolco Treaty, and continued to support the establishment of NWFZs in other 
regions. It was essential that the CTBT, which his country had already ratified, enter into force as soon 
as possible, and he called on all Annex 2 States to ratify that instrument. 
82. Universal adherence to the additional protocol would significantly enhance the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Since ChileÂs additional protocol had entered into 
force in April 2004, his country had complied fully with the schedule established by the Agency for 
the submission of declarations and the implementation of inspections. Noting that a strong legal 
framework had to be the basis for a more secure and predictable international scenario, he said that 
Chile had expressed its willingness to hold talks on the implementation of integrated safeguards. Chile 
taken a number of initiatives in the area of safeguards and non-proliferation, including the workshop 
entitled: ÂThe Nuclear ChallengeÂ held in Santiago in September 2008, which sought to develop a 

GC(52)/OR.3

common regional position on issues and would make a tangible contribution to the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. 

83. Chile was party to international instruments in the area of nuclear safety and security, including 
the Assistance Convention and the CPPNM. Noting that the AgencyÂs safety and security guidelines 
had facilitated the creation of a safety culture, he said that consideration might also be given to the 
preparation of guidelines for communication management in the event of a radiological or nuclear 
emergency. 
84. Chile attached high priority to the safe transport of nuclear material, and had insisted that the 
issue remain on the AgencyÂs agenda. It would continue to support actively initiatives, including 
General Conference resolutions, aimed at strengthening the transport safety regime. The dialogue that 
had been taking place within the framework of the Agency between representatives of coastal and 
shipping States was highly beneficial. 
85. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities had contributed to strengthening and improving 
ChileÂs regulatory infrastructure in the area of nuclear and radiation safety. With assistance from the 
Agency, Chile had organized two regional training courses on advanced detection equipment and 
medical response to a nuclear and radiological emergency. In addition, the Chilean Nuclear Energy 
Commission had, in cooperation with the Agency, organized a workshop on integrated management 
systems in May, as well as a regional training course on radiotracer applications in mining, mineral 
processing and related environmental systems in March 2008. A workshop concerning the sustainable 
management of natural resources in the Apalta Valley had also been held in the city of Santa Cruz in 
September. 
86. In February 2007, his Government had set up an interdisciplinary working group composed of 
12 independent scientists to study the feasibility of using nuclear energy for power generation. He 
thanked the Agency for its continued valuable assistance in that regard. 
87. His Government had supported the AgencyÂs work aimed at determining the non-diversion of 
nuclear material and technologies to non-peaceful purposes in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran 
should extend its cooperation by fulfilling its obligations under relevant United Nations Security 
Council resolutions. 
88. Chile appreciated the AgencyÂs activities relating to the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula. It had delegation noted with concern the difficulties being experienced, but was hopeful that 
the dismantlement process would be concluded successfully and that the DPRK would return to the 
NPT. 
89. Chile welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to establish the Commission of Eminent 
Persons to consider the nature and scope of the AgencyÂs programme up to 2020 and beyond. It was 
important to reflect on the AgencyÂs role in a changing global environment, and Chile was willing to 
participate actively in that process. 
90. Mr RÃNAKY (Hungary) welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to establish a Commission 
of Eminent Persons with a view to revising the structure and operation of the Agency. The working 
organs of the Agency were facing increasing difficulty in reaching agreement with all interested 
parties on issues such as setting the TCF target budget or addressing special safeguards matters, and 
there was clearly a need for change. The CommissionÂs recommendations report gave further impetus 
to the work ahead. 
91. At a time of growing international concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation, Hungary 
attributed great importance to strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Comprehensive 
safeguards agreements together with the additional protocol were the backbone of that system and 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
15 


constituted the current verification standard. Hungary had been among the first States to have begun 
implementing integrated safeguards in 2004, and it supported all efforts aimed at strengthening the 
AgencyÂs safeguards capabilities further. To that end, it continued to provide training programmes for 
inspectors and had conducted a complementary access exercise under the additional protocol. It had 
also extended the scope of its internal central accountancy system for sealed and unsealed radioactive 
sources to include radioactive waste, and had introduced electronic communication channels to enable 
licensees to report through a standardized web surface. His country was happy to share its many years 
of safeguards experience with all parties ready to conclude an additional protocol. 

92. As a country with a significant nuclear industry, Hungary attached high priority to nuclear 
safety and security. After thorough negotiations and meticulous preparations, the highly enriched spent 
fuel from the Budapest Research Reactor was to be returned to the Russian Federation. That outcome 
was a major achievement given the complexity of the negotiations, and he thanked all those who had 
contributed to the success of the project. Hungary was also assisting a neighbouring country in the 
repatriation of spent fuel from a research reactor. 
93. Hungary had participated in the third review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. The report it had submitted had been accepted, and several aspects had 
been deemed good practice. His Government would do its utmost to maintain a high-level of safety 
performance. 
94. With regard to events related to the operation of the Paks nuclear power plant, he reported that 
the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority, together with the operators, had concluded the periodic 
safety review of the plant and of the interim spent fuel storage facility. The assessments had shown 
that sufficient and necessary safety measures were being observed at both facilities. The Paks nuclear 
power plant, which had produced 36.7% of all electricity in Hungary in 2007, was in the process of a 
power uprate, and by the end of 2009 all four units would each be able to produce 500 MW (e). Work 
was also being undertaken to extend the lifetime of the facility. His Government was cooperating with 
the Agency to take advantage of existing experience in the area of licence renewal, and identify best 
practices to ensure the safe operation of the units beyond their designated lifetime. The interim spent 
fuel storage facility had also been granted a unified operating licence for modules 1 to 16, which made 
it easier to address issues common to all modules. 
95. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority and the licensees had concluded the revision of the 
nuclear safety regulations, meeting the safety reference levels developed by WENRA. The new safety 
regulations would be published shortly. 
96. In the field of emergency preparedness, he said that HungaryÂs revised and modernized national 
emergency response plan that would serve as a guide in the event of a nuclear or radiological 
emergency had recently been approved by all partner authorities. 
97. The national radioactive waste repository near BÃ¡taapÃ¡ti would accommodate low and medium 
level radioactive waste from the Paks nuclear power plant. The licensing procedure had commenced 
following preliminary approval by Parliament, and the competent authority had issued the building 
licence in June 2008. The building of the repository was now under way and the operating licence for 
the part of the repository above ground had recently been granted. 
98. As a donor to the PACT programme, Hungary placed emphasis on improving the irradiation 
capabilities of its oncology and radiotherapy centres. With the help of the Agency, a thorax phantom 
had been circulated among the centres, making it possible to increase accuracy and adjust the dose 
rate. The results of the measurements were being evaluated and a summary report was being prepared 
for submission to the Agency later in 2008.

99. In accordance with HungaryÂs commitments to balancing growing energy needs and protecting 
the environment, Parliament had adopted a decision on the energy policy for the period 2008-2020, 
under which the Government was instructed to start preparation for a new nuclear power plant or new 
unit(s), and to submit proposals to the Parliament in due course. 
100. In the area of technical cooperation, Hungary had agreed to host 21 workshops, technical 
meetings and training courses in 2008 organized through the AgencyÂs Department of Technical 
Cooperation, attesting to its commitment to reciprocate the technical assistance it had received from 
the Agency. His Government had decided to pledge its share of the TCF for 2009, and called on all 
Member States to pay their share in full and on time. Specific regional needs should be taken into 
account to avoid a slowdown of performance at a critical time. 
101. Mr DJELIC (Serbia) said that Serbia was a country in transition whose new Government had 
assumed office in July 2008. His country stood firm in its commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear 
technologies and energy in compliance with the NPT; the fundamental principles and main goals of 
the Agency; and the safe and secure application of nuclear technologies for the benefit of human 
society in accordance with global standards and requirements. Serbia would honour its obligations 
under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded with the European Union in April 2008, 
which included obligations pertaining to nuclear safety and non-proliferation. 
102. Further expansion of its membership would help the Agency to become a more global 
organization, better able to perform its role. In that regard, he welcomed the Kingdom of Lesotho, the 
Independent State of Papua New Guinea and the Sultanate of Oman as new members. 
103. A strengthened safeguards system and enhanced verification role for the Agency, including 
through the application of the additional protocol, were essential in preventing proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction and would help address the current challenges to the NPT regime. Serbia 
would sign and ratify its additional protocol as soon as the new law on ionizing radiation protection 
and nuclear safety, which was fully consistent with European Union and other international standards, 
had been approved by Parliament. 
104. In view of the risk of possible acts of nuclear terrorism, Serbia was making further efforts to 
improve the mechanisms for preventing and responding to illicit trafficking of nuclear material and to 
strengthen the physical protection of nuclear and radioactive materials. The coordinating role played 
by the Agency in that regard was essential, and his country fully supported relevant Agency 
programmes and the NSF. 
105. Serbia had been among the first countries to have signed and ratified the Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, and had also signed the amendment to the CPPNM. In the 
interests of global safety and security, his country would greatly appreciate further assistance from the 
Agency and other international actors concerning the Vinca Institute nuclear decommissioning 
programme, particularly in connection with the removal of spent fuel from the RA research reactor. 
Many international actors and the Agency itself had recognized the importance of the project, which 
his Government viewed as the top nuclear priority. It was considered as a continuation of the 
successful removal of fresh fuel to the Russian Federation undertaken in 2002, in cooperation with the 
United States of America, the Russian Federation and the NTI. In early 2008, Serbia had also 
conducted the safe removal, conditioning and storage of radium sources from the Institute of 
Oncology and Radiology in Belgrade, with support from the Agency and assistance received as part of 
EU/IAEA joint action. His country looked to the Agency and its Member States for support for 
completion of the removal of spent fuel from the Vinca Institute by September and he invited all 
interested parties to attend the donor conference for Serbia the following day.

106. His country strongly supported further improvement of technical cooperation, which was one of 
the milestones of the AgencyÂs activities and had greatly benefited his country. The AgencyÂs 
expertise, consultancy and assistance in providing the necessary equipment were crucial to achieve 
project goals in several areas, and were indispensable for Serbia to accomplish the complex 
decommissioning programme at the Vinca Institute. SerbiaÂs needs had been further reflected in a set 
of national and regional projects prepared in collaboration with Agency experts. He was pleased to 
announce that Serbia had regularly fulfilled its financial obligations towards the Agency and would 
continue to do so. Lastly, his delegation fully endorsed the AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2007 and the 
Regular Budget for 2009. 
107. Ms DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that the Czech Republic very much appreciated the 
timely release of the Director GeneralÂs background report entitled 20/20 Vision for the Future, an 
important document indicating the AgencyÂs future direction. She agreed that all Member States, in 
cooperation with the Agency, must strengthen the international non-proliferation regime by: upholding 
preventive measures to lower the risks of nuclear accidents and nuclear terrorism; preventing the 
spread of nuclear weapons by the use of export control legislation based on the principles of the 
Zangger Committee and by implementing multilateral nuclear assurances principles in practice; using 
the AgencyÂs verification skills for future developments in the area of nuclear disarmament, for 
example for the verification of a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
108. As one of the States with integrated safeguards and credible assurances on the exclusively 
peaceful nature of its nuclear programme confirmed by the Agency, the Czech Republic understood 
the need to increase the AgencyÂs verification budget. The obligation to support such an increase Â at 
least for the NPT States Parties Âstemmed from the preamble of the NPT, and the time had come to 
update Annex II to the additional protocol to reflect the technical progress made in nuclear civil trade. 
The current list dated back to the 1990s and could not give the Agency necessary means to keep its 
verification tools updated. That meant less security for all. 
109. Her Government also understood that strengthening global nuclear security was impossible 
without adequate knowledge sharing and exchanges of best practices. That should go hand in hand 
with the establishment of the AgencyÂs programme for acquiring the best experts in the area of nuclear 
sciences in general. 
110. Her country was very serious about the supporting non-proliferation regime and regularly 
contributed to the NSF. The Czech Republic had been actively involved in the Global Threat 
Reduction Initiative, and the first repatriation of spent HEU fuel from research reactors in the Czech 
Republic had been carried out in December 2007. The Government of the Czech Republic had 
recently decided to support the safe repatriation of spent fuel from the Vinca RA Research Reactor in 
Serbia to the Russian Federation, and was going to make a total contribution of approximately 
US $1 million over the following three years in view of the importance of that activity. 
111. Recognizing the need to enhance the AgencyÂs analytical capabilities and in reaction to the 
urgent call for the modernization of the Safeguards Analytical Laboratory in Seibersdorf, the Czech 
Republic had recently officially offered the Agency its own premises and capacities for performing 
analyses of safeguards samples in the future. Using or investing in adequate capacity in countries near 
the AgencyÂs Headquarters might be a cost-effective solution for the Agency. The Nuclear Research 
Institute at ReÂ, near Prague, a member of the AgencyÂs Network of Analytical Laboratories, had 
launched a large structural project in cooperation with the European Union, part of which was 
designed to upgrade its Central Analytical Laboratory. The aim was to extend the scope of services 
provided in the area of environmental samples analysis, essential for the fulfilling AgencyÂs 
obligations in the area of safeguards implementation and controlling the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. In cooperation with the Agency, the certified laboratory could become one of its 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
18 


laboratories, ensuring an independent and timely analysis of safeguards samples. The Czech Republic 
had already initiated discussions with the Secretariat in that regard and looked forward to further 
dialogue. 

112. The technical cooperation programme remained key to the further development of participating 
Member States and would continue to be so in the medium term. In Europe in particular, it was 
increasingly seen as a unique platform for exchanges of information, experience and know-how on a 
regional level, rather than a procurement instrument or tool for responding to individual national needs 
alone. The Czech Republic had, therefore, been focusing on regional projects and invited other 
European countries that might benefit from knowledge-sharing to become actively involved in the 
technical cooperation programme. Her Government very much welcomed the involvement of other 
international organizations, including the European Commission, and the synergy established with 
them thus far, and hoped that it would be further strengthened. In line with the changing approach to 
the technical cooperation programme, the Czech Republic also continued to offer voluntary 
contributions to support various activities in other Member States. In identifying possible projects, it 
cooperated closely both with the Secretariat and potential target countries in order to address their 
needs in the most effective way. Having already provided assistance on a long-term basis, her country 
preferred earmarked contributions that ensured the consistency and continuity of activities carried out 
with its donations, and helped it to monitor the use of the financial resources directly and 
independently. The Czech Republic systematically contributed to the enhancement of the nuclear 
safety of nuclear power plants in Armenia and Ukraine and supported the strengthening of radiation 
protection in medicine and radioactive waste management in priority countries, above all in the region. 
113. The changing situation in Europe might raise the possibility of reallocating some technical 
cooperation funds from one region to another in the near future. In that context, the Czech Republic 
would very much appreciate the timely involvement of the Members States in all crucial discussions 
relating to financial, budgetary and strategic matters, thereby contributing to greater transparency in 
the decision-making process and to more effective planning. 
114. The Czech Republic also supported PACT, under which it had initiated comprehensive 
assistance to Moldova, with a view to improving the regulatory body infrastructure and performance, 
and possibly upgrading radiotherapy services. 
115. She concluded by reassuring the Secretariat of the Czech RepublicÂs continuous full support and 
cooperation. 
116. Mr RISTORI (European Commission) said that energy was at the top of the EUÂs political 
agenda, owing to its link with climate change and the growing importance of security of energy 
supply. A majority of the EUÂs member countries were users of nuclear power, and a majority of the 
EUÂs citizens recognized the importance of nuclear energy in reducing CO2 
emissions and improving 
energy security. The EU was the worldÂs largest producer of electricity through nuclear power, with 
146 nuclear power plants. It was vital that the nuclear power industry meet the highest standards in 
safety, security and safeguards. 
117. The joint statement by the EU and the Agency of 7 May 2008 had established the conditions for 
closer collaboration between Euratom and the Agency, with regular and frequent high-level contacts. 
The two organizations would work together on a complementary basis to strengthen safety and 
security, and to generalize safeguards and the additional protocol. The joint project by the EU, the 
Agency and the Ukraine on the safety of nuclear facilities in that country was an excellent example of 
such cooperation. 
118. Starting in November 2008, the European Commission would put forward a new strategic 
analysis of energy policy and a programme of nuclear modernization which stressed energy security 

GC(52)/OR.3 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
19 


and the role of public authorities in making the necessary investments in clean energy sources, in 
connection with the new emissions trading system. Nuclear safety would be subject to particular 
attention, and a high-level group had been set up to address it, with the involvement of Norway, 
Switzerland and the Agency. The EU intended to be a model for the world in turning nuclear safety 
standards into community-wide legislation. 

119. Waste management continued to be an issue of great importance for public acceptance of 
nuclear power. Technological solutions, such as deep geological disposal, did exist, but national 
authorities had to take adequate measures in that area. The EU also attached great importance to the 
decommissioning of old nuclear facilities, which was an issue that had to be addressed in technical and 
financial terms as existing plants came to the end of their service lives in the coming 20 years. The 
European Commission was also working to harmonize national conventions on responsibility for 
nuclear accidents. The Bratislava-Prague European Nuclear Energy Forum brought together all those 
involved from the public, institutional, industrial and NGO spheres to address questions of 
opportunity, risk and transparency. 
120. The European Commission fully supported the NPT; it would use the new Instrument for 
Stability and Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation, and would promote the full implementation 
of the additional protocol. In the field of radiation protection, the Commission hoped to see a 
significant effort towards harmonizing nuclear medicine and medical applications of ionizing 
radiation, including a seminar on the matter to be organized together with the Secretariat. 
121. The CommissionÂs seventh research and development programme would continue efforts in 
Generation IV fission development, and in developing sustainable nuclear power, which would be 
necessary for establishing a link between the public and private sector. It would also continue to 
support the ITER project. 
122. Nuclear power was an important option for ensuring base-load electricity generation, as 
required by industry. By 2020, the EU would produce almost two-thirds of its electricity without 
emitting CO2, through nuclear power and renewable energy sources. Safety, security, nonproliferation, 
and close cooperation with the Agency would continue to be essential in that effort.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/9) 
1. Mr UGOKWE (Nigeria), commending the Agency and its Director General on their excellent 
work, said that the comprehensive reports on the AgencyÂs activities over the preceding year gave 
cause for hope that cooperation and dialogue among Member States, underpinned by technological 
development and adherence to the basic tenets of safety and security and safeguards, would continue 
to engender peace and progress in the world. 
2. His delegation was grateful for the support and cooperation it had received during his countryÂs 
tenure as a member of the Board of Governors and he assured incoming Board members of his 
delegationÂs support and cooperation. 
3. Over the preceding five decades, the major pillars of the AgencyÂs work had been enhanced 
continuously with a view to harnessing the benefits of nuclear technology in an environmentally 
sustainable manner, while maintaining international peace and security. As a developing country faced 
with the daunting task of providing for the basic needs of its people, Nigeria was aligning its 
development objectives with the AgencyÂs efforts. It had been participating in the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme for over three decades and had benefited particularly in the areas of human 
resources development and capacity building. His Government was grateful for the AgencyÂs 
assistance in the fields of energy planning, food and agriculture, medicine and human health 
(particularly PACT), industry, mineral exploration and exploitation, environmental management, 
water resources management, and electricity generation, inter alia. Nigeria would continue to partner 
with the Agency to develop sustainable programmes and promote regional cooperation through 
AFRA. 
4. 
He thanked the Agency for its assistance with the successful procurement and installation of the 
1.7 MeV tandem accelerator at the Centre for Energy Research and Development of the Obafemi 
Awolowo University, which had been commissioned recently. The facility would be used for basic 
and applied research in food and agriculture, environmental studies, industrial studies, materials 
science and manpower training, inter alia. 
5. Energy was known to be a major driver of industrialization, which was a critical index of human 
development. Many developing countries had initiated programmes to deploy nuclear power plants for 
electricity generation to meet growing energy demands. Nigeria was greatly encouraged by the 
AgencyÂs commitment to supporting developing Member States in their efforts to introduce nuclear 
power plants in their energy mix. Such support had to be transparent and without conditions within the 
framework of the Agency, and Member States should have unfettered access to the development and 
deployment of the technology. 
6. NigeriaÂs President had made it a priority to diversify the countryÂs energy base to spur on 
development. In that connection, his country had started implementing a programme to introduce 
nuclear energy into the energy mix and he thanked the Agency for playing a catalytic role in that 
endeavour. To further the aforementioned objectives, Nigeria, in partnership with the Agency, had 
started to identify and characterize possible sites for the countryÂs first nuclear power plants, to 
develop the human resources needed for the implementation of a nuclear power programme, to 
develop and strengthen the requisite regulatory platform, and to develop a robust legal framework for 
a sustainable nuclear power industry.

7. His country had acceded to all relevant laws, treaties and conventions and would pursue the 
implementation of its nuclear electricity programme in full compliance with the AgencyÂs codes and 
guidelines on safety, security and safeguards. Nigeria could only partner with Member States that 
shared its commitment to the basic tenets of the Agency and its respect for international peace and 
security. It looked forward to continued partnership and cooperation with the Agency and the 
international community to achieve its national objective to deploy nuclear power plants for electricity 
generation within the shortest possible timeframe. 
8. Nigeria had demonstrated its commitment to compliance with international legal and regulatory 
requirements for safety, security and safeguards, as illustrated by its signing of the NPT in 1968, its 
support for the indefinite extension of that Treaty 1995, its signing of a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement in 1988, and its ratification of the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident 
in 1990. 
9. As part of its efforts to establish a sustained culture of nuclear safety, security and safeguards, 
in 2006 the country had promulgated national regulations on the safety and security of radioactive 
sources, a national policy on radioactive waste, and national waste management regulations, thus 
showing its commitment to addressing radioactive waste issues in a coordinated and cooperative 
manner. 
10. With a population of over 140 million and an estimated cancer incidence rate of about 100 000 
new cases annually, NigeriaÂs five radiotherapy centres and two nuclear medicine facilities for the 
diagnosis and treatment of cancer were grossly inadequate. The country had therefore embarked on 
upgrading existing centres and establishing six additional radiotherapy centres and eight new nuclear 
medicine facilities. It had recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Agency to 
integrate radiotherapy and nuclear medicine into the National Cancer Plan for the period 2008Â2013, 
which should enhance the use of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine for the management of cancer in 
the country. Nigeria was also cooperating with the Agency and other development partners in the 
training of personnel and building of the capacity to train professionals locally in order to ensure the 
efficient delivery of services. 
11. With Agency assistance, Nigeria had developed significant capacity for the application of 
nuclear techniques. It looked forward to the support and cooperation of the Agency in building 
regional and subregional capacities in order to enhance regional integration in the development and 
use of the various nuclear technology facilities in the country. 
12. His country remained committed to the basic tenets of the NPT. All of its nuclear activities 
served purely peaceful purposes and were fully safeguarded. Its commitment to non-proliferation was 
further affirmed by its untiring efforts, in concert with other countries, to promote the full ratification 
and entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty. Nigeria appreciated the AgencyÂs pivotal role in 
promoting non-proliferation. It was concerned, however, that certain core NPT provisions, including 
Article IV, were being subjected to redefinition and reinterpretation. 
13. Proliferation concerns were best addressed in a transparent, comprehensive and 
non-discriminatory manner through multilateralism. The absence of a demonstrated commitment to 
nuclear disarmament on the part of some nuclear-weapon States was not only a drawback for the full 
implementation of NPT obligations by all State Parties, it was discriminatory and could erode the 
confidence of Member States in the AgencyÂs safeguards and verification system. 
14. Nigeria appreciated the AgencyÂs continued support and reaffirmed its abiding commitment to 
the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy for sustainable development. He thanked the 
Director General for his unrelenting efforts to advance nuclear non-proliferation through diplomacy.

15. Mr SYCHOV (Belarus) said that ever more countries were expressing an interest in nuclear 
power and nuclear technology and many had already embarked on new nuclear power programmes. At 
the preceding General Conference, his country had indicated that it was reviewing several options for 
development for its energy sector, one of which was to establish its own nuclear power system. In 
conducting that analysis, Belarus had taken into consideration many factors and circumstances, such 
as energy security, reduction of carbon emissions, increased confidence in the safety of nuclear power 
plants, economic advisability and the competitiveness of nuclear power. 
16. Based on those and others important factors, in January 2008 Belarus had taken the decision to 
construct a nuclear power plant. Activities were under way to put in place the necessary capacity, 
legislation was being adopted for the nuclear sector, the nuclear and radiation safety regulatory 
structure improved, and a site for the construction of the nuclear power plant selected. Belarus 
appreciated its fruitful cooperation with the Agency on all issues related to the launching of a national 
nuclear power programme and looked forward to further collaboration to ensure the projectÂs safety 
and reliability. 
17. It was highly important that the Agency remain at the forefront of international efforts to 
provide assistance to States embarking on nuclear power programmes and his country welcomed the 
AgencyÂs efficient response to the growing expectations of Member States in the area of the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy, and in particular its preparation and publication of a series of documents to 
assist States introducing nuclear power. Agency assistance in that field, which was of particular 
importance for creating the bases for safe operation, should be systematic and comprehensive. 
18. Nuclear power development could not be considered in isolation from the energy sector as a 
whole, and resolving the energy problem was essential for sustainable development. The issue of fair 
access to energy was taking on central significance throughout the world and energy issues were being 
considered in many international organizations and forums. 
19. For its part, Belarus was striving to make its own contribution to solving interrelated problems 
in the energy field. At the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, it had proposed the 
creation of a global mechanism for the transfer of alternative and renewable energy technologies. The 
initiative aimed at promoting collaboration on technology transfer in the fields of energy efficiency 
and new and renewable energy sources. Such technologies were concentrated in a few countries. The 
creation of a mechanism within the framework of the United Nations which would guarantee access 
for all countries to those technologies, making them the common property of all mankind, would make 
major change possible. Renewable energy sources would become a basis for collaboration, not 
competition. Within the framework of that initiative, Belarus was proposing to hold thematic debates 
on the issue of alternative and renewable energy technologies during the 63rd session of the General 
Assembly. He called upon IAEA Member States to support that proposal. It was clear that a 
comprehensive, synergistic approach to discussing energy issues was required and Belarus shared the 
opinion of the Director General that active, coordinated political action was needed in the energy field, 
and in such related spheres as socio-economic development, climate change, and combating poverty. 
20. Belarus was an active participant in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, under 
which it had received significant help in fields related to the application of nuclear knowledge and 
technology. All technical cooperation projects conducted in Belarus aimed at solving priority 
socio-economic problems. In its CPF, which had been renewed in 2007, Belarus had defined its main 
technical cooperation priorities, which included the development of a national nuclear power 
infrastructure, environmental protection, rehabilitation of land contaminated by the Chernobyl 
accident, and public health issues. Projects currently in progress or planned were fully in line with 
those priorities.

21. Beginning in 2009, the Agency would be providing assistance with the introduction of nuclear 
power in Belarus. Cooperation with the Agency was envisaged to train personnel to work in the 
national nuclear power programme and on the development of a national nuclear safety regulatory 
system. 
22. Furthermore, Belarus intended to continue its active collaboration with the Agency related to 
the rehabilitation of areas contaminated by the Chernobyl accident. Cooperation in that field was in 
line with the United Nations Chernobyl strategy, which envisaged the transition of the affected regions 
to sustainable socio-economic development. At the 62nd session of the General Assembly, the 
AgencyÂs involvement in those efforts had been highly praised. Belarus expected that the Agency 
would be actively involved in implementing the United Nations Chernobyl action plan. 
23. Its successful cooperation with the Agency had enabled Belarus to offer its expertise and 
technical capacity in support of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. Each year, Belarus 
organized international graduate courses in radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources in 
Minsk. In addition, BelarusÂs customs and border authorities made their experience in the field of 
combating of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material available to other countries. 
24. Belarus supported the strengthening and expansion of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme and believed that its funding should be more predictable and assured. In that connection, 
his country was pleased to note the continuing positive trend in the funding situation for the 
programme thanks to the coordinated efforts of Member States and the Secretariat. For its part, 
Belarus had for several years paid its voluntary contributions to the TCF in full and on time, and 
committed itself to doing so again in 2009. 
25. Given the growing interest in nuclear power and growing demands for Agency technical 
cooperation projects, it was extremely important that the Agency continue to play a key role in nuclear 
and radiation safety. As a State which had taken the decision to construct its first nuclear power plant, 
Belarus accorded great attention to nuclear safety issues. It was particularly interested in international 
collaboration relating to the safe and reliable operation of nuclear installations, and the management of 
radioactive sources, spent fuel and waste. In that connection, he noted the importance of effective 
implementation of the most important international legal instruments, above all the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management. As a party to both conventions, Belarus took a responsible approach 
to their implementation and intended to continue to cooperate in efforts to universalize them. 
26. Earlier in 2008, the 4th review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety had taken place and had confirmed the interconnection between increased expectations of 
nuclear energy and the increasing attention given to nuclear safety issues. Ensuring the necessary level 
of safety and the security of nuclear facilities was an unconditional priority in any StateÂs nuclear 
power programme. In that context, he stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs safety standards. 
Belarus considered work carried out at national level to ensure nuclear and radiation safety to be an 
inseparable part of the AgencyÂs general efforts to establish a global safety regime, and it supported 
the activities of the Agency and its Secretariat in that field. 
27. His country was committed to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and rigorously met its 
obligations under the NPT and its safeguards agreement. It attached great importance to strengthening 
the safeguards system. In signing an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement in 2005, it had 
reaffirmed its commitment to the principles of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
strengthening of the AgencyÂs authority in that field.

28. Belarus also recognized the important role of international export control regimes. It had set up 
an effective national export control system and, as a member of the NSG, it strictly applied NSG 
guidelines when taking decisions related to the supply of controlled items. 
29. His country believed that international non-proliferation efforts should be accompanied by 
concrete steps in nuclear disarmament, and by confidence-building measures between nuclear-weapon 
and non-nuclear-weapon States. 
30. When considering non-proliferation and disarmament as a whole, it was worth remembering 
that one of the most important aims was to ensure that nuclear technology was used exclusively for 
peaceful purposes. Under the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute, every Member State had the inalienable 
right to conduct peaceful nuclear activities. Belarus believed that the existing international 
mechanisms should promote equal and non-discriminatory access for all interested countries to the 
benefits of nuclear energy. 
31. In conclusion, he reaffirmed his countryÂs support for the strengthening of the AgencyÂs status 
as the leading international organization promoting the safe, reliable and peaceful use of nuclear 
energy for sustainable development. 
32. Mr MSOLLA (United Republic of Tanzania) commended the Director General on his statement 
which highlighted not only the successes and challenges of the Agency in the preceding year, but also 
the work before the Agency and the priority actions that urgently needed to be taken to ensure a secure 
and prosperous future world. He also expressed support for the important message for a safe and 
sustainably prosperous world delivered by the High Representative for Disarmament on behalf of the 
United Nations Secretary-General. 
33. His country was grateful for ongoing technical cooperation projects and hoped that the 
relationship between the Agency and his country would be sustained and strengthened. It was in the 
third year of executing its second CPF, which focused on eight priority themes. While not all themes 
had been implemented as envisaged because of the extreme financial constraints and limitations faced 
by both the United Republic of Tanzania and the Agency, there had been tangible achievements in the 
fields of health, food security and water resources management in particular. A good number of people 
in his country were now familiar with the Agency not just in the safeguards role, but also as an 
agent for sustainable development. As agreement had been reached on the targets for the TCF for 
2009Â2011, he hoped that the Agency and Tanzania could finalize the technical cooperation 
programme for his country for the same period so that implementation of its CPF could be completed. 
He agreed with the Director General that, in future, the targets for the TCF should be based on priority 
criteria agreed in advance to avoid the all too familiar contentious and protracted negotiations. 
34. Tanzania invited the Agency and its development partners to renegotiate its CPF and prepare the 
third one, as circumstances had changed: for example, capacity building, human resources 
development and nuclear knowledge management had gained in importance, and mining of uranium in 
Tanzania was slowly becoming a reality. In that connection, he called on the Agency to continue and 
intensify its efforts to support Member States, and in particular LDCs like Tanzania, in capacity 
building, human resources development and nuclear knowledge management, in line with General 
Conference resolution GC(48)/RES/13. 
35. Tanzania was following with keen interest the growing interest in using nuclear technology to 
produce electricity and in other potential benefits of nuclear technologies. Statements made by the 
Director General had prompted his country to prepare a comprehensive nuclear technology policy, 
which could lead to the countryÂs atomic energy legislation being revised to establish a framework for 
investment of national resources in that field.

36. Peace and development could long not coexist with abject poverty, and democracy and good 
governance could not grow amid poverty, diseases and deprivation. Poverty alleviation promoted 
collective world security, peace and prosperity. His country therefore called on the Agency and the 
international community to strengthen technical cooperation programmes aimed at harnessing 
sustainable use of nuclear technology and atomic energy, including nuclear power, for development 
and poverty alleviation. Strategic applications of nuclear technology in targeted areas, such as 
sustainable energy development, health, food crop and livestock improvement, and water resources 
management and sanitation, could contribute immensely to poverty alleviation, in particular in LDCs 
such as Tanzania. 
37. Tanzania greatly appreciated the commitment of the international community to tackling the 
cancer therapy problem through PACT. Under that programme, and with the support of the Agency 
and the international community, Tanzania had developed and begun to put into effect its first 
comprehensive and integrated national cancer control strategy. The nuclear medicine and radiotherapy 
services at the countryÂs only cancer hospital, which served over 35 million people, were constantly 
improving and coming in line with international standards, while preparations for the establishment of 
a second unit at the Bugando Medical Centre were at an advanced stage. 
38. He expressed appreciation and gratitude for the valuable support given to African Member 
States, in particular Tanzania, through PATTEC. As a result of that support, application of the SIT to 
eradicate tsetse fly species in various parts of Africa continued to gain momentum. The support had 
also facilitated the development of human resources capacity for the African region, and the 
improvement and tsetse fly proofing of a facility in Tanzania that was now being used to rear tsetse 
colonies. At that facility, planning and development of stratified baseline data collections using a 
standardized grid-based sampling frame was progressing well. He appealed for the resumption of the 
recently discontinued support to his country and that facility so that the fight against the tsetse fly 
problem in Africa and Tanzania could be sustained. 
39. Since its inception in 1990, AFRA had evolved into a stable and credible regional cooperative 
framework implementing a programme worth US $2.2 million, and its membership had grown to 
32. AFRA was now entering a new phase, into which it had been propelled by a series of high-level 
policy review seminars, including those held in Algeria and Egypt in 2007 where landmark 
declarations had been made. The African Union Summit held in Addis Ababa in 2007 had endorsed 
the Declaration of Algiers and Plan of Action and, pursuant to the latter, the Aswan seminar had 
adopted conclusions and resolutions on a number of key issues. All the resulting programmes would 
need the support of the Agency and the international community. He thanked the Agency for the 
technical assistance, strong support and guidance that was being given to the AFRA partnership and he 
expressed gratitude to the Agency, AFRA member States and development partners for the funding 
they provided, appealing to them to sustain their generous assistance and support in the interests of 
peace and socio-economic development. 
40. Finally, his country pledged its full share to the TCF. 
41. Mr AL SAUD (Saudi Arabia) said that the AgencyÂs outstanding record highlighted its 
important role in disseminating knowledge regarding the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and 
promoting nuclear safety and security. The prospects for expanding that role were set out in the 
Director GeneralÂs background report entitled 20/20 Vision for the Future. 
42. As continuous global economic growth called for a commensurate increase in energy supply, 
countries that had opted for nuclear energy relied on Agency technical assistance to establish the 
necessary infrastructure, imbue human resources with a safety culture, promote exchanges of relevant 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30

7 


information and ideas, prevent proliferation, reduce radioactive waste, and place all nuclear activities 
under Agency safeguards. 

43. Notwithstanding the marked improvement in nuclear safety in recent decades thanks to the 
AgencyÂs efforts to build a global safety network, further action was needed to reduce the risk of 
nuclear accidents. Although the indicators pointed to a improvement in the safety of nuclear reactors, 
the continued use of outdated reactors was a source of considerable concern. He called on the Agency 
to continue setting standards for the safety of nuclear installations, activities and material, to assist 
States in complying with them, and to promote international cooperation to develop an acceptable 
solution to the problem of radioactive waste. 
44. The AgencyÂs technical assistance to developing countries made a direct contribution to the 
well-being of their peoples through peaceful applications of nuclear energy in agriculture, nutrition, 
hydrology, medicine and industry. The technical cooperation programme also facilitated exchange of 
information with counterparts regarding diversification of energy sources, impact control, legislation 
and development of the institutional infrastructure required to implement Agency safety standards. 
Saudi Arabia had a sound record of technical cooperation with the Agency in peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy. In addition to its national projects, it participated in Asian regional projects as well as 
interregional projects. 
45. Safeguards were one of the AgencyÂs core activities and its verification responsibilities were set 
to expand in line with the increase in the quantity of nuclear material subject to safeguards. The 
organization should take serious steps to apply safeguards in all States with nuclear activities, 
especially where those activities were of a sensitive nature, without exception, while ensuring that the 
regime did not constitute an obstacle to development, especially in countries that complied with their 
obligations. 
46. The fact that IsraelÂs nuclear facilities still escaped international verification was a major 
security concern for countries in the region. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, had met all the 
constitutional and legal requirements for implementation of its comprehensive safeguards agreement 
with the Agency. He expressed the hope that the General Conference would be more successful at its 
current session in tackling the item on the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East and 
other related agenda items, and that the Agency would be able to act on the demand Â repeated in 
numerous General Conference resolutions over the decades Â for a response to the urgent need for all 
countries in the Middle East without exception to agree forthwith to the application of comprehensive 
Agency safeguards to their nuclear activities. Such a step would be an important confidence-building 
measure and would prevent a perceived lack of impartiality and application of double standards from 
undermining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime. It would also promote the establishment of 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 
47. The NPT was based on a vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. It was striking, however, 
that the nuclear-weapon States party to the NPT had not yet acted on all the commitments to which 
they had subscribed in the Final Document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, which required them 
to engage in good-faith negotiations aimed at eliminating their nuclear arsenals. He hoped that action 
would be taken to achieve that lofty goal so that the countries of the Middle East and the world as a 
whole could reap the benefits. There were justified fears that, if countries continued to view nuclear 
weapons as a deterrent and source of prestige, the message that such weapons were essential for 
security would continue to be propagated. Moreover, the application of double standards in the 
non-proliferation regime was poisoning the atmosphere and making it difficult to check the spread of 
nuclear weapons. It was time to heed the warning issued by the United Nations High-level Panel on 
Threats, Challenges and Change, namely that the world was reaching a point where the erosion of the 

GC(52)/OR.4

8 


non-proliferation regime was becoming irreversible. He therefore called on peace-loving nations to 
mobilize support for action to universalize the NPT and the safeguards regime. 

48. Finally, he commended the AgencyÂs action in recent years to counter nuclear terrorism, nuclear 
smuggling and illicit trafficking by helping countries to enact effective national legislation in 
accordance with Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). 
49. Ms OHENE (Ghana) said that the Annual Report for 2007 confirmed that the AgencyÂs 
activities were central to maximizing the utilization of nuclear technology for economic and social 
development and preventing its misuse for non-peaceful purposes. 
50. Ghana attached great importance to the technical cooperation programme and appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts, in partnership with African Member States, to use nuclear science and technology to 
address the many-sided socio-economic problems of human health, nutrition, agriculture, energy, 
industry and environment. Her country wished to express its deep appreciation to the Agency, and 
especially the Director of the Division for Africa and his staff who had made concerted efforts to 
implement Ghana's national, AFRA and other regional projects. 
51. The research scientists at the three institutes and five centres of the Ghana Atomic Energy 
Commission, and other national research institutions and universities were engaged in various research 
activities using nuclear and biotechnology techniques which were well aligned to the development 
agenda of Ghana with the sole objective of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. GhanaÂs 
nuclear facilities were dedicated not only to research, education and training but also to the promotion 
of commercialization. To achieve sustainability, Ghana followed the AFRA guidelines and there were 
business and marketing plans for income generation for major nuclear facilities and projects. 
52. It was GhanaÂs objective that nuclear techniques should continue to play a critical role in crop 
improvement, pest management, food preservation, medical sterilization, radiotherapy and nuclear 
medicine. The country would continue to use non-destructive testing techniques, including the use of 
radioisotopes and radiotracers for troubleshooting and optimization of the petrochemical and mining 
industries. 
53. As part of GhanaÂs efforts to promote the commercialization of radiation processing of food and 
medical products, the Government had provided funds for the upgrading of the existing gamma 
irradiator. It was the countryÂs cherished hope and firm belief that the facility would greatly enhance 
the export of agricultural produce and contribute to its health care delivery system. 
54. With respect to human health, Ghana was happy to note the considerable work being done by 
the Agency. The WHO statistics quoted in the Annual Report, according to which 84 million people 
would die of cancer over the coming ten years, 75% of them from developing countries, were 
frightening. However, according to the Agency, with adequate funding and resources, more than 40% 
of all cancers could be prevented and 30% could be cured, if detected early and treated. 
55. She thanked the Director General for the major role he had played in facilitating the securing of 
loans from the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the OPEC Fund for International 
Development to expand and upgrade the two existing centres for radiotherapy and nuclear medicine in 
Ghana. All the necessary arrangements were being made to establish a comprehensive programme for 
cancer therapy under PACT in Ghana. Recognizing the upsurge of cancer in Ghana and the West 
African sub region, her country had decided to establish a radiological and medical sciences research 
institute to play a leading role in cancer research and the treatment of any radiological emergencies. It 
would welcome any form of assistance from friendly countries to strengthen the establishment of 
infrastructure to support research and education in the new institute.

56. Her country was convinced that human resources would ultimately constitute the basis for 
sustainability and growth of the nuclear industry in Ghana and Africa. Ghana had therefore established 
the Graduate School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences at the University of Ghana, in cooperation with 
the Agency, for the preservation, maintenance and enhancement of nuclear knowledge. Enrolment at 
the postgraduate school stood at 138. Ghana remained grateful to the Agency for its support in diverse 
ways, in particular for providing funds for some of the students pursuing PhD sandwich programmes. 
Preparations were also in progress to run the harmonized African masters degree programme in 
nuclear science and technology and the postgraduate diploma programme in radiation protection 
during the coming academic year. 
57. Over the preceding year, the training department of the Graduate School of Nuclear and Allied 
Sciences had hosted many IAEA/AFRA training workshops and courses in various fields of nuclear 
technology, including safety and security. 
58. Recognizing the need to strengthen institutional capacity in nuclear science and technology, 
Ghana had embarked on the establishment of a national accelerator facility, with emphasis on the use 
of ion beams for teaching and research in the field of nuclear physics and materials engineering. The 
beneficiaries of the accelerator technology would be research scientists and postgraduate students from 
universities in Ghana and the rest of Africa. The building to house the accelerator was nearing 
completion and the Government had provided $500 000 on a cost-sharing basis towards the 
procurement of equipment. She appealed to Member States to offer support with extrabudgetary 
funding. 
59. In the light of soaring food prices, and amid the challenges of climate change, energy security 
and the need for urgent and decisive action to address food security issues, the relevance of the 
AgencyÂs contribution to agricultural development, particularly in African Member States, could not 
be exaggerated. It was against that backdrop that Ghana supported the AgencyÂs initiative that had 
culminated in the development of a groundwater assessment programme using isotope hydrology 
techniques. Undoubtedly, the initiative would improve water resources management in many African 
countries facing drought. She also expressed appreciation to the Agency for the development and use 
of the SIT. As a participating country in PATTEC, Ghana was involved in the mass rearing and 
irradiation of tsetse flies. The Agency was to be commended on its research and development 
activities on use of the technique for the suppression and eradication of the mosquitoes that caused 
malaria. 
60. The Government of Ghana had decided to generate electricity using nuclear power plants in the 
long term. It had been informed by the Agency of its willingness to work very closely with national 
stakeholder institutions to establish the first nuclear power plant. The workshop on issues related to the 
introduction of the nuclear power to be presented by Agency staff in the first quarter of 2009 was 
being eagerly awaited. 
61. Her country wished to assure the Secretariat and the international community that Ghana was 
fully committed to nuclear safeguards, safety and security and would continue to ensure that all 
nuclear technology practices were conducted in a safe, secure and environmentally friendly manner. 
She commended the Agency for continuing to support national and international efforts aimed at the 
safe and secure use of nuclear technology. 
62. In Ghana, draft legislation to establish an independent regulatory body had been prepared and 
was awaiting parliamentary approval. Special attention was also being paid to nuclear security issues. 
A committee comprising senior officials from national security agencies, operators of nuclear facilities 
and the regulatory body, oversaw the planning and implementation of actions, including those related 
to the Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan and the International Physical Protection Advisory

Service. The country was grateful to the Agency for the supply of equipment, provision of expert 
services and the organization of national and regional training courses. 

63. Mr KARIMOV (Azerbaijan) said that, throughout its existence, the Agency had always actively 
promoted international cooperation on the peaceful use of atomic energy and strict compliance with 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. His country valued the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure safety 
worldwide and was taking all necessary steps to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the 
threat of nuclear terrorism. 
64. As new threats and challenges to international security and stability emerged, the NPT and the 
AgencyÂs role in ensuring its implementation took on particular importance. 
65. The problems in the Caucasus in August 2008 had once again demonstrated the exceptional 
complexity of creating in the world an atmosphere of mutual trust, neighbourliness and respect for the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. Unresolved conflicts, territories not subject to 
international monitoring, separatism, and the emergence of self-proclaimed States not subject to any 
international obligations all posed threats to peace and stability. On more than one occasion, his 
country had drawn attention to the problem of illegally occupied and uncontrolled territories which 
might be used for unhindered trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material, or use thereof for 
unsanctioned purposes. Uncontrolled territories posed a direct threat to the safety of regions that were 
suffering from inter-ethnic conflicts and prone to all kinds of risk. Nowhere in the world should be 
outside international verification mechanisms and all conflicts should be resolved through 
international law, thus minimizing the potential risk of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and the 
threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism. Azerbaijan appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent 
such acts of terrorism and hoped that it could continue to strengthen its role in that area. 
66. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was particularly important in resolving issues 
related to the peaceful use of atomic energy and Azerbaijan welcomed the positive results that had 
recently been achieved. Further increasing the effectiveness and level of cooperation was one of the 
main priorities for interaction between his country and the Agency. Azerbaijan participated actively in 
a number of regional and national technical cooperation projects, one of the priority areas being 
non-power applications. It supported Agency efforts to promote effective programmes in the fields of 
nuclear science, technology and applications, aimed at meeting the countryÂs basic sustainable 
development requirements. Work to preserve and expand nuclear knowledge, which was the 
fundamental basis for nuclear safety, was acquiring special importance. Improvement of nuclear 
education was a vital element in developing innovative nuclear technology and the Secretariat should 
therefore further assist interested Member States to participate in such programmes as the World 
Nuclear University Summer Institute. 
67. Azerbaijan also attached importance to cooperation with the Agency on ensuring safe handling 
of radioactive sources and strengthening its national system for control, accounting, storage, transport 
and disposition of radiation sources. In 2008, a presidential decree had established the State Agency 
for Nuclear and Radiation Safety Regulation to fulfil those functions. Work was under way to 
complete preparation of the necessary regulatory documents, to set up the structure and to hire staff for 
the new State body. 
68. Under the technical cooperation programme in 2008, the system for the preparation and storage 
of low-and high-level radioactive waste had become operational. Nuclear medicine equipment for the 
diagnosis and treatment of cancer had been installed at the National Oncology Centre. In addition, the 
Agency had assisted with the acquisition, installation and commissioning of a linear accelerator for 
treating cancer patients.

69. Azerbaijan had been extracting oil on an industrial scale for 160 years. As a result of 
long-standing production activities at oil deposits, some areas had become polluted with natural 
radionuclides which posed a serious threat to public health. A priority in AzerbaijanÂs cooperation 
with the Agency was monitoring of the radioecological situation on the Abseron Peninsula and 
rehabilitation thereof. It was planned to expand that cooperation in the future to other industrial areas, 
territories and water resources in Azerbaijan. 
70. While recognizing the AgencyÂs indisputable authority and its ever growing role in the 
international arena, Azerbaijan was aware of the need to review a number of its statutory functions, the 
challenges facing the Agency and the scope for tackling them. It therefore considered the creation of 
the Commission of Eminent Persons to analyse the nature and scale of the AgencyÂs work up to 
2020 both timely and well founded. His country welcomed the report of the Commission on the future 
of the Agency and was ready to put forward its own proposals on the issues addressed in it. 
71. Azerbaijan intended to continue to work with the Agency and to support any initiatives aimed at 
strengthening the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, ensuring nuclear and radiation safety, 
and using atomic energy for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
72. Mr STRITAR (Slovenia) said that the Agency played an indispensable role in global efforts to 
prevent nuclear proliferation. The inspections it carried out were widely respected as impartial and 
independent and were aimed at detecting any misuse of nuclear material and at deterring any such 
activity. The Safeguards Implementation Report for 2007 indicated that 82 States had comprehensive 
safeguards agreements with additional protocols in force, which was an increase from the year before. 
However, only one additional country party to the NPT had brought a comprehensive safeguards 
agreements into force. His country believed that a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with 
an additional protocol should be considered the contemporary verification standard, and NPT State 
Parties without comprehensive safeguards agreements should be more proactive in meeting that 
standard. He urged Member States without a comprehensive safeguards agreement in force, and those 
that were hesitant about concluding an additional protocol, to do so without delay. 
73. Regrettably, the work of the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the 
Framework of the IAEA Statute set up by the Board in 2005 had not formulated any specific 
recommendation to the Board. However, SAGSI worked closely with the Secretariat in developing 
new safeguards concepts which could be used in the future and which went beyond the current 
integrated safeguards concepts. Concepts which built on the advantages of unpredictability and 
verification seemed worthy of additional effort. Such concepts could be used as an alternative to the 
normally defined level of routine inspections, resulting in a trade-off between further reductions in 
routine inspections and unannounced, occasional and intensive inspections. 
74. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism had entered into 
force in July 2007, which was a clear sign that many countries were ready to prevent and combat 
nuclear terrorism. The Convention had been opened for signature in September 2005 and Slovenia had 
been among the first signatories. As terrorism was a global threat, the State Parties to the Convention 
should make every effort to adopt appropriate measures to ensure the protection of radioactive and 
nuclear material, taking into account the relevant recommendations and functions of the Agency. 
75. Slovenia attached utmost importance to the implementation of the AgencyÂs nuclear security 
activities to prevent, detect and respond to nuclear terrorism. The responsibility for nuclear security 
rested with individual Member States which should work hand in hand with the Agency to strengthen 
non-proliferation, nuclear verification and export controls. Any other practical initiatives and steps that 
could be taken would be welcome.

76. As evidence of SloveniaÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, over 
the preceding year it had hosted six Agency regional workshops, training courses and seminars, and 
Slovenian organizations and institutions had accepted more than a dozen fellows from various 
developing countries. Since 2006, Slovenian experts had participated in the ambitious Vinca Institute 
Nuclear Decommissioning (VIND) programme to assist Serbia in the decommissioning of nuclear 
facilities. Slovenia had provided assistance to the Serbian regulator by reviewing documents related to 
the repackaging and transport of spent fuel from the Vinca research reactor. 
77. Slovenia had pledged to pay its full share to the TCF for 2009 and had paid its share in full in 
previous years. 
78. His country recognized the effort that had been put into implementing the International Action 
Plan for Strengthening the International Preparedness and Response System for Nuclear and 
Radiological Emergencies and, in that connection, it welcomed the establishment of a working group 
on long-term sustainability in Rome in June 2008, which would continue activities in that regard. To 
strengthen international emergency response, the Agency had invited Member States to register their 
resources with the Response Assistance Network, whose main objectives were to provide and 
coordinate assistance and advice, and to promote emergency preparedness. Slovenia had been one of 
the first countries to register with the Network at the start of 2008 and it was pleasing to see more 
countries registering. The Network was voluntary in nature and did not assume any obligation. 
Although still at an early stage of implementation, it could contribute significantly to establishing a 
robust and sustainable global emergency response network in the future. 
79. Expectations were rising as regards the future expansion of nuclear power. The energy 
consumption forecast for Slovenia showed a clear increase in electricity demand, making nuclear 
energy a viable option for the countryÂs future energy mix. However the primary concern was the 
continued safe operation of existing nuclear capacity. Ageing management and life extension activities 
were a priority for operators and regulators. Exchange of international experience and information 
could contribute significantly to maintaining a high level of nuclear safety. The KrÂko nuclear power 
plant was the largest producer of electricity in Slovenia, contributing almost 40% of the electrical 
power supplied to the grid. It had an excellent operating record, in spite of a leak in June 2008 that had 
resulted in a reactor shutdown, but no releases to the environment. That event had triggered an 
unprecedented media response throughout Europe. His country was ready to discuss openly with 
international stakeholders improvements that would prevent the repetition of such an unnecessary 
response in the future. 
80. Slovenia attached the utmost importance to maintaining a high level of nuclear safety 
worldwide. Although the prime responsibility for nuclear safety rested with the operator, the 
implications went beyond national boundaries, making international cooperation in that regard 
indispensable. The Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had review mechanisms that 
highlighted the importance of ongoing safety improvement and international cooperation on safetyrelated 
matters. Slovenia welcomed the successful outcome of the fourth review meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety which had taken place in April 2008, and it 
had prepared its third national report for the review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint 
Convention in the coming year. 
81. With regard to staffing and competence issues, his country attached great importance to nuclear 
research and education. The Slovenian Government had approved the framework document for 
sustainable assurance of supporting activities in the field of nuclear and radiation safety. Research 
projects had been selected covering different areas, such as methods and techniques for ageing

13 


management, improvement of nuclear safety using probabilistic safety analysis, and use of reference 
benchmarks for managing nuclear facilities. 

82. In 2007, the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration had been awarded the internationally 
recognized ISO 9001:2000 certification for its quality management system. 
83. With reference to the 20/20 Vision for the Future report, Slovenia agreed that the Agency had 
vast experience and could mobilize international technical expertise of considerable breadth and 
quality. The Agency should maintain its statutory role and its primary goal was to respond to the needs 
of Member States where other institutions could not provide services so effectively. Slovenia 
appreciated the AgencyÂs initiative to address the issues that would influence its future and considered 
the key success factor to be human resources. With experienced and capable staff, the demanding 
tasks foreseen in the report would be much easier to achieve and would be implemented more 
efficiently. The report also addressed increases and, to a lesser degree, decreases in Agency activities 
up to 2020. It was difficult to forecast the future. Member States should be the main driving force 
steering the AgencyÂs activities along whatever route they chose, and the 20/20 report, together with 
the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons, could be used as a comprehensive route planner. 
84. Mr VALLIM GUERREIRO (Brazil) said his country welcomed the fact that the Scientific 
Forum held in parallel with the General Conference was focusing on the future role of the Agency, 
based on the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons on the future of the agency. The convening 
of that Commission by the Director General had been timely, since the world was about to experience 
a revival of nuclear energy because of growing electricity needs, in particular in developing countries, 
coupled with a widespread recognition that nuclear energy was an economically competitive and 
environmentally sound alternative to other energy sources. Very few now questioned the 
anthropogenic contribution to climate change, especially from burning of fossil fuels. Increased use of 
atomic energy would present a wide range of opportunities and challenges, and a review of the role of 
the Agency in that new environment was essential. 
85. Although the trend towards growing use of nuclear energy was clear, it was impossible to 
predict its eventual extent. Several scenarios were being envisaged over different time frames, and the 
Agency had to be given the tools it needed to adapt as circumstances changed. It would be 
counterproductive to put the Agency in an institutional and operational straitjacket as if the future 
environment were already known. 
86. In that context, it was important to consider whether the Agency could play an enhanced role 
without changes to its Statute, whether it should change at all, should change only from a managerial 
perspective, or should assume more responsibilities, and whether it would be in a position to address 
future challenges within its present framework. There were no clear-cut answers to such questions and 
his country looked forward to future exchanges on them. 
87. As the use of nuclear energy became more widespread and the international importance of the 
Agency increased, it would be vital to ensure that all Member States felt a sense of ownership and 
belonging vis-Ã -vis the Agency, and that they felt that its priorities were also their priorities. 
Inclusiveness, participation and commitment would be essential in fulfilling the collective tasks ahead. 
88. It was natural that different countries ascribed different degrees of importance to the AgencyÂs 
different statutory activities, but it was important to implement each activity fully, in a holistic and 
integrated way, without discrimination or selectivity. Brazil attached equal importance to all pillars of 
the AgencyÂs activities. Its contributions to peace and security, to development and the alleviation of 
poverty, and to a clean environment were equally valuable, whether those activities derived from 
treaty obligations or not, and his country believed that it would be unhealthy for the Agency to be 
skewed in one direction or another.

89. One of the most daunting future challenges was the battle for public opinion. Brazil was 
encouraged by the deepening of a safety culture in connection with the use of nuclear energy around 
the world, and by technological developments allowing the construction of ever safer reactors. There 
could not be too much zeal on the issue of safety, as even one accident was too many. Having 
experienced the most serious accident ever involving a radioactive source, in GoiÃ¢nia 21 years 
previously, Brazil was particularly aware of the importance of safety. 
90. Nuclear energy also had to be secure, as the prospect that non-State actors might acquire, have 
access to or use weapons incorporating radioactive material, such as radiological dispersal devices, 
was too dreadful to contemplate. While the responsibility for the safety and security of nuclear 
material and radioactive sources lay with States, it was in the interests of all to abide by the strictest 
standards. The consequences of nuclear accidents or malicious acts involving nuclear material had no 
respect for national boundaries. 
91. As the only institution with a mandate to verify compliance with non-proliferation commitments 
under the NPT, the Agency had a key role in maintaining international peace and security. Brazil 
appreciated the objectivity, impartiality and professionalism with which the Secretariat applied 
safeguards, belying the epithet ÂUnited Nations nuclear watchdogÂ. 
92. While the Agency had no agreed mandate to deal with nuclear disarmament obligations arising 
from Article VI of the NPT, it was unavoidable that Member States brought to the General Conference 
their perceptions regarding the progress, of lack thereof, in that area. Disarmament and 
non-proliferation were mutually reinforcing and movement in one area was affected by movement in 
the other. 
93. While much had been said about the proliferation risks that the nuclear renaissance would 
entail, Brazil considered those risks to have been somewhat exaggerated and saw no well founded 
reasons to conclude that greater reliance on nuclear power would lead to the spread of sensitive 
nuclear technologies. The bulk of new nuclear power plants would be built in countries which already 
produced their own fuel. Given the inherent difficulties of developing isotope separation techniques, 
the huge investment required, the extensive training of human resources needed and the industrial 
capacity involved, his country considered it most unlikely that any country wishing to embark upon a 
nuclear programme for the first time would attempt to set up its own enrichment facility, particularly 
since the LEU market was working adequately. Nor was Brazil aware of any fear on the part of 
countries embarking on nuclear programmes for the first time that supplies of fuel for their future 
nuclear power plants would be interrupted. However, if a country decided to enrich uranium itself, it 
had every right to do so, provided it complied with its relevant obligations, including supplying the 
Agency with the necessary design information. Brazil regarded any reinterpretation of Article IV of 
the NPT as unacceptable and believed that any attempt to establish a new divide between haves and 
have-nots underestimated the profound concession made by non-nuclear-weapon States on acceding to 
the NPT. 
94. When listening to the debate on the enrichment issue, one had the impression that there was an 
implicit assumption that Agency safeguards on enrichment facilities were not effective and did not 
achieve their stated purpose. Such an assumption was simply wrong. There was no record of any case 
of diversion of nuclear material from a safeguarded enrichment facility. 
95. Brazil was currently discussing the future of its nuclear programme, including from an 
institutional point of view, following the decision to complete as soon as possible the construction of 
the 1300 MW Angra III nuclear power reactor, for which the commissioning stages had been finalized 
with the granting of the licences required by law. The actual construction work could begin shortly. It 
was also planned that, by 2030, between four and eight new nuclear power plants would become 

GC(52)/OR.4

2008,

15 


operational, each with an estimated output of 1000 MW. The science and technology section of the 
growth acceleration programme which had already been approved and funded by Congress provided 
for the completion of the pilot conversion plant for the production of uranium hexafluoride in Aramar, 
SÃ£o Paulo. It also provided for the expansion of the commercial uranium enrichment plant in Resende, 
Rio de Janeiro, with the ultimate objective of achieving self-sufficiency in LEU. Brazil also planned to 
increase radioisotope production to meet all domestic demand. 

96. In February 2008, the President of Brazil and the President of Argentina had issued a formal 
declaration on a wide spectrum of bilateral relations. In the section of that declaration dealing with 
nuclear cooperation, both Heads of State had defined the composition of a bilateral commission to be 
responsible for the development of a model nuclear power reactor to meet the electricity needs of the 
two countries and, eventually, of the region. The declaration also stated that the competent authorities 
in Argentina and Brazil should define a common project in the nuclear fuel cycle field and the intent 
was expressed to establish a binational uranium enrichment enterprise. Despite the magnitude of the 
task, work was proceeding at an accelerated pace in the respective national nuclear commissions to 
fulfil that mandate. 
97. The decision of the Governments of Brazil and Argentina to issue the declaration stemmed from 
the need felt by both sides to take further steps to integrate nuclear activities in the two countries in 
addition to the existing arrangements embodied in ABACC, which had been operating successfully 
since 1991. Brazil welcomed the progress achieved in cooperation between the Agency and the 
ABACC under the Quadripartite Agreement. Significant improvements had been made through the 
establishment of guidelines for joint safeguards activities at several nuclear facilities, and of 
procedures for unannounced inspections and for common use of safeguards equipment. More 
improvements still remained to be made and Brazil hoped that the next meeting of the AgreementÂs 
Liaison Committee would be fruitful. Brazil attached great importance to cooperation between the 
Agency and ABACC and requested that both organizations continue to pursue coordination in order to 
avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and achieve cost-effectiveness. 
98. Mr AL-JASEM (Kuwait) said a major increase in the worldÂs energy supply would be necessary 
to meet the worldÂs socio-economic development needs during the coming decades. It was for national 
policy-makers to decide whether to opt for nuclear energy to meet that demand. At their summit 
meeting in December 2006, the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council had adopted a joint 
programme on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and a series of consultations and meetings had 
since been held between Council experts and Agency staff to identify needs and prepare a feasibility 
study, which had now been completed. 
99. He emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs efforts to promote regional and international 
cooperation in finding solutions to the global shortage of drinking water. In resolution 
GC(51)/RES/14, the General Conference had called for support for a plan to use small and mediumsized 
nuclear reactors for cost-effective production of drinking water and for nuclear hydrogen 
production. Water desalination was an issue of vital importance in Kuwait and the Government had 
donated Â10 000 to activities in that area. It looked forward to participating in the meetings of INDAG 
in order to share experience and find ways of expanding research on the use of nuclear technology for 
groundwater desalination. 
100. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme in areas such as agriculture, animal husbandry, 
water resources, energy and environment contributed to the building of national capacities in 
developing countries and to the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Kuwait had 
hosted a variety of regional training courses in cooperation with the Agency. His Government 
regularly paid its full share of the TCF and called on other States to follow suit.

101. Safeguards were the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. He urged all States that had 
not yet signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency to do so forthwith and 
encouraged States that were already implementing an agreement to conclude an additional protocol. 
States party to the NPT should honour their obligations under the Treaty and their safeguards 
agreement and work closely with the Agency to dispel any doubts that arose regarding their 
programme through negotiations and constructive dialogue. 
102. With regard to the idea of holding a forum on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East, he noted that a prerequisite for the achievement of that goal was the application of 
comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region and the accession of all States in the 
region to the NPT. He hoped that an objective and balanced agenda for the forum would be drawn up 
in order to dispel any misgivings regarding the feasibility of achieving its aim. Noting that all States in 
the Middle East except Israel were parties to the NPT and had placed their nuclear facilities under 
Agency safeguards, he called on the international community to protect the region against future crises 
or wars that undermined its security and stability by taking a vigorous and non-discriminatory stand 
vis-Ã -vis any State that had failed to sign the NPT. 
103. Promotion of the safety and security of radioactive sources and nuclear material was a core 
Agency task. It was essential to develop regulations and apply guidelines aimed at controlling 
movements of such material. Kuwait was keen to continue its cooperation with the Agency and other 
relevant organizations in that regard through the implementation of national and regional projects. The 
Agency should liaise with Member States that were building nuclear power plants in order to ensure 
that they took the necessary precautions and applied appropriate safety measures. 
104. With regard to the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, while Kuwait 
acknowledged the right of all countries to develop a nuclear energy programme for peaceful purposes 
in keeping with the NPT, it called on Iran to continue cooperating with the Agency in order to allay 
fears regarding the nature of its programme and to address all outstanding issues. It also urged all 
parties concerned to pursue a policy of diplomacy, dialogue and negotiation to achieve the desired 
objective.

105. Ms INTERIANO TOBAR (El Salvador) said that, with the aim of preserving peace, security 
and stability, 41 years previously her country had adhered to the Tlatelolco Treaty, which was the first 
safeguards treaty in the world and established the first nuclear-weapon-free zone. In adhering to the 
NPT, El Salvador had reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Her 
Government was firmly committed to supporting all instruments and initiatives related to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and recognized the importance of the three main pillars of the 
AgencyÂs activities: safeguards, nuclear safety, and science and technology. Multilateralism was the 
only way to encourage political dialogue aimed at finding formulas for collective cooperation, to 
promote peaceful coexistence among States and to ensure safety. 
106. The CTBT played an important complementary role in nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation efforts, and El Salvador would continue to support the efforts of peace-loving 
countries to achieve its early entry into force. Only a few days previously, the Fourth Ministerial 
Meeting to promote the entry into force of the CTBT had taken place during the 63rd session of the 
United Nations General Assembly. El Salvador had supported the declaration calling on States that 
had not yet done so, particularly those listed in Annex 2 and those which possessed nuclear weapons, 
to sign or ratify the Treaty and maintain a moratorium on nuclear testing to demonstrate their good 
intentions and as a confidence-building measure. In that connection, she expressed appreciation to 
Barbados, Colombia, Iraq and the Dominican Republic for ratifying the Treaty. The international 

GC(52)/OR.4

17 


community should work together to achieve greater transparency in the nuclear field, to create ever 
more effective international safety standards, and to find new measures to prevent proliferation of and 
eliminate nuclear weapons. 

107. The challenges the world was facing at present were extensive and complex. Food security, 
climate change, the energy crisis resulting from high oil prices, and financial problems reflected a 
global crisis which had a negative impact on development efforts. El Salvador supported the AgencyÂs 
existing cooperation with the FAO and the emerging cooperation with the UNEP Environment Fund, 
which was of utmost importance to meet the growing needs of Member States, particularly developing 
countries. 
108. Peace, safety and development were intrinsically connected and international cooperation for 
development played a fundamental role, especially in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
It was therefore essential to ensure fair access to technological resources, transfer of environmentally 
friendly technology and support for the builders of technical capacity, and the Agency made an 
invaluable contribution to the achievement of those goals. 
109. El Salvador appreciated the AgencyÂs technical assistance to developing countries focused on 
nuclear applications in health, agriculture, industry, the environment, hydrology and research in 
various fields. That assistance contributed directly to improving the living conditions of people, and 
human welfare in general. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects contributed significantly to 
sustainable development in all countries, particularly the most vulnerable ones. An example of that 
was the establishment of an isotope hydrology laboratory at the laboratories of the LaGeo company in 
El Salvador, which was the only laboratory of its kind in Central America and provided analytical 
services to various countries in South America and sometimes to Mexico. 
110. Her country collaborated with the Agency within the framework of South-South cooperation by 
providing national experts in such areas as geothermal energy and nuclear instrumentation. It was 
interested in working together with Agency experts in developing a national cancer prevention 
programme. It therefore appreciated the efforts to approve a subregional plan in that regard, an 
initiative resulting from the meeting of health ministers from Central America and the Dominican 
Republic held in San Salvador in September 2007. Her country welcomed the fact that, in 
September 2007, ARCAL and the Agency had officially adopted the Regional Strategic Profile for 
2007Â2012. 
111. El Salvador welcomed the report by the Commission of Eminent Persons and was greatly 
interested in the results of the Scientific Forum taking place during the General Conference which 
would address, inter alia, the future of the Agency. It was essential to join forces to strengthen the 
Agency, thus helping it fulfil its mandate. With that in mind, she urged Member States to focus their 
efforts on a visionary remodelling of the Agency. Her country supported the concept of a revitalized 
world nuclear order that reduced and eradicated the risks of nuclear proliferation for non-peaceful 
purposes, while at the same time allowing for the valuable contribution made by the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology to human welfare. 
112. Her country looked forward to a world free of nuclear weapons, through the work of the United 
Nations and disarmament efforts. The international community had developed instruments and 
initiatives that formed the basis of the non-proliferation regime, and it should continue work towards 
complete disarmament. 
113. The Agency played an essential role in nuclear energy, nuclear applications, non-proliferation 
and safeguards. Its valuable contribution was widely recognized and should be promoted, strengthened 
and legitimized by the Member States. Thanks to the efforts of various Member States, progress had 
been made in international cooperation to strengthen nuclear safety, the safe management of nuclear

18 


waste and radiation protection. However, many countries had still not undertaken commitments in that 
regard and El Salvador urged them to do so. 

114. With the Tlatelolco Treaty, Latin America and the Caribbean had set an example for other 
regions of the world. The path to a world that was more humane, free and safe for future generations 
was in the hands of the international community, and that should guide its actions. 
115. Mr BERNHARD (Denmark) said that the world depended and would continue to depend on the 
Agency in efforts to combat nuclear proliferation. Denmark thus looked forward to becoming a 
member of the Board of Governors in 2009. The AgencyÂs safeguards regime remained the 
fundamental instrument in ensuring nuclear non-proliferation. Yet some States with comprehensive 
safeguards agreements in force had nonetheless developed secret nuclear programmes. All States 
should therefore recognize that the Agency verification standard consisted of both a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol. The NPT was the cornerstone of the global nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and his country welcomed the improved atmosphere at the second 
Preparatory Committee meeting for the 2010 NPT Review Conference earlier in 2008 and hoped for a 
positive outcome at that Conference, avoiding a repetition of the deadlock experienced at the 
2005 NPT Review Conference. 
116. The United Nations Security Council also had a key responsibility for non-proliferation. To 
maintain their credibility, both the Security Council and the Agency had to react promptly and 
consistently when States breached their safeguards commitments or sought to break out of the NPT 
regime. Denmark supported increased Security Council involvement in the area of non-proliferation, 
both in general and in specific cases such as that of Iran. The adoption of Security Council 
resolution 1540 (2004) had been an important step in that direction. 
117. With regard to Iran, his country continued to support a consistent approach by the Security 
Council. In adopting Security Council resolutions 1803 (2008) and 1835 (2008), the international 
community had once more signalled to Iran that its failure to comply with the requirements of the 
Security Council and the Agency was unacceptable. Denmark shared the concerns expressed by the 
Director General and urged Iran to take the steps related to suspension of activities required by the 
Board of Governors and the Security Council, in order to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful 
nature of its nuclear programme. The generous offer of a revised negotiations package put forward by 
the European Union High Representative in June 2008 remained on the table. 
118. Denmark commended the AgencyÂs efforts during inspection visits to the installation at 
Al Kibar in the Syrian Arab Republic. It urged the Syrian authorities to cooperate fully with the 
Agency and show maximum transparency while the samples taken from the site were being analysed 
and evaluated, including by providing access to additional information and sites. 
119. The current stalemate in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the reports of the 
DPRKÂs intention to reopen the Yongbyon facilities and refuse the AgencyÂs inspectors access gave 
serious cause for concern. The considerable progress made since the October 2007 six-party 
agreement that had led to the declaration of 26 June 2008 must not be reversed. 
120. The threat of proliferation to non-State actors such as terrorists had posed a new challenge in 
recent years. Denmark was committed to ensuring that sufficient resources were available under the 
Nuclear Security Fund to address that threat and, in the preceding year, had decided to make a national 
contribution of Â1 million to the Fund. Nuclear and other radioactive material must not fall into the 
hands of terrorists; therefore, joint action was needed to strengthen non-proliferation, nuclear 
verification and export controls. His country had contributed from the outset to the Proliferation 
Security Initiative by playing a lead role with respect to containerized shipments in the maritime 
domain and by facilitating outreach to industry. As it believed that further regional cooperation in that

19 


area was necessary, it planned to organize a regional Proliferation Security Initiative seminar in 
November in Copenhagen. 

121. Denmark believed that nuclear power was not a sustainable form of energy and that it should 
not be included in national energy planning. Hence, while respecting othersÂ choice and noting the 
AgencyÂs mandate as stipulated in its Statute, it was not in favour of a promotional role for the Agency 
in that regard. 
122. Despite reservations about establishing a multilateral nuclear fuel assurance mechanism, his 
country believed in the importance of ensuring that an expansion of civilian nuclear power would not 
result in a further spread of sensitive nuclear fuel cycle technology which could be used for military 
ends. It would therefore consider supporting a multilateral proliferation-safe mechanism that would 
provide an assured nuclear fuel supply for States that had opted for nuclear power, and it called on the 
Agency to play a crucial role in that regard. 
123. Ms DELA ROSA (Philippines) recalled that, since its inception, the Agency had played an 
essential role both in helping Member States achieve their development goals and in upholding global 
peace and security. However, the world faced major new challenges such as high fossil fuel costs, 
climate change and a transformed political environment, all of which affected the relevance and 
effectiveness of the Agency. In that context, the Philippines welcomed the 20/20 initiative of the 
Director General and his establishment of the Commission of Eminent Persons. The CommissionÂs 
report contained a wide-ranging set of bold and innovative initiatives and provided a good basis for 
discussions on the future of the Agency. 
124. An enabling environment for a strengthened global nuclear order was necessary for the Agency 
to meet the challenges and opportunities of the coming decades. The CommissionÂs report referred to 
four important partnerships in that regard, to which the Philippines believed a fifth should be added: 
partnership between nuclear-weapon States, de facto nuclear-weapon States and even States strongly 
believed to have nuclear weapons. Such a partnership was necessary to ensure that neighbouring 
States did not seek to acquire nuclear weapons because they feared for their security. 
125. The renaissance of nuclear energy in the coming two decades would create opportunities and 
challenges for both Member States and the Agency. There was a need for training of a new generation 
of human resources, design of safe, secure, economical and proliferation-resistant reactors, assured 
nuclear fuel supplies, radioactive waste management including disposal, an effective and quick 
radiological emergency response system, and public acceptance. To that end, the Philippines 
supported strengthened cooperation at regional and international level. Her country also viewed with 
interest the CommissionÂs proposals to limit the number of complex nuclear facilities and, with the 
AgencyÂs help, convert them into multinational facilities, such as regional nuclear fuel cycle centres. 
126. Enlarging the contribution of nuclear applications was important not only for the well-being of 
humanity, but also for the universality of benefits to Member States. The Philippines believed that 
expanding the mandate of the Agency in that regard would increase developing countriesÂ support for 
the organization. 
127. As the Commission had rightly stated, the Agency would need a considerable increase in 
resources from Member States in order to be able to carry out its duties properly. Furthermore, the 
statutory and promotional activities of the Agency should be given sufficient, assured and predictable 
funding. 
128. The AgencyÂs safeguards and verification activities played a critical role in ensuring nuclear 
non-proliferation. With regard to the implementation of safeguards in Iran, her country welcomed the 
Director GeneralÂs report to the Board of Governors which indicated that the Agency had been able to 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
20 


continue verifying the non-diversion of declared nuclear material in Iran. However, it was concerned 
over the lack of substantive progress in resolving outstanding issues. Her country called for all parties 
to cooperate fully with the Agency so that it could provide credible assurances of the absence of 
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran. It urged Iran to implement the additional protocol 
and to comply with relevant United Nations Security Council and Agency resolutions as a confidencebuilding 
measure. 

129. With regard to the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, the Philippines noted with concern that 
countryÂs recent announcement of the suspension of its disablement activities. The Philippines 
believed that the six-party talks were the most comprehensive, practical and logical approach to 
achieving the results needed for lasting peace and sustained prosperity in the region. 
130. The Government of the Philippines placed emphasis on the role of science and technology in 
meeting the Millennium Development Goals, and in particular nuclear science and technology. Fifty 
years previously, the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission Â now the Philippine Nuclear Research 
Institute Â had been established to promote and regulate peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
Over that period, the Philippines had worked in partnership with the Agency and had received 
consistent support for the development of nuclear science and technology in the country. Nuclear 
science had been applied in the priority areas of agriculture, health, biotechnology, earth and marine 
sciences, materials science, manufacturing and process engineering, and environment. Her country 
commended the Agency for giving priority to PACT and urged Member States to continue supporting 
the programme through additional contributions. 
131. The Philippines had achieved significant milestones in its environmental activities, using stable 
isotopes and nuclear techniques. Under the RCA programme it had led regional efforts to provide 
more sensitive, faster and cheaper assays for the key toxin in harmful algal blooms. It used nuclear and 
analytical techniques to determine sources of pollution and to establish standards for air quality, to 
characterize groundwater systems, delineate watershed protection zones and put in place preventive 
measures to decrease water quality degradation. 
132. Driven by concerns over global warming and the rapid increase of global oil prices, the 
Philippines was again looking to develop a nuclear power programme to support its development 
needs. Following the Agency expert mission to the country earlier in the year, it was setting up a core 
group to study the rehabilitation of the Bataan nuclear power plant and the national infrastructure 
requirements for launching a nuclear power programme. Preliminary assessment of the existing 
infrastructure had shown that, as a priority, the group needed to address the issues of an independent 
and effective regulatory system, human resources development and stakeholder commitment. A bill 
creating a separate nuclear regulatory commission had just gone through its first public hearing in 
Congress. The Philippines was committed to exploring the possibility of using nuclear power in a 
manner that would ensure nuclear non-proliferation, safety and security. 
133. As many countries turned to nuclear power, nuclear technology would again be put to the test 
and it was therefore essential that the global community address nuclear safety and security and public 
acceptance in a united manner. The Philippines would continue its participation in relevant 
international and regional networks to ensure nuclear and radiation safety and security, nuclear 
education and training, and knowledge management. 
134. Her country commended the work of the Agency to combat the risk of nuclear terrorism and 
assist Member States, including her own, in improving nuclear security. In that area, the Philippines 
also continued to participate in a number of multilateral initiatives. 
135. As more countries looked to nuclear power to meet their increasing need for energy, and as the 
demand for technical cooperation from developing countries rose, the Agency would continue to play 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
21 


a vital role in enabling developing countries to use science and technology for development, and in 
upholding international peace and security. 

136. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that his countryÂs pacifist 
stance and rejection of nuclear weapons were enshrined in its Constitution, which stated expressly that 
the State would prevent the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction and promote nuclear 
disarmament. In that connection, at the start of 2008, a multidisciplinary group comprising 
representatives from Venezuelan ministries and institutions and Agency officials had developed a 
national integrated safety plan for Venezuela covering activities related to nuclear safety and security 
that should be implemented between the end of 2008 and the end of 2011. The Agency had also 
provided assistance in implementing projects related to health, the environment, industry, agriculture 
and radiation safety, including projects to strengthen the national regulatory infrastructure for the 
control of radiation sources, to strengthen the national system for preparedness and response to 
radiological emergencies, and to strengthen and update technical capabilities for protecting the health 
and safety of workers exposed to ionizing radiation. 
137. It was of great importance to his Government to develop integration with other States of Latin 
America and the Caribbean, to strengthen South-South relations and to promote solidarity among 
peoples. Both ARCAL and the Agency provided a favourable setting for working towards those 
objectives, since nuclear science and technology could be tools to drive social and economic progress 
and hence could serve to promote cooperation, solidarity and peaceful coexistence among States. 
Venezuela had chaired the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination Board until May 2008 and would chair 
the Board of ARCAL Representatives until October 2008. During that time it had worked hard on 
institutional strengthening of ARCAL to ensure it met the regionÂs development needs. His country 
welcomed the Dominican RepublicÂs ratification of the ARCAL agreement and hoped that those 
States that had not yet ratified it would intensify their efforts to that end. 
138. He stressed the need to maintain a balance between the three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities. It 
was also important to train human resources at all levels and to transfer technology, which was of key 
importance for development. His country objected to proposals with purely commercial aims that 
imposed limitations on countries in developing nuclear technology. 
139. Venezuela upheld the international principles of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and 
believed that the total elimination of such weapons was the most effective way of tackling the 
challenges posed by their existence, including the possibility of a nuclear accident or attack. Practical 
steps taken by his country over the preceding year included renewing the authorization required to 
operate the three detection and monitoring antennae set up under the CTBT which were located on 
Venezuelan territory and were part of a global network. Negotiations had also been resumed on the 
agreement on the conduct of activities, including post-certification activities, relating to CTBT 
international monitoring facilities. Venezuela was convinced that support for the CTBT would help 
meet the objective of ensuring a higher level of security. The entry into force of the CTBT was a moral 
imperative, as it would check the development of new nuclear weapons. 
140. Venezuela had participated in the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 
2010 NPT Review Conference held in Geneva in April and May 2008, thereby reaffirming its 
commitment to the Treaty. The NPT, which was the cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation 
regime, remained under a lot of pressure. Nuclear agreements were being signed with 
States that were not party to the Treaty; the existence of military nuclear programmes not subject to 
Agency monitoring was being ignored, while other countries were being hounded for wishing to 
exercise their right to access nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; under the pretext of fighting 
terrorism, a process had been restarted with the objective of developing and producing new and more 
destructive nuclear weapons. A multipolar world was emerging, marked by the appearance of new 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
22 


State and non-State actors and the fact that more and more countries were becoming interested in 
using their right to benefit from the peaceful applications of nuclear technology. Out of a total of seven 
NPT Review Conferences, only three had succeeded in issuing a final declaration. Expectations for the 
2010 NPT Review Conference were not high but, given that the problem was not the Treaty itself, but 
a lack of political commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament on the part of key 
stakeholders, Venezuela Â a country that did not believe in the usefulness of such weapons as a 
deterrent Â hoped that, in the time remaining before the Conference, some optimistic signs might be 
seen as regards the future of the NPT, including its universalization. 

141. His country supported the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as an 
effective contribution to peace and stability. It was essential that Israel joined most other countries of 
the world, including all Arab States, and adhere to the NPT, allowing the Agency to apply safeguards 
to its nuclear facilities. That need had become even more pressing since the Israeli GovernmentÂs 
public announcement that it possessed nuclear weapons. 
142. Efforts related to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation had to be made in a multilateral, 
simultaneous and non-discriminatory manner. Venezuela rejected the trend to view the nuclear 
programmes of some countries as not posing any threat to the world while others did. His country thus 
disagreed with the assumption by the United Nations Security Council of competencies that were 
assigned exclusively to the Agency in dealing with IranÂs nuclear programme. Such interference 
affected the AgencyÂs authority and credibility, undermining the independence that should 
characterize the functioning of agencies and bodies of the United Nations system. Venezuela was 
convinced that the Agency was the appropriate technical forum to seek a peaceful and negotiated 
solution with the Iranian authorities. 
143. There was no justification for discriminatory practices that contravened the principle of the legal 
equality of States, forcing some countries to comply with obligations under international agreements 
while others were exempted from the same requirements. Combating unconfirmed threats from some 
States should not be used as a reason to violate the inalienable right of all countries to have access to 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, or to justify attacks against other countries, for example IsraelÂs 
attack on Syria in September 2007. Such actions constituted a flagrant violation of the United Nations 
Charter and obstructed the work of the Agency in its verification activities. It was worrying that some 
countries in the international community had remained silent on those issues but did not hesitate to 
fabricate any number of documents to make accusations against countries that were party to the NPT 
and had safeguards agreements with the Agency. 
144. 
He thanked the Director General and the Commission of Eminent Persons for their efforts in 
preparing the report on the AgencyÂs role up to 2020 and beyond, presented in May 2008. His country 
had a few preliminary observations to make on that report. Firstly, the organization of nuclear fuel 
supply mechanisms was being led by a small group of countries. The topic deserved wider and more 
in-depth analysis, given the various implications Â including economic and national security 
implications Â of such a mechanism, where political motives could clearly be brought into play. 
Secondly, the report stated that transparency going well beyond the measures called for in the 
additional protocol was needed to provide confidence that a StateÂs nuclear programme was entirely 
peaceful. That notion had been applied in the case of IranÂs nuclear programme. Venezuela had 
rejected it then and would continue to do so, regardless of which country wished to apply it. Trying to 
impose rules which went beyond those agreed under legal instruments in force would destabilize the 
relationship between the Agency and Member States and raise doubts regarding the legal documents 
themselves. Thirdly, the report stated that the United Nations Security Council should go beyond its 
resolution 1540 (2004) by legally imposing safeguards obligations going well beyond the additional 
protocol. Venezuela rejected that resolution as it gave the Security Council inappropriate rights and 
functions which only served to undermine international treaties that had been negotiated multilaterally 

GC(52)/OR.4

September 
2008,

23 


and ratified by each State Party. It also imposed on all countries legal obligations laid down by a 
limited and privileged group of States, namely those comprising the Security Council. Venezuela 
would not consider the possibility of giving even more extraordinary functions to the Security Council 
and asking it to impose safeguards obligations that were not included in an agreement negotiated with 
the competent body in the nuclear field Â namely the Agency Â and adopted voluntarily by States, 
like the additional protocol. 

145. Mr HORVATIC (Croatia) said that his country had recently completed a two-year term as a 
member of the Board of Governors, which had reinforced its view of the importance and mutual 
interdependence of all three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities, i.e. safety and security, science and 
technology, and safeguards and verification, and of the AgencyÂs objectives, i.e. non-proliferation and 
the peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
146. The threat of nuclear terrorism and other criminal acts involving nuclear material remained very 
real. From the beginning, Croatia had recognized the importance of and had actively participated in 
the adoption of international instruments and United Nations Security Council resolutions related to 
those issues. In addition to belonging to the international legal framework and re-evaluating and 
improving its domestic law in the field of nuclear security, Croatia had established a strategy and 
relevant institutional capacities to combat illicit trafficking. The main aim of the strategy was to 
prevent terrorists and non-State actors acquiring nuclear weapons. Strong international cooperation, in 
particular regional cooperation, was needed to achieve those security goals. Croatia participated in 
numerous non-proliferation initiatives, regional seminars and training courses, and fostered export 
control and border control management. 
147. Security and development were always interdependent, and the AgencyÂs role as a focal point 
for peaceful nuclear cooperation, in which it served as a development partner, was important. 
Technical assistance was of the utmost importance for developing countries and Croatia strongly 
appreciated activities in that area. His country recognized the role and significance of PACT and 
programmes in other nuclear applications fields, such as food and agriculture, industry, environment, 
hydrology and biological and physical research, which made an important direct contribution to 
human well-being. 
148. His country believed that further strengthening Agency technical assistance would improve 
safeguards implementation, allowing some potential sensitive verification issues to be avoided in the 
future. It viewed a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol as the 
current Agency verification standard. Croatia had implemented both an agreement and an additional 
protocol and was one of the States in which the Secretariat had found no indication of diversion of 
declared nuclear material and no indication of undeclared nuclear material and activities. It had also 
concluded an exchange of letters with the Agency on an SQP in 2008 and hoped that that instrument 
would strengthen the safeguards system as a whole. 
149. The NPT was the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the foundation for 
the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and an important element for further development of nuclear 
energy applications for peaceful purposes. It was the sole multilateral legal instrument intended to 
bring about a nuclear-weapon-free world and must not be undermined. Croatia hoped that the 
forthcoming 2010 NPT Review Conference would have a positive outcome. That would require a 
cooperative approach and mutual trust, which it was part of the AgencyÂs role Â as the custodian of 
the NPT Â to ensure. 
150. The Scientific Forum on the future role of the Agency and the report of the Commission of 
Eminent Persons had both indicated that the Agency was at a crossroads. Member States could 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
24 


succeed in finding the right path for that noble organization only by working together in a good 
multilateral environment, bearing in mind statutory obligations and objectives. 

151. Mr MARFURT (Switzerland), also speaking on behalf of Liechtenstein, said that, since the 
preceding General Conference, non-proliferation had continued to dominate diplomatic agendas. Like 
the first, the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference had 
ended with the adoption of a purely procedural report. The rift remained between States wishing to 
concentrate exclusively on efforts to prevent proliferation and States wishing to focus on disarmament 
or those concerned by restrictions on access to nuclear technologies, and there was no sign of a 
possible change in that situation. 
152. Regional issues had also been at the top of the agenda in the preceding year and, with the 
exception of the Libyan nuclear file, the outlook was not particularly encouraging. The decision of the 
NSG no longer to require comprehensive safeguards as a condition of nuclear cooperation with India 
had undoubtedly been a striking development. While the decision had been facilitated by India 
reaffirming a number of commitments related to non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, in 
particular to continue to respect the moratorium on nuclear explosions, it posed new challenges to the 
aims of universalization of the NPT and application of comprehensive Agency safeguards, including 
the additional protocol. The non-proliferation regime had reached a turning point and Member States 
would have to reflect on how a universal non-proliferation regime could be achieved. 
153. The situation regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, described in the AgencyÂs most recent 
report, also remained unsatisfactory. The Agency had not been able to make headway on the alleged 
studies and Iran had continued its enrichment-related activities in breach of Security Council and 
Board resolutions, which was all the more regrettable as progress had been made leading up to the 
Geneva talks in July 2008. Switzerland believed that the prospect of a diplomatic solution Â the only 
practicable solution Â remained real. It therefore encouraged Iran to make constructive and urgent 
efforts, both in its cooperation with the Agency and with regard to the package proposal of the five 
permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany, to allow rapid implementation of the 
Âfreeze-for-freezeÂ concept. 
154. After some positive developments, such as the DPRKÂs submission of a list of its nuclear 
facilities and programmes in June 2008, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsular seemed again to 
have reached deadlock. The discussion process had stalled over the verification mechanism issue and 
Pyongyang had demanded that the Agency remove seals and surveillance instruments at the Yongbyon 
reprocessing facility with a view to resuming its activities. Those developments ran counter to the 
commitment made by the DPRK to dismantle all its nuclear facilities. Consequently, Switzerland 
reiterated its call to the DPRK to rejoin the NPT so that the Agency could resume activities in the 
country to the full extent of its mandate. 
155. In the light of the oral report by the Director General on the Syrian nuclear programme during 
the recent meeting of the Board of Governors, his country commended Syria on its cooperation which 
had allowed the Agency to inspect the Al Kibar site in July 2008. It called on States holding specific 
information to share it with the Agency, thus confirming its role as the sole competent verification 
authority. As announced during the meetings of the Board the preceding week, Switzerland awaited 
the AgencyÂs conclusions on analyses currently under way and encouraged Syria to pursue its 
cooperation with the Agency. 
156. His country was satisfied with the accounts for 2007 and thanked the External Auditor for his 
recommendations. In recent years, Switzerland had repeatedly called for efforts to include all 
expenditure in the Regular Budget and, after various exceptions, it had expected that future increases 
for both the Regular Budget and technical cooperation could be limited to adjustments for inflation. 

GC(52)/OR.4

25 


However, the budget proposal for 2009, which had been accepted by consensus at the most recent 
meetings of the Board, regrettably did not show any improvement in that area. The commitment of all 
Member States to activities jointly approved and funded was under threat. His country reiterated its 
call for the inclusion, after rigorous planning, of all planned investments in the Regular Budget for 
reasons of transparency and budget predictability. It also sympathized with those countries that had 
expressed concern regarding the protection of the technical cooperation activities against fluctuations 
in exchange rates. 

157. Switzerland attached great importance to technical cooperation activities and to maintaining a 
balance between technical cooperation and verification activities. It welcomed the fact that the 
contribution payment target had largely been achieved, that the programme implementation rate had 
been very good and that the due account mechanism was having a positive impact on project 
implementation. It was equally pleased that the Agency was pursuing its commitment to the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
158. His country was pleased with the annual Safeguards Implementation Report, in particular the 
conclusions drawn for States party to the NPT with comprehensive safeguards agreements in force. It 
was also pleased to note that inspection goals had been met very satisfactorily and that declared 
nuclear material had remained in peaceful use. With regard to integrated safeguards, his country 
supported the External AuditorÂs call for a more detailed analysis of the reduction in costs that regime 
would bring. It was concerned to note that the cost of applying safeguards had increased by more than 
15%, though the number of States where integrated safeguards were fully or partially applied was on 
the rise. 
159. With regard to the disposal of high-level long-lived waste, in the preceding year consultations 
had been initiated in Switzerland on a roadmap for the creation of depositories in deep geological 
strata. The aim was to commission one such depository by 2050. Affected Swiss and foreign parties 
had given an opportunity to express their views, those views had been evaluated and the concept 
adapted accordingly, and the Government had recently been able to adopt the roadmap. 
160. Switzerland had five reactors in operation and believed that those power plants, which had been 
designed in the 1960s, would be replaced after 50 years of use. One of the companies owning one of 
the two large units had recently submitted a plan for a new power plant and a second company was 
expected to announce a second plan in the coming months. Public consultations on the construction of 
a new nuclear power plant would mostly likely take place in 2012. 
161. Mr NSEMUKILA (Zambia) informed the Conference of the death of the late President of 
Zambia, Dr Levy Patrick Mwanawasa, who had died on 19 August 2008 after suffering a stroke while 
attending an African Union summit in Egypt. Dr Mwanawasa had been instrumental in achieving 
recognition of the developmental role of science and technology in ZambiaÂs development agenda and, 
under his guidance, significant progress had been made in developing capacity in those fields in the 
country. He had strongly supported the development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its 
regulation. Under his leadership, Zambian radiation protection laws had been strengthened. He was 
credited with having turned around the Zambian economy in the preceding seven years and he had 
also been a recognized champion of justice for all, both within Zambia and beyond its borders. 
162. His country welcomed the measures aimed at strengthening technical cooperation activities with 
Member States. The AgencyÂs programme on nutrition and management of HIV/AIDS and ZambiaÂs 
national projects on that subject had proved to be of great benefit. In the area of medical diagnosis and 
treatment, the installation of a new SPECT gamma camera had revolutionized the work of ZambiaÂs 
University Teaching Hospital.

163. Zambia had taken steps to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radioactive sources 
by strengthening its legal framework and ensuring the safety of material. Regulations on uranium 
mining, milling and processing, which had been developed in consultation with the Agency, would be 
adopted in the near future. An independent radiation protection authority was being set up and the 
capacity of the national Mines Safety Department was being strengthened. The Zambian Government 
would require the support of the Agency and other partners to ensure that the country had state-ofthe-
art technology to ensure that its population was safe from the harmful effects of uranium mining, 
as well as technology for the safe management of uranium. 
164. His country was happy with the focus of the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2009 and the 
support given to the technical cooperation programme. ZambiaÂs CPF was being revised and should be 
ready before 2009. The country continued to build on the benefits it had gained from that programme. 
Developments since the preceding General Conference included the hosting of a regional training 
course on ICT-based training and the establishment of a nutrition monitoring laboratory. 
165. Zambia continued to support AFRA, which should be congratulated for continuing to mobilize 
specialized teams of experts that addressed problems of AFRA member States using expertise and 
capacity within the region. Since the preceding General Conference, his country had received AFRA 
missions in various fields. Zambian scientific and technical staff had participated in training courses 
and seminars, as well as coordination meetings and programmes. He appealed to partners to continue 
to support AFRA financially in order to ensure that the various projects planned could be carried out. 
166. His country fully supported the AgencyÂs safeguards work throughout the world. Safeguards 
measures should continue to be comprehensive, non-selective and global. It therefore was essential 
that all Member States facilitated and supported the AgencyÂs work. 
167. Finally, Zambia pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2009. 
168. Mr BAZOBERRY (Bolivia) commended the Director General on his initiative in establishing 
the Commission of Eminent Persons to reflect on the nature and scope of the AgencyÂs programme up 
to 2020 and beyond. 
169. Tackling disarmament and non-proliferation was essential to maintain world peace and security 
in a multilateral context. 
170. Rising population figures and the need for progress on the Millennium Development Goals 
made it necessary to confront critical issues such as energy, food security, availability of potable 
water, conservation of resources and protection of the environment. Water shortages and rising fossil 
fuel prices led to lower food and slowed industrial development, which could cause a global crisis 
affecting, above all, developing countries. He drew attention to Agency activities related to the 
application of nuclear and isotopic techniques in the management of water resources and groundwater, 
in connection with the impact of climate change on water resources, and to the support the Agency 
provided through programmes on nuclear power, nuclear applications and technical cooperation. 
171. The Annual Report for 2007 highlighted significant progress in the AgencyÂs activities related 
to the application of peaceful nuclear technology, global safety and security of nuclear and 
radiological material and facilities, and verification of non-proliferation commitments. Such activities 
remained vital to maximizing the benefits of the use of nuclear energy for the economic and social 
development of Member States, and to preventing misuse for non-peaceful purposes. 
172. Bolivia commended the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen further the technical cooperation 
programme, allowing three new projects to be included in the 2007Â2008 cycle two of which were for 
the regional programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean. His country attached importance to 
early implementation of the Regional Strategic Profile for Latin America and the Caribbean which,

along with the work of SAGTAC, should help promote the existing strategic alliance between ARCAL 
and the Agency through an ongoing consultation process that optimized cooperation activities. 

173. The Agency should continue its efforts to establish partnerships with other regional agencies to 
strengthen technical cooperation programmes. Planned partnerships with PAHO, the Ibero-American 
Programme of Science and Technology for Development (CYTED) and the Latin American Energy 
Organization (OLADE) should help expand the scope of technical cooperation significantly. 
174. The Agency was making a noticeable contribution to meeting the Millennium Development 
Goals through projects aimed at the use and promotion of nuclear technology for sustainable 
development. Bolivia welcomed the fact that the Agency was elaborating modalities for integrating 
environmental considerations into technical cooperation activities. It noted the recommendations made 
by the Focus Group on the Environment, which had set out three main objectives for the AgencyÂs 
regular and technical cooperation programmes: protection of humans and the ecosystem from ionizing 
radiation; optimization of the benefits for the environment of nuclear technology; and facilitation of 
the sustainable use and management of natural resources. 
175. The Bolivian Government was aware of the negative consequences of accelerated degradation 
of the environment. For that reason, it had put together the National Development Plan 2006Â2010 
aimed at rational and sustainable exploitation of forest resources and biodiversity, both with respect to 
primary production and industrialization, with a view to improving the living conditions of the 
population and, above all, indigenous communities. That policy was based on the principle of 
restoring a balance between the need to conserve nature and socio-economic sustainable development 
needs. 
176. The importance of the work done by PACT should be recognized. That programme allowed 
cancer patients to have access to preventive care and radiotherapy treatment in many developing 
countries. The Agency was also providing valuable assistance in building national capacity. He 
thanked those countries and institutions that supported PACT and urged them to continue their 
support. Bolivia occupied third place globally in terms of the incidence of cervical cancer, with a rate 
of 55 per 100 000 persons. It had benefited from human resources training, and the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme for the 2007Â2008 biennium contained three projects: one on upgrading the 
cancer treatment programme in Bolivia, a second on upgrading radiotherapy services, and a third on 
strengthening nuclear medicine in Bolivia. 
177. Bolivia was utilizing the advantages offered to it with a view to the democratization of nuclear 
energy and was striving to reduce poverty, because poverty had a highly negative and dangerous effect 
on development. Poverty and energy, and energy and sustainable development were linked. Slowed 
development led to greater poverty, which affected peace and security. 
178. The NPT was the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and it underpinned global 
security and stability. Non-proliferation and disarmament were inseparable in his countryÂs view and 
the rational conduct of States in the use of nuclear energy should therefore become the new watchword 
for the twenty-first century. Bolivia was confident that the Agency, as the sole competent authority in 
the nuclear field, would continue to play a key role in verification and compliance with obligations 
under safeguards agreements. 
179. It was crucial to maintain and strengthen the universality, authority and relevancy of the NPT. 
Therefore, Bolivia called on States possessing nuclear weapons to join the NPT as soon as possible. 
Had not the bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki provided an adequate example of the 
destructive consequences of weapons of mass destruction? The celebration of the 50th anniversary of 
the Brussels Expo 58 was, for his country, a milestone in the search for consensus on the rights and 
obligations of all States under the Charter of the United Nations.

180. Mr DÃAZ (Mexico) said that the Annual Report for 2007 made timely reference to challenges 
related to energy supplies, human health, food security and conservation and protection of natural 
resources, and gave a comprehensive account of the activities undertaken by the Agency in those 
areas. In the context of the 50th anniversary of the Agency, the report should be read as an 
introspective review of what the Agency had been and had done. In addition, Member States should 
also reflect on the AgencyÂs place in the world nuclear regime and the world nuclear order in the 
coming decades. No less important was to consider how the Agency should be positioned to face 
emerging international challenges. Mexico supported the consolidation of a world nuclear order based 
on multilaterally agreed rules. 
181. It was important that the AgencyÂs efforts continue, maintaining a balanced and equitable 
approach to cooperation, safety and verification activities, and thus ensuring genuine peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. Mexico welcomed the contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
made over the preceding year by technical cooperation projects on such sensitive issues as eradication 
of extreme poverty and hunger, reduction of infant mortality, improving maternal health, combating 
HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and ensuring environmental sustainability. His country wished 
to emphasize the benefits to be derived from the peaceful use of nuclear energy through application of 
relevant technologies in key areas for economic and social development, such as agriculture and 
stockbreeding, food, human health, sustainable water resources management, combating insect pests, 
industry and research; and it called on the Agency to increase its efforts to disseminate information on 
such benefits in order to improve support for the use of nuclear energy and thus attract increased 
financial contributions for that purpose. 
182. In the 50 years for which it had been a member of the Agency, Mexico had recognized the 
importance of exchange of nuclear knowledge and transfer of nuclear technology to maintain and 
improve its scientific and technological capacities. Technical cooperation with the Agency had been 
an important factor in introducing nuclear technology in the country, including nuclear power. There 
had also been significant progress in nuclear medicine, control of pests using the SIT, irradiation of 
food and surgical materials, and use of isotopes in water resources management and in industry and 
research. 
183. His country collaborated extensively with other Latin American and Caribbean countries 
through ARCAL, a mechanism which was currently being strengthened so that it could play a more 
active role in the region. 
184. Mexico shared concerns over the lack of human resources training, which was needed for 
continued development of expanding activities in the nuclear sector and to replace some staff close to 
retirement. It was important to bolster opportunities for training new staff and the Agency was well 
positioned to expand the capacities of higher education institutions and research centres. 
185. The negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the purchasing power of the TCF was 
cause for concern and possible solutions, and a more flexible mechanism for national participation 
costs, needed to be discussed and analysed. 
186. He commended the AgencyÂs activities aimed at improving the safety of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, specifically its work on the safety and security of nuclear material and facilities and 
the related international legal infrastructure. At the invitation of the Agency, Mexico had offered to 
host the ConvEx3 large-scale international emergency response exercise in 2008 in which 75 Member 
States, 9 international organizations and 8 observer countries had participated, as well as relevant 
national bodies. The exercise had helped to identify areas for improvement in the nuclear emergency 
response system at national, international and international organization level. MexicoÂs response 
capabilities had been registered under the Response Assistance Network and he called on the 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
29 


international community to integrate their capabilities into the network, which would facilitate the 
AgencyÂs efforts in handling radiological emergencies. 

187. In June 2007, Mexico had organized a meeting of the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological 
and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies. The ForumÂs efforts to reinforce nuclear and radiological regulation 
had proved highly successful, of immediate use and complementary to Agency efforts. 
188. His country had supported the Convention on Nuclear Safety from the outset and had acted as 
vice-chair of the fourth meeting of the Contracting Parties. It submitted its periodic reports on the 
nuclear safety of the countryÂs reactors on time. 
189. Mexico supported the AgencyÂs efforts related to the safety and security of radioactive sources 
and had participated in the meetings organized by the Agency in 2007 and 2008 to exchange 
information on application of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
The Mexican regulatory authority was exchanging information on the import and/or export of 
radioactive sources and was negotiating with the Government of Canada on a possible cooperation 
agreement in that area. 
190. At the request of the Government of Mexico, the Agency had sent an International Nuclear 
Security Advisory Service mission to assess the detection mechanisms and response capability of 
several of MexicoÂs strategic facilities in order to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and/or 
radioactive material and acts of nuclear terrorism. 
191. Mexico reiterated its support for the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, 
in particular those aimed at the full implementation of the safeguards obligations of all Member States. 
In that connection, he thanked the Agency for the role it had played, particularly during recent months, 
in negotiations on the application of safeguard agreements. 
192. His country welcomed the progress in the execution of the work plan between Iran and the 
Agency and encouraged the Government of Iran to intensify its cooperation and to collaborate actively 
with the Agency to clarify outstanding issues and provide clear assurances that its programme was 
strictly for peaceful purposes. Mexico also called on the DPRK to continue to cooperate with the 
Agency and to renew its commitment to the NPT. 
193. Mexico congratulated the Government of India on its decision to conclude a safeguards 
agreement with the Agency in August 2008 and encouraged the Indian authorities to join the NPT and 
the CTBT as an additional sign of the countryÂs commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation. 
194. With regard to the report of the Commission of Eminent Persons, Mexico supported the reportÂs 
approach and the call to strengthen the activities of the international community related to 
non-proliferation, disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It noted the main areas of 
opportunity and the challenges identified by the Commission, as well as the need for solid partnerships 
to address them. Mexico would bear those recommendations in mind in discussions within the 
AgencyÂs policy-making organs and, where appropriate, in other world nuclear bodies. 
195. Expansion of the use of nuclear energy would increase safety needs and the AgencyÂs 
responsibilities, with implications for both fuel supplies and the financial costs faced by Member 
States. Mexico was analysing the proposals put forward by the Director General and Member States 
relating to multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle in order to strengthen control and prevent 
diversion to illicit activities, and it was prepared to discuss them. 
196. In the preceding decade, the financial contributions of some developing countries and 
economies in transition had risen considerably and changes in assessment rates and increases in 
international organizationsÂ budgets were of great concern to many countries. Mexico had drawn 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
30 


attention to that situation in the relevant bodies of the United Nations system and had pointed to the 
causes and possible solutions. His country promoted the effective and efficient use of financial 
resources by adopting properly justified budgets. It looked for savings, additional funding mechanisms 
and efficient budgeting. 

197. Mexico reaffirmed its commitment to continue to work with the Agency and Member States to 
disseminate and improve the use of nuclear technology for development and the welfare of 
populations. In view of the emerging challenges, serious reflection on reinforcement of the world 
nuclear order was needed. 
198. Mr OLIVEIRA (ABACC) said that, during its 17 years of existence, ABACC had successfully 
applied the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (SCCC) created under 
the Agreement for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy which entered into force in 1991. 
The Quadripartite Agreement had been signed and applied as of 1994 with a view to avoiding 
unnecessary duplication of activities. ABACCÂs role was fully recognized and accepted in 
international forums. Its credibility was founded upon the skills and dedication of many officials, 
technicians, assistants and inspectors. Constant guidance and supervision had also been provided by 
members of the ABACC Commission. ABACC applied the SCCC to all existing nuclear material in 
approximately 70 nuclear facilities in Argentina and Brazil and performed around 110 inspections per 
year, confirming that both countries were carrying out their nuclear activities in full compliance with 
their nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation commitments at both bi-national and international level. 
In fulfilling its mission, ABACC faced constant challenges. It had always had the full support of both 
countries, which provided the necessary human and financial resources, making available the existing 
technical infrastructure in their own nuclear organizations. 
199. The world was experiencing a renaissance of nuclear energy. Various international forums were 
unanimous in affirming that the importance of nuclear energy in the future global energy mix was 
closely linked to the capacity to respond satisfactorily to concerns over safety, nuclear waste and 
proliferation risks. Such concerns demonstrated the importance of international non-proliferation 
treaties and the mechanisms and organizations responsible for the application of safeguards and 
physical protection. The governments of Argentina and Brazil had both decided to resume their 
respective nuclear programmes for peaceful purposes. In February 2008, the Presidents of both 
countries had reiterated their commitment to nuclear cooperation, laying the foundations for joint work 
in such areas as nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment. The political decision to reactivate nuclear 
programmes and to embark on joint ventures not only raised the growth prospects for the entire 
nuclear production chain of both countries, but also opened up opportunities for ABACC and extended 
its responsibilities. In that connection, its experience in constructing a common safeguards system 
could be very useful in the implementation of the new joint ventures, bearing in mind that ABACC 
was the first fully operational bi-national organization created by the two countries. Any joint venture 
involved many interactions, each one entailing problems, and ABACC had accumulated a great deal of 
experience in that regard since its creation. In keeping with the times, ABACCÂs Secretariat, in line 
with the guidance of the Commission, had endeavoured to keep abreast of new challenges, seeking to 
improve its administrative and technical activities. 
200. The Agency needed to collaborate with national and regional systems, taking into account their 
technical capabilities, in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards, as had been 
recognized in Programme 93+2. 
201. In December 2007, the AgencyÂs Director General had visited ABACC headquarters. That had 
strengthened mutual understanding and promoted cooperation between the two bodies. 

GC(52)/OR.4

202. The procedures for short notice random inspections at fuel fabrication plants and conversion 
plants had been approved. They were the result of coordinated work by the authorities of Argentina 
and Brazil, operators in both countries and the Agency. Both countries also used the mailbox system 
for sending nuclear information electronically between the various organizations, national authorities 
and operators involved. 
203. As regards inspection coordination activities, ABACC and the Agency had set up video 
conferencing that would be used to hold pre-inspection meetings, thus optimizing the availability of 
inspectors during safeguards missions and providing a faster means of exchanging ideas on inspection 
activities. The system would also be used for other types of meetings between the two institutions, and 
for contact between ABACC and other organizations. 
204. With regard to procedures for the common use of equipment, both institutions were trying to 
make the new requirements and criteria compatible with existing internal ones, in such a way as not to 
impair the agreed common use of equipment. The climate of mutual trust which had always facilitated 
the achievement of excellent results in ABACCÂs relationship with the Agency should also allow that 
issue to be resolved successfully. 
205. With regard to new safeguards methodologies and equipment, ABACC was proud to state that 
the testing of the UF6 
sampling method (the ABACC-Cristallini method) performed at various 
laboratories around the world continued to show that that method would eventually replace the current 
sampling technique, as it was less costly and produced less waste. 
206. ABACC, in collaboration with the Agency, had also performed tests with a new line of 
surveillance cameras being used by the Agency which would be used in various safeguards activities 
in the near future, principally at facilities where portable cameras were needed. 
207. Many technical and coordination meetings had also been held between the two agencies. Apart 
from items covered by the Quadripartite Agreement, other issues to be discussed included application 
of the Âstate of healthÂ, joint inspection activities, procedures for common use of equipment, the design 
information verification plan and new safeguards approaches. 
208. The next meeting of the Liaison Committee established by the Quadripartite Agreement would 
be held in December 2008 in Rio de Janeiro. At that meeting, representatives would analyse the results 
obtained and establish guidelines for future actions under the Agreement. 
209. In order to ensure high-quality work, ABACC, in cooperation with the Agency, promoted the 
holding of courses in its various fields of activity with the participation of inspectors from both 
agencies. In its bid for excellence, the ABACC Secretariat had kept abreast of developments taking 
place internationally, paying particular attention to new surveillance technologies, including new types 
of cameras and a laser system for use in safeguards. Significant support had been provided for those 
activities through cooperation agreements with the Agency, the United States Department of Energy 
and Euratom. 
210. With regard to technical cooperation between ABACC and the Republic of Korea, represented 
by the Korea Institute of Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Control, the agenda had been set for the 
meeting that was to be held soon in Korea and the topics for exchange of information had been 
determined, including short notice random inspections and the new systems and equipment used at 
CANDU reactors. 
211. Mr LIEDERMANN (Sovereign Order of Malta) said that the Sovereign Order of Malta, as the 
oldest humanitarian entity founded 900 years ago, was concerned at the changes that had occurred in 
recent decades. The number of extremely vulnerable people in the world was growing, and there was 

GC(52)/OR.4 
30 
September 
2008, 
Page 
32 


therefore a need for a strong civil society with effective voluntary organizations able to mobilize 
public good will and meet current challenges. 

212. The Order maintained full diplomatic relations with 100 countries, had permanent missions to 
the United Nations in New York, Vienna and Geneva and carried out hospital and charitable missions 
throughout the world through its national associations and diplomatic channels. It was involved in 
medical assistance, combating leprosy, aiding the handicapped and children in difficulties, medical 
research, the collection and distribution of medicine, education, assisting the aged, and aiding war 
victims and refugees. It administered hospitals, dispensaries, cure and rehabilitation centres, welcome 
centres, crÃ¨ches, mobile schools and camps. To respond to emergencies, the Order had formed 
voluntary agencies and first aid corps in many countries. Of particular note were the OrderÂs activities 
in developing countries and countries menaced by civil war. 
213. The OrderÂs international relief organization, Malteser International, ran medical emergency 
operations and long-term reconstruction and development programmes worldwide. Twenty 
associations belonged to Malteser International, which ran missions in 30 countries. 
214. The changes over the preceding years had shown how current and pressing the need was for a 
commitment to support non-proliferation, encourage the use of peaceful and safe nuclear technology, 
respect the environment and be mindful of the most disadvantaged people. Many positive benefits 
could be derived from nuclear technology in vital fields such as food security and medicine. The work 
of the Agency through the nuclear applications programme and PACT received ample support from 
the Order. 
215. As some of the achievements of the ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ ideal, he highlighted the eradication of 
the tsetse fly from Zanzibar using the SIT, assistance to help countries improve their radiotherapy and 
nuclear medicine programmes, the effort to aid Bangladesh in dealing with arsenic-poisoned 
groundwater, and the development of various types of enhanced wheat across North Africa and barley 
in the Andes in Peru. 
216. Over the preceding half-century, the Agency had played an important technical role in support 
of peace, security and development. Such efforts required serious multilateralism based on collective 
security, capable of building a real climate of peace and trust for everyone, and Â in the tradition of 
the Order Â an attitude of caring for the sick and poor, for those in need and for the most 
marginalized members of society.

1. 
Mr 
ALOBIDI 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
reaffirmed 
the 
right 
of 
all 
Member 
States 
without 
distinction 
to 
obtain 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
He 
warned 
against 
interpreting 
any 
provision 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
adversely 
influenced 
the 
development, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
against 
imposing 
restrictions 
on 
the 
export 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
2. 
Welcoming 
recent 
achievements 
under 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
water 
resources 
management, 
he 
said 
that 
Libya 
had 
hosted 
a 
number 
of 
important 
activities 
such 
as 
the 
eighth 
meeting 
of 
national 
coordinators 
of 
AFRA 
projects, 
a 
quality 
control 
conference, 
three 
coordination 
meetings 
on 
quality 
assurance, 
three 
training 
courses 
in 
medicine, 
the 
healthcare 
industry 
and 
health 
physics, 
and 
a 
workshop 
for 
AFRA 
Member 
States 
on 
developing 
infrastructure 
for 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Libya 
had 
submitted 
five 
proposals 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
during 
the 
period 
2009Â2011 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
water, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
energy 
planning. 
All 
five 
had 
been 
accepted 
as 
national 
projects. 
3. 
Libya 
invariably 
paid 
its 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
plan 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation 
and 
water 
desalination, 
it 
had 
established 
a 
nuclear 
institution 
and 
invited 
specialized 
international 
companies 
to 
make 
relevant 
presentations 
of 
advanced 
nuclear 
technology, 
especially 
nuclear 
reactors. 
Libya 
had 
also 
entered 
into 
negotiations 
with 
a 
number 
of 
States 
that 
had 
led 
to 
the 
signing 
of 
agreements 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Thus, 
it 
had 
signed 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
with 
the 
French 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
in 
2006 
and 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
French 
Government 
in 
2008; 
it 
had 
initialled 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
which 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
signed 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year; 
it 
had 
signed 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
with 
the 
Argentine 
Infab 
company 
in 
2006 
and 
had 
submitted 
a 
draft 
cooperation 
agreement 
with 
the 
Argentine 
Government, 
to 
which 
it 
was 
awaiting 
a 
response; 
it 
was 
studying 
a 
draft 
cooperation 
agreement 
between 
Libya 
and 
Ukraine; 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
a 
draft 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
between 
Libya 
and 
Canada 
which 
would 
shortly 
be 
signed; 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
had 
been 
signed 
with 
the 
Korean 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 
service 
company 
in 
2005; 
and 
a 
science 
and 
technology 
cooperation 
agreement 
covering 
energy 
in 
general 
had 
been 
signed 
with 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
4. 
When 
providing 
technical 
and 
legal 
support 
to 
Member 
States, 
the 
Agency 
should 
refrain 
from 
imposing 
any 
political 
or 
economic 
conditions 
that 
were 
inconsistent 
with 
its 
Statute. 
Moreover, 
the 
developed 
countries 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
assist 
developing 
countries 
in 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
by 
facilitating 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
material 
and 
relevant 
scientific 
data. 
5. 
Libya 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
It 
had 
established 
a 
national 
monitoring 
office 
which 
would 
eventually 
become 
a 
fully 
fledged 
independent 
monitoring 
agency. 
Libya 
was 
a 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM; 
it 
had 
signed 
the 
convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
it 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
Early 
Notification 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident. 
6. 
Libya 
had 
taken 
an 
historical 
and 
courageous 
step 
on 
19 
December 
2003 
when 
it 
had 
voluntarily 
renounced 
any 
programme 
that 
might 
lead 
to 
the 
development 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
weapons.

In 
that 
context, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
finding 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
at 
its 
latest 
meeting 
that 
Libya 
had 
been 
cooperating 
fully 
and 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
implementing 
its 
safeguards 
agreement. 


7. 
LibyaÂs 
recent 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
would 
shortly 
result 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
regional 
centre 
for 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
Libya. 
The 
Agency 
had 
helped 
experts 
from 
Libya 
and 
the 
United 
States 
to 
prepare 
the 
requisite 
technical 
document, 
and 
a 
strategic 
plan 
had 
been 
developed 
in 
Tripoli 
the 
previous 
month. 
8. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
Libya 
reiterated 
its 
position 
that 
threats 
and 
confrontation 
would 
lead 
nowhere, 
and 
that 
sanctions 
would 
never 
force 
any 
country 
to 
renounce 
its 
sovereign 
rights. 
Indeed 
they 
usually 
punished 
ordinary 
citizens 
rather 
than 
decision-makers. 
The 
use 
of 
force 
destroyed 
the 
relations 
between 
peoples 
and 
promoted 
extremism. 
He 
reaffirmed 
IranÂs 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
increase 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
dispel 
any 
doubts 
regarding 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
9. 
Libya 
was 
extremely 
concerned 
about 
the 
threat 
to 
the 
Middle 
East 
from 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards, 
and 
IsraelÂs 
refusal 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
which 
undermined 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
promoted 
an 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
decision 
by 
the 
1995 
NPT 
Review 
and 
Extension 
Conference 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
had 
encouraged 
the 
other 
States 
of 
the 
region 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
but 
the 
zone 
had 
not 
been 
established 
because 
of 
IsraelÂs 
conduct. 
And 
yet 
certain 
countries 
refrained 
from 
demanding 
that 
Israel 
should 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
all 
other 
relevant 
instruments, 
while 
calling 
for 
the 
imposition 
of 
sanctions 
on 
other 
countries 
solely 
on 
the 
suspicion 
that 
they 
might 
have 
a 
military 
nuclear 
programme. 
10. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
nuclear 
weapon 
States 
to 
implement 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
honour 
the 
commitments 
they 
had 
assumed 
at 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
by 
launching 
a 
programme 
to 
eliminate 
their 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
11. 
He 
further 
called 
on 
the 
Conference 
to 
discuss 
the 
agenda 
item 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
a 
nuclear 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
opposition 
during 
the 
two 
previous 
sessions 
to 
its 
inclusion 
on 
the 
agenda 
provided 
resounding 
proof 
of 
the 
application 
by 
some 
States 
of 
double 
standards 
to 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region. 
He 
strongly 
urged 
all 
peace-loving 
States 
to 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
at 
the 
current 
session 
for 
an 
objective 
discussion 
of 
the 
agenda 
item. 
12. 
Ms 
CRAXI 
(Italy) 
said 
that 
the 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
foundation 
for 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Italy 
hoped 
that 
significant 
progress 
would 
be 
achieved 
with 
regard 
to 
each 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Treaty: 
namely, 
in 
non-proliferation, 
by 
strengthening 
safeguards 
and 
the 
verification 
regime; 
in 
disarmament, 
with 
a 
renewed 
effort 
to 
meet 
NPT 
commitments; 
and 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
through 
recognition 
of 
responsibilities 
associated 
with 
using 
that 
resource. 
Italy 
believed 
that 
growth 
in 
the 
civil 
nuclear 
sector 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
a 
greater 
effort 
to 
prevent 
proliferation 
risks. 
13. 
Her 
country 
supported 
Agency 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
formulating 
multilateral 
solutions 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
with 
a 
view 
to 
assuring 
all 
Member 
States, 
without 
discrimination, 
access 
to 
supplies 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Italy 
hoped 
that 
such 
efforts 
would 
improve 
the 
overall 
security 
of 
the 
system 
through 
a 
stable 
and 
balanced 
supply 
mechanism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
was 
essential, 
and 
Italy 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
fuel 
bank, 
under 
Agency 
auspices, 
initiated 
by 
the 
NTI. 
14. 
Italy 
was 
starting 
to 
make 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
once 
again. 
In 
June 
2008 
a 
new 
nuclear 
law, 
the 
first 
since 
1987, 
had 
been 
approved, 
providing 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
new 
sites 
for 
nuclear 
power

production 
in 
the 
country. 
Other 
investments 
and 
initiatives 
were 
planned 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
research 
and 
the 
environment 
in 
order 
to 
equip 
the 
country 
with 
the 
technology 
required 
to 
meet 
its 
needs. 


15. 
With 
the 
renaissance 
in 
civil 
nuclear 
power 
around 
the 
world, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
pursue 
an 
agenda 
for 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
To 
that 
end, 
additional 
protocols 
should 
be 
universally 
applied 
in 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
AgencyÂs 
highest 
verification 
standard, 
and 
the 
ban 
on 
nuclear 
tests 
should 
become 
an 
obligatory 
universal 
standard 
through 
the 
comprehensive 
ratification 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
The 
system 
already 
in 
place 
for 
monitoring 
the 
test 
ban 
was 
an 
important 
factor 
in 
the 
TreatyÂs 
credibility. 
Italy 
was 
contributing 
to 
the 
system 
by 
certifying 
a 
laboratory 
and 
through 
a 
new 
monitoring 
station. 
16. 
The 
next 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2010 
would 
provide 
an 
important 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system, 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
disarmament. 
Italy 
supported 
the 
opening 
of 
negotiations, 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament, 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
17. 
The 
present 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
should 
not 
be 
underestimated, 
and 
he 
called 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
prevention 
measures 
and 
support 
for 
the 
Agency. 
Other 
forms 
of 
international 
cooperation, 
such 
as 
the 
G8Âs 
Global 
Partnership 
Against 
the 
Spread 
of 
Weapons 
and 
Materials 
of 
Mass 
Destruction, 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative, 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative, 
GNEP 
and 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
also 
had 
a 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
global 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
18. 
Italy 
was 
convinced 
that 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system 
was 
the 
most 
effective 
instrument 
for 
preventing 
and 
combating 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
She 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
activities 
in 
Iran 
in 
particular, 
and 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
most 
recent 
report 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
Iran 
had 
confirmed 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Board, 
and 
the 
absence 
of 
cooperation 
with 
Agency 
inspectors 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
the 
nuclear 
programme. 
Furthermore, 
Iran 
had 
continued 
to 
refuse 
to 
apply 
the 
modified 
text 
of 
the 
Subsidiary 
Arrangements, 
which 
provided 
for 
prior 
notification 
of 
nuclear 
facility 
projects. 
Italy 
encouraged 
Iran 
to 
implement 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Board, 
and 
to 
apply 
its 
additional 
protocol 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
full 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
19. 
Italy 
hoped 
that 
the 
process 
of 
dismantling 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
DPRK 
could 
recommence 
in 
a 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner 
in 
order 
to 
consolidate 
the 
progress 
achieved 
through 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
implement 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
and 
comply 
fully 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
Italy 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fundamental 
role 
in 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
such 
international 
obligations. 
20. 
Having 
noted 
that 
Syria 
should 
provide 
the 
Agency 
with 
full 
and 
sincere 
collaboration 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
the 
investigation 
process 
begun 
in 
June 
2008 
to 
be 
concluded, 
she 
said 
that 
Italy 
welcomed 
LibyaÂs 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
following 
its 
historic 
decision 
to 
renounce 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Libya 
provided 
another 
example 
of 
collaboration 
with 
the 
application 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
21. 
Every 
country 
with 
a 
nuclear 
programme 
should 
give 
absolute 
priority 
to 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
the 
public 
and 
of 
workers 
at 
nuclear 
sites. 
The 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
drawn 
up 
by 
the 
Agency 
were 
essential 
tools, 
as 
were 
the 
conventions 
concluded 
with 
numerous 
Member 
States, 
and 
the 
assistance, 
support 
and 
consultation 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Italy 
welcomed 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
revise 
safety 
and 
security 
standards, 
and 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
Member 
StatesÂ 
contributions 
in 
that 
regard. 
Italy 
was 
party 
to 
all 
safety 
and 
security 
conventions 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
auspices 
and 
gave 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
whole 
system.

22. 
Italy 
encouraged 
international 
cooperation 
and 
participation 
in 
new 
European 
and 
international 
projects 
in 
the 
nuclear 
technology 
field. 
ItalyÂs 
national 
research 
agencies, 
universities 
and 
industries 
were 
taking 
part 
in 
numerous 
European 
projects 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
innovative 
nuclear 
systems 
and 
advanced 
fuel 
cycles. 
23. 
Italy 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
regularly 
provided 
financial 
support 
in 
that 
regard. 
ItalyÂs 
universities 
and 
health 
institutions 
ran 
collaboration 
programmes, 
particularly 
in 
nuclear 
medicine, 
which 
involved 
a 
large 
number 
of 
scientific 
visits 
and 
fellowships. 
A 
project 
of 
such 
broad 
scope 
demonstrated 
ItalyÂs 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
24. 
Through 
UNESCO, 
Italy 
contributed 
85% 
of 
the 
budget 
of 
the 
Centre 
for 
Theoretical 
Physics 
in 
Trieste, 
which 
worked 
under 
Agency 
supervision 
to 
promote 
international 
cooperation 
among 
scientists 
from 
all 
countries 
of 
the 
world. 
The 
Centre 
was 
pursuing 
achievement 
of 
the 
MDGs 
and 
had 
trained 
more 
than 
100 
000 
scientists 
from 
100 
countries, 
especially 
developing 
countries, 
over 
its 
40 
years 
of 
activity. 
25. 
Italy 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
applications 
developed 
by 
the 
Agency 
which 
offered 
benefits 
for 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
development. 
It 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
combating 
cancer, 
and 
its 
efforts 
to 
eradicate 
harmful 
insects 
and 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
drinking 
water 
in 
many 
regions 
of 
the 
world. 
26. 
Italy 
was 
conscious 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
relaunch 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
in 
the 
best 
way 
possible 
while 
ensuring 
the 
highest 
levels 
of 
safety 
and 
security. 
Italy 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
fully 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
and 
activities 
in 
achieving 
those 
goals. 
27. 
Mr 
DAINIUS 
(Lithuania) 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
full 
support 
for 
the 
Agency, 
which 
remained 
the 
worldÂs 
focal 
point 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
played 
an 
indispensable 
global 
role 
in 
preventing 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
equipment 
to 
nuclear 
weapons-related 
programmes 
and 
countering 
new 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
essential 
for 
the 
credible 
verification 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
and 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
should 
constitute 
the 
verification 
standard. 
Lithuania 
called 
upon 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
reaffirm 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
NPT 
by 
concluding 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
congratulated 
Qatar 
for 
signing 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Lesotho 
and 
Iraq 
for 
concluding 
additional 
protocols. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
draw 
a 
safeguards 
conclusion 
for 
47 
States, 
including 
his 
own, 
and 
noted 
that 
as 
from 
1 
January 
2008, 
the 
trilateral 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
among 
Lithuania 
and 
other 
non-nuclear 
European 
Union 
States, 
Euratom 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
superseded 
the 
bilateral 
ones 
between 
Lithuania 
and 
the 
Agency. 
28. 
A 
growing 
number 
of 
countries 
had 
expressed 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
as 
a 
way 
to 
meet 
their 
increasing 
energy 
needs, 
but 
there 
were 
also 
concerns 
over 
future 
interruptions 
in 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply. 
Lithuania 
therefore 
welcomed 
Member 
StatesÂ 
initiatives 
on 
credible 
and 
robust 
international 
assurances 
of 
access 
to 
enriched 
uranium 
or 
enrichment 
services. 
In 
particular, 
the 
proposed 
fuel 
bank 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency 
would 
enhance 
international 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
and 
contribute 
to 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
29. 
Lithuania 
strongly 
supported 
global 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
and 
national 
nuclear 
security 
regimes. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
assisting 
Member 
States 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
national 
and 
regional 
nuclear 
security 
frameworks. 
In 
May 
2008, 
the 
Lithuanian 
Parliament 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
the 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
had 
drafted 
new 
requirements 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
nuclear 
facilities.

of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
he 
said 
that 
Lithuania 
was 
seeking 
ways 
to 
improve 
its 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
control 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources, 
exposure 
to 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
prevention 
of 
radiological 
emergencies. 
It 
called 
on 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
adhere 
to 
and 
fully 
implement 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and 
other 
international 
instruments 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
CPPNM. 


30. 
Safety 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
It 
was 
therefore 
highly 
important 
to 
build 
capacities 
at 
institutional, 
national 
and 
regional 
level, 
share 
knowledge 
and 
experiences, 
provide 
training 
and 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
to 
identify 
gaps 
in 
knowledge, 
and 
to 
develop 
sustainable 
national 
programmes 
to 
train 
specialists. 
Particular 
attention 
should 
be 
paid 
to 
building 
competence 
and 
training 
personnel 
at 
regulatory 
authorities 
and 
supporting 
organizations. 
Lithuania 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
network 
for 
the 
exchange 
of 
regulatory 
experiences 
and 
practices 
to 
improve 
global 
safety, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
participating 
in 
activities 
in 
that 
regard. 
31. 
Lithuania 
dedicated 
considerable 
resources 
to 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
safety 
at 
Unit 
2 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
prior 
to 
its 
decommissioning. 
Some 
improvements 
had 
already 
been 
made 
and 
others 
would 
be 
introduced 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
safety 
improvement 
programme, 
which 
was 
updated 
and 
reviewed 
each 
year. 
The 
follow-up 
OSART 
mission 
to 
the 
plant, 
completed 
in 
April 
2008, 
had 
achieved 
positive 
results. 
All 
outstanding 
issues 
from 
the 
2006 
mission 
had 
been 
either 
been 
successfully 
resolved 
or 
were 
progressing 
satisfactorily, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
good 
practices 
which 
would 
be 
shared 
with 
other 
Member 
States, 
had 
been 
noted. 
Lithuania 
was 
also 
making 
arrangements 
for 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
Unit 
1 
of 
the 
plant. 
32. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
growing 
global 
energy 
demand, 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
power 
would 
increase 
significantly 
in 
the 
future. 
LithuaniaÂs 
National 
Energy 
Strategy 
envisioned 
rapid 
economic 
growth, 
which 
would 
have 
a 
direct 
impact 
on 
energy 
consumption 
and 
electricity 
demand. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
the 
main 
energy 
source 
in 
the 
country, 
accounting 
for 
around 
70% 
of 
the 
electricity 
generated. 
Lithuania 
intended 
to 
expand 
its 
capacities 
by 
building 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
jointly 
with 
Estonia, 
Latvia 
and 
Poland. 
Construction 
of 
the 
Visaginas 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
planned 
for 
2016Â2018 
and 
the 
plant 
was 
intended 
to 
supply 
energy 
to 
the 
entire 
Baltic 
region. 
Despite 
the 
complexity 
of 
the 
project 
and 
the 
high 
level 
of 
coordination 
required 
among 
participating 
parties, 
some 
steps 
had 
already 
been 
accomplished. 
An 
environmental 
impact 
assessment 
had 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Lithuanian 
Ministry 
of 
Environment 
in 
November 
2007 
to 
evaluate 
the 
construction 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Lithuania 
with 
an 
approximate 
capacity 
of 
3400 
MW. 
The 
assessment 
report 
had 
been 
prepared 
and 
was 
presented 
to 
the 
public 
in 
August 
2008; 
it 
would 
be 
submitted 
for 
assessment 
to 
the 
Agency 
expert 
mission 
to 
Lithuania 
in 
December 
2008. 
The 
final 
decision 
on 
the 
acceptability 
of 
the 
plant 
would 
be 
taken 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Environment, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
all 
comments 
received 
from 
various 
authorities 
and 
the 
public 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
abroad, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
results 
of 
the 
expert 
mission. 
In 
2007, 
Lithuania 
had 
established 
a 
national 
investor 
company, 
LEO 
LT, 
which 
was 
responsible 
for 
the 
implementation 
and 
development 
of 
the 
project. 
A 
subsidiary 
company 
had 
been 
established 
in 
August 
2008 
to 
coordinate 
all 
preparatory 
activities. 
The 
timely 
preparation 
of 
specialists 
for 
the 
licensing, 
construction 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
a 
national 
priority, 
and 
Lithuania 
had 
developed 
a 
national 
programme 
for 
the 
training 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
specialists 
for 
the 
years 
2008Â2015. 
New 
courses 
on 
nuclear 
physics 
and 
nuclear 
engineering 
had 
been 
launched 
at 
the 
countryÂs 
main 
universities, 
and 
there 
was 
a 
plan 
to 
establish 
a 
regional 
centre 
to 
train 
nuclear 
energy 
specialists 
and 
carry 
out 
research. 
33. 
Radioactive 
waste 
management 
required 
utmost 
attention 
so 
that 
future 
generations 
were 
not 
affected 
by 
radioactive 
waste 
generated 
by 
nuclear 
power 
facilities 
and 
other 
peaceful 
applications. 
Long-term 
safety 
assessments 
were 
a 
key 
element 
in 
that 
process. 
LithuaniaÂs

management 
strategy 
identified 
tasks 
that 
had 
to 
be 
implemented 
to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
The 
country 
had 
already 
taken 
a 
decision 
to 
dispose 
of 
short-lived 
very 
low 
level 
waste 
in 
a 
landfill-type 
repository, 
and 
short-lived 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste 
in 
a 
near-surface 
repository 
with 
reinforced 
concrete 
vaults. 
Projects 
related 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facilities 
and 
repositories 
for 
radioactive 
waste 
from 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
were 
ongoing. 
A 
contractor 
had 
been 
chosen 
to 
build 
the 
landfill-type 
repository 
and 
technical 
preparations 
were 
under 
way. 
As 
regards 
the 
near-surface 
repository, 
the 
pre-qualification 
procedure 
was 
complete 
and 
tender 
was 
set 
to 
be 
announced. 
Both 
repositories 
would 
be 
constructed 
with 
the 
financial 
assistance 
of 
the 
EU. 


34. 
Radiation 
protection 
was 
a 
complex, 
multifunctional 
and 
dynamically 
developing 
infrastructure 
that 
had 
to 
adapt 
to 
ever-changing 
technologies, 
and 
LithuaniaÂs 
own 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
was 
constantly 
being 
strengthened. 
The 
country 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
the 
Regional 
European 
and 
Central 
Asian 
ALARA 
Network, 
appreciating 
its 
usefulness 
and 
supporting 
its 
goal 
to 
maintain 
and 
improve 
radiation 
protection 
in 
those 
regions. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
the 
network 
of 
Analytical 
Laboratories 
for 
the 
Measurement 
of 
Environmental 
Radioactivity, 
the 
Radiation 
Protection 
Centre 
regularly 
passed 
the 
relevant 
proficiency 
tests. 
Lithuania 
devoted 
considerable 
attention 
to 
developing 
its 
medical 
radiation 
protection 
system, 
and 
was 
implementing 
activities 
under 
a 
national 
project 
to 
monitor 
patient 
doses. 
Doses 
in 
interventional 
radiology 
were 
measured 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
mammography 
images 
was 
assessed 
under 
the 
regional 
project 
to 
strengthen 
the 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients 
and 
medical 
exposure 
control. 
Specialists 
from 
the 
Radiation 
Protection 
Centre 
participated 
in 
various 
training 
courses, 
seminars, 
workshops 
and 
visits 
with 
a 
view 
to 
building 
their 
competence 
to 
perform 
functions 
in 
various 
areas 
where 
radiation 
sources 
were 
used. 
Considerable 
effort 
was 
being 
invested 
in 
developing 
a 
complete 
set 
of 
measures 
to 
ensure 
the 
radiation 
protection 
of 
workers 
at 
facilities 
using 
radiation 
sources 
and 
of 
the 
public. 
The 
establishment 
of 
a 
training 
centre 
in 
Lithuania 
was 
a 
very 
promising 
step 
that 
enabled 
specialists 
to 
expand 
their 
radiation 
protection 
capacities. 
35. 
Proper 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
was 
of 
great 
importance, 
which 
was 
why 
Lithuania 
paid 
its 
TCF 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
Throughout 
the 
countryÂs 
history 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Lithuanian 
organizations 
had 
been 
actively 
involved 
in 
various 
activities 
to 
build 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
infrastructure, 
increase 
the 
level 
of 
professional 
expertise 
and 
ensure 
the 
safe 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Lithuania 
was 
about 
to 
undertake 
challenging 
tasks 
related 
to 
nuclear 
power 
expansion, 
which 
would 
require 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national 
institutions 
involved. 
A 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
on 
enhancing 
capabilities 
in 
the 
State 
Nuclear 
Power 
Safety 
Inspectorate 
(VATESI) 
and 
other 
institutions 
in 
the 
licensing 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
launched 
in 
early 
2008, 
helped 
institutions 
to 
enhance 
their 
capabilities, 
and 
consequently 
ensured 
proper 
regulatory 
and 
authorization 
processes 
during 
construction 
and 
operation 
of 
the 
new 
plant. 
36. 
Mr 
KAKODKAR 
(India) 
said 
that 
2008 
had 
been 
a 
remarkable 
one 
for 
his 
country 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
BoardÂs 
approval 
by 
consensus 
of 
the 
Agreement 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
India 
for 
the 
Application 
of 
Safeguards 
to 
Civilian 
Nuclear 
Facilities 
in 
August 
2008 
and 
the 
Statement 
on 
Civil 
Nuclear 
Cooperation 
with 
India 
issued 
by 
the 
Nuclear 
Suppliers 
Group 
in 
September 
had 
created 
the 
conditions 
for 
India 
to 
make 
an 
even 
bigger 
contribution 
to 
the 
growth 
of 
international 
civil 
nuclear 
cooperation. 
He 
acknowledged 
the 
contribution 
and 
assistance 
of 
IndiaÂs 
close 
friends 
in 
the 
international 
community 
who 
had 
made 
that 
possible. 
While 
the 
development 
of 
such 
cooperation 
would 
help 
to 
strengthen 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
security, 
India 
also 
looked 
forward 
to 
enhancing 
its 
assistance 
to 
friendly 
countries. 
IndiaÂs 
reactor 
system 
was 
based 
on 
220 
MW(e) 
PHWRs, 
which 
was 
competitive 
in 
terms 
of 
capital 
costs, 
safety 
performance 
and 
energy 
cost, 
making 
it 
well 
suited 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
countries 
with 
small 
electricity 
grids, 
especially 
those 
in 
the 
developing 
world.

37. 
A 
critical 
point, 
marked 
by 
a 
huge 
increase 
in 
the 
energy 
requirements 
of 
emerging 
economies, 
unfulfilled 
development 
aspirations 
of 
a 
vast 
majority 
of 
the 
global 
population 
and 
the 
serious 
threat 
of 
climate 
change, 
had 
been 
reached 
in 
global 
development 
efforts. 
According 
to 
the 
Intergovernmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate 
Change, 
the 
warming 
of 
the 
climate 
system 
was 
unequivocal, 
as 
shown 
by 
increases 
in 
the 
global 
average 
air 
and 
ocean 
temperatures, 
widespread 
melting 
of 
snow 
and 
ice 
and 
rising 
of 
the 
global 
average 
sea 
level. 
It 
was 
clear 
that 
efforts 
to 
meet 
enhanced 
energy 
requirements 
would 
have 
to 
rely 
more 
on 
non-fossil 
energy 
sources 
in 
order 
to 
mitigate 
climate 
change 
and 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
available 
energy 
resources. 
By 
2031Â32, 
IndiaÂs 
use 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
supply 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
could 
be 
anywhere 
between 
13% 
in 
the 
most 
energy 
efficient 
scenario, 
and 
21% 
in 
a 
coal-
dominant 
scenario. 
His 
country 
had 
therefore 
accorded 
high 
priority 
to 
increasing 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
its 
overall 
electricity 
generation. 
Nuclear 
energy 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
meet 
energy 
demands 
for 
sustainable 
development 
throughout 
the 
world. 
38. 
IndiaÂs 
comprehensive 
atomic 
energy 
programme 
covered 
the 
entire 
fuel 
cycle 
for 
uranium, 
plutonium 
and 
thorium 
based 
fuels 
and 
was 
governed 
by 
the 
long-term 
objective 
of 
energy 
independence 
using 
the 
countryÂs 
vast 
thorium 
resources. 
There 
were 
several 
benefits 
to 
the 
use 
of 
thorium, 
particularly 
in 
heavy 
water 
reactors, 
including 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
energy 
production 
and 
efficient 
fissile 
plutonium 
disposal, 
which 
might 
be 
of 
interest 
to 
other 
countries. 
39. 
India 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
INPRO 
in 
recent 
years. 
It 
was 
participating 
in 
eight 
of 
the 
twelve 
collaborative 
projects 
under 
Phase 
II, 
which 
offered 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
Member 
States 
to 
work 
together 
to 
advance 
technological 
approaches, 
fulfil 
future 
energy 
needs 
and 
increase 
the 
volume, 
reach 
and 
range 
of 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
world. 
It 
was 
ironic 
that 
such 
an 
important 
activity, 
which 
was 
at 
the 
core 
of 
a 
holistic 
solution 
to 
ensuring 
safe, 
secure 
and 
sustainable 
global 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy, 
was 
still 
not 
a 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Regular 
Budget. 
Full 
budgetary 
support 
should 
be 
given 
to 
INPRO 
activities, 
as 
an 
efficient 
and 
sustainable 
way 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
meet 
its 
statutory 
objectives. 
40. 
The 
vast 
energy 
potential 
of 
the 
atom 
could 
prevent 
the 
widening 
of 
disparities, 
but 
fears 
arising 
from 
its 
destructive 
power 
were 
preventing 
wider 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy. 
There 
were 
several 
proposed 
solutions, 
but 
those 
based 
on 
science 
and 
technology 
were 
likely 
to 
be 
the 
most 
successful. 
The 
Agency 
was 
unique 
in 
its 
ability 
to 
implement 
such 
solutions 
as 
it 
was 
an 
international 
organization 
with 
the 
necessary 
science 
and 
technology 
resources. 
41. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
development 
worldwide, 
the 
factors 
limiting 
its 
growth 
also 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
The 
number 
of 
countries 
to 
begin 
constructing 
a 
new 
power 
reactor 
had 
remained 
stagnant 
since 
1985 
at 
33. 
However, 
there 
were 
ambitious 
plans 
to 
expand 
the 
nuclear 
power 
generating 
capacity 
of 
many 
countries, 
and 
several 
countries 
were 
intending 
to 
build 
their 
first 
nuclear 
plant 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
The 
necessary 
infrastructure, 
including 
the 
availability 
of 
trained 
human 
resources, 
had 
to 
be 
in 
place 
to 
support 
such 
a 
nuclear 
renaissance. 
India 
had 
been 
implementing 
a 
robust 
staff 
training 
programme 
for 
over 
five 
decades, 
and 
offered 
to 
train 
young 
foreign 
scientists 
at 
its 
nuclear 
training 
school, 
which 
conducted 
a 
one-year 
orientation 
course 
for 
engineering 
graduates 
and 
science 
postgraduates 
on 
mutually 
agreed 
terms. 
42. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
understand 
the 
issues 
that 
inhibited 
access 
to 
nuclear 
power, 
including 
human 
resources, 
necessary 
infrastructures, 
safety 
regulations 
and 
security, 
and 
find 
ways 
to 
resolve 
them. 
A 
balanced 
approach 
that 
maximized 
development 
and 
minimized 
risk 
was 
required. 
Through 
over 
five 
decades 
of 
scientific 
and 
professional 
work, 
the 
Agency 
had 
established 
itself 
as 
a 
credible 
organization 
that 
fulfilled 
its 
mandate. 
With 
its 
strong 
science 
base 
and 
rich 
experience, 
the 
Agency 
was 
in 
a 
unique 
position 
to 
identify 
and 
promote 
optimal 
holistic 
technological 
solutions 
that 
minimized 
constraints 
and 
were 
accessible 
to 
all.

The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
bold 
initiative 
to 
establish 
a 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
to 
examine 
the 
nature 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
until 
2020 
and 
beyond 
was 
highly 
commendable. 
The 
Commission 
had 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
play 
a 
greater 
role 
in 
steering 
global 
development 
through 
the 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
Although 
the 
report 
covered 
all 
the 
relevant 
areas, 
especially 
the 
need 
for 
enhanced 
resources 
through 
the 
Regular 
Budget, 
it 
could 
have 
been 
more 
balanced. 
It 
did 
not 
provide 
many 
practical 
ideas 
and 
strategies 
to 
enable 
interested 
countries 
to 
access 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
or 
focus 
on 
other 
related 
aspects 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
Agency 
Statute, 
and 
could 
therefore 
not 
stand 
alone 
as 
the 
basis 
for 
AgencyÂs 
future. 
However, 
India 
welcomed 
the 
opportunity 
provided 
by 
the 
release 
of 
the 
report 
to 
generate 
constructive 
and 
practical 
ideas 
as 
to 
how 
the 
renaissance 
of 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
could 
benefit 
everyone, 
in 
particular 
developing 
countries. 
44. 
To 
mark 
100 
years 
since 
the 
birth 
of 
Homi 
Bhabha, 
the 
founder 
of 
IndiaÂs 
atomic 
energy 
programme, 
and 
the 
silver 
jubilee 
of 
the 
Indian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Regulatory 
Board, 
India 
would 
be 
hosting 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Topical 
Issues 
in 
Nuclear 
Installation 
Safety: 
Ensuring 
Safety 
for 
Sustainable 
Nuclear 
Development 
in 
Mumbai 
from 
17 
to 
21 
November 
2008. 
As 
part 
of 
a 
year-
long 
Homi 
Bhabha 
centenary 
programme, 
India 
was 
planning 
to 
organize 
an 
international 
conference 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy, 
hopefully 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Homi 
Bhabha 
had 
helped 
to 
shape 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
the 
decision 
to 
locate 
the 
headquarters 
in 
Vienna. 
He 
had 
also 
been 
President 
of 
the 
first 
Geneva 
Conference 
on 
Peaceful 
Uses 
of 
Atomic 
Energy. 
45. 
Throughout 
human 
civilization, 
every 
era 
had 
been 
defined 
by 
a 
significant 
achievement, 
for 
example 
the 
use 
of 
fire, 
the 
invention 
of 
the 
wheel, 
locomotion 
through 
steam, 
the 
realization 
of 
the 
power 
of 
the 
atom 
and 
the 
Internet. 
The 
world 
was 
now 
at 
the 
threshold 
of 
the 
most 
exciting 
of 
possibilities 
Â 
the 
power 
to 
understand 
and 
manipulate 
matter 
in 
the 
service 
of 
mankind. 
But 
that 
possibility 
could 
only 
become 
a 
reality 
if 
the 
nations 
of 
the 
world, 
in 
particular 
the 
scientific 
community, 
came 
together 
as 
never 
before. 
India 
was 
hopeful 
that 
the 
international 
nuclear 
community, 
working 
together 
as 
one 
family 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency, 
would 
not 
let 
such 
an 
opportunity 
pass 
and 
would 
take 
giant 
leaps 
towards 
harnessing 
nuclear 
power 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
humanity 
as 
a 
whole. 
46. 
Mr 
MITEVSKI 
(The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
joined 
the 
crucial 
instruments 
marking 
the 
milestones 
of 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities, 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
further 
strengthening 
its 
national 
security 
system 
and 
international 
cooperation. 
His 
country 
paid 
particular 
attention 
to 
strengthening 
institutional 
capacities 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials; 
appropriate 
equipment 
had 
been 
installed 
at 
all 
border 
crossings 
and 
an 
efficient 
reporting 
and 
enforcement 
system 
was 
in 
place. 
The 
country 
was 
about 
to 
hold 
a 
sub-regional 
training 
course 
on 
radiation 
safety 
for 
customs 
and 
regulatory 
authorities. 
47. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
had 
made 
significant 
steps 
towards 
compliance 
with 
international 
safety 
standards, 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
Radiation 
Safety 
Directorate. 
Further 
assistance 
would 
be 
focused 
on 
drafting 
the 
remaining 
regulations 
and 
setting 
up 
a 
central 
storage 
facility 
for 
low 
and 
medium 
level 
radioactive 
waste. 
He 
expressed 
thanks 
to 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
CooperationÂs 
Division 
for 
Europe 
for 
their 
assistance 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
programme 
for 
the 
subsequent 
cycle 
was 
focused 
on 
upgrading 
diagnostic 
procedures 
in 
nuclear 
medicine, 
implementing 
food 
standards 
and 
strengthening 
the 
capabilities 
of 
the 
radiation 
safety 
services. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
medical 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
improving 
human 
health, 
the 
Macedonian 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
support 
a 
project 
to 
establish 
a 
PET 
centre, 
providing 
a 
national 

GC(52)/OR.5

contribution 
of 
Â4 
million. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
that 
model 
project 
in 
the 
form 
of 
expert 
services 
and 
staff 
training 
was 
of 
crucial 
importance. 


48. 
With 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Agency, 
certain 
Macedonian 
institutions 
had 
been 
upgraded 
to 
centres 
of 
excellence 
where 
regional 
experts 
could 
receive 
training. 
The 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
hosting 
more 
foreign 
participants 
in 
such 
training 
programmes 
in 
the 
future, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
regional 
cooperation. 
49. 
Despite 
national 
budgetary 
restrictions, 
his 
country 
had 
always 
paid 
in 
full 
its 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
It 
had 
also 
made 
several 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
50. 
Ms 
FUNES-NOPPEN 
(Belgium) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
produced 
more 
than 
half 
of 
its 
electricity 
using 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
reviewing 
the 
future 
of 
its 
energy 
policy. 
The 
special 
commission 
established 
for 
that 
purpose 
would 
produce 
its 
report 
in 
2009. 
51. 
Her 
country 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
research, 
development 
and 
training 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
It 
worked 
closely 
in 
the 
development 
of 
the 
ITER 
programme, 
and 
a 
concept 
developed 
by 
the 
Belgian 
Laboratory 
for 
Plasma 
Physics 
of 
the 
Royal 
Military 
Academy 
involving 
the 
ion 
cyclotron 
resonance 
heating 
of 
plasma 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
ITER. 
Belgium 
was 
continuing 
its 
efforts 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
new 
nuclear 
technologies, 
including 
through 
membership 
of 
the 
INPRO 
Steering 
Committee 
and 
participation 
in 
several 
specific 
projects. 
52. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
MYRRHA 
project 
to 
develop 
an 
accelerator-driven 
subcritical 
reactor, 
an 
international 
consortium 
had 
been 
established 
under 
the 
Belgian 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
to 
develop 
plans 
for 
the 
infrastructure 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
European 
Commission. 
53. 
At 
national 
level, 
the 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
in 
Mol 
was 
continuing 
its 
research 
and 
training 
activities, 
with 
particular 
focus 
on 
the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
the 
environment 
and 
societal 
aspects 
related 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
Centre 
had 
strengthened 
its 
role 
as 
a 
training 
centre 
for 
professionals 
in 
the 
nuclear 
industry. 
It 
also 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
European 
projects 
such 
as 
the 
European 
Nuclear 
Education 
Network 
and 
the 
European 
Network 
on 
Education 
and 
Training 
in 
Radiological 
Protection, 
which 
aimed 
to 
facilitate 
the 
mobility 
of 
undergraduate 
and 
postgraduate 
students 
and 
promote 
recognition 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
qualifications 
across 
Europe. 
As 
part 
of 
the 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
and 
the 
Belgian 
Agency 
for 
Radioactive 
Waste 
and 
Enriched 
Fissile 
Materials 
concerning 
the 
European 
Underground 
Research 
Infrastructure 
for 
Disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste 
In 
Clay 
Environment 
(EURIDICE), 
the 
research 
programme 
on 
the 
disposal 
of 
long-lived 
high 
activity 
radioactive 
waste 
in 
clay 
deposits 
had 
been 
extended 
and 
the 
High 
Activity 
Disposal 
Experimental 
Site 
underground 
facilities 
in 
Mol 
had 
been 
expanded. 
There 
were 
plans 
to 
perform 
an 
experiment 
to 
simulate 
thermal 
impact 
on 
high 
activity 
waste 
in 
underground 
facilities. 
The 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
had 
strengthened 
its 
relations 
with 
international 
partners 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
signing 
agreements 
with 
Egypt, 
Estonia 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
It 
also 
regularly 
received 
experts 
under 
training 
programmes. 
54. 
Belgium 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
safety, 
as 
a 
means 
of 
raising 
public 
confidence. 
Following 
an 
irradiation 
localization 
error 
during 
the 
treatment 
of 
patients 
in 
a 
Belgian 
hospital, 
and 
similar 
accidents 
in 
other 
countries, 
the 
Belgian 
authorities 
had 
taken 
a 
number 
of 
control 
and 
prevention 
measures. 
Two 
roundtables 
comprising 
all 
Belgian 
radiotherapy 
stakeholders 
had 
been 
organized 
by 
the 
Federal 
Agency 
for 
Nuclear 
Control, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
French 
competent 
authorities. 
The 
objective 
had 
been 
to 
explore 
additional 
measures 
that 
could 
further 
increase 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radiotherapy 
treatments 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
confidence 
of 
patients 
and 
their 
families. 
The 
roundtables 
had 
been 
successful, 
providing 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
mechanism 
that 
involved 
declaring 
significant 
events 
concerning 
radiation 
protection 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 

GC(52)/OR.5

necessary 
measures 
were 
taken 
locally, 
prevent 
the 
occurrence 
of 
similar 
incidents 
or 
accidents, 
and 
promote 
an 
exchange 
of 
experience. 
Initiatives 
to 
improve 
quality 
and 
assist 
radiophysicists 
in 
their 
work 
had 
also 
been 
developed. 


55. 
In 
August 
2008, 
there 
had 
been 
an 
accidental 
release 
of 
radioactive 
iodine 
at 
the 
Institute 
for 
Radioisotopes 
in 
Fleurus. 
Production 
had 
been 
stopped 
immediately, 
and 
would 
not 
be 
resumed 
until 
the 
precise 
causes 
had 
been 
identified 
and 
treated, 
and 
the 
ventilation 
and 
alarm 
systems 
had 
been 
improved. 
Temporary 
precautionary 
measures 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
protect 
the 
public, 
even 
though 
the 
levels 
of 
radioactivity 
had 
been 
below 
the 
WHO 
admissible 
dose 
for 
children 
under 
five. 
Those 
measures 
had 
later 
been 
lifted, 
but 
an 
enquiry 
into 
the 
causes 
of 
the 
release 
was 
still 
under 
way. 
56. 
A 
law 
to 
approve 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
had 
been 
sanctioned 
and 
promulgated 
in 
Belgium 
in 
July 
2008. 
Her 
country 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendment, 
as 
the 
Convention 
was 
the 
only 
legally 
binding 
instrument 
concerning 
physical 
protection. 
Belgium 
was 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
was 
constantly 
adapting 
its 
policy 
to 
protect 
nuclear 
facilities 
against 
malevolent 
acts, 
in 
order 
to 
keep 
up 
with 
new 
international 
challenges. 
57. 
Noting 
that 
the 
NPT 
had 
to 
remain 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
she 
said 
that 
the 
Agency 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
increasing 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity, 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
not 
diverted 
to 
non-peaceful 
purposes, 
promoting 
a 
rigorous 
safety 
culture 
and 
standards 
and 
combating 
the 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Belgium 
welcomed 
consideration 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future, 
and 
stressed 
that 
the 
process 
had 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
transparently, 
with 
intergovernmental 
dialogue 
to 
allow 
Member 
States 
to 
analyse 
the 
various 
aspects 
and 
take 
decisions. 
58. 
On 
account 
of 
the 
importance 
it 
attached 
to 
the 
efficient 
functioning 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Belgium 
was, 
exceptionally, 
allowing 
the 
Agency 
to 
use 
its 
budgetary 
surplus 
to 
launch 
AIPS. 
59. 
An 
effective 
multilateral 
approach 
should 
be 
taken 
in 
addressing 
threats 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Belgium 
unreservedly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
excellent 
work 
on 
the 
difficult 
Iranian 
issue. 
It 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
collaborate 
fully 
and 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
resolve 
any 
outstanding 
issues 
to 
guarantee 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
should 
also 
implement 
Board 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
60. 
Her 
country 
welcomed 
the 
success 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
missions 
to 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya. 
It 
appreciated 
LibyaÂs 
transparency 
and 
encouraged 
further 
cooperation 
in 
that 
regard. 
61. 
Belgium 
noted 
with 
concern 
the 
worrying 
developments 
in 
the 
DPRKÂs 
and 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
fulfil 
its 
verification 
role 
in 
North 
Korea. 
The 
DPRK 
needed 
to 
implement 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
verifiably 
and 
irreversibly 
dismantle 
its 
nuclear 
facilities, 
abandon 
its 
weapons-grade 
fissile 
material 
and 
adhere 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Belgium 
also 
called 
on 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
and 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency, 
so 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
conduct 
any 
necessary 
additional 
investigations. 
62. 
Belgium 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
and 
India 
had 
signed 
a 
safeguards 
agreement, 
which 
was 
a 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 
It 
hoped 
that 
India 
would 
also 
adhere 
to 
an 
additional 
protocol 
without 
delay. 
Belgium 
congratulated 
Lesotho 
and 
Iraq 
for 
signing 
additional 
protocols, 
and 
Qatar 
for 
signing 
a 
safeguards 
agreement. 
63. 
Belgium 
hoped 
that, 
as 
in 
other 
years, 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
be 
able 
to 
pass 
a 
single 
resolution 
on 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East.

64. 
Mr 
SHAHBAZ 
(Pakistan) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
as 
the 
worldÂs 
focal 
point 
for 
promoting 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
assuming 
greater 
significance 
in 
view 
of 
the 
rapidly 
growing 
global 
energy 
demand 
and 
the 
shortage 
of 
fossil 
fuel 
reserves, 
alongside 
diverse 
environmental 
and 
proliferation 
challenges. 
The 
Agency 
could 
make 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
meeting 
the 
needs 
and 
challenges 
of 
the 
twenty-first 
century 
by 
ensuring 
equitable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
materials, 
technology 
and 
equipment 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
65. 
To 
ensure 
the 
realization 
of 
every 
StateÂs 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
develop 
universal 
and 
non-discriminatory 
criteria 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
relevant 
fields, 
including 
nuclear 
power 
generation. 
In 
that 
process, 
principles 
should 
be 
placed 
above 
expediency 
and 
commercial 
and 
strategic 
interests. 
Such 
an 
approach 
would 
help 
to 
reinforce 
confidence 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
66. 
He 
recalled 
that 
President 
Eisenhower, 
in 
his 
1953 
address 
to 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
had 
stated 
that 
it 
was 
not 
enough 
to 
take 
nuclear 
weapons 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
soldiers 
Â 
they 
had 
to 
be 
put 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who 
would 
know 
how 
to 
strip 
their 
military 
casing 
and 
adapt 
them 
to 
the 
arts 
of 
peace. 
Pakistan 
believed 
that 
the 
principle 
of 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
had 
to 
be 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
any 
future 
vision 
for 
the 
Agency. 
That 
could 
only 
be 
ensured 
by 
maintaining 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
and 
its 
work 
on 
verification 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
It 
was 
essential 
that 
the 
Agency, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
efficient 
technical 
organizations 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
system, 
maintain 
focus 
on 
its 
technical 
and 
promotional 
character. 
In 
recent 
years, 
political 
issues 
had 
taken 
up 
much 
of 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
policy-making 
organs. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
priorities 
had 
been 
tilted 
more 
towards 
verification 
activities. 
It 
was 
necessary 
to 
check 
such 
trends, 
which 
ran 
the 
risk 
of 
reducing 
the 
promotional 
dimension 
to 
a 
residual 
issue. 
67. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
the 
best 
reflection 
of 
its 
promotional 
activities, 
having 
brought 
about 
tangible 
benefits 
to 
developing 
Member 
States. 
Pakistan 
would 
continue 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
programme 
by 
sharing 
its 
experience, 
offering 
training 
placements 
and 
providing 
the 
services 
of 
experts. 
His 
country 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
major 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
made 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
the 
development 
of 
its 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programme. 
He 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
deep 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
achieving 
a 
high 
rate 
of 
implementation 
and 
excellent 
programme 
delivery, 
and 
noted 
that 
an 
extensive 
programme 
to 
apply 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
radioisotopes 
in 
agriculture, 
hydrology, 
medicine 
and 
industry 
was 
under 
way 
in 
Pakistan. 
68. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Pakistan 
had 
long 
been 
a 
strong 
advocate 
of 
promoting 
and 
harnessing 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
the 
peace, 
progress 
and 
prosperity 
of 
all. 
It 
had 
developed 
the 
entire 
range 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities 
and 
now 
had 
two 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
operation, 
with 
a 
third 
under 
construction. 
Pakistan 
planned 
to 
establish 
a 
uranium 
conversion 
and 
enrichment 
facility, 
which 
would 
be 
placed 
under 
Agency 
safeguards, 
to 
cater 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
those 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Pakistan 
looked 
forward 
to 
Agency 
assistance 
in 
the 
completion 
of 
its 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
plan, 
including 
uranium 
exploration 
and 
prospecting, 
so 
that 
that 
clean 
source 
of 
power 
production 
could 
be 
exploited 
to 
the 
fullest 
possible 
extent 
to 
avoid 
a 
reliance 
on 
fossil 
fuels. 
69. 
Since 
the 
inception 
of 
its 
atomic 
energy 
development 
programme, 
Pakistan 
had 
always 
recognized 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
the 
national 
and 
international 
context 
was 
a 
vital 
objective. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
Pakistan 
had 
always 
strived 
to 
follow 
existing 
international 
standards; 
Agency 
guidance 
documents 
on 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
facilities 
and 
materials, 
and 
on 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
had 
been 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
inspection 
and 
enforcement. 
The 
country 
also 
participated 
in 
the 
Illicit 
Trafficking 
Database. 
The 
Pakistan 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
was 
mandated 
to 
ensure 
that 
appropriate 
measures 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
materials 
were 
taken 
by 
all 
licensees. 
It 
was 
also 
required 
to 
ensure 
enforcement 
of 

GC(52)/OR.5

regulations 
prohibiting 
unauthorized 
access 
to, 
possession 
of 
or 
use 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
and 
facilities 
containing 
such 
materials. 
The 
Pakistan 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
had 
adopted 
a 
body 
of 
regulations 
and 
upgraded 
those 
that 
already 
existed 
to 
regulate 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
facilities. 
It 
was 
also 
implementing 
PakistanÂs 
nuclear 
security 
action 
plan. 
While 
Pakistan 
deeply 
appreciated 
the 
valuable 
assistance 
that 
had 
been 
provided, 
it 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
develop 
ways 
and 
means 
to 
facilitate 
transfers 
of 
safety-related 
technology. 
It 
also 
called 
upon 
States 
with 
advanced 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
move 
beyond 
emphasizing 
the 
significance 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
take 
steps 
to 
remove 
unjustified 
restrictions 
on 
transfers 
of 
related 
technology 
and 
equipment 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
worldwide. 


70. 
His 
countryÂs 
track 
record 
on 
Agency 
safeguards 
had 
been 
immaculate. 
Pakistan 
had 
in 
place 
effective 
controls 
over 
the 
export 
of 
goods, 
technologies 
and 
facilities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
their 
delivery 
system. 
Pakistan 
believed 
that 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
to 
be 
strengthened 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
moral 
and 
political 
commitment 
to 
its 
objectives, 
as 
well 
as 
by 
the 
application 
of 
norms 
on 
a 
non-selective, 
non-discriminatory 
and 
equitable 
manner. 
71. 
Mr 
NIEWODNICZANSKI 
(Poland) 
said 
that 
several 
very 
important 
tasks 
had 
been 
accomplished 
in 
the 
preceding 
year. 
However, 
multilateral 
non-proliferation 
instruments 
still 
required 
further 
strengthening, 
and 
universal 
adherence 
to 
such 
instruments 
had 
to 
be 
promoted 
to 
ensure 
their 
effective 
implementation. 
His 
country 
had 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
in 
force, 
and 
called 
upon 
other 
States 
to 
fulfil 
their 
obligations 
in 
that 
regard. 
States 
with 
SQPs 
should 
also 
conclude 
an 
exchange 
of 
letters 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
reinforce 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
Poland 
hoped 
that 
further 
progress 
could 
be 
made 
and 
expected 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
to 
be 
highly 
successful. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
Final 
Declaration 
of 
the 
2007 
Conference 
on 
Facilitating 
the 
Entry 
into 
Force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
and 
hoped 
that 
proper 
steps 
would 
be 
taken 
as 
early 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
make 
significant 
progress 
towards 
bringing 
the 
CTBT 
into 
force. 
72. 
Poland 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security 
to 
protect 
the 
world 
from 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
and 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
amended 
CPPNM. 
His 
country 
had 
deposited 
the 
relevant 
ratification 
instruments 
for 
approval 
in 
2008, 
and 
hoped 
that 
other 
States 
Parties 
would 
do 
likewise 
in 
a 
timely 
manner. 
73. 
Poland 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
since 
its 
inception. 
All 
unirradiated 
nuclear 
material 
of 
Russian 
origin 
had 
been 
returned 
to 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
and 
Poland 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
converting 
its 
nuclear 
research 
reactor 
core 
to 
LEU 
fuel. 
Poland 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
administrative 
difficulties 
being 
encountered 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
repatriation 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
of 
Russian 
origin 
would 
be 
overcome 
shortly, 
so 
that 
the 
repatriation 
could 
be 
completed 
successfully. 
74. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
leading 
role 
in 
elaborating 
and 
implementing 
legal 
instruments 
related 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
management. 
Legally 
binding 
conventions 
and 
internationally 
agreed 
safety 
standards 
had 
always 
been 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
As 
a 
party 
to 
all 
the 
relevant 
conventions 
in 
that 
regard, 
his 
country 
appreciated 
the 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
response 
to 
the 
resolution 
passed 
in 
2007 
on 
that 
subject. 
Polish 
representatives 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
Fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
in 
May 
2009. 
Both 
conventions 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
strengthening 
the 
worldÂs 
safety. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
ensuring 
nuclear 
peace 
on 
a 
global 
scale 
could 
not 
be 
overestimated.

75. 
A 
cooperation 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
ITER 
International 
Fusion 
Energy 
Organization 
would 
help 
to 
promote 
fusion 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
would 
benefit 
both 
parties. 
The 
Agency 
had 
traditionally 
been 
a 
source 
of 
new 
ideas 
and 
initiatives 
in 
various 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technologies, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
nuclear 
power 
sector, 
but 
also 
in 
non-power 
fields 
such 
as 
medicine, 
human 
nutrition, 
agriculture, 
hydrology, 
and 
even 
pure 
science. 
Poland 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
technologies, 
which 
were 
particularly 
important 
for 
less 
developed 
Member 
States. 
Poland 
strongly 
supported 
the 
continuation 
of 
the 
Joint 
FAO/IAEA 
Division 
of 
Nuclear 
Techniques 
in 
Food 
and 
Agriculture, 
which 
was 
the 
only 
unit 
dealing 
with 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
agriculture. 
It 
was 
also 
essential 
to 
maintain 
the 
scope 
of 
activity 
of 
the 
three 
Agency 
laboratories 
in 
Seibersdorf, 
Monaco 
and 
Vienna 
which, 
given 
their 
leading 
positions 
and 
scientific 
excellence, 
could 
not 
be 
replaced 
by 
any 
other 
centre 
in 
the 
world. 
76. 
Given 
the 
recent 
worldwide 
trends 
in 
nuclear 
science, 
improved 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
was 
required 
to 
maintain 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
all 
aspects 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
very 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
ensuring 
the 
availability 
of 
qualified 
human 
resources 
to 
fill 
scientific 
and 
engineering 
posts 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
Poland 
fully 
endorsed 
any 
initiative 
proposing 
solutions 
to 
that 
problem, 
especially 
as 
it 
planned 
to 
develop 
its 
own 
nuclear 
power 
capacities 
in 
the 
future. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Poland 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
IRRS 
missions 
to 
Member 
States 
and 
would 
like 
to 
receive 
a 
mission 
to 
conduct 
a 
review 
of 
regulatory, 
technical 
and 
policy 
issues 
and 
to 
identify 
possible 
areas 
for 
improvement. 
77. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
right 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
choose 
that 
option, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
remember 
that 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
entailed 
certain 
security 
problems. 
As 
a 
GNEP 
partner, 
Poland 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
various 
options 
for 
formulating 
multilateral 
conditions 
for 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel-related 
activities. 
78. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
an 
integral 
component 
of 
its 
statutory 
mandate. 
Poland 
was 
a 
good 
example 
of 
a 
country 
whose 
position 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
programme 
had 
changed 
from 
recipient 
to 
donor. 
Poland 
and 
other 
new 
EU 
Member 
States 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries, 
and 
Polish 
institutions 
also 
participated 
actively 
in 
regional 
projects, 
sharing 
their 
knowledge 
and 
competence 
with 
other 
Member 
States. 
He 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
full 
support 
for 
the 
common 
position 
defining 
the 
expectations 
and 
proposed 
principles 
to 
be 
followed 
to 
make 
regional 
cooperation 
more 
efficient 
and 
profitable 
to 
all 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region, 
as 
formulated 
during 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
regional 
meeting 
of 
European 
Member 
States 
earlier 
in 
the 
year. 
79. 
Technical 
cooperation 
activities 
had 
to 
receive 
adequate 
funding, 
and 
donors 
and 
recipients 
had 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
programme 
by 
pledging 
and 
paying 
their 
TCF 
contributions 
and 
NPCs 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full. 
Poland 
therefore 
strongly 
supported 
the 
due 
account 
mechanism. 
The 
country 
was 
prepared 
to 
pledge 
and 
pay 
its 
calculated 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF, 
although 
given 
the 
recent 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
dollar 
exchange 
rate, 
it 
felt 
that 
certain 
financial 
mechanisms 
should 
be 
established 
to 
protect 
such 
contributions. 
80. 
While 
highly 
appreciative 
of 
the 
hard 
work 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
Poland 
was 
concerned 
that 
the 
report 
indicated 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
become 
a 
purely 
political 
body 
with 
limited 
or 
no 
competence 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
science 
and 
preserve 
nuclear 
knowledge. 
That 
would 
not 
satisfy 
the 
expectations 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
and 
Poland 
believed 
that 
disarmament 
and 
verification 
tasks 
should 
be 
given 
the 
same 
attention 
as 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Moreover, 
Poland 
believed 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
should 
not 
depend 
so 
heavily 
on 
extrabudgetary 
funds, 
and 
that 
any 
new 
statutory 
tasks 
imposed 
on 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
Mr 
Mwiria 
(Kenya), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair.

81. 
Mr 
CURIA 
(Argentina) 
said 
that 
as 
part 
of 
the 
policy 
established 
by 
his 
Government 
in 
August 
2006, 
his 
country 
had 
continued 
to 
develop 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
through 
a 
nuclear 
programme 
based 
on 
two 
main 
issues: 
mass 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
with 
a 
heavy 
emphasis 
on 
developing 
autonomous 
capacities 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
products 
and 
services, 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
in 
public 
health 
and 
industry. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
measures 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
implement 
the 
programme. 
82. 
The 
Atucha 
II 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
concluded 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2010. 
Completion 
of 
the 
plant 
would 
not 
only 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
electricity 
generation, 
but 
would 
also 
restart 
a 
whole 
range 
of 
nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
industry 
related 
activities 
requiring 
the 
training 
of 
highly 
specialized 
human 
resources. 
Preliminary 
studies 
and 
activities 
were 
under 
way 
relating 
to 
the 
life 
extension 
of 
the 
Embalse 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
construction 
of 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
the 
subsequent 
decade. 
A 
project 
to 
construct 
a 
prototype 
low-power, 
nationally 
designed 
CAREM 
innovative 
reactor 
was 
ongoing. 
83. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
joint 
efforts 
to 
develop 
next 
generation 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
that 
offered 
a 
higher 
level 
of 
operational 
safety, 
substantially 
reduced 
radioactive 
waste 
generation 
and 
eliminated 
proliferation 
risks. 
In 
particular, 
it 
supported 
INPRO 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
experts 
and 
extrabudgetary 
funding. 
84. 
Measures 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
activities, 
and 
the 
Pilcaniyeu 
Technological 
Complex 
had 
resumed 
its 
uranium 
enrichment 
activities, 
continuing 
the 
evaluation 
of 
an 
innovative 
technology 
developed 
in 
the 
country 
to 
improve 
performance. 
Such 
activities 
were 
intended 
to 
meet 
demand 
for 
LEU 
used 
in 
the 
fuel 
elements 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactors. 
Activities 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
successfully 
since 
2001 
at 
Atucha 
I, 
resulting 
in 
a 
significant 
improvement 
in 
burnup 
to 
make 
savings 
in 
fuel 
costs. 
The 
subsequent 
step 
would 
be 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
for 
low 
enriched 
fuel 
for 
national 
research 
and 
production 
reactors 
and 
experimental 
reactors 
exported 
to 
other 
countries 
and, 
in 
the 
medium 
term, 
for 
CAREM 
reactors. 
85. 
Uranium 
mining 
and 
prospecting 
activities 
had 
been 
intensified 
and 
the 
environmental 
restoration 
of 
deposits 
previously 
affected 
by 
such 
mining 
was 
continuing. 
Industrial 
level 
heavy 
water 
production 
continued 
at 
the 
Arroyito 
plant, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
the 
600 
tonnes 
needed 
for 
the 
initial 
inventory 
of 
the 
Atucha 
II 
plant. 
86. 
The 
conversion 
of 
the 
RA-6 
research 
and 
training 
reactor 
to 
use 
of 
LEU 
had 
been 
completed 
in 
2007. 
That 
had 
been 
the 
last 
reactor 
in 
the 
country 
that 
used 
HEU, 
and 
subsequently 
almost 
all 
HEU 
had 
been 
repatriated, 
thus 
reducing 
the 
national 
inventory 
to 
a 
minimum, 
for 
use 
in 
laboratories. 
87. 
Argentina 
remained 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
activities 
to 
develop 
research 
and 
radioisotope 
production 
reactors 
and 
their 
fuel. 
The 
Centre 
for 
Nuclear 
Diagnostics, 
which 
had 
been 
inaugurated 
in 
May 
2007, 
had 
a 
high 
level 
of 
excellence, 
and 
the 
latest 
diagnosis 
equipment 
for 
oncology, 
cardiology 
and 
neurology. 
It 
also 
performed 
tasks 
related 
to 
public 
services, 
medical 
scientific 
research 
and 
the 
training 
of 
highly 
specialized 
human 
resources. 
The 
Nuclear 
Medicine 
School 
Foundation 
in 
Mendoza 
was 
upgrading 
its 
nuclear 
medicine 
equipment 
for 
the 
training 
of 
postgraduates. 
Argentina 
was 
expanding 
its 
manufacture 
of 
radioisotopes 
in 
laboratories 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
for 
high-tech 
nuclear 
medicine 
equipment. 
88. 
The 
National 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(CNEA) 
had 
divided 
its 
science 
and 
technology 
activities 
into 
four 
main 
areas: 
nuclear 
energy, 
nuclear 
technology 
applications, 
safety 
and 
the 
environment, 
and 
non-nuclear 
applications 
and 
research, 
which 
covered 
activities 
related 
to 
the 
technological 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
research 
reactors, 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
spent 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
applications, 
as 
well 
as 
basic 
scientific 
research 
into 
nuclear 
activity 
and 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear-related 
technologies.

89. 
Argentina 
had 
intensified 
its 
training 
of 
highly 
specialized 
human 
resources 
through 
the 
creation 
of 
its 
third 
university-level 
institute 
specializing 
in 
nuclear 
disciplines, 
the 
Dan 
Beninson 
Institute 
for 
Nuclear 
Technology, 
with 
particular 
emphasis 
on 
nuclear 
reactors, 
fuel 
cycles 
and 
radiochemistry. 
The 
SÃ¡bato 
Institute 
and 
Balseiro 
Institute 
were 
offering 
more 
extensive 
training, 
and 
the 
CNEA 
was 
in 
the 
final 
stage 
of 
negotiations 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
make 
the 
Balseiro 
Institute 
a 
regional 
collaborating 
centre 
for 
the 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
its 
applications. 
90. 
Argentina 
was 
continuing 
to 
establish 
and 
improve 
cooperation 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
as 
shown 
by 
its 
ongoing 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
assistance 
work 
on 
a 
multilateral 
level, 
through 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
ARCAL, 
and 
on 
a 
bilateral 
level, 
through 
specific 
cooperation 
agreements 
with 
around 
30 
States. 
It 
would 
continue 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
experts 
and 
training. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
visit 
to 
Argentina 
and 
cooperation 
activities 
related 
to 
PACT 
demonstrated 
the 
importance 
that 
the 
country 
attached 
to 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency. 
91. 
Argentina 
highly 
valued 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
on 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
The 
existence 
of 
solid, 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
infrastructures 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
crucial 
to 
ensure 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Safety 
and 
security 
had 
to 
be 
tackled 
together, 
not 
separately. 
Argentina 
also 
gave 
special 
attention 
to 
training 
in 
nuclear, 
radiation, 
transport 
and 
waste 
safety, 
and 
had 
signed 
a 
long-term 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
become 
a 
regional 
training 
centre 
in 
that 
regard. 
That 
was 
a 
key 
milestone, 
since 
it 
was 
the 
first 
agreement 
between 
a 
Member 
State 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
response 
to 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(51)/RES/11. 
Another 
relevant 
milestone 
had 
been 
the 
successful 
Fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
as 
so 
much 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
since 
the 
previous 
meeting. 
92. 
The 
12th 
International 
Congress 
of 
the 
International 
Radiation 
Protection 
Association, 
which 
dealt 
with 
the 
establishment 
and 
application 
of 
standards 
for 
protection 
against 
the 
harmful 
effects 
of 
exposure 
to 
radiation, 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Buenos 
Aires 
in 
October 
2008. 
Over 
1500 
communications 
had 
been 
received 
from 
82 
countries 
in 
5 
continents, 
thus 
making 
the 
mission 
to 
strengthen 
radiation 
protection 
throughout 
the 
world 
a 
reality. 
That 
would 
have 
been 
impossible 
without 
the 
extraordinary 
support 
of 
the 
Secretariat, 
which 
had 
ensured 
the 
broad 
participation 
of 
developing 
countries. 
93. 
Argentina 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Annual 
Report 
referred 
to 
activities 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Radiological 
and 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agencies 
under 
an 
extrabudgetary 
programme. 
Chile 
had 
recently 
joined 
the 
Forum, 
bringing 
the 
number 
of 
members 
to 
seven. 
The 
Report 
had 
also 
noted 
important 
progress 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
radiation 
protection 
of 
patients, 
the 
application 
of 
PSA 
in 
radiotherapy, 
and 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Ibero-American 
Radiation 
Safety 
Network. 
94. 
International 
safeguards 
were 
especially 
important 
for 
facilitating 
nuclear 
expansion 
and 
allowing 
the 
Agency 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
statutory 
function 
to 
accelerate 
and 
enlarge 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity 
throughout 
the 
world. 
The 
Agency 
implemented 
an 
effective 
verification 
system 
to 
assure 
the 
international 
community 
of 
the 
peaceful 
purposes 
of 
nuclear 
programmes. 
Such 
guarantees 
had 
to 
be 
achieved 
through 
cooperation 
and 
dialogue 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Member 
States, 
guided 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
non-discrimination, 
quality, 
technical 
excellence 
and 
objectivity 
of 
criteria 
and 
expert 
opinion, 
without 
which 
their 
credibility 
would 
be 
affected. 
Argentina 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Common 
System 
of 
Accounting 
and 
Control 
of 
Nuclear 
Materials 
and 
the 
cooperation 
between 
ABACC 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Such 
cooperation 
should 
be 
extended 
and 
intensified 
to 
ensure 
an 
effective 
and 
more 
efficient 
application 
of 
safeguards 
under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement, 
particularly 
in 
view 
of 
the 
contribution 
that 
ABACC 
and 
the 
bilateral 
system 
made 
to 
non-proliferation 
efforts.

95. 
As 
regards 
nuclear 
material 
accounting 
and 
control, 
the 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority, 
an 
independent 
control 
body, 
was 
continuing 
its 
work, 
giving 
priority 
to 
tasks 
related 
to 
the 
licensing 
of 
Atucha 
II 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
extending 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Embalse 
and 
Atucha 
I 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
96. 
There 
had 
been 
a 
new 
push 
towards 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
region 
and 
a 
decision 
had 
been 
taken 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil 
in 
February 
2008 
to 
intensify 
cooperation, 
with 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Binational 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
and 
the 
subsequent 
approval 
of 
numerous 
ambitious 
joint 
projects 
related 
to 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
waste, 
the 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
nuclear 
applications, 
including 
relevant 
regulatory 
aspects. 
97. 
Argentina 
believed 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
future; 
its 
multiple 
applications 
to 
alleviate 
poverty 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
millions 
would 
give 
the 
Agency 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
statutory 
mission. 
The 
Agency 
had 
to 
strengthen 
its 
work 
in 
all 
countries 
that 
were 
considering, 
or 
had 
taken 
decisions, 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power. 
98. 
Argentina 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
principles 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
strongly 
believed 
in 
the 
right 
of 
countries 
to 
develop 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
at 
any 
level, 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
international 
obligations. 
His 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
participating 
actively 
in 
the 
debate 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
future 
direction. 
99. 
Mr 
ZNIBER 
(Morocco) 
said 
that 
the 
global 
demand 
for 
energy 
was 
growing 
apace 
and 
rising 
energy 
prices 
on 
international 
markets 
were 
undermining 
security 
and 
stability 
and 
placing 
a 
heavy 
burden 
on 
developing 
countries. 
The 
phenomenon 
of 
climate 
change 
also 
made 
it 
necessary 
to 
diversify 
energy 
sources. 
If 
countries 
chose 
under 
those 
circumstances 
to 
exploit 
the 
enormous 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
they 
would 
have 
to 
take 
action 
to 
meet 
the 
challenges 
associated 
with 
it. 
Hence 
the 
growing 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
as 
it 
entered 
its 
sixth 
decade. 
100. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
world 
was 
witnessing 
the 
growth 
of 
organized 
terrorist 
networks 
with 
sufficient 
funds 
and 
know-how 
to 
use 
nuclear 
weapons 
to 
achieve 
their 
aims. 
Every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
through 
the 
Agency 
to 
frustrate 
their 
plans. 
As 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
Morocco 
was 
concerned 
about 
the 
failure 
to 
make 
any 
progress 
towards 
universalizing 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
a 
fact 
that 
was 
undermining 
its 
credibility. 
He 
hoped 
that 
all 
parties 
to 
the 
Treaty 
would 
support 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Arab 
States 
to 
promote, 
through 
the 
Agency, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
was 
a 
goal 
that 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
unless 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region, 
including 
Israel, 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
placed 
their 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
activities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
time 
had 
come 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
pay 
serious 
attention 
to 
a 
situation 
that 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
General 
Conference 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
regard. 
Morocco 
also 
placed 
great 
hopes 
on 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
NPT 
review 
conference 
to 
be 
held 
in 
2010. 
101. 
Morocco 
gave 
high 
priority 
to 
the 
development 
of 
its 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
sector. 
It 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
developing 
countries 
to 
use 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance, 
it 
had 
extended 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
cover 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
vital 
activities. 
During 
the 
current 
year 
it 
was 
pursuing 
15 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
food, 
environmental 
protection, 
water 
resources 
and 
radioactive 
safety. 
It 
was 
also 
participating 
in 
a 
number 
of 
regional 
projects 
under 
the 
AFRA 
Agreement. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
providing 
AFRA 
with 
financial 
and 
logistical 
support. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
results 
achieved 
at 
the 
AFRA 
ministerial 
meeting 
held 
in 
Aswan, 
Egypt, 
which 
had 
agreed 
on 
far-reaching 
reforms 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
cooperation 
among 
African 
countries 
in 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
called 
on 
international 
institutions 
and 
donor 
countries 
to 
provide 
financial 
support 
for 
AFRA 
through 
the 
fund 
to 
be 
established 
for 
that 
purpose.

102. 
Morocco 
had 
begun 
operating 
its 
first 
research 
reactor 
in 
2007. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
for 
the 
project 
from 
the 
outset. 
103. 
In 
keeping 
with 
a 
basic 
principle 
of 
its 
foreign 
policy, 
Morocco 
strongly 
supported 
South-South 
technological 
cooperation 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
had 
hosted 
high-level 
training 
courses 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
radiation 
prevention 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
its 
preparations 
for 
the 
sixth 
training 
course, 
Morocco 
welcomed 
the 
valuable 
findings 
of 
the 
training 
assessment 
mission 
that 
had 
visited 
the 
country 
in 
June 
2007. 
It 
hoped 
to 
play 
an 
increasingly 
important 
role 
in 
regional 
training 
in 
radioactive 
safety 
by 
placing 
its 
human 
resources 
and 
expertise 
at 
the 
service 
of 
African 
researchers 
and 
experts. 
104. 
Morocco 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
cancer. 
It 
was 
building 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
and 
promoting 
awareness 
through 
public 
information 
campaigns. 
Princess 
Lalla 
Salma, 
the 
wife 
of 
King 
Mohammed 
VI, 
oversaw 
the 
work 
of 
the 
King 
Mohammed 
V 
Anti-Cancer 
Association. 
Morocco 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
under 
the 
PACT 
programme 
and 
hoped 
to 
play 
an 
effective 
regional 
role 
in 
that 
field 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
105. 
Morocco 
welcomed 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
membership, 
which 
would 
strengthen 
cooperation 
and 
exchanges 
of 
expertise 
among 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fields 
of 
competence. 
106. 
Mr 
ZOGRAFOS 
(Greece) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Although 
individual 
Member 
States 
bore 
ultimate 
responsibility 
for 
the 
safe 
operation 
of 
their 
nuclear 
facilities, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
independent 
professional 
opinion 
set 
the 
norms 
of 
a 
global 
safety 
culture. 
Greece 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
Fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
also 
intended 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention. 
107. 
Experts 
from 
the 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
participated 
actively 
in 
Agency 
activities. 
Greece 
followed 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
which 
it 
had 
implemented 
together 
with 
the 
corresponding 
EU 
directive. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
use 
installed 
border 
equipment 
and 
to 
share 
the 
experience 
gained 
with 
other 
countries 
by 
offering 
training 
and 
organizing 
seminars 
on 
relevant 
issues. 
Greece 
was 
extending 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
nuclear 
security 
by 
providing 
technical 
support 
services 
to 
the 
region 
with 
regard 
to 
sustainability 
and 
maintenance 
of 
border 
radiation 
detection 
equipment. 
108. 
Greece 
supported 
every 
effort 
made 
to 
establish 
an 
effective 
global 
security 
regime 
and 
had 
provided 
both 
financial 
and 
in-kind 
contributions 
in 
that 
connection. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
on 
the 
measures 
taken 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
particularly 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009. 
Greece 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
forthcoming 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2010Â2013. 
109. 
The 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
was 
a 
recognized 
Agency 
regional 
training 
centre 
in 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
security, 
having 
hosted 
an 
upgraded 
postgraduate 
course. 
In 
addition, 
since 
2007, 
nearly 
50 
participants 
from 
23 
countries 
had 
attended 
seminars 
concerning 
the 
assessment 
of 
occupational 
exposure 
owing 
to 
radionuclide 
intake 
and 
remote 
monitoring 
and 
sustainability 
of 
border 
radiation 
detection 
equipment. 
110. 
Greece 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
members 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
illicit 
trafficking 
information 
system, 
established 
in 
1995. 
His 
country 
participated 
in 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative 
and 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
It 
had 
also 
signed 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
had 
ratified 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism.

111. 
The 
continuing 
success 
of 
international 
safeguards 
relied 
on 
political 
support 
at 
international 
and 
regional 
levels, 
and 
on 
the 
political 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
of 
inspected 
States. 
Greece 
supported 
every 
effort 
to 
continue 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system 
as 
technology 
developed 
so 
that 
the 
system 
could 
be 
made 
as 
credible 
as 
possible. 
Broader 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols, 
which 
enhanced 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
improved 
its 
efficiency, 
was 
the 
most 
effective 
measure 
in 
response 
to 
security 
and 
proliferation 
threats. 
112. 
Greece 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
concerning 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme, 
and 
reaffirmed 
its 
support 
for 
a 
negotiated 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue. 
However, 
he 
noted 
with 
grave 
concern 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
most 
recent 
report 
indicated 
that 
no 
substantive 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
on 
the 
alleged 
studies 
and 
other 
associated 
remaining 
key 
issues. 
IranÂs 
compliance 
with 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
Board 
requirements 
was 
essential, 
and 
Greece 
urged 
Iran 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency, 
including 
making 
full 
disclosure 
of 
any 
work 
related 
to 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
facilitating 
Agency 
verification. 
Greece 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
demonstrate 
good 
faith, 
full 
transparency 
and 
good 
cooperation, 
paving 
the 
way 
for 
the 
suspension 
of 
all 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
113. 
LibyaÂs 
decision 
to 
adopt 
a 
policy 
of 
providing 
every 
access 
to 
safeguards 
inspectors, 
even 
beyond 
that 
required 
under 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
had 
been 
universally 
welcomed. 
He 
hoped 
that 
it 
was 
an 
example 
that 
could 
be 
followed 
by 
others. 
114. 
The 
nuclear 
community 
had 
always 
faced 
obstacles 
that 
did 
not 
exist 
in 
any 
other 
trading 
activity. 
Credibility 
and 
assurance 
of 
supply 
were 
vital 
to 
trade 
negotiations. 
Early 
proposals 
on 
assurance 
of 
supply 
and 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
lost 
amid 
lengthy 
discussions 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
political 
will. 
The 
clear 
need 
for 
reconsideration 
and 
the 
relentless 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
brought 
closer 
the 
idea 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism 
to 
strengthen 
non-
proliferation 
and 
meet 
growing 
demands. 
The 
basis 
of 
such 
a 
mechanism 
in 
the 
short 
term 
would 
be 
a 
fuel 
bank 
of 
last 
resort 
under 
Agency 
auspices, 
operating 
in 
a 
non-political 
and 
non-discriminatory 
way, 
in 
accordance 
with 
non-proliferation 
and 
other 
criteria. 
Such 
a 
bank 
would 
not 
be 
used 
in 
a 
non-
compliance 
case, 
nor 
to 
solve 
commercial 
issues. 
Greece 
supported 
such 
a 
plan 
fully 
and, 
as 
an 
EU 
Member 
State, 
was 
ready 
to 
contribute 
towards 
its 
early 
implementation. 
115. 
Greece 
contributed 
100% 
of 
its 
voluntary 
obligations 
Â 
approximately 
US$500 
000 
per 
year 
Â 
to 
the 
TCF. 
In 
recognition 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
were 
now 
other 
countries 
with 
priority 
needs 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
technical 
cooperation, 
Greece 
had 
made 
no 
claims 
for 
national 
programmes 
for 
the 
next 
cycle. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
its 
participation 
in 
regional 
programmes 
was 
increasing, 
since 
the 
impact 
of 
such 
programmes 
was 
considered 
valuable 
for 
collaboration 
and 
harmonization. 
Greece 
was 
now 
returning 
the 
AgencyÂs 
investment 
in 
it, 
by 
hosting 
ever 
more 
scientists 
from 
around 
the 
world 
free 
of 
charge. 
Technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
should 
be 
designed 
well 
in 
advance 
and 
implemented 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
network 
of 
partnerships 
with 
participant 
States. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
Âone 
houseÂ 
approach 
was 
an 
important 
element 
in 
the 
planning 
and 
execution 
of 
technical 
cooperation. 
The 
use 
of 
isotopes 
was 
very 
important 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
health, 
particularly 
in 
the 
developing 
world, 
where 
millions 
of 
people 
were 
suffering 
from 
cancer. 
He 
highlighted 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
PACT 
programme 
in 
that 
regard. 
116. 
Thanks 
to 
years 
of 
investment, 
the 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
grown 
as 
a 
unique 
authority 
within 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
organizations. 
The 
Commission 
represented 
Greece 
in 
26 
EU 
committees, 
12 
OECD/NEA 
committees 
and 
21 
Agency 
committees. 
It 
also 
participated 
in 
11 
regional 
programmes, 
organized 
training 
seminars 
for 
various 
institutions 
and 
prepared 
responses 
to 
questions 
raised 
in 
Parliament 
related 
to 
nuclear 
matters.

117. 
Greece 
was 
contributing 
in 
full 
its 
share 
of 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
In 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
need 
for 
increased 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
in 
programme 
delivery 
Â 
to 
be 
achieved 
through 
AIPS 
Â 
his 
country 
had 
made 
part 
of 
its 
share 
of 
the 
2006 
budget 
surplus 
available 
to 
the 
Agency. 
118. 
He 
praised 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
in 
making 
an 
assessment 
of 
the 
challenges 
the 
Agency 
would 
have 
to 
face 
up 
to 
the 
year 
2020 
and 
beyond. 
The 
CommissionÂs 
report 
addressed 
many 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
and 
set 
out 
very 
useful 
recommendations. 
His 
country 
congratulated 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Commission 
and 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
vision 
as 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
role 
in 
the 
difficult 
times 
ahead. 
119. 
Mr 
MONAWAR 
(Afghanistan) 
said 
that 
the 
preceding 
year 
had 
been 
one 
of 
great 
hopes 
and 
grave 
fears. 
The 
world 
had 
witnessed 
the 
hope-inspiring 
glory 
of 
human 
accomplishment 
at 
the 
Olympic 
Games 
in 
Beijing, 
but 
also 
the 
loss 
of 
life 
from 
natural 
disasters; 
there 
was 
a 
growing 
global 
understanding 
of 
climate 
change 
issues, 
but 
millions 
of 
lives 
were 
threatened 
every 
day 
by 
food 
shortages; 
the 
world 
had 
also 
seen 
with 
disbelief 
the 
brutal 
slaughter 
of 
innocent 
people 
at 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorists 
in 
Afghanistan, 
Algeria, 
India, 
Lebanon, 
Pakistan 
and 
Syria. 
Terrorism 
could 
not 
be 
ended 
until 
the 
elaborate 
institutional 
support 
enjoyed 
by 
perpetrators 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
dismantled, 
and 
their 
secure 
sanctuaries 
eliminated. 
Dedicated 
regional 
and 
international 
cooperation 
could 
make 
that 
possible. 
120. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
worldÂs 
most 
effective 
enforcer 
of 
nuclear 
safeguards. 
Afghanistan 
was 
a 
country 
that 
faced 
geographical 
challenges 
as 
well 
as 
added 
internal 
dangers 
owing 
to 
the 
control 
of 
weapons 
by 
terrorists, 
and 
thorough 
monitoring 
and 
regulation 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
was 
therefore 
critical 
to 
its 
security. 
121. 
A 
new 
generation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
could 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
global 
energy 
shortages 
and 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 
but 
the 
security 
of 
medium 
and 
small 
reactors 
would 
have 
to 
be 
made 
compatible 
with 
small 
grids. 
The 
Agency 
had 
to 
continue 
to 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
instituting 
protective 
measures 
so 
that 
such 
technologies 
could 
be 
used 
safely. 
The 
Agency 
had 
an 
opportunity 
to 
push 
forward 
with 
its 
innovation 
work. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
areas 
including 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
industry 
could 
be 
instrumental 
in 
facilitating 
rapid 
progress 
in 
international 
development. 
Nuclear 
power 
could 
not 
be 
seriously 
considered 
as 
a 
potential 
sustainable 
energy 
source 
unless 
active 
measures 
were 
taken 
to 
ensure 
its 
safety 
and 
security. 
However, 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capabilities 
in 
that 
regard, 
a 
cleaner, 
safer 
and 
more 
efficient 
future 
might 
be 
anticipated. 
122. 
Safe, 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technologies 
needed 
to 
be 
developed 
in 
Afghanistan. 
His 
country 
was 
in 
a 
period 
of 
recovery, 
at 
a 
pivotal 
time 
in 
the 
nationÂs 
history. 
The 
development 
of 
sustainable 
industries 
was 
essential, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
food 
security, 
health 
and 
water 
management, 
where 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technologies 
held 
great 
potential. 
123. 
Industrial 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
be 
used 
in 
gas 
exploration, 
road 
construction 
and 
imaging 
technologies 
to 
solve 
medical 
problems. 
Nuclear 
technologies 
could 
improve 
the 
safety 
and 
quality 
of 
food 
and 
improve 
control 
of 
food 
production. 
Ionizing 
radiation 
could 
be 
used 
to 
destroy 
various 
contaminants 
that 
caused 
illness 
or 
rendered 
food 
shipments 
inedible. 
Such 
techniques 
could 
also 
help 
to 
regulate 
food 
quantity 
and 
quality, 
and 
to 
prevent 
uncertainty 
in 
agricultural 
production 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
food 
crises. 
124. 
If 
Afghanistan 
could 
develop 
an 
adequate 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure, 
it 
would 
not 
have 
to 
be 
dependent 
on 
oil 
in 
the 
future, 
which 
was 
particularly 
important 
to 
its 
growth 
as 
an 
autonomous, 
sovereign 
nation. 
Additionally, 
the 
environmental 
solution 
presented 
by 
nuclear 
power 
was 
beneficial 
to 
the 
world. 
Given 
the 
environmental 
impact 
of 
fossil 
fuels, 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
find 
alternatives.

Progress 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
research 
gave 
Afghanistan 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
growth 
and 
development. 
With 
the 
oversight 
of 
the 
Agency, 
it 
could 
use 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technologies 
to 
develop 
its 
own 
industries, 
tackle 
food 
crises 
and 
prevent 
climate 
change, 
thus 
assisting 
the 
countryÂs 
development 
as 
a 
functioning, 
stable 
nation. 
Initiatives 
like 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
could 
open 
the 
door 
for 
nations 
such 
as 
his 
own 
to 
make 
significant 
developmental 
advances. 
However, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
remember 
that 
any 
breakthroughs 
should 
be 
for 
the 
advancement 
and 
improvement 
of 
society 
and 
not 
for 
destructive 
ends. 
126. 
Afghanistan 
strongly 
supported 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
acquire 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
regime. 
Mutual 
trust 
between 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
States 
had 
to 
be 
strengthened 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
the 
goal 
of 
a 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Afghanistan 
took 
a 
strong, 
unwavering 
stand 
against 
nuclear 
proliferation 
for 
military 
purposes, 
and 
wholeheartedly 
supported 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
additional 
protocol 
to 
ensure 
that 
parties 
adhere 
to 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
practice. 
Member 
StatesÂ 
actions 
had 
to 
be 
transparent 
to 
strengthen 
the 
trust 
required 
for 
achieving 
international 
cooperation 
and 
safety 
goals. 
Afghanistan 
called 
upon 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
join, 
ratify 
and 
implement 
the 
NPT, 
and 
conclude 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
CTBT 
was 
still 
waiting 
for 
ratification 
by 
the 
States 
listed 
in 
Annex 
2 
before 
it 
could 
enter 
into 
force. 
127. 
Afghanistan 
was 
extremely 
concerned 
about 
the 
military 
testing 
of 
WMDs 
throughout 
the 
world, 
especially 
in 
its 
own 
region. 
If 
and 
when 
an 
incident 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
took 
place, 
the 
responsibility 
would 
have 
to 
be 
borne 
by 
those 
States 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
technology. 
128. 
The 
A.Q. 
Khan 
network 
was 
a 
clear 
violation 
of 
international 
norms, 
including 
the 
NPT. 
The 
confession 
made 
clearly 
indicated 
the 
willingness 
of 
the 
Pakistani 
Government 
to 
participate 
in 
such 
acts. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
to 
discuss 
the 
matter 
with 
serious 
consideration 
and 
hold 
accountable 
those 
regimes 
that 
supported 
or 
advocated 
such 
dangerous 
and 
irresponsible 
acts. 
129. 
In 
view 
of 
its 
serious 
concerns 
about 
regional 
proliferation, 
especially 
in 
South 
Asia, 
Afghanistan 
firmly 
supported 
the 
disarmament 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
appreciated 
ChinaÂs 
leadership 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
His 
country 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
place 
their 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
materials 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime. 
130. 
The 
creation 
of 
NWFZs 
was 
a 
logical 
way 
to 
achieve 
collective 
safety. 
Governments 
and 
the 
military 
controlled 
WMDs, 
yet 
innocent 
civilians 
would 
be 
the 
ones 
to 
suffer 
from 
rogue 
proliferation. 
Afghanistan 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
NWFZs 
in 
Latin 
America, 
Africa, 
Southeast 
Asia, 
Central 
Asia, 
and 
the 
South 
Pacific. 
It 
firmly 
supported 
and 
encouraged 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
131. 
Diplomacy 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
resolve 
security 
concerns 
worldwide, 
and 
Afghanistan 
required 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
while 
it 
tried 
to 
move 
forwards. 
The 
world 
recognized 
that 
it 
should 
not 
turn 
its 
back 
on 
Afghanistan 
and 
that 
the 
country 
needed 
to 
succeed 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
stabilize 
and 
modernize. 
He 
hoped 
that 
joint 
efforts 
could 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
his 
countryÂs 
stability, 
advancement 
and 
success. 
132. 
Mr 
QUIÃONES 
(Dominican 
Republic) 
said 
that 
more 
than 
half 
a 
century 
after 
the 
advent 
of 
the 
nuclear 
era, 
nuclear 
technologies 
Â 
which 
had 
originally 
primarily 
been 
directed 
towards 
military 
purposes 
Â 
were 
providing 
solutions 
to 
problems 
associated 
with 
human 
development 
and 
welfare, 
and 
were 
being 
used 
in 
practically 
all 
spheres 
of 
human 
activity. 
His 
country 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
recognized 
its 
contribution 
in 
meeting 
the 
challenges 
facing 
the 
international 
community. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
function, 
challenges 
and 
opportunities, 
which 
would 
be 
a 
basis 
for 
consideration 
by 
Member 
States.

133. 
The 
undertaking 
to 
achieve 
the 
MDGs 
was 
perhaps 
one 
of 
the 
most 
significant 
commitments 
the 
international 
community 
had 
ever 
made. 
As 
such 
it 
put 
great 
responsibility 
on 
States 
and 
required 
a 
great 
deal 
of 
political 
will, 
the 
planning 
of 
actions 
to 
meet 
the 
targets 
set, 
a 
reordering 
of 
budgetary 
priorities 
and 
a 
major 
flow 
of 
resources 
to 
assist 
and 
support 
development. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
and 
make 
them 
available 
to 
developing 
countries 
through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
atomic 
energy 
was 
making 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
towards 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
MDGs, 
particularly 
in 
priority 
areas 
of 
human 
development 
such 
as 
health, 
food, 
agriculture, 
the 
environment 
and 
energy 
supply. 
134. 
In 
the 
current 
context 
of 
rising 
prices 
for 
basic 
food 
products, 
the 
issue 
of 
ensuring 
food 
security 
was 
one 
that 
deserved 
the 
fullest 
attention 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
joined 
others 
in 
calling 
for 
concrete 
and 
forceful 
measures 
to 
resolve 
the 
issue 
of 
food 
security, 
which 
had 
exacerbated 
poverty 
in 
many 
countries. 
In 
his 
countryÂs 
region, 
the 
devastating 
effects 
of 
atmospheric 
phenomena 
on 
agriculture 
had 
made 
the 
situation 
even 
worse. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
recognized 
the 
contributions 
that 
nuclear 
technology 
had 
made 
to 
food 
security; 
isotopic 
techniques 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
increasing 
food 
production, 
controlling 
pests 
using 
the 
SIT, 
and 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
soil 
and 
of 
water 
resources. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
redoubled 
its 
efforts 
to 
increase 
its 
support 
for 
agricultural 
development 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
current 
food 
crisis, 
and 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
strengthen 
those 
efforts 
through 
the 
Joint 
Division, 
which 
had 
provided 
so 
much 
assistance 
to 
developing 
countries. 
135. 
The 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
the 
prevention, 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
diseases 
such 
as 
cancer 
was 
essential 
for 
preserving 
human 
life. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
national 
cancer 
control 
plans 
through 
the 
framework 
of 
PACT 
was 
particularly 
welcome. 
He 
hoped 
that 
PACT 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
efforts 
to 
combat 
cancer 
in 
the 
whole 
Caribbean 
region. 
136. 
Ensuring 
energy 
security, 
while 
facing 
issues 
such 
as 
global 
warming, 
increasing 
fossil 
fuel 
prices 
and 
growing 
energy 
demand, 
was 
a 
challenge 
for 
all 
Member 
States, 
but 
one 
that 
was 
most 
serious 
for 
developing 
countries 
that 
also 
had 
to 
address 
the 
food 
crisis. 
The 
renewed 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
reflected 
countriesÂ 
need 
to 
diversify 
their 
energy 
mix, 
reduce 
their 
dependence 
on 
oil 
and 
decrease 
emissions 
of 
pollutants 
into 
the 
atmosphere. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
was 
indispensable 
in 
providing 
developing 
countries 
with 
access 
to 
the 
training 
and 
other 
elements 
needed 
to 
consider 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
recognized 
and 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
increase 
its 
activities 
in 
the 
energy 
sector, 
as 
they 
were 
of 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
study 
of 
all 
power 
generation 
options. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
drawn 
up 
an 
integrated 
plan 
for 
promoting 
investment 
in 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
legal 
framework 
of 
financial 
incentives. 
Numerous 
wind, 
solar, 
biodiesel, 
ethanol, 
and 
hydroelectric 
energy 
projects 
were 
currently 
being 
studied 
or 
implemented. 
In 
addition, 
in 
order 
to 
find 
viable 
solutions 
of 
low 
environmental 
impact 
to 
energy 
problems 
at 
the 
national, 
regional 
and 
international 
level, 
the 
country 
had 
hosted 
the 
first 
International 
Energy 
Week 
in 
January 
2008, 
bringing 
together 
representatives 
of 
governments, 
international 
organizations, 
consultants 
and 
private 
companies 
to 
discuss 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
situation. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
participation 
in 
the 
event. 
137. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
crucial 
for 
transferring 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
techniques 
to 
developing 
countries. 
Thanks 
to 
Agency 
support, 
personnel 
had 
received 
training 
in 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
resources, 
the 
environment 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
setting 
up 
cancer 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
facilities, 
establishing 
dosimetry 
laboratories 
and 
adopting 
radiation 
protection 
regulations. 
For 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
the 
priority 
was 
to 
promote 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
science 
in 
general 
and 
to 
participate 
in 
international 
cooperation 
on 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technologies. 
The 
country 
was 
working 
to 
strengthen 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
make 
further 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
In 
the 
next 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle, 
Agency 
assistance 
would 
contribute 

GC(52)/OR.5

towards 
establishing 
a 
nuclear 
research 
and 
applications 
centre, 
improving 
the 
radiotherapy 
service 
at 
the 
new 
national 
cancer 
hospital, 
assessing 
sedimentation 
in 
reservoirs 
and 
dams, 
studying 
the 
ecological 
requirements 
of 
protected 
areas 
and 
developing 
human 
resources 
in 
general. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
intended 
to 
complete 
the 
review 
of 
its 
CPF 
shortly, 
which 
would 
focus 
on 
areas 
where 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
development 
priorities. 


138. 
With 
regard 
to 
regional 
cooperation, 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
ratified 
the 
ARCAL 
Agreement 
in 
July 
2008 
and 
had 
also 
signed 
an 
inter-institutional 
agreement 
with 
CubaÂs 
Agency 
for 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Advanced 
Technologies, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
promoting 
cooperation 
in 
the 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
An 
expert 
from 
Argentina 
had 
also 
visited 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
to 
take 
the 
first 
steps 
for 
collaboration 
between 
the 
two 
countries 
on 
training. 
139. 
Preventing 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
in 
the 
construction 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
or 
in 
terrorist 
acts, 
in 
addition 
to 
protecting 
the 
public 
and 
the 
environment 
from 
the 
dangers 
posed 
by 
radiation, 
was 
fundamental. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
was 
key 
in 
minimizing 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
would 
hold 
a 
regional 
seminar 
in 
October 
2008 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
safeguards, 
which 
was 
to 
be 
attended 
by 
senior 
representatives 
of 
ministries 
of 
foreign 
affairs 
and 
the 
environment, 
regulatory 
authorities, 
police 
forces, 
intelligence 
services, 
customs 
services 
and 
other 
authorities 
from 
the 
22 
countries 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
region. 
140. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
welcomed 
the 
measures 
taken 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
promote 
safe 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
materials, 
since 
the 
country 
lay 
on 
a 
maritime 
transit 
route 
for 
such 
shipments 
and 
was 
greatly 
concerned 
that 
they 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
the 
safest 
manner 
possible. 
It 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
regime 
concerning 
civil 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage, 
welcomed 
the 
process 
of 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States, 
and 
reiterated 
the 
importance 
of 
coastal 
States 
being 
provided 
with 
full

141. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
made 
efforts 
to 
improve 
its 
radiation 
safety 
and 
protection 
infrastructure, 
both 
in 
institutional 
and 
regulatory 
terms, 
so 
that 
the 
country 
could 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
the 
safest 
and 
most 
effective 
way 
possible, 
and 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
safety 
and 
security 
by 
addressing 
the 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
materials. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
support 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
those 
areas, 
particularly 
in 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
the 
final 
disposal 
of 
disused 
sources, 
response 
to 
radiation 
incidents 
and 
emergencies, 
and 
control 
of 
illicit 
trafficking. 
Agency 
training 
courses 
and 
workshops 
on 
such 
subjects, 
with 
broad 
participation 
from 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
countries, 
had 
enabled 
the 
development 
of 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
important 
capacities. 
142. 
His 
country 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
strengthened 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
system. 
Its 
own 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
in 
force 
since 
1973, 
and 
it 
had 
already 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
had 
also 
agreed 
to 
modifications 
to 
its 
SQP 
in 
2005. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
hosted 
a 
regional 
seminar 
on 
application 
of 
the 
strengthened 
safeguards 
system 
in 
July 
2008, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
raising 
awareness 
of 
the 
measures 
the 
system 
in 
the 
region 
and 
assisting 
States 
that 
held 
a 
limited 
quantity 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
in 
applying 
those 
measures. 
143. 
Mr 
ALBUSAIDI 
(Oman) 
thanked 
Member 
States 
for 
approving 
OmanÂs 
application 
for 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency. 
He 
assured 
them 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
strong 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
promoting 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
in 
enabling 
States 
to 
benefit 
from 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Oman 
looked 
forward 
to 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
electricity 
generation 
and 
water 
desalination, 
and 
hoped 
to 
benefit 
from 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
medicine, 
health, 
the 
environment, 
water 
resources 
management 
and 
agriculture.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/9) 
1. 
Mr 
VEJONIS 
(Latvia) 
expressed 
satisfaction 
that 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
targets 
for 
the 
TCF 
for 
the 
years 
2009Â2011, 
enabling 
the 
Agency 
to 
move 
forward 
in 
finalizing 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
that 
cycle. 
Latvia, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
submitted 
only 
two 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
a 
step 
consistent 
with 
the 
trend 
of 
increasing 
the 
use 
of 
regional 
projects, 
which 
were 
useful 
forums 
for 
the 
exchange 
of 
ideas 
and 
experience. 
Latvia 
was 
also 
hosting 
scientific 
visits 
and 
training 
courses, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
the 
exchange 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge. 
2. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
he 
said 
that 
Member 
States 
participating 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
Europe 
had 
adopted 
a 
common 
position 
on 
the 
development 
of 
a 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
strategy, 
and 
had 
decided 
that 
funds 
not 
used 
by 
European 
Union 
countries 
should 
be 
used 
for 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
requiring 
additional 
resources 
for 
their 
development 
and 
infrastructure. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
engage 
in 
timely, 
active 
and 
transparent 
consultations 
with 
Member 
States 
in 
cases 
where 
budgeting 
principles 
were 
being 
reviewed 
and 
modified. 
Any 
changes 
to 
the 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
allocated 
to 
Europe 
should 
be 
introduced 
only 
with 
the 
consent 
of 
the 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Europe 
region 
in 
a 
transparent 
and 
constructive 
way. 
Latvia 
was 
ready 
to 
pay 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target. 
It 
had 
gained 
much 
from 
participating 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
continued 
to 
allocate 
supplementary 
contributions 
for 
its 
national 
projects. 
3. 
Latvia 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
on 
measures 
to 
fund 
the 
initial 
stage 
of 
the 
AIPS 
project 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
the 
adoption 
of 
IPSAS 
by 
2010. 
Latvia 
had 
permitted 
its 
2006 
cash 
surplus 
to 
be 
used 
for 
the 
funding 
of 
AIPS, 
a 
system 
that 
would 
provide 
greater 
transparency 
and 
improve 
efficiency 
in 
the 
internal 
control 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
procurement 
options, 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
Member 
States. 
4. 
Latvia 
welcomed 
the 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
a 
number 
of 
Member 
States 
concerning 
the 
repatriation 
of 
HEU 
fuel. 
Thanks 
to 
help 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
Latvia 
had 
succeeded 
in 
returning 
spent 
fuel 
to 
the 
country 
of 
origin 
in 
May 
2008. 
5. 
In 
the 
current 
international 
environment, 
effective 
measures 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
to 
prevent 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear, 
biological, 
chemical 
and 
radiological 
weapons 
were 
essential. 
Member 
States 
should 
therefore 
attach 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
strong 
national 
and 
internationally 
coordinated 
export 
controls 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
and 
combat 
the 
establishment 
of 
procurement 
networks, 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
technologies 
and 
materials, 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
proliferation 
of 
such 
materials 
by 
non-State 
actors. 
A 
project 
to 
develop 
training 
materials 
on 
dual-use 
items 
had 
been 
implemented 
by 
Latvian 
customs 
institutions 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy. 
As 
a 
result, 
a 
handbook 
on 
goods 
identification 
had 
been 
published, 
experts 
educated, 
and 
the 
control 
system 
and 
procedures 
concerning 
dual-use 
goods 
had 
been 
improved 
significantly. 
6. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
first 
CRP 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
technical 
measures 
to 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material 
had 
been 
an 
important 
milestone. 
Also, 
he 
noted 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Council 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
of 
the 
third 
Joint 
Action 
in 
support 
of 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security.

7. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
Latvia 
strongly 
supported 
strengthening 
its 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency. 
Thirty 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
still 
not 
fulfilled 
their 
obligation 
to 
bring 
into 
force 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
which 
meant 
that 
more 
than 
1100 
facilities 
containing 
nuclear 
material 
were 
not 
under 
safeguards. 
Latvia 
regretted 
such 
a 
situation, 
and 
called 
upon 
the 
countries 
concerned 
to 
bring 
their 
safeguards 
agreements 
into 
force. 
It 
had 
been 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
12 
Member 
States 
had 
concluded 
an 
additional 
protocol 
since 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
8. 
Mr 
MOSQUERA 
(Ecuador) 
said 
that 
since 
the 
AgencyÂs 
establishment, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
witnessed 
the 
evolution 
of 
a 
solid 
organization 
that 
was 
noted 
for 
its 
professionalism, 
impartiality 
and 
independence. 
Efforts 
had 
to 
continue 
for 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
safer, 
fairer 
world, 
where 
nuclear 
technologies 
contributed 
to 
social 
welfare 
rather 
than 
causing 
concern 
or 
destruction. 
His 
country 
applauded 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
establish 
a 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
to 
analyse 
the 
challenges 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
face 
up 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond. 
The 
CommissionÂs 
work 
and 
conclusions 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
good 
point 
of 
departure 
for 
Member 
States 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
dialogue 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Agency 
continued 
meeting 
its 
objectives 
with 
the 
same 
effectiveness 
and 
impartiality. 
9. 
Ecuador 
had 
shown 
its 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation 
through 
the 
principles 
and 
values 
enshrined 
in 
its 
foreign 
policy. 
It 
belonged 
to 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
densely 
populated 
NWFZ 
and 
rejected 
any 
non-peaceful 
nuclear 
programme 
by 
any 
State. 
Furthermore, 
Ecuador 
complied 
faithfully 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
relevant 
international 
agreements. 
10. 
States 
must 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
control 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
technologies, 
given 
the 
potential 
consequences 
of 
their 
accidental 
or 
malicious 
use. 
Ecuador 
welcomed 
the 
steps 
that 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
create 
a 
legal 
framework 
in 
that 
regard. 
Its 
national 
regulatory 
authority 
had 
helped 
to 
strengthen 
the 
national 
security 
regime 
for 
radioactive 
material 
during 
transport 
and 
temporary 
and 
final 
storage. 
Ecuador 
supported 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
international 
regime 
for 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
including 
the 
principle 
of 
responsibility 
for 
damage 
to 
human 
health, 
the 
environment 
and 
economic 
losses 
that 
could 
occur 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
accident 
or 
incident. 
It 
was 
also 
very 
important 
to 
establish 
prior, 
transparent 
and 
clear 
communication 
among 
States 
on 
the 
movement 
of 
such 
material, 
especially 
by 
sea. 
Dialogue 
between 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
States 
should 
continue, 
as 
it 
was 
of 
mutual 
benefit. 
11. 
Ecuador 
recognized 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
competent 
authority 
to 
verify 
and 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
agreements, 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
technology 
and 
material 
for 
non-peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
should 
be 
applied 
universally, 
without 
exception, 
including 
by 
those 
countries 
outside 
the 
regime. 
Adherence 
to 
the 
NPT 
should 
not 
be 
considered 
merely 
as 
an 
option, 
but 
as 
a 
priority 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
guarantee 
global 
and 
regional 
security. 
There 
was 
also 
a 
need 
to 
create 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
Ecuador 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
adopt 
the 
measures 
required 
to 
facilitate 
the 
suggested 
approach 
and 
promote 
the 
forum 
recommended 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2000, 
about 
which 
a 
consensus 
was 
gradually 
forming. 
12. 
Ecuador 
had 
maintained 
a 
principled 
position 
on 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
It 
firmly 
believed 
in 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
Parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination, 
provided 
that 
they 
complied 
in 
a 
full 
and 
transparent 
manner 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
regime. 
Diplomatic 
dialogue 
was 
very 
important 
for 
finding 
an 
agreed 
solution 
to 
any 
type 
of 
international 
conflict. 
Ecuador 
rejected 
the 
adoption 
of 
unilateral 
measures 
of 
force 
outside 
the 
multilateral 
United 
Nations 
system 
and 
international 
law.

13. 
Given 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services, 
and 
related 
proliferation 
risks, 
all 
options 
for 
assuring 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
had 
to 
be 
examined 
in 
detail. 
Ecuador 
was 
willing 
to 
support 
the 
most 
viable 
initiatives 
that 
were 
proliferation 
resistant 
and 
also 
allowed 
countries 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
14. 
His 
countryÂs 
new 
Constitution 
that 
had 
recently 
been 
approved 
included 
a 
vision 
for 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
renewable 
energy. 
Lasting 
safety 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
without 
sustainable 
human 
development. 
Cooperation 
for 
development 
had 
made 
a 
major 
contribution 
in 
Ecuador, 
and 
his 
country 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
increase 
its 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
strengthen 
its 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation. 
Ecuador 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
in 
implementing 
national 
projects, 
which 
had 
led 
to 
sustainable 
social 
development. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
projects 
in 
the 
2009Â2011 
cycle 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
industry 
would 
receive 
similar 
support. 
Ecuador 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
ARCAL 
and 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
made 
to 
strengthen 
it. 
His 
country 
had 
made 
major 
efforts 
to 
keep 
up 
to 
date 
with 
its 
financial 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF, 
and 
was 
aiming 
to 
end 
the 
year 
without 
any 
balance 
outstanding. 
15. 
The 
national 
competent 
authority 
in 
Ecuador 
been 
merged 
with 
the 
Ministry 
for 
Electricity 
and 
Renewable 
Energy. 
The 
aim 
was 
to 
develop 
an 
energy 
mix 
that 
relied 
less 
on 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
used 
cleaner 
energy, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
nuclear 
option. 
16. 
Ms 
KAUPPI 
(Finland) 
said 
that 
the 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
Her 
country 
strongly 
supported 
achieving 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
associated 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
Nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
was 
a 
serious 
concern 
to 
her 
Government, 
and 
the 
NPT 
could 
only 
fulfil 
its 
role 
if 
there 
was 
confidence 
that 
all 
States 
were 
complying 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
Treaty. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
to 
take 
appropriate 
measures 
in 
the 
event 
of 
non-compliance, 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
integrity 
and 
authority 
of 
the 
system. 
Finland 
was 
dedicated 
to 
ensuring 
the 
success 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
It 
would 
also 
continue 
to 
promote 
the 
strengthening 
of 
export 
controls, 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
and 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
17. 
Well-functioning 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
were 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
public 
confidence 
in 
and 
acceptance 
of 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
longer 
term. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
continue 
its 
highly 
professional 
and 
impartial 
work 
in 
safeguards 
implementation, 
and 
had 
sufficient 
resources 
for 
future 
verification 
activities. 
Finland 
strongly 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system, 
and 
further 
reinforcement 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capability 
and 
legal 
authority 
to 
assure 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
The 
safeguards 
framework 
and 
mechanisms 
were 
well 
developed 
and 
had 
to 
be 
implemented 
effectively 
throughout 
the 
world. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols, 
which 
together 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
constituted 
the 
current 
verification 
standard, 
should 
be 
brought 
into 
force 
and 
implemented 
in 
all 
Member 
States 
without 
delay. 
The 
efficiency 
of 
safeguards 
could 
also 
be 
enhanced 
by 
more 
information-driven 
verification 
activities, 
use 
of 
state-of-the-art 
technologies, 
high-
calibre 
staff 
and 
outsourcing. 
18. 
Integrated 
safeguards 
brought 
benefits 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
State 
concerned. 
Following 
successful 
negotiations 
between 
Finland, 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission, 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
her 
country 
would 
commence 
in 
October 
2008. 
Finland 
was 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage 
in 
developing 
an 
underground 
final 
disposal 
facility 
for 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel, 
and 
much 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
developing 
an 
integrated 
safeguards 
approach 
for 
the 
repository. 
19. 
The 
growing 
interest 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
led 
to 
increasing 
challenges 
for 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
its 
areas 
of 
activity. 
The 
first 
report 
on 
the 
international 
status 
and 
prospects 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
presented 
in 
response 
to 
General 
Conference 
resolutions, 
had 
been 
of 
great 
interest 
to 
Finland, 
which 

GC(52)/OR.6

was 
currently 
building 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
unit 
and 
considering 
further 
nuclear 
power 
capacity. 
Her 
country 
had 
over 
30 
years 
of 
experience 
concerning 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
operation, 
and 
a 
very 
good 
safety 
and 
performance 
record. 
A 
fifth 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
unit 
was 
under 
construction, 
and 
three 
companies 
were 
interested 
in 
building 
additional 
capacity. 
In 
Finland, 
the 
most 
important 
step 
concerning 
new 
projects 
was 
the 
Âdecision-in-principleÂ: 
a 
decision 
made 
by 
the 
Government 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
ratified 
by 
the 
Parliament. 
One 
application 
for 
a 
decision-in-principle 
had 
been 
filed 
and 
two 
more 
applications 
were 
expected 
over 
the 
coming 
months. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
expected 
to 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
in 
FinlandÂs 
energy 
mix 
far 
into 
the 
future, 
with 
the 
national 
energy 
strategy 
based 
on 
the 
strong 
promotion 
of 
renewable 
energy, 
intensified 
energy 
efficiency 
and 
increased 
self-sufficiency. 
Once 
the 
new 
1600 
MW 
reactor 
was 
in 
operation, 
nuclear 
power 
was 
expected 
to 
meet 
over 
35% 
of 
national 
electricity 
demand. 


20. 
Public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was, 
to 
a 
great 
extent, 
related 
to 
nuclear 
safety, 
so 
it 
was 
very 
important 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide. 
The 
Agency 
would 
play 
an 
increasingly 
important 
role 
in 
such 
efforts 
as 
more 
countries 
developed 
their 
nuclear 
power 
capabilities, 
and 
Finland 
strongly 
supported 
the 
continuation 
and 
further 
development 
of 
Agency 
activities 
in 
that 
area. 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
to 
strengthen 
and 
coordinate 
their 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
that 
countries 
embarking 
on 
nuclear 
power 
programmes 
developed 
sound 
safety 
infrastructures, 
including 
effective 
and 
independent 
regulatory 
authorities. 
Finland 
had 
shared 
with 
interested 
countries 
its 
experiences 
in 
that 
area. 
Responsibility 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
lay 
solely 
with 
the 
national 
authorities 
and 
the 
operators: 
the 
Agency 
could 
only 
give 
advice 
and 
support, 
and 
develop 
robust 
international 
standards. 
21. 
Finland 
sincerely 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
developing 
modern 
safety 
standards, 
and 
had 
actively 
contributed 
to 
those 
efforts. 
Her 
country 
was 
party 
to 
all 
international 
safety 
conventions 
and 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
relevant 
review 
meetings. 
It 
called 
upon 
all 
countries 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
safety 
conventions 
and 
apply 
the 
resulting 
obligations 
in 
full. 
22. 
FinlandÂs 
good 
safety 
record 
had 
contributed 
to 
better 
public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
making 
it 
possible 
to 
expand 
nuclear 
power 
production. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
that 
a 
good 
safety 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
was 
key 
for 
a 
successful 
and 
safe 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
If 
all 
stakeholders 
were 
aware 
of 
the 
regulatory 
control 
and 
related 
requirements 
and 
activities 
from 
the 
outset, 
and 
if 
the 
system 
was 
well 
organized, 
there 
should 
not 
be 
any 
significant 
economic 
risk 
or 
delay 
in 
the 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
23. 
A 
clearly 
defined 
waste 
management 
policy 
and 
strategy, 
that 
was 
declared 
openly 
by 
the 
government 
and 
included 
solid 
funding 
arrangements 
defined 
in 
the 
nuclear 
legislation, 
were 
essential 
to 
facilitate 
progress 
in 
the 
area 
of 
waste 
management. 
The 
geological 
repository 
for 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
in 
Finland 
was 
under 
development, 
and 
was 
now 
over 
3000 
m 
long 
and 
300 
m 
deep. 
The 
repository 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
operational 
by 
2020 
and 
safeguards 
implementation 
should 
be 
in 
order 
before 
licensing 
began 
in 
2012. 
Since 
the 
1990s, 
any 
nuclear 
waste 
generated 
during 
power 
plant 
operation 
had 
been 
placed 
in 
waste 
disposal 
facilities 
underground 
at 
each 
plant 
site. 
24. 
With 
more 
countries 
planning 
to 
use 
nuclear 
power, 
it 
was 
necessary 
to 
create 
mechanisms 
that 
would 
allow 
access 
to 
nuclear 
power, 
while 
reducing 
the 
need 
to 
construct 
proliferation-sensitive 
facilities 
and 
minimizing 
the 
risk 
of 
dissemination 
of 
sensitive 
technologies. 
Finland 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
active 
and 
crucial 
role 
in 
developing 
multilateral 
nuclear 
approaches. 
Such 
approaches 
should 
not 
only 
cover 
fuel 
supply, 
but 
also 
the 
back 
end 
of 
the 
fuel 
cycle. 
25. 
Finland 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
achieved 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
and 
noted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
role 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Finland 
had 
provided 
support 
in 
kind 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
would 
be 
making 
another 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
NSF.

26. 
Lastly, 
Finland 
welcomed 
the 
Report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency, 
which 
gave 
a 
comprehensive 
view 
of 
the 
challenges 
and 
tasks 
facing 
the 
Agency 
now 
and 
in 
the 
future. 
27. 
Mr 
HAMER 
(Netherlands) 
said 
that 
his 
governmentÂs 
policy 
on 
non-proliferation 
continued 
to 
be 
based 
on 
the 
international 
system 
of 
treaties 
and 
agreements, 
and 
observed 
that 
it 
was 
important 
to 
be 
aware 
of 
new 
emerging 
security 
and 
proliferation 
risks. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
prepared 
to 
use 
new 
techniques 
and 
assist 
in 
developing 
new 
instruments 
to 
be 
used 
in 
specific 
instances 
to 
counter 
new 
risks, 
which 
could 
only 
be 
dealt 
with 
by 
the 
international 
community 
working 
together 
through 
multilateral 
cooperation; 
such 
a 
strategy 
called 
for 
a 
legal 
approach 
as 
well 
as 
a 
practical 
one. 
The 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative, 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
and 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
were 
all 
examples 
of 
new 
instruments 
supported 
by 
the 
Netherlands. 
His 
country 
considered 
that 
a 
customized 
approach, 
based 
on 
individual 
cases 
and 
developments 
and 
using 
a 
mix 
of 
both 
old 
and 
new 
instruments, 
was 
necessary 
to 
contain 
proliferation 
risks. 
28. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
international 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
global 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
The 
Netherlands 
favoured 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
system 
and 
advocated 
its 
universal 
adoption 
and 
implementation. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
constituted 
the 
verification 
standard, 
and 
his 
country 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
conclude 
such 
agreements. 
However, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
safeguards 
was 
not 
enough. 
In 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspection 
regime, 
a 
strong 
policy 
against 
non-
compliance 
was 
required. 
29. 
The 
NSF 
was 
pivotal 
to 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
proliferation 
and 
improving 
nuclear 
security, 
yet 
the 
NSF 
was 
dependent 
on 
voluntary 
contributions 
for 
90% 
of 
its 
funding. 
Since 
nuclear 
security 
was 
indispensable 
to 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
core 
activities, 
the 
Netherlands 
believed 
that 
the 
NSF 
should 
be 
funded 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
Pending 
a 
decision 
to 
that 
effect, 
his 
country 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
generously 
and 
unconditionally 
to 
the 
NSF. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
that 
conditionality 
could 
seriously 
hamper 
the 
implementation 
of 
programmes 
and 
projects. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
donated 
generously 
and 
without 
conditions 
for 
several 
years, 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
consider 
similar 
contributions 
in 
the 
future. 
His 
country 
also 
looked 
forward 
to 
discussions 
on 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
2010Â2013. 
30. 
The 
Netherlands 
supported 
the 
existing 
mechanisms 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
had 
joined 
the 
related 
conventions 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct. 
Learning 
from 
the 
collective 
knowledge 
and 
insight 
of 
experts 
from 
so 
many 
countries 
was 
an 
enriching 
experience 
that 
contributed 
to 
broader 
political 
backing 
for 
nuclear 
safety. 
31. 
The 
results 
of 
a 
recent 
IPPAS 
mission 
to 
four 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
Netherlands 
were 
anticipated. 
An 
OSART 
mission 
had 
inspected 
the 
Borssele 
Nuclear 
Plant 
in 
2005, 
and 
in 
June 
2007 
a 
follow-up 
mission 
concluded 
that 
all 
the 
recommendations 
and 
suggestions 
had 
been 
implemented. 
32. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
had 
already 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2009. 
It 
hoped 
that 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
would 
pledge 
their 
share 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
optimistic 
about 
the 
AgencyÂs 
progress 
in 
streamlining 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
it 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
that 
would 
contribute 
towards 
achieving 
the 
MDGs. 
It 
was 
pleased 
that 
a 
consensus 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
the 
target 
figures 
for 
the 
TCF 
for 
the 
coming 
years. 
33. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
been 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
AIPS 
since 
the 
Agency 
had 
first 
tabled 
the 
proposal 
in 
2007. 
Full 
implementation 
of 
AIPS 
would 
not 
only 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
meet 
the 
IPSAS 
requirements 
by 
2010, 
the 
deadline 
for 
all 
UN 
organizations, 
but 
would 
also 
result 
in 
significant 
efficiency 
gains 
for 
the 
Agency 
and 
cost 
savings 
for 
Member 
States. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
therefore 

GC(52)/OR.6

happy 
to 
increase 
its 
pledge 
for 
the 
financing 
of 
the 
first 
plateau 
of 
AIPS 
to 
145 
000 
euros. 
Subsequent 
plateaux 
should 
be 
financed 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 


34. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
been 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
discussions 
on 
nuclear 
fuel 
assurances 
and 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
six 
countries 
to 
have 
jointly 
submitted 
the 
first 
proposal 
for 
a 
fuel 
assurance 
arrangement. 
In 
2008, 
together 
with 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
Germany, 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
organized 
a 
seminar 
on 
the 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
regarding 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
His 
country 
remained 
committed 
to 
continuing 
an 
open 
and 
constructive 
dialogue 
on 
the 
issue 
between 
all 
interested 
States 
Â 
both 
suppliers 
and 
consumers. 
35. 
The 
Netherlands 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
reflect 
upon 
the 
long-term 
future 
of 
the 
Agency. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
discussions, 
which 
should 
be 
taken 
up 
by 
Member 
States 
within 
the 
relevant 
decision-making 
bodies. 
Members 
States 
would 
decide 
on 
the 
instruments, 
role 
and 
tasks 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
have 
in 
order 
to 
perform 
its 
statutory 
mandate. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
also 
prepared 
to 
discuss 
potential 
budgetary 
implications 
of 
those 
choices. 
If 
Member 
States 
were 
to 
decide 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
charged 
with 
additional 
tasks 
without 
relinquishing 
any 
of 
its 
current 
responsibilities, 
it 
would 
only 
be 
realistic 
to 
expect 
additional 
financial 
consequences. 
36. 
Over 
the 
next 
three 
years 
his 
country 
would 
invest 
seven 
billion 
euros 
to 
make 
its 
energy 
system 
more 
sustainable. 
It 
would 
increase 
international 
cooperation 
in 
that 
area 
and 
would 
adapt 
the 
legislative 
framework 
so 
that 
energy 
markets 
and 
the 
investment 
climate 
would 
improve. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
the 
European 
hub 
for 
imports, 
processing 
and 
exports 
of 
oil 
and 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
play 
a 
similar 
role 
for 
natural 
gas, 
biomass 
and 
carbon 
dioxide. 
Energy 
savings 
and 
sustainability 
would 
remain 
the 
cornerstones 
of 
the 
NetherlandsÂ 
energy 
policy. 
In 
2020, 
20% 
of 
the 
energy 
generated 
should 
be 
sustainable 
and 
2% 
should 
be 
saved 
annually 
on 
energy 
consumption. 
His 
countryÂs 
government 
was 
focusing 
on 
wind 
and 
biomass 
energy 
and 
preparing 
for 
a 
large-scale 
roll-
out 
of 
solar 
panels. 
Together 
with 
the 
private 
sector, 
his 
Government 
would 
take 
steps 
to 
harness 
the 
potential 
of 
the 
North 
Sea 
as 
a 
source 
for 
sustainable 
energy. 
The 
development 
of 
carbon 
dioxide 
capture 
and 
storage 
was 
being 
strongly 
stimulated. 
Three 
nuclear 
energy 
scenarios 
were 
being 
developed 
which 
could 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
future 
government 
decision-making. 
37. 
Ms 
MACMILLAN 
(New 
Zealand) 
said 
that 
creating 
a 
world 
safe 
from 
nuclear 
weapons 
had 
to 
remain 
one 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
most 
pressing 
goals. 
Preventing 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
under 
the 
NPT 
was 
a 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and 
New 
Zealand 
offered 
its 
continued 
support 
in 
achieving 
that 
objective. 
Her 
country 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
second 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
Efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
work 
cohesively 
towards 
agreement 
on 
concrete 
measures 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Treaty 
across 
the 
full 
range 
of 
nuclear 
issues, 
to 
ensure 
that 
its 
relevance 
and 
credibility 
was 
reaffirmed 
at 
the 
2010 
Review 
Conference. 
38. 
The 
Agency 
had 
to 
have 
all 
of 
the 
tools 
necessary 
to 
provide 
robust 
assurances 
to 
the 
international 
community 
that 
nuclear 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
States 
were 
purely 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Current 
proliferation 
challenges 
meant 
that 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
alone 
no 
longer 
gave 
the 
Agency 
enough 
authority 
to 
carry 
out 
fully 
its 
verification 
mandate 
under 
the 
NPT. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
was 
the 
key 
tool 
in 
that 
regard, 
and 
New 
Zealand 
strongly 
supported 
efforts 
to 
make 
it 
a 
condition 
in 
new 
supply 
arrangements 
with 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
Her 
country 
urged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so, 
particularly 
those 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
activities, 
to 
conclude 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
an 
additional 
protocol 
without 
delay. 
It 
supported 
the 
decision 
to 
modify 
the 
SQP 
in 
order 
to 
address 
a 
weakness 
identified 
in 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
offer 
of 
assistance 
to 
small 
States 
to 
assist 
in 
implementation 
of 
that 
decision.

39. 
The 
possibility 
of 
terrorists 
obtaining 
nuclear 
or 
other 
radioactive 
material 
remained 
a 
grave 
threat, 
and 
uncertainty 
in 
funding 
made 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
planning 
and 
prioritization 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security 
difficult. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
intending 
to 
make 
a 
contribution 
of 
50 
000 
New 
Zealand 
dollars 
to 
the 
NSF, 
and 
had 
increased 
the 
level 
of 
its 
contribution 
for 
2008 
to 
reflect 
its 
participation 
in 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
was 
well 
placed 
to 
implement 
some 
of 
the 
key 
principles 
of 
the 
Initiative, 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorists. 
40. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
principles 
and 
objectives 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
The 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
considerable 
significance 
to 
her 
country. 
Given 
that 
such 
shipments 
sometimes 
passed 
the 
shores 
of 
New 
Zealand 
and 
small 
island 
States 
in 
the 
South 
Pacific, 
her 
country 
considered 
that: 
they 
should 
take 
place 
against 
a 
backdrop 
of 
the 
highest 
possible 
safety 
and 
security 
standards; 
it 
should 
receive 
appropriate 
information 
in 
advance 
of 
any 
such 
transports; 
proper 
emergency 
response 
systems 
should 
be 
in 
operation, 
and 
that 
an 
effective 
liability 
and 
compensation 
mechanism 
should 
be 
in 
place 
so 
that 
any 
innocent 
victim 
was 
assured 
of 
support 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
incident. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
pleased 
that 
progress 
was 
being 
made 
in 
many 
areas 
but 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
continue 
to 
strive 
for 
improvements 
where 
possible. 
41. 
Her 
country 
appreciated 
the 
valuable 
role 
that 
INLEX 
had 
played 
in 
examining 
and 
clarifying 
the 
application 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
liability 
regime, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
outreach 
workshops 
being 
held 
to 
explain 
the 
nature 
and 
content 
of 
the 
international 
regime. 
It 
was 
important 
for 
INLEX 
to 
examine 
possible 
gaps 
in 
the 
regime 
and 
ways 
in 
which 
they 
might 
be 
addressed. 
New 
Zealand 
welcomed 
the 
continued 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
states, 
in 
particular 
on 
the 
exchange 
of 
information 
regarding 
shipments, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
further 
progress 
with 
a 
view 
to 
working 
towards 
an 
understanding 
on 
future 
practice 
which 
met 
the 
concerns 
of 
both 
sides. 
42. 
New 
Zealand 
supported 
ongoing 
international 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
DPRK. 
However, 
the 
steps 
being 
taken 
by 
the 
DPRK 
to 
restore 
its 
nuclear 
capability 
would 
seriously 
undermine 
the 
good 
faith 
and 
confidence 
that 
had 
been 
built 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
DPRK 
needed 
to 
comply 
fully 
with 
its 
international 
obligations 
resulting 
from 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
including 
an 
early 
return 
to 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
the 
NPT. 
43. 
New 
Zealand 
shared 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
international 
community 
about 
the 
outstanding 
questions 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
Security 
Council 
and 
Agency 
resolutions. 
Iran 
should 
comply 
with 
the 
resolutions, 
particularly 
through 
the 
suspension 
of 
its 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
activities, 
implementation 
of 
its 
additional 
protocol 
and 
reconsideration 
of 
its 
decision 
to 
suspend 
implementation 
of 
Code 
3.1 
of 
the 
Subsidiary 
Arrangements. 
Iran 
needed 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
timely 
and 
transparent 
manner 
to 
provide 
information 
on 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
identified 
in 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
regarding 
possible 
military 
dimensions 
to 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
New 
Zealand 
strongly 
supported 
a 
diplomatic 
solution 
based 
on 
IranÂs 
compliance 
with 
the 
relevant 
resolutions. 
44. 
As 
a 
strong 
proponent 
of 
the 
NPT, 
New 
Zealand 
supported 
the 
principle 
that 
all 
States 
should 
have 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
particularly 
the 
many 
civilian 
applications 
unrelated 
to 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
that 
could 
enhance 
the 
lives 
of 
millions 
of 
people 
worldwide. 
New 
Zealand 
had 
rejected 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
itself, 
not 
considering 
it 
to 
be 
compatible 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
sustainable 
development 
given 
the 
long-term 
financial 
and 
ecological 
costs, 
particularly 
those 
associated 
with 
the 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste. 
There 
were 
also 
proliferation 
risks 
associated 
with 
nuclear 
power 
generation. 
Any 
responsible 
discussion 
about 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option 
should 
be 
balanced 
and 
include 
consideration 
of 
the 
serious 
risks 
and 
costs 
as 
well 
as 
any 
potential 
benefits. 
The 

GC(52)/OR.6

international 
community 
had 
to 
direct 
more 
attention 
and 
resources 
to 
other 
safe, 
renewable 
energies. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
not 
convinced 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
place 
increased 
focus 
on 
the 
provision 
of 
nuclear 
power 
expertise 
and 
resources 
when 
there 
were 
many 
other, 
more 
sustainable, 
energy 
sources 
that 
could 
be 
developed. 


45. 
The 
international 
community 
needed 
to 
work 
together 
to 
tackle 
challenges 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
that 
regard, 
working 
with 
Member 
States 
to 
safeguard 
and 
secure 
nuclear 
material 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes. 
46. 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
the 
modern 
world 
perpetuated 
the 
inequities 
inherent 
in 
the 
contemporary 
system 
of 
international 
economic 
relations. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
problems 
faced 
by 
developing 
countries 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
electricity 
generation, 
food 
production, 
health 
improvement, 
and 
protecting 
the 
environment 
required 
ever 
more 
international 
cooperation 
in 
their 
resolution. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
had 
an 
essential 
role 
to 
play 
in 
enabling 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
be 
used 
in 
promoting 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Those 
activities 
should 
be 
strengthened 
and 
receive 
the 
required 
resources 
in 
a 
predictable 
and 
unconditional 
fashion, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
priority 
they 
deserved 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
47. 
Cuba 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
PACT, 
which 
was 
a 
programme 
that 
demonstrated 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
areas 
of 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
public, 
and 
needed 
to 
be 
provided 
with 
all 
the 
resources 
necessary 
for 
effective 
implementation. 
48. 
In 
Cuba, 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
important 
areas 
such 
as 
public 
health, 
agriculture, 
food, 
hydrology 
and 
environmental 
protection 
were 
greatly 
appreciated. 
Cuba 
stressed 
its 
firm 
commitment 
to 
promoting 
technical 
cooperation, 
which 
it 
had 
demonstrated 
in 
2007 
by 
meeting 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time, 
and 
by 
implementing 
its 
national 
projects 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
over 
90% 
and 
contributing 
30 
international 
experts 
and 
11 
professors. 
The 
importance 
it 
accorded 
to 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries 
was 
also 
reflected 
in 
its 
participation 
in 
coordinated 
research 
programmes 
and 
ARCAL. 
49. 
Cuba 
was 
both 
a 
recipient 
of 
and 
a 
contributor 
to 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation. 
Its 
capacity 
to 
participate 
in 
those 
activities 
was, 
however, 
affected 
by 
the 
illegal 
economic 
blockade 
that 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
had 
imposed 
upon 
the 
country 
for 
almost 
50 
years, 
in 
flagrant 
violation 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
multilateralism 
and 
international 
law, 
and 
which 
had, 
according 
to 
conservative 
calculations, 
caused 
Cuba 
losses 
of 
more 
than 
$93 
thousand 
million 
as 
of 
December 
2007. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
that 
criminal 
policy, 
Cuba 
continued 
to 
face 
difficulties 
in 
acquiring 
important 
equipment, 
and 
its 
specialists 
had 
difficulties 
in 
obtaining 
visas 
in 
order 
to 
take 
part 
in 
Agency 
technical 
meetings 
held 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
She 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
its 
professionalism 
and 
dedication 
in 
finding 
alternative 
ways 
of 
ensuring 
the 
implementation 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
with 
Cuba. 
50. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
in 
a 
balanced 
manner, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
principles 
of 
international 
law, 
including 
those 
set 
out 
in 
the 
Charter 
of 
the 
United 
Nations. 
Cuba 
rejected 
all 
efforts 
to 
give 
the 
other 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
priority 
over 
technical 
cooperation, 
which 
should 
be 
given 
all 
the 
support 
required, 
in 
particular 
by 
providing 
assured 
and 
predictable 
resources. 
51. 
Cuba 
opposed 
efforts 
to 
impose 
on 
particular 
States 
safeguards 
obligations 
which 
went 
beyond 
their 
legal 
commitments. 
Voluntary 
measures 
could 
in 
no 
way 
be 
turned 
into 
obligations 
for 
Member 
States. 
52. 
Cuba 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
initiate 
a 
study 
on 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond, 
which 
would 
provide 
important 
input 
for 
consideration. 
She 
expressed 
concern 
that

many 
of 
the 
matters 
addressed 
went 
beyond 
the 
remit 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
that 
some 
of 
the 
recommendations 
made 
were 
very 
general. 
The 
vision 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
should 
be 
developed 
through 
a 
broad 
process 
of 
analysis, 
in 
which 
all 
Member 
States 
should 
actively 
participate. 


53. 
Her 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
radiation 
safety, 
and 
was 
continuing 
to 
develop 
appropriate 
infrastructure 
and 
train 
its 
staff. 
It 
also 
participated 
in 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Radiological 
and 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agencies, 
and 
the 
ConvEx-3 
large-scale 
nuclear 
exercise. 
54. 
Cuba 
was 
proud 
of 
its 
results 
in 
the 
field 
of 
non-proliferation. 
Scarcely 
four 
years 
after 
having 
signed 
the 
NPT, 
Cuba 
was 
among 
the 
small 
group 
of 
47 
countries 
in 
which 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
detected 
no 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
declared 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
no 
sign 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activities. 
55. 
Cuba 
rejected 
the 
link 
that 
some 
were 
seeking 
to 
establish 
between 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
non-proliferation. 
Such 
approaches 
could 
not 
be 
used 
to 
introduce 
new 
discriminatory 
measures 
against 
developing 
countries, 
in 
breach 
of 
their 
inalienable 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
56. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
activities 
had 
to 
be 
conducted 
in 
an 
impartial 
and 
unbiased 
manner. 
Cuba 
rejected 
attempts 
to 
put 
pressure 
on 
or 
interfere 
in 
those 
verification 
efforts, 
which 
put 
their 
efficiency 
and 
credibility 
at 
risk. 
Verification 
should 
remain 
a 
technical 
matter, 
and 
should 
not 
be 
manipulated 
for 
geopolitical 
purposes. 
57. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
authority 
competent 
to 
verify 
fulfilment 
by 
Member 
States 
of 
their 
obligations 
under 
safeguards 
agreements. 
Cuba 
recognized 
and 
firmly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
professional 
and 
technical 
work 
in 
that 
respect, 
and 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
without 
external 
interference. 
58. 
The 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
could 
only 
be 
resolved 
through 
unconditional 
dialogue, 
based 
on 
equality 
and 
mutual 
respect. 
Decisions 
violating 
its 
inalienable 
rights 
could 
not 
be 
imposed 
on 
Iran, 
and 
efforts 
to 
do 
so 
should 
cease. 
59. 
There 
was 
an 
inextricable 
link 
between 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
There 
was 
a 
lack 
of 
political 
will 
among 
some 
of 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
to 
make 
progress 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
and 
Cuba 
deplored 
their 
double 
standards. 
60. 
Cuba 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
called 
upon 
Israel 
to 
sign 
the 
NPT, 
submit 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
to 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
implement 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
should 
stop 
transferring 
nuclear 
equipment, 
information, 
material, 
facilities, 
resources 
and 
devices 
to 
Israel, 
and 
providing 
it 
with 
assistance 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
Such 
action 
would 
make 
the 
most 
effective 
contribution 
possible 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
61. 
The 
policies 
of 
certain 
States 
had 
led 
to 
economic, 
food 
and 
energy 
crises 
and 
contributed 
to 
the 
continuing 
deterioration 
of 
the 
environment. 
Human 
civilization 
and 
all 
that 
had 
been 
created 
over 
thousands 
of 
year 
were 
in 
danger 
of 
disappearing 
owing 
to 
the 
irresponsible 
actions 
of 
those 
who 
used 
their 
economic 
and 
military 
power 
to 
attempt 
to 
impose 
their 
policies 
in 
flagrant 
violation 
of 
international 
law. 
The 
opportunity 
to 
change 
that 
situation 
should 
not 
be 
missed. 
62. 
Mr 
ERTAY 
(Turkey) 
said 
that 
securing 
his 
countryÂs 
energy 
supply 
involved 
using 
domestic 
resources 
to 
the 
extent 
possible 
and 
diversifying 
imports. 
Given 
its 
positive 
safety 
record 
and 
cost-
effectiveness, 
nuclear 
power 
would 
become 
a 
major 
component 
of 
TurkeyÂs 
energy 
mix 
in 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term. 
There 
were 
plans 
to 
add 
4000Â5000 
MW(e) 
nuclear 
capacity 
before 
2020 
to 
meet 
an 
annual 
increase 
in 
electricity 
demand 
of 
7.9%. 
The 
first 
stage 
of 
tender 
for 
a 
nuclear 
power

plant 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
an 
evaluation 
was 
in 
progress. 
The 
country 
was 
also 
updating 
its 
nuclear 
legislation 
to 
incorporate 
the 
latest 
safety 
standards 
issued 
by 
the 
Agency. 
A 
draft 
nuclear 
law, 
the 
contents 
of 
which 
had 
been 
discussed 
with 
the 
Agency, 
had 
been 
submitted 
for 
approval. 


63. 
The 
NPT 
had 
been 
serving 
collective 
security 
interests 
for 
four 
decades, 
but 
was 
facing 
challenges 
that 
were 
difficult 
to 
overcome. 
The 
non-proliferation 
regime 
rested 
on 
three 
pillars 
Â 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
non-proliferation 
and 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
Â 
which 
required 
equal 
attention 
from 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
weapon 
States 
alike. 
Non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
were 
mutually 
reinforcing, 
and 
Turkey 
would 
continue 
to 
promote 
key 
issues 
for 
the 
sustainability 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
the 
long 
term 
including 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
further 
reduction 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
Such 
steps, 
together 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
should 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
universal 
verification 
standard. 
64. 
Nuclear 
terrorism 
had 
emerged 
as 
a 
new 
challenge 
to 
be 
considered 
seriously 
in 
non-
proliferation 
efforts. 
All 
possible 
steps 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
prevent 
terrorists 
from 
gaining 
access 
to 
nuclear 
material 
and 
other 
WMD 
components, 
and 
new 
measures 
should 
be 
devised 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trade 
in 
sensitive 
nuclear 
equipment 
and 
technology. 
In 
that 
context, 
Turkey 
called 
for 
adherence 
to 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
CPPNM. 
65. 
Turkey 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
alleviating, 
through 
peaceful 
means 
and 
as 
early 
as 
possible, 
the 
ongoing 
crisis 
of 
confidence 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff 
were 
to 
be 
commended 
for 
their 
tireless 
and 
impartial 
efforts 
to 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
issues. 
Turkey 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
continue 
its 
verification 
of 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
in 
Iran, 
and 
that 
Iran 
had 
provided 
the 
Agency 
with 
the 
required 
accounting 
reports 
in 
connection 
with 
its 
declared 
nuclear 
activities. 
However, 
it 
was 
concerning 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
still 
not 
able 
to 
verify 
the 
full 
scope 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Turkey 
encouraged 
Iran 
to 
comply 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1835 
(2008) 
in 
implementing 
all 
measures 
required 
to 
build 
confidence 
in 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date. 
66. 
The 
complete, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
remained 
a 
regional 
and 
global 
priority, 
and 
the 
actions 
agreed 
on 
13 
February 
2007 
were 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
achieving 
that 
goal. 
It 
was 
concerning 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
decided 
to 
suspend 
disabling 
activities 
at 
the 
5 
MW(e) 
reactor 
and 
had 
asked 
the 
Agency 
to 
remove 
the 
seals 
and 
surveillance 
equipment 
at 
its 
reprocessing 
plant. 
Turkey 
hoped 
that 
conditions 
could 
be 
created 
for 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
NPT 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date 
and 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
resume 
its 
activities 
under 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
67. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
ever-increasing 
role 
in 
maximizing 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
human 
welfare 
while 
minimizing 
the 
risks 
of 
proliferation. 
Turkey 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond, 
agreeing 
in 
principle 
that 
a 
strengthened 
Agency 
equipped 
with 
adequate 
authority 
and 
resources 
was 
essential 
in 
reinforcing 
global 
nuclear 
order 
to 
promote 
peace 
and 
prosperity. 
68. 
Several 
countries 
had 
expressed 
the 
intention 
of 
using 
nuclear 
power 
to 
meet 
their 
future 
energy 
needs. 
Measures 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
guard 
against 
a 
heightened 
risk 
of 
weapons 
proliferation, 
but 
States 
in 
full 
compliance 
with 
their 
safeguards 
obligations 
should 
enjoy 
unfettered 
access 
to 
civil 
nuclear 
technology, 
as 
enshrined 
in 
the 
NPT. 
Many 
proposals 
had 
been 
put 
forward 
concerning 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
fuel 
cycle. 
Any 
such 
arrangement 
should 
guarantee 
StatesÂ 
long-term 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
in 
a 
predictable, 
stable 
and 
cost 
effective 
manner. 
However, 
participation 
should 

GC(52)/OR.6 
1

11 


be 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis, 
should 
not 
require 
the 
relinquishment 
of 
any 
rights 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
should 
not 
hinder 
or 
replace 
well 
functioning 
market 
mechanisms. 


69. 
The 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
sources 
remained 
a 
priority 
for 
the 
international 
community. 
Turkey 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
continue 
strengthening 
its 
nuclear, 
radiation, 
transport 
and 
waste 
safety 
efforts, 
focusing 
particularly 
on 
mandatory 
activities 
and 
on 
regions 
where 
the 
need 
for 
improvement 
was 
greatest. 
His 
country 
had 
welcomed 
the 
results 
of 
the 
fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
The 
high 
number 
of 
participants 
and 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
national 
reports 
presented 
had 
been 
a 
clear 
indication 
of 
the 
special 
importance 
attached 
to 
achieving 
and 
maintaining 
an 
increased 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide. 
70. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
facilitating 
implementation 
of 
effective 
programmes 
to 
further 
improve 
the 
scientific 
and 
technological 
capabilities 
of 
Member 
States. 
Turkey 
strongly 
supported 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
as 
demonstrated 
by 
its 
consistent, 
timely 
and 
full 
payment 
of 
its 
TCF 
contributions. 
Strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
would 
substantially 
increase 
quality 
of 
life 
throughout 
the 
world, 
but 
particularly 
in 
developing 
countries. 
The 
Turkish 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
bear 
the 
full 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
national 
projects 
in 
the 
next 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle. 
71. 
Mr 
SHANNON 
(Australia), 
welcoming 
the 
new 
Member 
States, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
worked 
closely 
with 
the 
authorities 
of 
Papua 
New 
Guinea 
to 
upgrade 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
to 
assist 
in 
establishing 
a 
new 
radiotherapy 
unit. 
The 
Government 
of 
Australia 
was 
committed 
to 
taking 
a 
more 
active 
role 
in 
multilateral 
affairs 
and 
would 
work 
to 
advance 
and 
strengthen 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
architecture. 
It 
had, 
together 
in 
Japan, 
established 
the 
International 
Commission 
on 
Nuclear 
Non-proliferation 
and 
Disarmament, 
which 
had 
a 
two-year 
mandate 
to 
reinvigorate 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
beyond. 
72. 
Strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
critical 
to 
reinvigorating 
global 
non-
proliferation 
efforts, 
diplomacy 
should 
be 
used 
to 
bring 
all 
States 
into 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
inspections. 
States 
should 
support 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
in 
order 
to 
address 
contemporary 
challenges 
and 
ensure 
that 
Agency 
inspectors 
had 
the 
necessary 
authority 
to 
carry 
out 
inspections. 
Australia 
had 
worked 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard, 
including 
through 
the 
Australian 
safeguards 
support 
programme 
and 
its 
continued 
membership 
of 
SAGSI. 
Australia 
strongly 
urged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
the 
additional 
protocol 
as 
part 
of 
the 
contemporary 
safeguards 
standard 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
the 
confidence 
of 
all 
States 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
activities. 
Australia 
also 
firmly 
supported 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
existing 
authority 
to 
inspect 
for 
indicators 
of 
weaponization. 
73. 
A 
robust 
international 
response 
was 
needed 
to 
violations 
of 
safeguards 
commitments. 
In 
some 
cases, 
information 
and 
access 
beyond 
that 
required 
by 
a 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
might 
be 
required. 
Regrettably, 
Iran 
continued 
to 
expand 
its 
enrichment-related 
activities 
in 
defiance 
of 
legally 
binding 
Security 
Council 
requirements, 
despite 
growing 
evidence 
of 
military 
dimensions 
to 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
continued 
to

He 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
implement 
the

Arrangements 
without

in 
the 
light 
of 
IranÂs 
long 
history 
of 
undeclared 
activities. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Australia 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
adoption 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1835 
(2008), 
and 
urged 
Iran 
to 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
Libya 
which, 
in 
late 
2003, 
had 
disclosed 
its 
undeclared 
activities 
and 
embarked 
on 
a 
policy 
of 
full 
transparency.

The 
Agency 
had 
a 
vital 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula, 
and 
the 
DPRKÂs 
return 
to 
complete 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement. 
Australia 
was 
disappointed 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
yet 
to 
agree 
on 
a 
mechanism 
for 
verifying 
denuclearization 
and 
was 
concerned 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
suspended 
the 
disablement 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
The 
steps 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
taken 
towards 
restoring 
the 
facilities 
Â 
including 
its 
decision 
to 
deny 
access 
to 
Agency 
inspectors 
and 
its 
stated 
intention 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
material 
there 
Â 
were 
very 
worrying. 
Australia 
called 
upon 
the 
DPRK 
to 
reverse 
those 
decisions 
and 
work 
with 
its 
partners 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
to 
implement 
its 
commitments. 
The 
General 
Conference 
should 
join 
Australia 
in 
making 
such 
a 
call. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
concerned 
by 
credible 
information 
suggesting 
that 
the 
DPRK 
was 
assisting 
Syria 
in 
building 
an 
undeclared 
nuclear 
reactor. 
Under 
its 
safeguards 
agreement, 
Syria 
was 
obliged 
to 
report 
the 
planning 
and 
construction 
of 
any 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Australia 
therefore 
urged 
Syria 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
investigation 
of 
the 
information. 
75. 
Member 
States 
must 
hold 
each 
other 
to 
account 
for 
safeguards 
violations, 
as 
failure 
to 
do 
so 
would 
erode 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
the 
global 
security 
architecture 
that 
it 
supported. 
For 
similar 
reasons, 
it 
was 
inappropriate 
for 
States 
under 
investigation 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
76. 
The 
Government 
of 
Australia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
As 
a 
major 
uranium 
supplier, 
it 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
foster 
best-practice 
safety 
standards 
in 
uranium 
mining 
and 
had 
recently, 
in 
association 
with 
the 
Agency, 
hosted 
a 
roundtable 
meeting 
on 
the 
safety 
implications 
of 
the 
revival 
in 
the 
uranium 
mining 
industry. 
With 
specific 
regard 
to 
reactor 
safety, 
Australia 
had 
hosted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
International 
Conference 
on 
Research 
Reactors 
in 
Sydney 
in 
2007 
and 
would 
participate 
in 
the 
international 
meeting 
on 
application 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors 
in 
October 
2008. 
77. 
As 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
continuing 
development 
of 
Agency 
safety 
standards, 
Australia 
backed 
the 
recent 
roadmap 
for 
the 
future 
of 
those 
standards. 
It 
recognized 
the 
need 
for 
effective 
Agency 
facilitation 
of 
emergency 
response 
arrangements 
and, 
as 
such, 
had 
registered 
four 
response 
assistance 
network 
teams 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre. 
78. 
Australia 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
timely 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials 
that 
had 
an 
essential 
role 
in 
medical, 
scientific 
and 
industrial 
applications. 
It 
had 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
establishing 
the 
International 
Steering 
Committee 
on 
Denial 
of 
Shipment 
of 
Radioactive 
Material 
and 
welcomed 
recent 
regional 
workshops 
held 
on 
the 
issue. 
79. 
Australia 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
activities, 
including 
through 
contributions 
to 
the 
NSF. 
It 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
commit 
to 
voluntary 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
its 
supplementary 
guidance. 
Australia 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
a 
range 
of 
security 
documents. 
It 
had 
chaired 
the 
open-ended 
meeting 
of 
legal 
and 
technical 
experts 
on 
sharing 
lessons 
learned 
in 
implementing 
the 
guidance 
in 
May 
2008 
and 
commended 
that 
meetingÂs 
conclusions 
to 
interested 
Member 
States. 
80. 
Australia 
enjoyed 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
was 
proud 
of 
its 
record 
in 
supporting 
the 
right 
of 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
share 
those 
benefits. 
Although 
not 
a 
direct 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
Australia 
had 
been 
the 
twelfth 
biggest 
contributor 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
2007 
and 
contributed 
significant 
extrabudgetary 
funding 
to 
the 
RCA. 
However, 
AustraliaÂs 
contribution 
was 
not 
just 
financial: 
the 
Australian 
Nuclear 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Organisation 
had 
been 
designated 
as 
a 
collaborating 
centre 
for 
neutron 
scattering 
applications, 
and 
its 
OPAL 
research 
reactor, 
which 
had 
now 
returned 
to 
full 
operating 
power, 
was

again 
producing 
neutron 
beams 
for 
cutting-edge 
research. 
Following 
regulatory 
approval, 
OPAL 
would 
provide 
irradiated 
targets 
for 
a 
new 
enlarged 
molybolenum-99 
facility 
for 
production 
of 
lifesaving 
radiopharmaceuticals. 


81. 
His 
Government 
would 
consider 
carefully 
the 
thoughtful 
recommendations 
in 
the 
report 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
and 
would 
work 
towards 
ensuring 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
the 
resources 
it 
needed 
to 
undertake 
effectively 
its 
statutory 
responsibilities. 
82. 
Mr 
MYRTIL 
(Haiti), 
having 
welcomed 
the 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency, 
said 
that 
Haiti 
hoped 
that 
other 
States, 
such 
as 
members 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
Community, 
would 
join 
the 
Agency, 
so 
that 
their 
populations 
could 
also 
enjoy 
the 
advantages 
offered 
by 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
His 
Government 
recommended 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
send 
missions 
to 
the 
Caribbean 
region 
to 
raise 
awareness 
among 
the 
regionÂs 
Governments. 
In 
July 
2008, 
a 
high-ranking 
Agency 
official 
had 
participated 
in 
an 
intersessional 
meeting 
of 
the 
Association 
of 
Caribbean 
States, 
during 
which 
options 
for 
cooperation 
with 
the 
wider 
Caribbean 
had 
been 
discussed. 
83. 
The 
Government 
of 
Haiti 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
water, 
energy, 
agriculture 
and 
the 
environment 
might 
be 
integrated 
with 
that 
of 
other 
United 
Nations 
bodies, 
for 
example 
through 
UNDAF 
in 
Haiti. 
He 
hoped 
that 
a 
technical 
mission 
could 
shortly 
be 
sent 
to 
Haiti 
to 
discuss 
with 
UNDP 
the 
feasibility 
of 
such 
a 
project. 
84. 
His 
Government 
had 
requested 
once 
again 
that 
an 
imPACT 
mission 
be 
sent 
to 
Haiti 
to 
perform 
a 
systematic 
evaluation 
of 
HaitiÂs 
needs 
in 
terms 
of 
cancer 
treatment. 
The 
project 
to 
build 
a 
radiotherapy 
centre, 
which 
had 
been 
somewhat 
delayed, 
was 
now 
progressing 
well, 
and 
a 
call 
for 
tender 
to 
build 
the 
centre 
had 
been 
launched. 
National 
projects 
were 
also 
being 
implemented 
in 
areas 
including 
agriculture, 
water 
management 
and 
nutrition, 
and 
it 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
during 
the 
2009Â 
2011 
cycle, 
HaitiÂs 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
would 
intensify 
at 
every 
level. 
85. 
For 
almost 
five 
years, 
Haiti 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
ARCAL 
and 
had 
received 
vital 
assistance 
in 
diverse 
and 
strategic 
areas. 
ARCAL 
was 
at 
a 
turning 
point 
and 
its 
institutional 
strengthening 
was 
increasingly 
under 
discussion. 
Haiti 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
ARCAL 
Representatives, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
the 
new 
ARCAL 
executive 
board. 
86. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
to 
provide 
for 
technical 
assistance 
in 
order 
to 
rehabilitate 
bi-national 
projects 
between 
Haiti 
and 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
in 
particular 
concerning 
the 
management 
of 
shared 
aquifers 
and 
environmental 
management 
using 
isotopic 
and 
nuclear 
techniques. 
87. 
Since 
2007, 
Haiti 
had 
repeatedly 
stressed 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
pay 
particular 
attention 
to 
LDCs, 
a 
group 
that 
included 
Haiti. 
Those 
countries 
had 
been 
severely 
affected 
by 
the 
food 
crisis 
and 
needed 
Agency 
help 
to 
improve 
agriculture 
so 
as 
to 
meet 
populationsÂ 
food 
needs. 
As 
LDCs 
had 
different 
problems 
to 
those 
faced 
by 
developing 
or 
developed 
countries, 
Haiti 
requested 
that 
the 
Agency 
set 
up 
an 
LDC 
unit 
within 
the 
Secretariat. 
Haiti 
also 
intended 
to 
submit 
a 
draft 
resolution 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
making 
the 
LDC 
issue 
a 
permanent 
agenda 
item. 
88. 
Haiti 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency. 
It 
had 
particularly 
noted 
the 
CommissionÂs 
emphasis 
on 
the 
need 
to 
develop 
a 
number 
of 
partnerships 
to 
strengthen 
the 
world 
nuclear 
order, 
for 
example 
between 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
and 
non-nuclear-
weapon 
States; 
suppliers 
of 
fuel 
cycle 
services, 
and 
States 
wishing 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Haiti 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
partnership 
between 
developed 
countries, 
developing 
countries, 
international 
development 
agencies 
and 
the 
Agency, 
and 
called 
upon 
the 
Agency 
to 
make 
the 
necessary 
contacts 
with 
the 
Association 
of 
Caribbean 
States 
and 
other 
regional 
organizations 
such 
as 
the 
Caribbean 
Community 
or 
the 
OAS. 
The 
Agency 
should 
increase 
its 
efforts 
to 
raise 
awareness 

GC(52)/OR.6

among 
other 
international 
organizations 
of 
the 
great 
benefits 
to 
be 
gained 
from 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
which 
could 
assist 
in 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
MDGs. 


89. 
The 
Board 
of 
Governors 
must 
consider 
the 
increasing 
budgetary 
and 
financial 
problems 
facing 
the 
Agency. 
Haiti 
would, 
despite 
the 
many 
difficulties 
it 
faced, 
do 
all 
it 
could 
to 
make 
its 
modest 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
financial 
and 
budgetary 
efforts. 
90. 
Haiti 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
efforts 
to 
combat 
all 
forms 
of 
terrorism, 
including 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism, 
and 
his 
Government 
supported 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Haiti 
would 
take 
all 
steps 
necessary 
to 
comply 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
Lastly, 
Haiti 
encouraged 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Treaty, 
since 
that 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
achieve 
a 
reinforced 
global 
nuclear 
order. 
Mr 
Soltanieh 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


91. 
Mr 
JOHANSEN 
(Norway) 
said 
that 
the 
report 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
provided 
a 
sound 
basis 
for 
discussions 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Norway 
shared 
the 
CommissionÂs 
view 
that, 
given 
the 
prospect 
of 
increased 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
worldwide, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
non-
proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security 
would 
become 
increasingly 
important. 
The 
Agency 
must 
be 
fully 
equipped 
to 
perform 
its 
main 
tasks; 
it 
should 
focus 
on 
its 
comparative 
advantages 
and 
pursue 
new 
partnerships 
with 
actors 
and 
stakeholders. 
92. 
Safeguards 
were 
fundamental 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
Agency 
must 
have 
the 
necessary 
access, 
information 
and 
resources 
to 
safeguard 
Member 
StatesÂ 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes, 
and 
the 
tools 
required 
for 
evaluating 
evidence 
and 
information 
at 
the 
Safeguards 
Analytical 
Laboratory 
and 
cooperating 
laboratories. 
Member 
States 
could 
facilitate 
the 
AgencyÂs 
task 
by 
applying 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Norway 
urged 
those 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
also 
appealed 
to 
Iran 
to 
fully 
implement 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
any 
other 
transparency 
measures 
deemed 
necessary 
by 
the 
Agency, 
as 
called 
for 
in 
resolution 
1835 
(2008) 
adopted 
unanimously 
the 
previous 
week 
by 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council. 
Norway 
expected 
all 
countries 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
Agency 
investigation. 
93. 
As 
stated 
in 
the 
CommissionÂs 
report, 
the 
Agency 
must 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
efforts 
to 
identify 
credible 
and 
legitimate 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
Market 
mechanisms 
would 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
meet 
demands 
for 
civilian 
nuclear 
fuel; 
nevertheless, 
various 
types 
of 
international 
cooperation 
efforts 
should 
be 
devised 
to 
alleviate 
any 
concerns 
regarding 
long-term 
predictability. 
As 
a 
first 
step, 
Norway 
was 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
fuel 
bank 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
auspices. 
It 
acknowledged 
the 
generous 
contributions 
made 
in 
that 
connection 
by 
some 
Member 
States, 
and 
encouraged 
others 
to 
provide 
further 
political 
and 
financial 
support. 
94. 
The 
expected 
increase 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
pose 
new 
challenges 
for 
the 
safety 
of 
citizens, 
workers 
and 
the 
environment. 
Countries 
must 
be 
ready 
to 
prevent, 
mitigate 
and 
respond 
to 
any 
danger 
that 
might 
arise 
and 
alert 
other 
countries. 
Norway 
had 
long 
advocated 
better 
international 
coordination 
of 
response 
measures, 
and 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
developing 
and 
implementing 
safety 
principles 
and 
norms. 
It 
had 
therefore 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
ensuring 
sufficient 
and 
predictable 
financial 
resources 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
that 
area. 
95. 
Norway 
advocated 
the 
universalization 
of 
all 
relevant 
conventions 
and 
guidelines 
for 
preventing 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
and 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
in 
implementing 
those 
instruments. 
Norway 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
readiness 
to 
work 
with 
other 
organizations 
and 
initiatives 
in 
that 
field 
in 
the 
kind 
of 
partnership 
called 
for 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons. 
His 
country 
had 
decided 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
World 
Institute 
for

Nuclear 
Security 
because 
it 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
industry 
awareness 
and 
involvement, 
and 
the 
need 
for 
all 
interested 
parties 
to 
have 
the 
opportunity 
for 
participation. 


96. 
Promoting 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology 
was 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
The 
Agency 
must 
take 
its 
share 
of 
the 
responsibility 
for 
meeting 
the 
MDGs, 
and 
close 
partnership 
with 
other 
United 
Nations 
agencies 
was 
of 
vital 
importance. 
97. 
Every 
nation 
should 
have 
the 
sovereign 
right 
to 
choose 
its 
own 
energy 
mix, 
but 
not 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
common 
security 
or 
safety. 
The 
Agency 
should 
be 
ready 
to 
assist 
in 
the 
overall 
assessment 
of 
the 
options 
of 
Member 
States 
that 
requested 
assistance 
in 
energy 
planning: 
nuclear 
energy 
might 
not 
necessarily 
be 
the 
appropriate 
option. 
98. 
Norway 
noted 
the 
CommissionÂs 
concern 
that 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
disarmament 
could 
undermine 
the 
AgencyÂs 
non-proliferation 
mission. 
However, 
any 
perceived 
lack 
of 
progress 
must 
not 
be 
used 
as 
an 
excuse 
not 
to 
seek 
universal 
adherence 
to 
improved 
safeguards. 
A 
credible 
non-proliferation 
regime 
would 
clearly 
enhance 
collective 
security 
and 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
achieving 
a 
world 
free 
from 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Norway 
was 
concerned 
that 
the 
CTBT 
had 
not 
entered 
into 
force 
and 
that 
negotiations 
on 
the 
FMCT 
had 
not 
even 
begun. 
Norway 
had 
called 
on 
the 
States 
concerned 
to 
accelerate 
disarmament 
in 
a 
transparent, 
irreversible 
and 
verifiable 
manner. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
advocate 
multilateral 
instruments 
designed 
to 
prevent 
any 
new 
nuclear 
arms 
race. 
99. 
Verification 
was 
at 
the 
heart 
of 
safeguards 
and 
of 
any 
successful 
disarmament 
process. 
Norway 
supported 
the 
CommissionÂs 
recommendation 
to 
involve 
Agency 
experts 
in 
consultations 
on 
a 
FMCT 
verification 
regime 
and 
on 
safeguards 
of 
fissile 
materials 
no 
longer 
required 
for 
military 
purposes. 
Once 
the 
DPRK 
process 
was 
back 
on 
track, 
the 
Agency 
should 
monitor 
the 
dismantlement 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
former 
nuclear 
programme. 
100. 
Mr 
COGAN 
(Ireland) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission 
remained 
as 
important 
as 
it 
had 
been 
when 
the 
Agency 
was 
first 
established 
51 
years 
previously. 
A 
key 
debate 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
begun 
with 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
Report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
which 
sought 
to 
examine 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
2020 
and 
beyond. 
101. 
A 
cornerstone 
of 
Irish 
foreign 
policy 
had 
always 
been 
its 
commitment 
to 
effective 
multilateralism 
as 
the 
best 
way 
of 
upholding 
the 
rule 
of 
law 
and 
ensuring 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
and 
agreements 
offered 
the 
best 
guarantee 
of 
continued 
peace 
and 
security. 
Ireland 
was 
committed 
to 
maintaining 
the 
integrity 
and 
inviolability 
of 
such 
instruments, 
and 
to 
supporting 
the 
institutions 
that 
oversaw 
their 
implementation. 
Ireland 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
NPT, 
which 
had 
been 
born 
out 
of 
an 
Irish 
resolution 
at 
the 
United 
Nations. 
It 
formed 
the 
essence 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
was 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
With 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
Review 
Conference 
to 
achieve 
any 
meaningful 
outcome, 
decisions 
taken 
at 
previous 
conferences 
being 
called 
into 
question 
and 
ongoing 
controversy 
regarding 
the 
compliance 
of 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Treaty, 
the 
NPT 
was 
under 
great 
pressure. 
102. 
Ireland 
had 
reluctantly 
joined 
consensus 
on 
the 
decision 
of 
the 
NSG 
to 
exempt 
India 
from 
the 
requirement 
of 
full-scope 
safeguards 
as 
a 
condition 
of 
supply, 
which 
had 
been 
a 
key 
provision 
of 
NSG 
Guidelines 
since 
1992, 
and 
of 
the 
NPT 
since 
1995. 
That 
step 
was 
predicated 
on 
IndiaÂs 
key 
positions 
on 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
which 
included 
a 
unilateral 
moratorium 
on 
nuclear 
testing 
and 
strong 
safeguards 
against 
nuclear 
proliferation 
in 
third 
countries. 
103. 
Safeguards 
and 
verification 
were 
more 
crucial 
than 
ever, 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
being 
the 
only 
acceptable 
verification 
standard. 
Ireland 
called 
on 
States 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
adopt 
such 
measures 
to 
do 
so 
without 
delay, 
as 
they 
were 
necessary 
to 
ensure 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
full 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
purposes 
of 
nuclear 
programmes.

104. 
Ireland 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
with 
the 
DPRK 
in 
February 
2007, 
through 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
to 
freeze 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme, 
and 
the 
subsequent 
decisions 
and 
actions 
taken 
by 
the 
DPRK 
regarding 
the 
dismantlement 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
reactor 
and 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Very 
significant 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
since 
then 
by 
the 
DPRK. 
However, 
Ireland 
regretted 
the 
DPRKÂs 
recently 
stated 
intention 
to 
cease 
and 
reverse 
its 
denuclearization 
activities. 
It 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
and 
those 
involved 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
to 
work 
together 
to 
resolve 
the 
impasse 
and 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
get 
the 
denuclearization 
programme 
and 
all 
reciprocal 
arrangements 
back 
on 
track, 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
regional 
and 
international 
security. 
105. 
Ireland 
deeply 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
professional 
and 
impartial 
work 
in 
trying 
to 
resolve 
the 
long 
outstanding 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
nature 
and 
history 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Ireland 
supported 
efforts 
to 
find 
a 
negotiated 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue, 
and 
remained 
very 
concerned 
about 
IranÂs 
intentions 
with 
respect 
to 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
needed 
to 
comply 
fully 
with 
its 
obligations 
stemming 
from 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
1696 
(2006), 
1737 
(2006), 
1747 
(2007), 
1803 
(2008) 
and 
1835 
(2008) 
and 
Board 
resolutions. 
It 
should 
suspend 
all 
its 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities 
and 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
an 
open 
and 
transparent 
manner. 
106. 
Although 
Ireland 
acknowledged 
the 
sovereign 
right 
of 
each 
country 
to 
decide 
on 
its 
energy 
mix, 
it 
did 
not 
agree 
with 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
Its 
policy 
was 
shaped 
by 
the 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
associated 
activities 
posed 
an 
unacceptable 
threat 
to 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
Use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
entailed 
many 
serious 
problems 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
been 
resolved, 
such 
as 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
the 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
reprocessing 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel, 
contamination 
of 
the 
marine 
and 
terrestrial 
environment, 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
accidents 
and 
proliferation. 
The 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
seemed 
to 
be 
based 
on 
a 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
help 
to 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
global 
warming, 
but 
Ireland 
did 
not 
share 
that 
view. 
The 
perceived 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
were 
outweighed 
by 
the 
serious 
risks 
involved. 
The 
ongoing 
nuclear 
energy 
debate 
sought 
to 
downplay 
environmental, 
waste, 
proliferation, 
nuclear 
liability 
and 
safety 
issues. 
Ireland 
welcomed 
and 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
those 
important 
areas, 
and 
hoped 
for 
a 
real 
debate 
that 
could 
properly 
address 
all 
issues 
and 
concerns. 
Although 
Ireland 
had 
chosen 
not 
to 
exercise 
its 
right 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power, 
it 
benefited 
considerably 
from 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency. 
107. 
The 
Agency 
provided 
the 
necessary 
framework 
for 
cooperative 
efforts 
to 
build 
and 
strengthen 
the 
international 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regime, 
including 
advisory 
international 
standards, 
codes, 
guides, 
binding 
international 
conventions, 
international 
peer 
reviews 
and 
an 
international 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
system. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
vital 
role 
in 
implementing 
such 
standards 
was 
often 
complemented 
by 
bilateral 
agreements 
between 
States. 
108. 
Ireland 
greatly 
valued 
and 
supported 
the 
pioneering 
work 
and 
high 
quality 
research 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
agriculture 
and 
food, 
human 
health 
and 
other 
applications 
of 
non-power 
nuclear 
technology. 
Technical 
cooperation 
activities 
were 
particularly 
important 
in 
upgrading 
safety 
in 
beneficiary 
States: 
Ireland 
had 
paid 
in 
full 
its 
share 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2006, 
2007 
and 
2008 
and 
agreed 
with 
the 
target 
for 
the 
subsequent 
three 
years. 
109. 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(46)/RES/9.D, 
adopted 
in 
2002, 
concerning 
the 
Early 
Notification 
and 
Assistance 
Conventions 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
international 
efforts 
to 
develop 
a 
coherent 
and 
sustainable 
joint 
programme 
for 
a 
more 
efficient 
response 
to 
nuclear 
emergencies. 
A 
meeting 
of 
competent 
authorities 
convened 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
2003 
had 
agreed 
to 
establish 
a 
National 
Competent 
AuthoritiesÂ 
Co-ordinating 
Group 
to 
develop 
an 
international 
action 
plan 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
emergency 
response 
system. 
Ireland 
had 
contributed 
US 
$30 
000, 
and 
encouraged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
a 
contribution.

Coastal 
States 
such 
as 
Ireland 
considered 
that 
they 
should 
be 
fully 
informed 
when 
shipments 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
passed 
near 
their 
coasts, 
given 
the 
risks 
of 
such 
shipments. 
They 
could 
then 
assess 
the 
risks 
and 
take 
appropriate 
emergency 
response 
measures. 
Ireland 
was 
seeking 
to 
strengthen 
the 
ongoing 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States 
with 
a 
view 
to 
improving 
communication 
between 
the 
governments 
concerned. 
111. 
There 
were 
substantial 
safety 
and 
environmental 
concerns 
associated 
with 
reprocessing. 
Safety 
aspirations 
were 
not 
always 
met, 
and 
discharges 
from 
reprocessing 
operations 
into 
shared 
marine 
environments 
were 
neither 
acceptable 
nor 
sustainable. 
Moreover, 
the 
cost 
of 
reprocessing 
spent 
fuel 
was 
significantly 
higher 
than 
the 
cost 
of 
direct 
disposal. 
While 
States 
had 
the 
sovereign 
right 
to 
choose 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
engage 
in 
reprocessing 
activities, 
certain 
practical 
concerns 
should 
first 
be 
addressed. 
IrelandÂs 
concerns 
were 
not 
founded 
on 
abstract 
ideological 
policy 
but 
were 
informed 
by 
its 
negative 
perception 
of 
the 
reprocessing 
experiences 
of 
its 
neighbouring 
States. 
112. 
Ireland 
supported 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
and 
called 
upon 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
NSF, 
to 
which 
it 
had 
made 
voluntary 
contributions 
of 
approximately 
Â239 
000. 
It 
might 
be 
appropriate 
to 
consider 
how 
some 
of 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
could 
be 
absorbed 
into 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
programme. 
113. 
Ms 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada) 
welcomed 
the 
report 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
and 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
background 
report, 
and 
supported 
their 
general 
assessment 
of 
global 
trends 
and 
events 
likely 
to 
affect 
the 
Agency. 
Canada 
strongly 
supported 
the 
view 
that 
the 
Agency 
must 
remain 
focused 
on 
its 
core 
mandates, 
along 
with 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
applications. 
Nevertheless, 
in 
examining 
the 
proposals 
of 
the 
Commission, 
care 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Agency 
did 
not 
go 
beyond 
its 
mandate 
and 
take 
on 
tasks 
that 
would 
be 
better 
addressed 
in 
other 
fora. 
Overall, 
the 
reports 
offered 
an 
opportunity 
to 
engage 
in 
new 
and 
innovative 
thinking, 
with 
a 
focus 
on 
areas 
where 
the 
Agency 
could 
add 
value 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner. 
To 
help 
future 
work, 
Canada 
was 
pleased 
to 
contribute 
its 
share 
of 
the 
2006 
cash 
surplus, 
Â242 
000, 
in 
support 
of 
AIPS. 
114. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
legally 
binding 
safeguards 
commitments 
was 
as 
unique 
as 
it 
was 
essential. 
The 
safeguards 
system 
had 
been 
strengthened 
so 
that 
the 
Agency 
could 
draw 
broader 
safeguards 
conclusions, 
leading 
to 
increased 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
StatesÂ 
nuclear 
programmes. 
As 
noted 
in 
the 
report 
by 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
Member 
States 
must 
strive 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system 
within 
the 
AgencyÂs 
existing 
authorities, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
safeguards 
culture 
more 
broadly. 
Canada 
called 
on 
all 
States 
which 
had 
not 
joined 
the 
NPT 
to 
do 
so 
and 
on 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
accept 
the 
enhanced 
verification 
standard 
by 
entering 
into 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
115. 
Canada 
applauded 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
resolve 
outstanding 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
still 
had 
considerable 
work 
to 
do 
to 
achieve 
compliance 
with 
its 
obligations 
and 
resolve 
serious 
concerns 
arising 
from 
nuclear 
activities 
with 
possible 
military 
dimensions. 
Canada 
noted 
with 
grave 
concern 
from 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
latest 
report 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
suspended 
enrichment-related 
activities 
or 
addressed 
outstanding 
issues 
potentially 
related 
to 
weaponization. 
It 
also 
deeply 
regretted 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
extended 
the 
cooperation 
required 
to 
begin 
to 
build 
confidence 
in 
claims 
that 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
was 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Canada 
urged 
Iran 
to 
comply 
with 
relevant 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
by 
offering 
full 
and 
unfettered 
cooperation 
to 
the 
Agency, 
and 
suspending 
all 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities 
and 
work 
on 
the 
Arak 
research 
reactor. 
116. 
Canada 
remained 
deeply 
concerned 
about 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities, 
including 
the 
nuclear 
explosive 
test 
conducted 
in 
October 
2006. 
Canada 
supported 
a 
peaceful 
solution 
to 
the 
issue 
through

the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
welcomed 
the 
shutdown 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
at 
Yongbyon 
and 
the 
return 
of 
Agency 
personnel 
to 
the 
DPRK. 
Canada 
also 
welcomed 
steps 
towards 
implementing 
the 
October 
2007 
agreement, 
including 
provision 
of 
a 
declaration 
of 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
work 
on 
the 
disablement 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
facility. 
It 
was 
increasingly 
concerned 
by 
the 
recent 
halt 
and 
reversal 
of 
the 
disablement 
process, 
and 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
resume 
and 
complete 
its 
disablement 
work 
in 
line 
with 
six-party 
commitments, 
and 
recommit 
itself 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards. 


117. 
Canada 
was 
also 
concerned 
by 
revelations 
pointing 
to 
undeclared 
facilities 
and 
activities 
in 
Syria 
and 
possible 
nuclear 
collaboration 
between 
Syria 
and 
the 
DPRK. 
It 
fully 
supported 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
to 
investigate 
the 
situation 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
findings. 
It 
encouraged 
Syria 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
resolve 
the 
matter. 
118. 
Canada 
welcomed 
the 
new 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
India 
and 
the 
Agency, 
implementation 
of 
which 
would 
ensure 
an 
impermeable 
separation 
between 
civilian 
and 
strategic 
nuclear 
programmes. 
Broader 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
India 
would 
be 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
international 
civil 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
greater 
integration 
of 
nuclear 
into 
the 
energy 
supply 
mix. 
Increased 
generation 
would 
help 
to 
meet 
the 
rapidly 
increasing 
energy 
needs 
of 
the 
Indian 
population 
and 
fuel 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
Canada 
looked 
forward 
to 
greater 
collaboration 
with 
India 
in 
the 
nuclear 
sphere 
in 
future. 
119. 
Canada 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
the 
majority 
of 
States 
with 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
also 
had 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
force. 
A 
total 
of 
47 
States 
had 
attained 
the 
broad 
safeguards 
conclusion 
that 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
State-level 
integrated 
safeguards 
approaches, 
and 
Canada 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
expedite 
the 
transition 
to 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
those 
countries. 
A 
State-level 
integrated 
safeguards 
approach 
was 
being 
implemented 
in 
Canada 
on 
a 
sector-by-sector 
basis, 
and 
she 
was 
hopeful 
that 
it 
would 
be 
fully 
implemented 
by 
mid-
2009. 
Cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
transparency, 
and 
a 
consistent 
record 
of 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
should 
be 
essential 
factors 
in 
determining 
the 
annual 
inspection 
effort 
to 
be 
undertaken 
in 
a 
State, 
particularly 
for 
those 
States 
with 
integrated 
safeguards. 
120. 
The 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
required 
a 
concerted 
international 
response. 
Canada 
had 
contributed 
8 
million 
Canadian 
dollars 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
G8 
Global 
Partnership 
against 
the 
Spread 
of 
Weapons 
and 
Materials 
of 
Mass 
Destruction, 
which 
made 
it 
the 
second 
largest 
donor 
State 
to 
the 
Fund. 
Canada 
continued 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
activities 
were 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
security 
and 
prevent, 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Encouraging 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
such 
efforts 
and 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
she 
said 
Canada 
would 
like 
to 
see 
more 
such 
activities 
funded 
by 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
121. 
An 
unprecedented 
growth 
in 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
in 
Canada 
was 
posing 
new 
challenges 
for 
the 
Canadian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Commission 
(CNSC). 
Environmental 
review 
and 
assessment 
committees 
had 
been 
established 
to 
examine 
the 
environmental 
impact 
of 
applications 
for 
new 
reactors. 
The 
Commission 
was 
also 
completing 
two 
regulatory 
guides 
on 
designing 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
assessing 
their 
location. 
Canada 
would 
be 
hosting 
an 
IRRS 
mission 
in 
May 
2009. 
122. 
Canada 
had 
appreciated 
the 
opportunity 
to 
examine 
the 
overall 
nuclear 
safety 
situation 
during 
the 
fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
The 
participation 
of 
all 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
in 
the 
review 
process 
would 
help 
to 
increase 
safety 
at 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
throughout 
the 
world. 
As 
a 
signatory 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
Canada 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
third 
Review 
Meeting 
in 
May 
2009 
as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
advance 
the 
ConventionÂs 
objectives.

123. 
The 
CNSC 
placed 
strict 
controls 
on 
the 
utilization, 
transport 
and 
export 
of 
sealed 
radioactive 
sources, 
in 
full 
compliance 
with 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
its 
guidance 
document. 
Canada 
was 
a 
world 
leader 
in 
the 
export 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
subject 
to 
the 
Code, 
and 
continued 
to 
promote 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
regime 
of 
regulatory 
controls 
on 
import 
and 
export 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
encouraging 
outcome 
of 
the 
open-ended 
meeting 
on 
lessons 
learned 
from 
implementing 
the 
supplementary 
guidance. 
124. 
Canada 
participated 
significantly 
at 
all 
levels 
of 
the 
Transport 
Regulations, 
which 
formed 
the 
basis 
for 
Canadian 
legislation 
on 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
Representatives 
of 
CanadaÂs 
nuclear 
industry 
and 
the 
CNSC 
were 
also 
serving 
on 
the 
International 
Steering 
Committee 
on 
Denials 
of 
Shipment 
of 
Radioactive 
Material. 
125. 
Nuclear 
energy 
formed 
an 
important 
part 
of 
CanadaÂs 
energy 
supply. 
The 
nuclear 
industry 
made 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
countryÂs 
economy 
and 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
environment. 
The 
generation 
of 
electricity 
using 
the 
CANDU 
reactors 
reduced 
air 
pollution 
and 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
Canada 
stood 
ready 
to 
use 
its 
expertise 
and 
technology 
to 
help 
in 
the 
safe 
and 
non-polluting 
use 
of 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
energy, 
both 
at 
home 
and 
abroad. 
126. 
Recently, 
three 
applications 
for 
new 
reactors 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
CNSC 
and 
progress 
was 
being 
made 
with 
reactor 
refurbishments. 
Canada 
had 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
offer 
the 
international 
community 
in 
that 
sphere 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
share 
its 
capabilities 
as 
a 
responsible 
nuclear 
supplier 
country. 
As 
regards 
national 
developments 
in 
the 
nuclear 
industry, 
Atomic 
Energy 
of 
Canada 
Limited 
(AECL) 
had 
been 
given 
an 
additional 
100 
000 
million 
dollars 
to 
develop 
a 
third-generation 
CANDU 
reactor. 
The 
AECL 
had 
also 
signed 
a 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
on 
the 
issue 
with 
the 
CNSC. 
As 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
increased, 
Canada 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
Agency 
support 
for 
PHWR 
technology. 
127. 
Canada 
valued 
INPRO, 
which 
had 
generated 
considerable 
international 
interest. 
The 
project 
focused 
on 
innovative 
nuclear 
power 
and 
brought 
together 
technology 
developers 
and 
users, 
as 
a 
complement 
to 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
128. 
Canada 
was 
interested 
in 
advanced-design, 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycles 
and 
believed 
that 
heavy 
water 
CANDU 
reactors 
could 
be 
used 
in 
that 
connection. 
It 
had 
also 
noted 
a 
renewed 
interest 
in 
proliferation-resistant 
thorium 
cycles, 
and 
believed 
that 
a 
heavy 
water 
reactor 
fuelled 
by 
thorium 
had 
many 
promising 
advantages. 
129. 
Canada 
remained 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
suppliers 
of 
medical 
isotopes; 
nevertheless, 
temporary 
shortage 
of 
isotopes 
in 
Canada 
and 
Europe 
over 
the 
last 
year 
had 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
better 
cooperation 
and 
coordination 
in 
the 
management 
of 
their 
production. 
130. 
Canada 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
continued 
to 
make 
significant 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF. 
It 
commended 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
improved 
prioritizing 
and 
at 
meeting 
more 
efficiently 
and 
effectively 
the 
needs 
of 
donors 
and 
recipients. 
She 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
131. 
Ms 
ÂIAKOVÃ 
(Slovakia) 
said 
that 
in 
accordance 
with 
her 
countryÂs 
energy 
strategy, 
nuclear 
power 
would 
remain 
an 
important 
energy 
source 
in 
the 
long 
term. 
Over 
50% 
of 
electricity 
in 
Slovakia 
was 
currently 
generated 
by 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
the 
shutdown 
of 
Unit 
2 
of 
the 
Bohunice 
V-1 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
that 
was 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year 
posed 
a 
challenge 
to 
the 
security 
of 
energy 
supply. 
The 
Government 
and 
the 
energy 
sector 
were 
endeavouring 
to 
find 
appropriate 
replacement 
energy 
sources 
to 
make 
up 
the 
shortfall 
in 
electricity 
production. 
The 
country's 
largest 
energy 
producer 
intended 
to 
complete 
two 
nuclear 
units 
at 
the 
Mochovce 
site, 
which 
would 
make 
a 
major 
contribution 
to 
energy 
security 
in 
the 
country. 
Moreover, 
the 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
had 
recently 
approved 
a 
proposal 
for 
modification 
at 
units 
3 
and 
4 
of 
the 
Mochovce 
nuclear 
power 
plant.

Consent 
would 
be 
granted 
subject 
to 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
several 
provisions, 
taking 
into 
account 
national 
legislation, 
the 
opinion 
of 
the 
European 
Commission, 
Agency 
recommendations 
and 
international 
best 
practices. 


132. 
In 
May, 
her 
Government 
had 
approved 
an 
initiative 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
unit 
at 
the 
Bohunice 
site. 
Details, 
including 
conditions 
for 
construction, 
timetables 
for 
preparatory 
work 
and 
construction, 
and 
financing 
options, 
would 
be 
discussed 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
133. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
waste 
management, 
her 
Government 
had 
approved 
a 
strategy 
for 
the 
back 
end 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
the 
main 
elements 
of 
which 
were 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel, 
the 
shut 
down 
and 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
and 
the 
closure 
of 
repositories. 
134. 
The 
European 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Forum, 
which 
created 
a 
platform 
for 
broad 
discussion 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
Europe, 
had 
held 
its 
first 
meeting 
in 
Bratislava 
in 
November 
2007. 
The 
third 
meeting 
would 
also 
be 
held 
in 
Bratislava 
October 
2008. 
135. 
Slovakia 
paid 
the 
closest 
attention 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
On 
the 
basis 
of 
operational 
performance, 
regulatory 
assessments 
and 
inspection 
results, 
the 
independent 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
considered 
the 
operation 
of 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
Slovakia 
to 
be 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
operated 
in 
accordance 
with 
national 
legislation. 
At 
the 
Fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
held 
in 
Vienna 
in 
April, 
Slovakia's 
national 
report 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
had 
been 
widely 
discussed, 
and 
its 
comprehensiveness 
and 
transparency 
commended 
by 
several 
contracting 
parties. 
Moreover, 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
Review 
Meeting 
had 
confirmed 
that 
the 
safety 
of 
her 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
installations 
as 
well 
as 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
were 
in 
line 
with 
international 
best 
practices. 
136. 
The 
security 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
was 
a 
national 
responsibility, 
and 
her 
Government 
was 
preparing 
a 
law 
on 
the 
protection 
of 
critical 
infrastructure, 
including 
the 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Moreover, 
Slovakia 
had 
ratified 
all 
13 
conventions 
regarding 
international 
terrorism, 
including 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
137. 
In 
the 
fifteen 
years 
since 
it 
had 
joined 
the 
Agency, 
Slovakia 
had 
collaborated 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
many 
national, 
regional 
and 
interregional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
had 
significantly 
contributed 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
Europe. 
European 
Member 
States 
had 
prepared 
the 
European 
regional 
profile 
for 
2009Â 
2013, 
which 
addressed 
four 
sectors, 
namely 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
nuclear 
energy, 
human 
health, 
and 
isotope 
and 
radiation 
technology 
applications. 
In 
May, 
29 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
region 
had 
met 
and 
agreed 
on 
a 
common 
position 
regarding 
their 
future 
expectations 
of 
technical 
cooperation. 
Technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
consider 
the 
needs 
of 
those 
countries 
with 
greater 
potential 
for 
development 
in 
the 
nuclear 
area, 
and 
financial 
resources 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
be 
adequate, 
assured 
and 
predictable. 
Member 
States 
from 
the 
region 
had 
emphasized 
the 
need 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
develop 
a 
strategy 
to 
respond 
properly 
to 
the 
recommendations 
made 
in 
the 
regional 
profile. 
Slovakia 
was 
ready 
to 
continue 
to 
provide 
experts 
and 
training 
facilities 
and 
host 
fellows 
and 
visiting 
scientists 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
committed 
to 
fulfilling 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency, 
including 
payment 
of 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target. 
Her 
Government 
had 
already 
approved 
SlovakiaÂs 
contribution 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
for 
2009. 
138. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
she 
said 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
marked 
by 
high 
professionalism, 
independence 
and 
accountability, 
which 
would 
encourage 
effectiveness 
and 
impartiality. 
Mr 
BjÃ¶rnsson 
(Iceland), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair.

Ms 
TOBING 
(Indonesia) 
said 
that 
Indonesia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
and 
commended 
those 
countries 
that 
had 
regularly 
paid 
their 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
Indonesia, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
consistently 
paid 
the 
amount 
it 
had 
pledged 
towards 
the 
TCF 
target, 
and 
had 
pledged 
US$ 
100 
000 
for 
the 
2009 
target. 
Much 
had 
to 
be 
done 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
increasing 
needs 
and 
requests 
of 
Member 
States 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
while 
ensuring 
that 
the 
resources 
available 
were 
sufficient, 
predictable 
and 
assured. 
The 
current 
funding 
system 
for 
technical 
cooperation, 
which 
relied 
on 
voluntary 
contributions, 
was 
neither 
fair 
nor 
capable 
of 
meeting 
the 
essential 
needs 
of 
Member 
States, 
particularly 
the 
developing 
countries. 
The 
Agency 
should 
seek 
to 
ensure 
a 
more 
balanced 
distribution 
of 
the 
budget 
to 
reflect 
the 
equal 
importance 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Agency. 
140. 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
establish 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons. 
Although 
the 
CommissionÂs 
report 
accurately 
projected 
the 
future 
role 
of 
the 
Agency, 
it 
did 
not 
adequately 
address 
many 
issues 
of 
concern 
to 
developing 
countries, 
particularly 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
141. 
Indonesia 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
enhancing 
the 
capabilities 
of 
Member 
States 
regarding 
sustainable 
food 
security 
and 
productivity 
through 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radiation-induced 
breeding 
of 
new 
plant 
varieties 
of 
rice 
and 
sorghum, 
and 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
two 
high-yielding, 
high-quality 
rice 
mutant 
varieties 
produced 
by 
irradiation 
techniques 
had 
been 
already 
been 
planted 
in 
Indonesia. 
142. 
Indonesia 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
the 
Nuclear 
Technology 
Review 
2008 
had 
highlighted 
the 
results 
of 
the 
Thirteenth 
Conference 
of 
the 
Parties 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Framework 
Convention 
on 
Climate 
Change 
held 
in 
Bali 
in 
December 
2007. 
Although 
nuclear 
power 
had 
not 
been 
a 
principal 
topic 
of 
discussion, 
the 
Conference 
had 
constituted 
a 
step 
forward 
in 
managing 
risks 
related 
to 
global 
climate 
change. 
143. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
members 
of 
INPRO, 
Indonesia 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
activities 
aimed 
at 
meeting 
global 
energy 
demand 
and 
promoting 
sustainable 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
INPRO 
programme 
by 
sending 
cost-free 
experts 
to 
work 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
documentation 
regarding 
common 
user 
considerations 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
developing 
countries. 
144. 
Indonesia 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
and 
encouraged 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
join 
the 
Network. 
It 
also 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
supporting 
regional 
nuclear 
safety 
activities 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Network. 
145. 
Her 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
but 
stressed 
that 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
security 
should 
not 
hamper 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities, 
the 
exchange 
of 
nuclear 
material 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
As 
an 
archipelagic 
State, 
Indonesia 
noted 
with 
concern 
the 
potential 
for 
accidents 
or 
incidents 
during 
transportation 
of 
spent 
fuel 
and 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste 
by 
sea. 
146. 
Indonesia 
looked 
forward 
to 
a 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
It 
hoped 
that 
all 
countries 
would 
renew 
their 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
and 
intensify 
efforts 
to 
realize 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
a 
balanced, 
comprehensive 
and 
non-
discriminatory 
manner. 
As 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
said, 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
the 
core 
of 
the 
NPT, 
had 
been 
on 
the 
back 
burner 
for 
far 
too 
long. 
It 
was 
therefore 
timely 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
be 
involved 
in 
verifying 
the 
nuclear 
disarmament 
efforts 
of 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States.

147. 
The 
creation 
of 
a 
multilateral 
fuel 
cycle 
arrangement, 
which 
would 
guarantee 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
was 
a 
complementary 
mechanism 
for 
strengthening 
the 
existing 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
It 
should 
not 
restrict 
the 
right 
of 
each 
State 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
technology. 
148. 
The 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
remained 
a 
source 
of 
deep 
concern 
for 
Indonesia. 
Progress 
would 
be 
achieved 
only 
if 
Israel 
placed 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Indonesia 
supported 
the 
proposal 
of 
the 
League 
of 
Arab 
States 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
an 
additional 
agenda 
item 
concerning 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
and 
the 
submission 
of 
a 
draft 
resolution 
in 
that 
regard. 
Referring 
to 
the 
Israeli 
attack 
against 
a 
Syrian 
facility 
in 
September 
2007, 
she 
said 
that 
the 
use 
of 
force 
was 
unacceptable 
and 
constituted 
a 
flagrant 
violation 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Charter 
and 
international 
law. 
149. 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
the 
continued 
cooperation 
between 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Agency 
concerning 
the 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
of 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facilities. 
However, 
it 
was 
concerned 
about 
the 
DPRKÂs 
intention 
to 
request 
Agency 
inspectors 
to 
remove 
seals 
and 
surveillance 
equipment 
at 
the 
reprocessing 
plant. 
Indonesia 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
DPRKÂs 
continued 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
encouraged 
all 
the 
parties 
involved 
to 
fulfil 
the 
commitments 
they 
had 
made 
during 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
150. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
Iran's 
nuclear 
programme 
remained 
peaceful. 
Sanctions 
alone 
would 
not 
lead 
to 
a 
sustainable 
solution 
to 
the 
issue, 
and 
Indonesia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
as 
part 
of 
the 
dual-track 
approach; 
an 
atmosphere 
conducive 
to 
negotiation 
must 
therefore 
be 
promoted. 
151. 
Efforts 
to 
bring 
India 
into 
the 
mainstream 
of 
a 
non-proliferation 
regime 
should 
be 
conducted 
in 
such 
as 
way 
as 
to 
reinforce 
global 
non-proliferation 
norms, 
rather 
than 
undermine 
them. 
The 
decision 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Suppliers 
Group 
to 
grant 
an 
unconditional 
waiver 
to 
the 
long-standing 
nuclear 
trade 
restrictions 
on 
India 
was 
regrettable, 
and 
was 
likely 
to 
do 
more 
harm 
than 
good 
to 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
since 
it 
would 
discourage 
others 
from 
abandoning 
their 
nuclear 
ambitions. 
152. 
Mr 
SANZ 
OLIVA 
(Spain) 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
joint 
statement 
made 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
President 
of 
the 
European 
Commission 
on 
7 
May 
2008, 
coinciding 
with 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
Euratom 
Treaty. 
153. 
His 
Government 
was 
committed 
to 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
as 
shown 
by 
its 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
main 
policies, 
to 
promote 
multilateral 
solutions 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
encourage 
the 
conclusion 
of 
safeguards 
agreements, 
additional 
protocols 
and 
SQPs 
in 
Latin 
America, 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
North 
Africa. 
154. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
impartial 
and 
professional 
efforts 
to 
clarify 
the 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
past 
and 
present 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
needed 
to 
consider 
the 
offer 
made 
by 
China, 
France, 
Germany, 
Russia, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
the 
United 
States 
and 
the 
EU 
High 
Representative 
to 
find 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
and 
avoid 
confrontation. 
The 
most 
effective 
step 
that 
the 
international 
community 
could 
and 
should 
adopt 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
threat 
posed 
to 
international 
security 
by 
nuclear 
proliferation 
was 
to 
ensure 
the 
prompt 
and 
universal 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
was 
therefore 
a 
matter 
of 
concern 
that, 
11 
years 
after 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol, 
104 
States 
had 
still 
not 
brought 
their 
respective 
additional 
protocols 
into 
force 
and 
29 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
still 
not 
brought 
their 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
into 
force. 
However, 
Spain 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
already 
applying 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
26 
States, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
extending 
them 
to 
all 
States 
with 
additional 
protocols 
and 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
force. 
It 
was 
hoped 
that 
integrated 
safeguards 
could 
be 
introduced 
in 
all 
EU 
countries 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2008. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
there 
was 
no 
discrimination 
among 
Member 
States 
and 
that 
the 
specific 
conditions 
of 
each 
countryÂs 
legal 
framework 
were 
taken 
into 
account. 
In 
those 
EU 
countries 
that 

GC(52)/OR.6 
1 
October 
2008, 
Page 
23 


requested 
it, 
specific 
procedures 
should 
be 
established 
according 
to 
the 
type 
of 
facility; 
the 
Subsidiary 
Arrangements 
and 
Facility 
Attachments 
for 
each 
facility 
should 
be 
revised 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
those 
procedures. 


155. 
SpainÂs 
willingness 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Safeguards 
was 
shown 
by 
the 
various 
projects 
implemented 
under 
the 
Spanish 
safeguards 
support 
programme. 
That 
commitment 
extended 
to 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
to 
improve 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
and 
highly 
radioactive 
sources. 
The 
Spanish 
Government 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
the 
correct 
functioning 
of 
an 
integrated 
national 
system 
to 
ensure 
the 
security 
of 
its 
nuclear 
industry 
and 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
prevent 
and 
disclose 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
the 
improper 
use 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
Spain 
welcomed 
the 
Integrated 
Nuclear 
Security 
Support 
Plans 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
available 
to 
Member 
States, 
and 
offered 
the 
collaboration 
of 
Spanish 
institutions 
in 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
the 
illicit 
use 
of 
radioactive 
material. 
SpainÂs 
entry 
into 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
its 
decision 
to 
host 
the 
fourth 
meeting 
of 
the 
Initiative 
in 
June 
2008 
and 
a 
subsequent 
practical 
exercise 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
combating 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
threats. 
Spain 
had 
also 
made 
a 
considerable 
contribution 
to 
the 
NSF 
to 
fund 
projects 
to 
improve 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capacities 
in 
that 
field. 
156. 
Spain 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
radiation 
protection, 
especially 
those 
aimed 
at 
consolidating 
and 
strengthening 
national 
regulatory 
bodies 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
standards. 
At 
regional 
level, 
Spain 
was 
trying 
to 
promote 
cooperation 
among 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
basin 
to 
improve 
radiation 
protection 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
using 
an 
action 
plan 
developed 
by 
the 
Spanish 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Council. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Radiological 
and 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agencies, 
Spain 
was 
collaborating 
with 
countries 
from 
the 
area 
to 
improve 
regulatory 
capacities, 
in 
particular 
regarding 
control 
of 
medical 
and 
industrial 
applications 
of 
radiation. 
Spain 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
share 
the 
lessons 
learned 
in 
the 
Forum, 
and 
asked 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
intensify 
those 
efforts 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
157. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
2008, 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Council 
had 
received 
an 
IRRS 
mission, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
had 
been 
more 
than 
satisfactory. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
full-scope 
mission, 
reviewing 
security 
aspects 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
Such 
missions 
were 
the 
best 
tool 
available 
to 
the 
international 
community 
to 
review, 
verify 
and 
improve 
national 
regulatory 
capacities 
and 
practices. 
The 
success 
of 
the 
IRRS 
mission 
had 
motivated 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Council 
to 
organize 
an 
international 
meeting 
in 
Seville 
in 
November 
2008 
to 
share 
lessons 
learned 
through 
such 
missions 
in 
2007 
and 
2008. 
158. 
Spain 
paid 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
and, 
in 
addition, 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Council 
and 
Research 
Centre 
for 
Energy, 
Environment 
and 
Technology 
(CIEMAT) 
funded 
a 
series 
of 
projects 
in 
Ibero-America 
and 
North 
Africa. 
The 
country 
had 
also 
provided 
experts 
for 
missions, 
offered 
training 
courses, 
subsidized 
and 
received 
fellows 
and 
hosted 
scientific 
visits 
to 
Spanish 
institutions 
and 
companies. 
The 
Research 
Centre 
collaborated 
actively 
in 
ARCAL 
by 
contributing 
financially, 
and 
providing 
experts 
and 
facilities 
for 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean. 
Spain 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Regional 
Strategic 
Profile 
which 
identified 
the 
priority 
areas 
for 
technical 
assistance. 
The 
national 
company 
for 
radioactive 
waste 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
especially 
with 
Ibero-America. 
159. 
Spain 
had 
eight 
nuclear 
units 
in 
operation, 
generating 
7728 
MW 
of 
installed 
electricity 
which 
represented 
8.5% 
of 
total 
national 
capacity. 
In 
2007, 
the 
gross 
electricity 
generation 
from 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
55 
039 
GWÂ·h, 
or 
17.6% 
of 
the 
total 
electricity 
generated 
nationally. 
The 
process 
of 
selecting 
a 
site 
for 
a 
centralized 
interim 
store 
for 
spent 
fuel 
and 
high 
activity 
waste 
had 
begun 
in 
June

Trade, 
following 
a 
favourable 
report 
from 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Council, 
had 
authorized 
the 
startup 
of 
an 
additional 
facility 
at 
the 
El 
Cabril 
Storage 
Centre, 
for 
the 
final 
disposal 
of 
very 
low 
activity 
waste. 


160. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2008, 
the 
Spanish 
Government 
planned 
to 
present 
a 
prospective 
study 
on 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
needs 
up 
to 
2030, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
analysing 
their 
evolution 
and 
defining 
the 
long-term 
energy 
policy, 
taking 
into 
account 
such 
aspects 
as 
assurance 
of 
supply, 
environmental 
and 
economic 
sustainability, 
the 
European 
objectives 
for 
2020, 
reduction 
of 
emissions, 
the 
development 
of 
renewable 
energy 
and 
reduced 
dependence 
on 
foreign 
supplies. 
161. 
Ms 
VADJA 
(Romania) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
a 
clean, 
reliable 
and 
sustainable 
energy 
source 
that 
could 
help 
address 
many 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
most 
pressing 
concerns. 
The 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
her 
countryÂs 
energy 
mix 
was 
set 
to 
double 
over 
the 
coming 
few 
years. 
Two 
units 
at 
the 
Cernavoda 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
were 
in 
operation 
and 
a 
third 
and 
fourth 
unit 
were 
due 
to 
be 
completed 
by 
2014Â2015, 
bringing 
the 
nuclear 
power 
share 
to 
around 
35%. 
The 
Government 
was 
also 
planning 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant; 
the 
site 
selection 
would 
be 
concluded 
by 
January 
2009. 
162. 
Romania 
welcomed 
increased 
Agency 
involvement 
in 
nuclear 
power 
application 
and 
noted 
with 
appreciation 
a 
number 
of 
useful 
documents 
issued 
on 
the 
subject. 
It 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
more 
support 
to 
those 
States 
that 
wished 
to 
build 
or 
strengthen 
their 
nuclear 
infrastructure. 
Romania 
was 
also 
working 
to 
develop 
other 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
relied 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
expertise 
and 
networking 
capacity 
to 
help 
Romania 
achieve 
its 
goals. 
163. 
Romania 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
education 
and 
training, 
and 
to 
preserve 
and 
enhance 
nuclear 
knowledge. 
164. 
Romania 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
to 
creating 
a 
solid 
safety 
infrastructure 
and 
culture. 
It 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
enhance 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime, 
and 
adhered 
to 
all 
international 
safety 
conventions 
and 
applied 
the 
AgencyÂs 
codes 
of 
conduct 
and 
safety 
standards. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Supplementary 
Compensation 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage 
Â 
the 
only 
effective 
solution 
to 
concerns 
over 
nuclear 
liability 
Â 
should 
be 
brought 
into 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
Romania 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
enhance 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
and 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre. 
165. 
Her 
country 
believed 
that 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
should 
be 
based 
on 
full 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
transparency 
in 
nuclear 
programmes. 
A 
universal 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
supported 
by 
a 
strong 
international 
safeguards 
system, 
was 
vital. 
Romania 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
prevention 
of 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
that 
might 
be 
misused, 
and 
she 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
integrated 
safeguards 
had 
been 
introduced 
in 
Romania 
in 
June 
2007. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol 
constituted 
the 
current 
verification 
standard, 
and 
Romania 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
strengthening 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
multilateral 
non-proliferation, 
arms 
control 
and 
disarmament 
treaties, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
strict 
implementation, 
were 
at 
the 
core 
of 
Romanian 
policy. 
166. 
International 
terrorism 
was 
a 
very 
real 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Her 
Government 
was 
actively 
committed 
to 
preventing 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
to 
reinforcing 
joint 
efforts 
to 
increase 
international 
cooperation 
to 
combat 
that 
threat. 
It 
had 
ratified 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
was 
a 
partner 
nation 
of 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
The 
amended 
CPPNM 
was 
another 
valuable 
instrument 
that 
Romania 
had 
ratified, 
but 
she 
noted 
with 
concern 
that 
the 
ratification 
process 
was 
still 
slow. 
The 
Agency 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
in 
helping 
States 
with 
their 
national

and 
regional 
nuclear 
security 
frameworks. 
Romania 
had 
again 
decided 
to 
make 
a 
national 
voluntary 
contribution 
in 
an 
amount 
of 
approximately 
US 
$40 
000, 
to 
be 
transferred 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2008. 


167. 
Romania 
believed 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
would 
remain 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
with 
Member 
States. 
The 
country 
was 
assessing 
its 
changing 
role 
within 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
trying 
to 
define 
a 
new 
strategy 
and 
new 
mechanisms 
for 
future 
cooperation. 
The 
main 
task 
of 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
Europe 
was 
to 
promote 
the 
sharing 
of 
knowledge 
and 
best 
practices, 
and 
Romania 
was 
ready 
to 
continue 
providing 
its 
experts 
and 
training 
facilities. 
It 
intended 
to 
focus 
more 
on 
regional 
projects 
in 
the 
future, 
and 
would 
partner 
30% 
more 
projects 
in 
the 
2009Â2011 
cycle. 
168. 
It 
was 
generally 
agreed 
that 
financing 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
be 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable. 
Romania 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
programme 
each 
year 
by 
pledging 
and 
paying 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full, 
and 
called 
on 
others 
to 
do 
the 
same. 
169. 
Mr 
HIGUERAS 
RAMOS 
(Peru) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
founding 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
world 
peace 
and 
security, 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
had 
contributed 
actively 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives, 
namely 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
regulation 
of 
its 
safe 
use 
and 
the 
application 
of 
verification, 
safeguards 
and 
physical 
protection 
measures. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
promote 
socioeconomic 
development 
was 
the 
surest 
way 
of 
achieving 
world 
peace 
and 
security. 
170. 
His 
Government 
would 
look 
favourably 
on 
any 
decision 
designed 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
It 
supported 
the 
actions 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
by 
State 
and 
non-State 
actors, 
and 
encouraged 
application 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
provided 
for 
in 
existing 
international 
instruments 
such 
as 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty. 
Peru 
also 
supported 
international 
conferences 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
NWFZs 
in 
other 
regions 
of 
the 
world. 
171. 
The 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
was 
crucial 
to 
achieving 
the 
final 
objective 
of 
general 
and 
complete 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Although 
Peru 
recognized 
the 
right 
of 
every 
State 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
that 
right 
was 
conditional 
upon 
strict 
compliance 
with 
commitments 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
application 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
based 
on 
the 
NPT, 
an 
important 
instrument 
to 
which 
those 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
accede. 
172. 
Peru 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
1999 
and 
had 
continued 
to 
apply 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
2007. 
173. 
Peru 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
India 
to 
apply 
safeguards 
to 
civilian 
nuclear 
facilities 
as 
an 
important 
element 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
verification 
and 
safeguards 
activities. 
174. 
Peru 
had 
expressed 
its 
general 
reservations 
regarding 
those 
chapters 
and 
paragraphs 
of 
the 
Final 
Document 
of 
the 
2008 
XV 
Ministerial 
Conference 
of 
the 
Non-Aligned 
Movement, 
which 
were 
not 
consistent 
with 
PeruÂs 
foreign 
policy 
on 
areas 
including, 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
international 
security, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
declaration 
on 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
Nevertheless, 
Peru 
continued 
to 
believe 
that 
all 
types 
of 
international 
conflict 
should 
be 
resolved 
through 
diplomatic 
dialogue 
alone, 
so 
that 
all 
decisions 
were 
always 
taken 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
system 
and 
international 
law.

175. 
The 
international 
situation 
showed 
that 
there 
was 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
by 
expanding 
its 
verification 
and 
monitoring 
capacities 
and 
its 
other 
responsibilities. 
Those 
tools 
should 
be 
used 
more 
effectively 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
used 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes. 
176. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
promote 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
should 
be 
strengthened. 
New 
challenges 
and 
realities 
necessitated 
a 
review 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
role 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
waste, 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
the 
verification 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons, 
which 
would 
make 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency. 
177. 
As 
in 
the 
past, 
Peru 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
the 
country 
in 
sectors 
related 
to 
increased 
food 
production, 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
neoplastic 
diseases, 
water 
resource 
management 
and 
modernization 
of 
new 
facilities. 
The 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
had 
continued 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
programmes, 
projects 
and 
activities 
aimed 
at 
giving 
added 
value 
to 
the 
production 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
where 
nuclear 
technology 
offered 
comparative 
advantages. 
178. 
With 
Agency 
assistance, 
the 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
and 
a 
number 
of 
other 
national 
institutions 
had 
successfully 
initiated 
and 
continued 
cooperation 
projects 
aimed 
at 
the 
application 
of 
genomics 
to 
increase 
wool 
production 
in 
alpacas 
and 
improve 
the 
neonatal 
health 
of 
South 
American 
camelids, 
genetic 
improvement 
of 
quinoa 
and 
kiwicha, 
management 
of 
the 
MÃ¡ncora 
aquifer 
to 
prevent 
seawater 
intrusion, 
and 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
support 
for 
nuclear 
technology. 
179. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
countries, 
the 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
had 
been 
able 
to 
provide 
specialized 
training 
in 
security 
to 
the 
relevant 
institutions. 
In 
May 
2008, 
Peru 
had 
hosted 
the 
V 
Summit 
of 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
of 
Latin 
America, 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
European 
Union 
and 
would 
host 
various 
meetings 
that 
were 
part 
of 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
Economic 
Cooperation 
Forum 
(APEC). 
180. 
His 
country 
valued 
the 
contribution 
the 
Agency 
made 
to 
national 
objectives 
through 
the 
supply 
of 
equipment, 
materials 
and 
inputs. 
Technology 
and 
knowledge 
transferred 
to 
Peru 
by 
Agency 
experts 
enabled 
the 
country 
to 
train 
its 
technical 
specialists 
locally. 
It 
was 
continuing 
to 
organize 
advanced 
courses 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
biotechnology, 
materials 
science, 
medicine, 
nuclear 
instrumentation 
and 
other 
subjects. 
181. 
Over 
the 
previous 
year, 
Peru 
had 
hosted 
important 
meetings 
organized 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency, 
including 
a 
seminar 
on 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
ARCAL 
Steering 
Group. 
In 
December 
2008, 
Peru 
would 
host 
the 
Regional 
Training 
Course 
on 
Environmental 
Management 
Systems 
in 
the 
Uranium 
Production 
Cycle. 
182. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
agreeing 
to 
send 
an 
IRRS 
mission 
to 
Peru 
from 
19 
to 
30 
April 
2009. 
183. 
The 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
completed 
their 
efforts 
to 
identify 
important 
cooperation 
projects 
for 
2009Â2011 
in 
areas 
including 
nuclear 
technology 
support, 
modernization 
of 
the 
RP-10 
research 
reactor, 
and 
improvements 
in 
cancer 
treatment. 
Peru 
highly 
valued 
Agency 
cooperation 
and 
was 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
considerations 
and 
obligations 
that 
it 
must 
meet, 
in 
particular 
the 
payment 
of 
national 
participation 
costs. 
In 
the 
previous 
year, 
Peru 
had 
dedicated 
its 
resources 
to 
reducing 
outstanding 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
hoped 
to 
continue 
those 
payments 
as 
far 
as 
possible. 
184. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
ARCAL, 
which 
helped 
close 
the 
technological 
gaps 
between 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
and 
establish 
cooperation 
links 
that 
had 
already 
begun 
to 
bear 
fruit 
at 
regional 
level.

185. 
Lastly, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
year 
2008 
was 
the 
fortieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
agreement 
between 
Peru 
and 
Argentina 
concerning 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
186. 
Mr 
ENKHSAIKHAN 
(Mongolia) 
said 
that 
in 
January 
2008, 
the 
Mongolian 
Parliament 
had 
adopted 
an 
MDG-based 
national 
development 
strategy 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
making 
Mongolia 
a 
middle 
income 
country 
by 
2021. 
One 
of 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
such 
rapid 
development 
was 
securing 
and 
increasing 
the 
supply 
of 
energy, 
a 
task 
rendered 
difficult 
by 
rising 
energy 
needs 
and 
oil 
prices. 
Under 
the 
strategy, 
an 
integrated 
energy 
system 
would 
be 
established 
and 
the 
energy 
mix 
would 
be 
diversified, 
including 
by 
exploiting 
the 
countryÂs 
uranium 
resources 
and 
possibly 
building 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
187. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
nuclear 
programme, 
his 
Government 
would 
initially 
work 
to 
create 
an 
appropriate 
legal 
framework 
and 
develop 
a 
programme 
for 
rational 
exploitation 
of 
the 
uranium 
deposits. 
A 
draft 
State 
policy 
on 
the 
exploitation 
of 
radioactive 
minerals 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
associated 
implementation 
plan 
had 
been 
presented 
to 
Parliament 
for 
consideration 
and 
adoption. 
Comprehensive 
nuclear 
legislation 
was 
also 
being 
drafted, 
and 
Mongolia 
was 
working 
to 
accede 
to 
a 
number 
of 
relevant 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
including 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
and 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Convention. 
188. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
importance 
his 
Government 
attached 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology, 
the 
Mongolian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
now 
reported 
directly 
to 
the 
Prime 
Minister, 
and 
related 
Government 
agencies, 
research 
and 
academic 
institutions 
were 
being 
restructured. 
Steps 
were 
also 
being 
taken 
to 
give 
the 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
the 
necessary 
independence 
to 
perform 
its 
tasks. 
189. 
New 
and 
safer 
power 
plant 
designs 
would 
make 
the 
nuclear 
option 
more 
attractive 
and 
viable, 
and 
Mongolia 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
design 
of 
smaller, 
low-cost 
reactors 
that 
were 
more 
affordable 
for 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
developing 
countries. 
190. 
Although 
safety 
was 
mainly 
a 
national 
responsibility, 
its 
impact 
extended 
beyond 
national 
boundaries. 
Safety 
culture 
and 
international 
cooperation 
were 
crucial 
and, 
in 
that 
context, 
the 
services 
of 
INSAG 
and 
SCART 
were 
invaluable. 
Safety 
and 
security 
should 
not 
be 
confined 
to 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
associated 
structures 
and 
radiation 
protection; 
equal 
importance 
should 
be 
given 
to 
ensuring 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
the 
application 
of 
non-nuclear 
power 
technologies. 
Given 
the 
number 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
adjacent 
to 
its 
territory, 
Mongolia 
supported 
the 
Agency 
policy 
of 
continuously 
improving 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
and 
closely 
followed 
the 
activities 
under 
the 
INPRO 
and 
ITER 
projects, 
as 
well 
as 
those 
of 
the 
GIF. 
191. 
Mongolia 
benefited 
greatly 
from 
Agency 
technical 
assistance, 
which 
had 
yielded 
positive 
results 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
human 
health, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
the 
environment. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
its 
support. 
Five 
national 
projects 
were 
being 
implemented 
in 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle, 
and 
talks 
were 
under 
way 
to 
determine 
further 
projects 
for 
2009Â2011. 
The 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
were 
of 
equal 
importance, 
and 
there 
should 
be 
a 
reasonable 
balance 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
resources. 
Accordingly, 
Mongolia 
supported 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
and 
noted 
the 
importance 
of 
ensuring 
that 
resources 
were 
sufficient, 
predictable 
and 
assured. 
192. 
Mongolia 
firmly 
believed 
that 
NWFZs 
contributed 
to 
confidence-building 
and 
strengthened 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
forum 
to 
share 
the 
experience 
of 
regions 
with 
NWFZs 
and 
examine 
the 
relevance 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
for 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
would 
be 
convened 
shortly.

193. 
While 
the 
NPT 
guaranteed 
the 
right 
to 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
all 
its 
States 
parties, 
a 
fully 
transparent 
nuclear 
policy 
was 
essential 
for 
mutual 
trust, 
productive 
cooperation 
and 
broader 
security. 
194. 
Noting 
that 
the 
progress 
made 
by 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
the 
DPRKÂs 
weapon 
programme 
should 
not 
be 
reversed, 
he 
said 
that 
further 
progress 
could 
only 
be 
achieved 
through 
cooperation 
and 
diplomacy. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
objective 
and 
essential 
role 
should 
not 
be 
diminished. 
195. 
In 
the 
10 
years 
since 
the 
adoption 
of 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
55/33 
S 
on 
MongoliaÂs 
international 
security 
and 
nuclear-weapon-free 
status, 
Mongolia 
had 
adopted 
national 
legislation 
which 
criminalized 
acts 
leading 
to 
violation 
of 
that 
status. 
At 
the 
international 
level, 
the 
five 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
issued 
a 
joint 
statement 
providing 
security 
assurances 
to 
Mongolia. 
To 
formalize 
its 
nuclear-weapon-free 
status, 
Mongolia 
had 
presented 
a 
draft 
trilateral 
treaty 
to 
its 
immediate 
neighbours 
in 
2007 
that 
was 
intended 
to 
form 
the 
international 
legal 
basis 
for 
MongoliaÂs 
status 
as 
a 
single-State 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, 
and 
would 
hopefully 
lead 
to 
institutionalization 
of 
MongoliaÂs 
status 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
196. 
Mr 
LEGWAILA 
(Botswana) 
said 
that, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
world 
was 
facing 
challenges 
such 
as 
natural 
and 
manmade 
disasters, 
high 
energy 
costs 
and 
food 
shortages, 
it 
was 
encouraging 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
continued 
to 
pursue 
the 
peaceful 
and 
beneficial 
exploitation 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
with 
a 
view 
to 
providing 
a 
better 
future 
for 
all. 
Botswana 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
uphold 
the 
principles 
enshrined 
in 
the 
NPT 
and 
would 
oppose 
efforts 
by 
any 
one 
nation 
or 
group 
to 
divert 
atomic 
energy 
for 
military 
uses. 
197. 
His 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
continuing 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations 
as 
a 
Member 
State 
of 
the 
Agency. 
A 
fully 
funded 
and 
adequately 
staffed 
Department 
of 
Radiation 
Protection 
was 
now 
operational 
in 
Botswana. 
Regulations 
to 
enhance 
the 
2006 
Radiation 
Protection 
Act 
had 
been 
approved 
in 
June 
2008, 
and 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
waste 
management 
facility 
were 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
the 
National 
Development 
Plan 
10 
for 
the 
period 
2009Â2016 
reflected 
a 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
security 
and 
to 
the 
enhancement 
of 
supportive 
measures. 
Botswana 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
invaluable 
support 
it 
had 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
form 
of 
expert 
advice, 
monitoring, 
equipment 
and 
staff 
training, 
and 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
it 
continued 
to 
make 
satisfactory 
progress 
towards 
attaining 
the 
five 
milestones 
set 
out 
by 
the 
Agency. 
198. 
Botswana 
continued 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
outreach 
programme 
by 
hosting 
a 
number 
of 
beneficial 
seminars 
and 
workshops. 
It 
was 
participating 
in 
AFRA 
and 
was 
deriving 
benefits 
from 
AFRA 
projects 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
agriculture, 
health, 
water 
resources 
and 
food 
and 
nutrition. 
However, 
Botswana 
continued 
to 
require 
support 
for 
the 
acquisition, 
adoption, 
adaptation 
and 
use 
of 
appropriate 
nuclear 
technologies 
to 
accelerate 
economic 
development, 
thus 
contributing 
to 
poverty 
reduction 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
199. 
Botswana 
continued 
to 
work 
tirelessly 
to 
reduce 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
pandemic 
but 
was 
encountering 
isolated 
challenges 
with 
related 
opportunistic 
diseases, 
such 
as 
drug-resistant 
tuberculosis 
strains. 
Research, 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency, 
on 
food 
and 
nutrition 
intervention 
techniques 
using 
stable 
isotopes 
was 
proceeding 
well, 
and 
would 
hopefully 
provide 
useful 
information. 
200. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
and 
had 
identified 
a 
number 
of 
potential 
areas 
of 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
during 
the 
2009Â2011 
project 
cycle. 
In 
agriculture, 
the 
areas 
included 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
improve 
crop 
yield 
through 
induced 
mutations, 
assisted 
reproductive 
techniques 
to 
improve 
livestock 
productivity, 
and 
improved 
diagnosis 
of 
animal 
diseases. 
In 
the 
health 
sector, 
plans 
were 
underway 
to 
set 
up 
a 
high 
dose 
rate 
brachytherapy

unit 
for 
cancer 
treatment. 
Efforts 
would 
also 
continue 
to 
find 
the 
appropriate 
energy 
mix 
for 
Botswana 
and 
continued 
attention 
would 
be 
paid 
to 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructure. 


201. 
Mr 
APOSTOL 
(Republic 
of 
Moldova) 
said 
that 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
like 
many 
in 
the 
region, 
paid 
great 
attention 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
international 
conventions 
it 
had 
ratified, 
and 
to 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
medicine, 
industry 
and 
other 
important 
branches 
of 
the 
national 
economy. 
202. 
During 
the 
preceding 
year, 
the 
National 
Agency 
for 
Regulation 
of 
Nuclear 
and 
Radiological 
Activities 
had 
been 
created 
as 
the 
single 
regulatory 
authority. 
Bringing 
MoldovaÂs 
legislative 
framework 
into 
line 
with 
Agency 
and 
European 
Union 
standards 
was 
the 
next 
step 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safe 
implementation 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
activities 
in 
the 
country. 
203. 
Since 
the 
previous 
General 
Conference, 
Moldova 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendments 
to 
Articles 
VI 
and 
XIV.A 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
encouraged 
other 
States 
to 
do 
likewise. 
The 
Parliament 
had 
also 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
the 
Agreement 
on 
Privileges 
and 
Immunities 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
204. 
In 
2008, 
Moldova 
had 
submitted 
its 
initial 
national 
report 
on 
nuclear 
material 
to 
the 
Secretariat 
pursuant 
to 
the 
SQP, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
first 
report 
on 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Convention. 
With 
the 
cooperation 
and 
assistance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security, 
it 
had 
drawn 
up 
an 
INSSP 
for 
security 
measures 
up 
to 
2010. 
Moldova 
had 
also 
joined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Illicit 
Trafficking 
Database. 
205. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
state 
that, 
although 
Moldova 
was 
in 
a 
transition 
period, 
its 
Government 
was 
implementing 
an 
approved 
plan 
for 
debt 
repayment, 
and 
paying 
current 
contributions 
to 
the 
Agency 
regularly. 
206. 
In 
2005, 
Moldova 
had 
signed 
its 
CPF, 
which 
identified 
the 
priority 
areas 
for 
cooperation 
as 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
human 
health, 
radiation 
processing, 
radiation 
safety, 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Over 
the 
previous 
eight 
years, 
Moldova 
had 
received 
technical 
assistance 
in 
an 
amount 
exceeding 
US$4.5 
million 
through 
Agency 
national 
and 
regional 
projects; 
activities 
undertaken 
included 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
modern 
calibration 
laboratory 
and 
provision 
of 
new 
equipment 
for 
cancer 
treatment. 
Moldova 
had 
also 
recently 
joined 
PACT, 
which 
was 
of 
great 
importance 
for 
the 
country. 
207. 
Noting 
that 
three 
new 
national 
projects 
would 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
cycle, 
he 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
the 
support 
it 
had 
given 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
ongoing 
national 
and 
regional 
projects. 
It 
was 
also 
grateful 
to 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
for 
the 
bilateral 
support 
it 
had 
given 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
inventory 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
208. 
In 
its 
first 
half 
century, 
the 
Agency 
had 
played 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
in 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
respectable 
international 
organizations. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
its 
activities. 
209. 
Mr 
GRIMA 
(Malta) 
said 
that 
the 
new 
threats 
and 
challenges 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
that 
had 
emerged 
in 
the 
early 
twenty-first 
century 
had 
called 
into 
question 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
global 
institutions 
that 
had 
served 
the 
international 
community 
well 
for 
so 
many 
years. 
The 
need 
for 
new 
thinking 
and 
novel 
approaches 
to 
world 
governance 
had 
become 
more 
urgent, 
and 
the 
tools 
available 
to 
the 
international 
community 
must 
be 
updated 
and 
strengthened.

210. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
Malta 
called 
on 
those 
States 
not 
yet 
party 
to 
the 
Treaty 
to 
join 
as 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
verifying 
the 
compliance 
of 
States 
with 
their 
safeguards 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
remained 
vital, 
and 
Malta 
considered 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
be 
the 
current 
verification 
standard. 
Accordingly, 
it 
urged 
those 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
adopt 
both 
without 
delay. 
211. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
still 
unable 
to 
determine 
the 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Malta 
urged 
Iran 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency; 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
would 
constitute 
an 
important 
step 
in 
building 
the 
required 
confidence 
in 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
212. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
ongoing 
developments 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
Malta 
had 
noted 
with 
concern 
the 
recent 
announcement 
by 
the 
DPRK 
of 
its 
decision 
to 
suspend 
its 
disablement 
activities. 
Malta 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
resume 
the 
dismantlement 
process 
and 
stressed 
that 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
early 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
213. 
Malta 
welcomed 
the 
developments 
regarding 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Socialist 
PeopleÂs 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya, 
and 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
now 
able 
to 
implement 
safeguards 
in 
Libya 
in 
a 
routine 
manner. 
It 
commended 
Libya 
for 
the 
various 
steps 
it 
had 
taken 
leading 
to 
a 
new 
phase 
in 
its 
relations 
with 
the 
Agency. 
214. 
The 
potential 
of 
malicious 
acts 
using 
nuclear 
material 
remained 
a 
continuing 
threat 
and 
Malta 
recognized 
the 
primary 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
providing 
States 
with 
assistance 
to 
control 
nuclear 
material 
and 
radiological 
sources, 
protect 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
strengthen 
border 
controls. 
The 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
material 
presented 
an 
enormous 
challenge 
in 
the 
area 
of 
non-
proliferation. 
Malta 
was 
particularly 
concerned 
to 
note 
that 
21 
of 
the 
243 
incidents 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
other 
unauthorized 
activities 
involving 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
reported 
to 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
previous 
12 
months 
had 
involved 
the 
theft 
or 
loss 
of 
material 
that 
had 
never 
been 
recovered. 
His 
country 
supported 
measures 
to 
enhance 
the 
capabilities 
of 
States 
to 
prevent 
and 
respond 
to 
illegal 
acts 
involving 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material. 
215. 
With 
the 
sharp 
fluctuations 
in 
oil 
prices, 
uncertainty 
of 
supply 
and 
climate 
change, 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
were 
considering 
adding 
nuclear 
power 
to 
their 
energy 
mix. 
The 
exercise 
of 
the 
alienable 
right 
of 
States 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
energy 
brought 
with 
it 
a 
heavy 
responsibility 
to 
meet 
the 
highest 
safety 
standards. 
Malta 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
promote 
education 
and 
training 
in 
all 
safety-related 
fields, 
and 
to 
enhance 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response. 
His 
country 
intended 
to 
play 
a 
part 
in 
the 
international 
effort 
to 
ensure 
the 
highest 
safety 
standards 
and 
had 
recently 
acceded 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
216. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
safety 
of 
marine 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
Malta 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
better 
communication 
between 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
States. 
The 
latter 
should 
be 
kept 
fully 
informed 
of 
shipments 
of 
nuclear 
material 
in 
their 
vicinity. 
217. 
Malta 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
benefited 
from 
its 
activities 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
including 
in 
the 
establishment 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national 
regulatory 
authority 
and 
the 
consolidation 
of 
public 
health 
services. 
Two 
additional 
national 
projects 
concerning 
consumer 
protection 
and 
human 
health 
had 
been 
planned 
for 
the 
next 
cycle. 
Malta 
also 
participated 
in 
several 
regional 
programmes 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
the 
preservation 
of 
cultural 
heritage 
and 
environmental 
protection.

218. 
Malta 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
discussion 
in 
the 
coming 
months 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
role 
and 
the 
resources 
required 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
fulfil 
its 
mandate 
effectively. 
Malta 
was 
confident 
that, 
in 
the 
decades 
to 
come, 
the 
Agency 
would 
remain 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
international 
efforts 
to 
make 
the 
world 
a 
better, 
safer 
and 
fairer 
place. 
219. 
Mr 
TRAN 
(Viet 
Nam) 
said 
that 
in 
2008, 
the 
Vietnamese 
National 
Assembly 
had 
passed 
the 
Atomic 
Energy 
Law, 
which 
concerned 
research, 
development 
and 
utilization 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
Viet 
Nam 
and 
would 
come 
into 
force 
from 
1 
January 
2009. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
and 
countries 
such 
as 
Australia, 
France, 
Japan, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
for 
their 
cooperation 
in 
drafting 
that 
law. 
Various 
Government 
decrees 
and 
ministerial-level 
circulars 
to 
apply 
the 
law 
were 
being 
drafted, 
and 
a 
comprehensive 
legal 
framework 
regulating 
all 
nuclear-related 
activities 
should 
be 
effectively 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2009. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
countries 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
with 
Viet 
Nam, 
in 
particular 
on 
a 
decree 
concerning 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
220. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
a 
vital 
resource 
for 
the 
development 
of 
national 
capacities 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
In 
the 
2007Â 
2008 
cycle, 
Viet 
Nam 
had 
been 
carrying 
out 
11 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
and 
9 
new 
project 
concepts 
had 
been 
proposed 
for 
2009Â2011. 
All 
the 
projects 
had 
been 
well 
implemented, 
producing 
many 
results 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
significance. 
Viet 
Nam 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
vast 
majority 
of 
regional 
and 
interregional 
projects, 
and 
thanked 
India 
for 
providing 
it 
with 
a 
Bhabhatron 
II 
teletherapy 
unit 
under 
the 
PACT 
programme. 
221. 
Viet 
Nam 
had 
made 
substantial 
progress 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety, 
security 
and 
safeguards. 
Important 
regulatory 
documents 
on 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
export 
and 
import 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
the 
recovery 
and 
handling 
of 
orphan 
sources 
and 
transportation 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
were 
being 
implemented 
effectively. 
Inspection 
of 
radiation 
facilities 
had 
been 
enhanced, 
with 
approximately 
800 
inspections 
covering 
40% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
radioactive 
facilities 
conducted 
each 
year. 
The 
introduction 
of 
an 
online 
licensing 
system 
had 
significantly 
improved 
radiation 
facility 
licensing. 
A 
division 
for 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
safeguards 
had 
been 
established 
within 
the 
Viet 
Nam 
Agency 
for 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Safety 
(VARANS). 
An 
electronic 
communication 
channel 
for 
submission 
of 
nuclear 
safeguards 
reports 
to 
the 
Agency 
had 
also 
been 
established. 
The 
capacity 
of 
VARANS 
had 
been 
substantially 
enhanced 
following 
intensive 
Government 
investment 
and 
international 
cooperation 
and 
support. 
222. 
Viet 
Nam 
had 
fulfilled 
all 
its 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
to 
the 
Agency, 
including 
by 
paying 
its 
NPCs 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle, 
making 
payment 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
pledging 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2008. 
Viet 
Nam 
had 
also 
cooperated 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
hosting 
many 
joint 
Agency 
and 
RCA 
meetings, 
workshops 
and 
training 
courses. 
It 
hoped 
to 
cooperate 
more 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Member 
States 
and 
international 
organizations 
in 
future, 
in 
particular 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
the 
country. 
223. 
Ms 
NORIEGA 
URIZAR 
(Guatemala) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
actively 
supported 
any 
initiative 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
As 
a 
party 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
an 
instrument 
that 
had 
established 
the 
first 
densely 
populated 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
world, 
Guatemala 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
She 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
her 
countryÂs 
additional 
protocol 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
May 
2008. 
224. 
A 
balance 
must 
be 
maintained 
between 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
namely 
verification, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
technical 
cooperation. 
With 
the 
increasing 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
particularly 
among 
developing 
countries, 
it 
was 
essential 
that 
more 
financial 
resources 
were 
provided 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme.

activities 
had 
to 
be 
sufficient, 
predictable 
and 
assured, 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
could 
not 
therefore 
continue 
to 
be 
dependent 
on 
voluntary 
contributions. 


225. 
Increasing 
food 
prices 
were 
leading 
to 
greater 
poverty 
and 
hunger 
in 
the 
world, 
and 
Guatemala 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
applications, 
in 
particular 
concerning 
crop 
improvement 
and 
PACT. 
226. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
Guatemala 
were 
contributing 
to 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
in 
her 
country. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
implemented 
in 
Guatemala 
in 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle 
had 
included 
a 
project 
on 
environmental 
control 
of 
mining 
operations 
in 
Guatemala, 
which 
sought 
to 
strengthen 
the 
technical 
capacity 
of 
the 
laboratories 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mining. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
human 
nutrition, 
a 
laboratory 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
evaluation 
of 
nutrition-related 
chronic 
diseases 
in 
Guatemala 
and 
Central 
America, 
had 
been 
established 
at 
the 
Institute 
of 
Nutrition 
of 
Central 
America 
and 
Panama. 
In 
the 
energy 
sector, 
efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
introduce 
new 
techniques 
to 
improve 
the 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
Chixoy 
hydroelectric 
dam. 
In 
agriculture, 
a 
project 
had 
been 
undertaken 
to 
establish 
a 
fruit 
fly 
free 
area 
using 
the 
sterile 
insect 
technique. 
In 
June, 
the 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
for 
Technical 
Cooperation 
had 
visited 
Guatemala 
and 
discussed 
strategies 
to 
increase 
Guatemala's 
participation 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
as 
well 
as 
national 
priorities 
in 
the 
nuclear 
area. 
Two 
new 
projects 
had 
been 
included 
for 
the 
2009Â2011 
cycle 
on 
strengthening 
cancer 
treatment 
at 
the 
National 
Cancer 
Institute 
and 
support 
for 
the 
development 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
nuclear 
technology. 
Guatemala 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
and 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
to 
increase 
GuatemalaÂs 
participation 
in 
regional 
projects. 
227. 
Guatemala 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
that 
would 
provide 
valuable 
input 
for 
the 
discussions 
of 
the 
future 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
for 
the 
Agency. 
Guatemala 
looked 
forward 
to 
participating 
constructively 
in 
those 
discussions.

7. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/9) 
1. Mr MOHAMAD (Malaysia) said that his country shared the Director GeneralÂs concern that the 
TCF continued to lag behind the pressing needs of developing countries. The Agency needed to ensure 
an equitable balance between the three pillars of its mandate, which was especially important in the 
light of the global nuclear energy renaissance and the need to ensure efficient use of nuclear power 
while also addressing nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation. 
2. With regard to the establishment of appropriate mechanisms to ensure sufficient, assured and 
predictable resources for the TCF, his country could support the idea of changing the status of TCF 
contributions to make them more obligatory. It fully supported the call for hedging mechanisms to 
protect against erosion of the value of the TCF due to currency fluctuations, and for appropriate 
criteria for setting TCF targets. 
3. In order to encourage more recipient States to provide extrabudgetary contributions to the 
Agency, in line with the concept of shared responsibility, such contributions should be exempt from 
programme support costs. 
4. He thanked the Agency for the continuing support provided by the Department of Technical 
Cooperation for the implementation of projects and other activities in Malaysia, and for the trust 
placed in his country which continued to host the IAEA postgraduate course on radiation protection 
and the safety of radiation services. He also thanked Member States that had shown interest in the 
course, which had attracted candidates from within the region and beyond. 
5. Since the early 1970s, the AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects in Malaysia had focused on 
non-power applications. Future cooperation was also expected to include planning and preparation for 
the possible implementation of a nuclear power programme, in view of increasing global and regional 
fossil fuel prices and diminishing indigenous energy resources. 
6. Malaysia was exploring the possible utilization of nuclear energy to meet future demand. The 
country planned to conduct a comprehensive review of national institutional, infrastructure-related and 
other relevant requirements for the implementation of a nuclear power programme, with a view to 
identifying gaps and implementing strategies to address them. In that connection, Malaysia would be 
seeking Agency support. His country appreciated the willingness of the Agency and certain Member 
States to assist with the planning and preparation of a possible nuclear power programme, including 
within the framework of INPRO. 
7. Malaysia had also been taking concrete action to strengthen its nuclear and radiological safety 
and security framework, including the drafting of a comprehensive national law to control strategic 
goods, which also covered nuclear material, equipment and technologies. The law would take account 
of the provisions of United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) and the additional 
protocol to MalaysiaÂs comprehensive safeguard agreement, which it had signed in 2005. 
8. His country had made compliance with the non-legally-binding IAEA Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the associated Guidance on the Import and Export of 
Radioactive Sources, as well as the non-legally-binding Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research 
Reactors, a licensing condition under national nuclear regulations. It had also been implementing 

GC(52)/OR.7 
3 
October 
2008, 
Page 
2 


several other nuclear security measures on a bilateral basis, in line with growing global and regional 
concerns over the need to ensure supply chain security in international trade. 

9. With regard to verification of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, Malaysia welcomed the 
statement by the Director General that the Agency had continued to verify the shutdown status of the 
DPRKÂs nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, with the cooperation of that country. 
10. It also welcomed the substantial progress made with regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, 
especially the fact that the Agency had been able to verify the non-diversion of nuclear material. 
11. Likewise, it was pleased that the Agency had not found any indication of actual work related to 
nuclear weapons development in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. 
12. With regard to implementation of safeguards in the Syrian Arab Republic, he welcomed the 
news that the Agency had been able to visit the installation at Al Kibar that had been destroyed by 
Israel in September 2007 and conclude that no indication of nuclear material had been found at the 
site, and he commended Syria for its cooperation with the Agency. 
13. The lack of progress with respect to consultations on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East was regrettable. 
14. He commended the Director General for his initiative in establishing the Commission of 
Eminent Persons to reflect on the future of the Agency and took note of his call for a structured 
discussion of the CommissionÂs report that could, perhaps, involve the establishment of issue-specific 
focus groups. However more broad-based discussions might be appropriate, since the future direction 
of the Agency was a matter of extreme importance to all Member States. It was regrettable that the 
CommissionÂs report did not specifically address the need for long-term and sustainable financing of 
the technical cooperation programme. 
15. The future of the Agency should be based on the fundamental bargain underlying the NPT, in 
particular the inalienable right of all the States party to the Treaty to develop research, production and 
use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I, 
II, and III of the Treaty. That should encompass the need to respect each countryÂs choice and decision 
concerning the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, without jeopardizing their respective national policies 
or international cooperation agreements and arrangements for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the 
nuclear fuel cycle. 
16. Furthermore, developed Member States should recognize developing countriesÂ legitimate right 
to the use of nuclear energy by allowing them to participate to the fullest extent possible in the transfer 
of nuclear equipment, material and scientific and technological information for peaceful purposes. 
17. Any concern any party might have regarding nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation should 
be addressed through multilaterally negotiated, universal, comprehensive and non-discriminatory 
agreements. Nuclear non-proliferation arrangements had to be transparent and open to participation by 
all States and should not impose restrictions on the access to material, equipment and technology for 
peaceful purposes required by developing countries for their continued development. It was extremely 
important that the Secretariat be allowed to maintain and enhance its impartiality and professionalism, 
particularly in carrying out its safeguards verification activities. Malaysia strongly rejected any 
attempt to politicize the work of the Agency, including its technical cooperation programme, which 
would be tantamount to a violation of the IAEA Statute. 
18. Nuclear-weapon States and all States not party to the NPT should exercise greater political will 
to achieve general, complete and irreversible nuclear disarmament, as called for under the NPT.

19. In order to maintain the relevance of the Agency to the needs of its developing Member States, 
renewed attention should be given to the promotional aspects of the AgencyÂs mandate. Bearing in 
mind Member States safeguards obligations, Malaysia rejected any notion that would result in certain 
technologies being excluded from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. 
20. Any notion of a global nuclear order should not worsen the dichotomy between developing and 
developed Member States by endorsing an emerging regime of nuclear technology suppliers and 
recipients on top of an existing regime of nuclear-weapon States and non-nuclear-weapon States, 
especially at a time when developing States needed to implement nuclear power programmes to ensure 
energy security and long-term sustainable development. 
21. Initiatives to develop a multilateral approach to the nuclear fuel cycle and fuel supply 
assurances should not create a new regime of nuclear technology haves and have-nots. Any such 
approach or regime should be based on extensive, comprehensive and transparent consultation among 
all interested parties and Member States and all relevant decisions should be taken by consensus. 
22. Mr WAHID-UZ-ZAMAN (Bangladesh) said that the current session of the General Conference 
was of historic significance as the world faced the threats of self-annihilation, soaring food and fuel 
prices, climate change, food and energy security problems, disease and a lack of drinking water. 
Solutions might be found to many of those problems with the AgencyÂs help. The key was to develop 
new sustainable technologies and ensure that they rapidly reached the people who needed them most. 
23. Like many developing countries in Asia and Africa, Bangladesh had a very vulnerable 
economy, characterized by extremely high population density, a low resource base and high incidence 
of natural disasters that had adverse implications for long-term savings, investment and economic 
growth. The vast majority of the population had not reaped the benefits of advances in science and 
technology. The nation also had to confront new challenges in the context of globalization and new 
problems that were arising in the current phase of domestic development. A reliable supply of energy 
and electricity was crucial to enhancing socio-economic development and improving the basic quality 
of life. Hence, his Government aimed at ensuring that all citizens would have electricity by 2020. 
24. The ongoing global energy crisis was already having a telling effect on the development efforts 
of developed and developing nations alike, particularly in countries with few energy resources of their 
own and those that were rapidly depleting their resources. The developing countries had a very low 
per capita energy consumption but even modest growth would have an impact on the both the 
availability and price of fossil fuels. 
25. Owing to a lack of indigenous energy resources, Bangladesh had become highly dependent on 
gas. Natural gas accounted for 70% of total commercial energy consumption and 90% of total 
electricity generation. The country had only limited reserves of gas and, if natural gas was used at the 
current rate, existing reserves could be depleted within 10Â15 years. Coal reserves and hydroelectric 
potential were also very limited. Per capita consumption of energy and electricity was one of the 
lowest in the world. Bangladesh urgently needed to reduce demand for its indigenous fossil fuel, and 
nuclear power was an inevitable option if the country was to achieve energy security. Nuclear power 
also posed less of a threat to the environment. He called upon the Agency to play a more proactive role 
in helping developing countries introduce nuclear power into their energy mix. 
26. Qualified human resources were essential for the safety, security, reliability and successful 
implementation of any nuclear power project. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission had a core 
team of dedicated scientists, engineers and technical staff. Further systematic expansion of human 
resources was an important prerequisite for the revitalization of the nuclear power plant programme. 
The Agency had an important role to play in human resources development.

27. Another major challenge with regard to the building of nuclear power plants in developing 
countries was financing. In that connection, the Agency should seek innovative financial 
arrangements. Since nuclear energy was clean, the Agency should take steps to persuade international 
financial institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank to include it 
in their sustainable environment management projects. As nuclear power did not emit greenhouse 
gases it should be considered in the CDM, and the Special Climate Change Fund should be accessible 
for civilian nuclear power projects. He urged the Agency to make greater efforts within the United 
Nations to bring about the implementation of that proposal. 
28. Cancer was a global problem and it was estimated that, by 2020, there would be 15 million new 
cases every year worldwide, 70% of which would be in developing countries. In Bangladesh, 
200 000 new cases of cancer were detected every year, yet there was virtually no screening for breast 
or cervical cancer, even though both could be treated successfully if detected early. The Agency could 
make a significant contribution to combating cancer in developing countries. Bangladesh was grateful 
to the organization for the technical assistance it provided with the introduction of nuclear medicine 
and low-dose rate therapy systems for diagnosis and cancer treatment. 
29. Bangladesh had impeccable non-proliferation credentials. The signing of the NPT, the CTBT, 
its safeguards agreement, and various protocols, conventions and bilateral agreements on peaceful uses 
of atomic energy bore testimony to its commitment to the non-proliferation verification regime. 
Recently, the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, in collaboration with the United States 
Department of Energy, had upgraded the physical security system for all nuclear facilities/radiation 
sources in both the public and private sectors with state-of-the-art technology under the radiological 
threat reduction programme. 
30. Bangladesh had also commissioned the establishment of a central radioactive waste processing 
and storage facility at its Atomic Energy Research Establishment complex in Savar. 
31. The Government had adopted the principles of a nuclear safety-oriented culture to protect the 
public and the environment from radiation exposure. Bangladesh had intensified its activities in the 
area of nuclear safety and radiation control since the enactment of the Nuclear Safety and Radiation 
Control Act in 1993 and the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control Rules in 1997. Recently, the 
Regulatory Authority had issued an operating license for the TRIGA Mark II research reactor after 
careful study of the safety analysis report prepared by Bangladeshi scientists and engineers. An act 
establishing the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority was currently in preparation and 
would make provision for an independent and impartial regulatory body to protect the public and the 
environment from the detrimental effects of nuclear energy, radiation sources and radioactive material 
used in medicine, industry, agriculture, education and research, and to ensure nuclear safety and 
radiation control for nuclear power reactors. 
32. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission had recently formulated comprehensive nuclear 
legislation incorporating the essential elements prescribed by the Agency. Bangladesh was working to 
finalize the legislation, a copy of which had been submitted to the Agency for peer review. The 
country needed Agency assistance with the further revision and finalization of its nuclear legislation. 
33. His Government appreciated the assistance provided by the Agency with its various R&D 
programmes on the peaceful use of nuclear energy, in particular in the area of human resources 
development. 
34. In conclusion, a vision for the Agency for the next fifty years should be formulated on the basis 
of the successes and experience of its first fifty years, and one of the its major objectives should be to 
reduce the gap between rich and poor, and between developed and developing nations.

35. Mr LUNDBORG (Sweden), recalling that 2008 marked the fortieth anniversary of the 
conclusion of the NPT, said that the Treaty had become one of the most valuable instruments of 
collective security. It had played a key role in safeguarding international peace and continued to do so. 
The NPT had virtually universal support, more than any comparable document apart from the United 
Nations Charter. The NPT had to remain the realistic response to the nuclear challenge and had to 
continue to be successful in the fight against proliferation. 
36. The non-proliferation commitment was shared by many, but sadly not all. There was a growing 
danger that nuclear proliferation might extend into more troublesome and complex regions. Iran was 
not the only case, but was currently perhaps the most worrisome. Recent developments in the DPRK 
were also of concern. A single State actor might be coped with by the logic of deterrence, but what lay 
ahead was the risk of a new phase of proliferation extending to one country after another in volatile 
parts of the world. 
37. Only effective multilateralism could deal with the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons, to 
both States and non-State actors. The risks of nuclear terrorism or illegal diversion of and trafficking 
in nuclear and other radioactive material also had to be countered. The International Convention for 
the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the CPPNM, alongside the AgencyÂs activities in 
the areas of nuclear security, verification and national implementation of international instruments, 
were very important in that respect. 
38. The AgencyÂs verification system was a key component of the non-proliferation regime. 
Effectively countering proliferation required a solid and effective safeguards system. Sweden, like 
many other countries, had persistently stressed the critical importance of the additional protocol. 
Notwithstanding the voluntary nature of the additional protocol, concluding one served as 
confirmation that a country was acting according not only to the letter but also to the spirit of the NPT. 
Together with comprehensive safeguards agreements, additional protocols constituted the universal 
standard for nuclear verification. 
39. A functioning multilateral mechanism would help achieve non-proliferation goals. The issue of 
multilateralization of the nuclear fuel cycle had been discussed for many years at the Agency and 
elsewhere. Sweden believed that the time had come to start moving towards the phase of selecting the 
options best suited for implementation. He drew attention to the fact that the European Union had 
indicated at the General Conference that it was considering the possibility of contributing to the 
Nuclear Threat Initiative in connection with the elaboration of a multilateral nuclear approaches 
mechanism within the framework of the Agency. 
40. A number of proposals regarding multilateral nuclear approaches had been submitted to the 
Agency. Very recently, interesting documentation on the German proposal for a multilateral 
enrichment sanctuary project had been circulated to Agency Member States. Sweden very much 
appreciated GermanyÂs ambitious efforts to achieve progress on the issue. 
41. On 1 July 2008, the two nuclear regulatory bodies in Sweden, the Swedish Nuclear Power 
Inspectorate and the Radiation Protection Authority, had been merged and a new integrated regulatory 
body, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, had been established. The merger would provide for 
more efficient and effective supervision with combined resources. The new regulatory body would 
continue the important international cooperation and organizational memberships of its predecessors. 
It would be well equipped to meet the new challenges ahead of it with regard to safety, security and 
safeguards. 
42. The Swedish nuclear power programme, established in the 1960s and 70s, was currently in a 
dynamic phase. Following the closure of the two BarsebÃ¤ck power reactors a few years earlier, 
10 reactors remained in operation The extensive modernization and safety upgrading of the 

GC(52)/OR.7 
3

2008, 
Page 
6 


10 operating Swedish reactors were continuing in order to make the reactors fit for operation for 
40 years and beyond. The whole modernization programme was expected to be finalized within five 
years. 

43. Pursuant to the Forsmark incident, when parts of the emergency power systems had failed, the 
former Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate had initiated extensive experience feedback efforts on 
those issues in international forums, including the Agency. The seminar held in Sweden in 
September 2007 had attracted many more participants than expected. The electrical systems issues 
involved had received worldwide attention. Sweden wished to thank the Agency for its support and for 
the successful OSART mission to the Forsmark site in February 2008. The mission had confirmed that 
the Forsmark nuclear power plant had taken the relevant corrective actions, and it had also generated a 
number of recommendations and suggestions. The report had been made public. Two more plants 
would be receiving OSART missions in order to complete the international assessment of the safety 
work at Swedish nuclear power plants. 
44. Sweden strongly supported the AgencyÂs Integrated Regulatory Review Service and would 
continue to provide experts to IRRS mission teams. In the near future, Sweden would also request an 
IRRS mission to review the new regulatory body. 
45. Installations serving the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle in Sweden currently included a final 
repository for low-and intermediate-level waste and an interim storage plant for spent nuclear fuel. 
According to the industry concept for spent nuclear fuel disposal, the spent fuel would be encapsulated 
in copper canisters before being placed in a deep geological final repository. 
46. Before the summer of 2009, Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co, which was 
jointly owned by the Swedish nuclear power industry, would announce in which municipality the 
company wished to build the final repository for spent nuclear fuel. The formal application for the 
final repository would, according to the industryÂs schedule, be presented in 2010. The application 
would be reviewed by the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and the Environmental Court before the 
final decision by the Government. 
47. Sweden continued to follow closely and participate in the ongoing review of the Basic Safety 
Standards and considered it to be of utmost importance that the review should take full account of the 
recently adopted recommendations of the ICRP and the new Safety Fundamentals. The new Basic 
Safety Standards could be expected to enhance and harmonize substantially the actions taken in the 
international community to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of 
radiation. The AgencyÂs leadership in that work was highly appreciated. 
48. Sweden was investing around Â6 million a year in technical cooperation programmes designed 
to improve reactor safety, nuclear non-proliferation measures, radioactive and nuclear waste 
management and radiation protection. Currently, those programmes mainly focused on cooperation 
with the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Additional technical cooperation programmes in the field of 
nuclear non-proliferation had been initiated in Armenia and Georgia. The AgencyÂs safety standards 
formed the basis for that cooperation. 
49. The 2008 Scientific Forum on the future role of the IAEA had provided useful ideas on the 
further development of the 20/20 vision. He thanked the Commission of Eminent Persons for its 
elaborate and useful contribution to the process of shaping the future role of the Agency. 
50. The CommissionÂs idea of creating an Âadditional protocol plusÂ to enhance verification and 
strengthen the safeguards system and, ultimately, the AgencyÂs ability to provide the necessary 
confidence, was a very interesting idea. Such a mechanism would confirm the AgencyÂs right and 
obligation to gain access to sites and information related to nuclear material production technologies

and to nuclear weaponization activities, as well as the AgencyÂs right to private interviews with 
individuals who might know about such activities. 

Ms 
Gervais-Vidricaire 
(Canada), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
chair. 


51. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) announced that the Syrian Government had ratified the 
amendment to Article XIV.A of the AgencyÂs Statute and would be depositing its instrument of 
acceptance the following week. 
52. Expressing regret at the appeals to Syria from some Member States to exhibit greater 
transparency and to cooperate more closely with the Agency, he reminded the States concerned that 
the Director General and the Deputy Director General for Safeguards had reported to the Board of 
Governors at its September meetings that Syria had been cooperative and had implemented the 
measures agreed with the Agency. His Government would continue to cooperate, but it would not 
under any circumstances make disclosures about its military sites that might threaten the countryÂs 
security. 
53. Syria urged Member States to support its candidacy for a Middle East and South Asia seat on 
the Board of Governors for the period 2008-2010, referring to the positive role it had played as a 
Board member and its productive cooperation with the Agency on technical and technological matters. 
54. While Syria commended the report submitted by the Commission of Eminent Persons, it called 
on the Conference to view it as a non-binding document that simply offered guidance to the Agency. 
The AgencyÂs strategy and its vision of its future role had to be determined by its Member States in 
accordance with the provisions of the Statute. 
55. The Agency had established partnerships with a number of United Nations bodies with a view 
to enhancing the effectiveness of joint projects and rationalizing expenditure. The partnerships had so 
far proved successful. In particular, he urged the Agency and all Member States to support the work of 
the Joint FAO/IAEA Division. 
56. The failure of the General Conference to discuss the agenda item concerning Israeli nuclear 
capabilities and threat at its preceding session and to adopt a resolution on the subject had sent a 
negative message to the peoples of the Middle East region regarding the double standards that were 
being applied by the international community. Notwithstanding the adoption of a series of resolutions 
in recent decades regarding the risk inherent in the continued existence of Israeli nuclear weapons 
outside the non-proliferation regime, IsraelÂs military nuclear arsenal continued to grow, with 
technical and financial support from some major powers which were at the same time preventing the 
use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in other countries. The Arab States and other countries 
demanded action to address the threat to both regional and international peace and security posed by 
non-peaceful Israeli nuclear capabilities in the Middle East. At its current session, the General 
Conference must demonstrate to all peace-loving peoples its determination to address the causes of 
instability in the region and to bolster the non-proliferation regime by taking up the agenda item on 
nuclear capabilities and threat. 
57. The goal of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was high on the agenda 
of a wide range of international forums. While all Arab States were parties to the NPT, Israel retained 
its exceptional status as a country with nuclear weapons that refused to take any serious steps towards 
ending the security imbalance in the Middle East. There had been concerted international efforts to 
establish nuclear-weapon-free zones in Africa, Asia, Central Europe, and Latin America and the 
Caribbean, but the Middle East was unfortunately still far from that goal, a situation that was 
conducive to an arms race in the region. Two steps were necessary to remedy the situation. First, Israel 
should accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 

GC(52)/OR.7

Second, Israel should comply with Security Council resolution 487 (1981) which called on it Âurgently 
to place its nuclear facilities under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy AgencyÂ. There 
was no point in holding a forum to draw on regional experience in establishing nuclear-weapon-free 
zones while Israel continued to block progress by failing to meet those requirements. SyriaÂs 
participation in such an event would also depend on the establishment of a clear-cut and objective 
agenda. 

58. An Agency integrated safety assessment team had visited SyriaÂs research reactor the preceding 
year and had made useful recommendations for improving safety, which were being implemented. 
Syria had hosted regional training courses on physical protection of radioactive sources in 2007 in 
cooperation with the Agency and was currently incorporating safety regulations in its domestic 
legislation and regulations. 
59. He commended the technical cooperation initiatives undertaken by the group of Asian Member 
States of the Agency in 2008. In particular, two regional meetings of liaison officers had adopted 
recommendations that had led to a constructive dialogue aimed at promoting cooperation among 
countries in the region. There were plans to establish a database of institutions that hosted trainees. 
The discussion of future technical cooperation projects at a meeting in Bangkok would also have a 
major impact on the implementation of regional projects, in particular through the preparation of an 
action plan. 
60. Most of SyriaÂs national projects would be completed successfully by the end of 2008. The 
Agency, Damascus University and Atomic Energy Commission of Syria would continue to cooperate 
on the project relating to a masterÂs degree course in radiation protection and the safety of radioactive 
sources. Syria also continued to host students from the region attending courses on agriculture, 
hydrology, radioactive sources and monitoring activities. 
61. With regard to the AgencyÂs espousal of national participation costs as part of a package to fund 
technical cooperation, he said that, although the rate had been reduced from 8 to 5%, the prepayment 
mechanism, and the inclusion of regional projects, had had adverse effects and had led to delays of up 
to four months in the implementation of projects. Syria proposed that a task force be established to 
review the mechanism and submit a report to the Board of Governors. 
62. ARASIA had recorded an implementation rate of around 80% for eight projects in 2008. He 
thanked the Agency Secretariat for its valuable assistance in that regard. The ARASIA States had 
signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at facilitating exchanges of plant genetic resources for 
the radiological production of mutations to improve agricultural yields. As Chair of the ARASIA 
Board of Representatives, he announced that ARASIA had adopted a medium-term strategy for the 
period 2008Â2013 at its annual meeting in Jordan in April 2008. During the current session of the 
Conference, the group had launched a website that would provide details of technical cooperation 
projects and other matters. 
63. Mr PANUPONG (Thailand) said that the growing number of developing countries joining the 
Agency attested to its important role in helping such countries achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals through peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Thailand shared that common aspiration. The work of 
the Agency was essential to the promotion of atoms for peace as well as peace itself. The organization 
had a proven track record of integrity, impartiality and professionalism in carrying out its statutory 
mandate, particularly with regard to verification, nuclear safety, and technology transfer. He 
commended the Director General on his exceptional leadership. 
64. The challenges of global warming and rising oil prices demanded a decisive shift in countriesÂ 
energy security paradigm. Dependence on fossil fuels alone was no longer sufficient. Diversification 
required greater use of new and alternative energy sources. For many countries, nuclear energy had 

GC(52)/OR.7 
3

2008, 
Page 
9 


become the choice for tomorrow to meet the ever growing power demand. Over recent years, there had 
been a continuing trend towards a so-called global nuclear renaissance. Several reports of the Agency 
had pointed to the fact that the major growth area for nuclear power was currently Asia. 

65. As one of the Asian countries considering launching a nuclear power programme, Thailand had 
recently reinvigorated its long-standing policy of promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In its 
power development plan, his Government was preparing to fulfil its goal of building the countryÂs first 
two nuclear power plants, which it was expected would deliver a combined capacity of 4000 MW, 
providing for 12.58% of ThailandÂs electricity needs. 
66. For the nuclear renaissance to be successful in Asia, priority in addressing safety and security 
concerns was vital. Thailand was doing its utmost to prepare carefully for nuclear energy. In 
December 2007, the Thai Cabinet had endorsed the creation of the Nuclear Power Programme 
Development Office under the Ministry of Energy. The Office acted as the coordinating body for the 
implementation of the nuclear power infrastructure establishment plan. It would coordinate with other 
Thai agencies responsible for selecting appropriate technology, for safety and nuclear waste disposal 
issues, regulatory infrastructure, legal framework, and human resources. 
67. In addition, Thailand had initiated a feasibility study for the nuclear power plant project, which 
was scheduled to be complete by May 2010. The aim was to ensure maximum safety and efficiency in 
the operation of a nuclear power plant, in compliance with Agency standards. His country was also 
considering various domestic legislation to allow it to accede to international instruments pertaining to 
nuclear safety, including the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
68. Thailand was cooperating with other ASEAN countries to promote a nuclear safety culture 
within the region and had hosted the ASEAN+3 Forum on Nuclear Energy Safety in Bangkok in 
June 2008. The participants, who had included the Deputy Director General for Nuclear Safety and 
Security, had deliberated on the need for regional cooperation on nuclear safety. The Forum had 
agreed, inter alia, that internationally standardized safety regulations should be put in place and that a 
clear roadmap for the development of nuclear power plants should be adopted among countries 
embarking on nuclear power programmes. 
69. Thailand strongly believed that a robust cooperation scheme on nuclear energy within the 
ASEAN region needed to be forged, particularly among newcomer countries. In developing the 
regional nuclear safety network, ASEAN member countries should seek closer cooperation with the 
Agency and other international and regional bodies to establish a sound legal framework and 
necessary standards, while avoiding unnecessary duplication. The Asian Nuclear Safety Network 
under the aegis of the Agency should be the main authority to oversee and regulate regional nuclear 
safety issues. 
70. The success of any nuclear power programme was linked to the degree of public acceptance. 
Therefore, the dissemination of accurate information about nuclear technology, including nuclear 
safety, was indispensable to mitigate the fear of nuclear power. In Thailand, the Office of Atoms for 
Peace, through its public relations section, regularly conducted various public awareness activities to 
build confidence in nuclear energy safety. Special emphasis was given to providing a good 
background on nuclear science and technology to children and youth. The new generation would play 
an important role in the future direction of national policy on peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
71. Human security should be at the core of a people-centred development agenda. His country 
supported the AgencyÂs efforts to help developing countries attain the Millennium Development Goals 
through the use of nuclear technology. Nuclear applications in the fields of medicine and agriculture 
had long been the chief area of cooperation between Thailand and the Agency.

72. Several health-related programmes had resulted in improved quality of life throughout the 
country. Useful activities included the ongoing work on neonatal screening, radiation protection and 
medical exposure control. He commended the AgencyÂs PACT programme, and its recently 
formalized partnership with the WHO. In November 2007, the Chulabhorn Research Institute of 
Thailand had collaborated with the Agency to host the International Conference on Clinical PET and 
Molecular Nuclear Medicine in Bangkok. The meeting had addressed the underlying challenges of 
establishing PET and cyclotron facilities in developing countries. Thailand wished to continue its 
cooperation with the Agency in that area. 
73. As a leading agricultural producer, Thailand benefited immensely from the use of nuclear 
technology to augment productivity and the safety of its products. In that connection, Thailand 
commended the significant support provided by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques 
in Food and Agriculture through capacity building, training, and research. That fruitful partnership 
should be continued. 
74. Technical cooperation in various fields of nuclear applications constituted an important pillar of 
the AgencyÂs work. Thailand had maintained active cooperation with the Agency in various capacitybuilding 
activities, training activities and fellowships. His country welcomed the recently agreed TCF 
target for 2009Â2011 of US $85 million. The number of requests for support for projects related to 
nuclear energy infrastructure planning had increased in recent years. Thailand hoped that resources 
allocated to technical cooperation activities in the Asia-Pacific region would adequately reflect the fact 
that Asia was currently at the heart of the nuclear renaissance. It was pleased to note that the 
introduction of AIPS had received the required funding. It was important to provide the Agency with 
sufficient, assured, and predictable resources to enable it to respond adequately to current and future 
proliferation challenges. 
75. Thanking the Director General for his initiative in establishing the Commission of Eminent 
Persons to consider the future of the Agency, he said that the report of the Commission would be an 
important contribution in strengthening the AgencyÂs future work. 
76. The Agency was the sole international authority for safeguards and verification. Thailand 
recognized the importance of strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency's 
safeguards system. It supported the AgencyÂs functions related to nuclear security and the physical 
protection of nuclear material and was prepared to ratify the relevant instruments as soon as domestic 
legal requirements were met. 
77. His Government was fully committed to the implementation of the NPT and hoped that the 
outcome of the second session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, 
held in Geneva in May 2008, would help pave the way for further progress on consensus building. 
When assessing the accomplishment of NPT obligations, there was a need to strike a balance between 
non-proliferation, disarmament, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Thailand stood ready to help 
support or facilitate any effort aimed at achieving that common goal. 
78. Thailand recognized that illicit trafficking in nuclear-related materials and components raised 
serious concerns over nuclear terrorism. It strongly supported the implementation of United Nation 
Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) to prevent terrorists and other non-State actors from acquiring 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. In October 2008, Thailand would be 
collaborating with the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in the organization of a regional 
workshop in Bangkok on the implementation of that resolution. 
79. Thailand had been an active proponent of the Bangkok Treaty establishing the Southeast Asia 
Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, which was the first and currently the only nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
Asia. The Bangkok Treaty had been signed by all ten ASEAN member countries. The nuclear

11 


weapon-free zone underpinned the non-proliferation and nuclear safety regime in South-East Asia. In 
light of its essential contribution to security, the draft resolution on the zone had attracted 
overwhelming support at the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly. It was ThailandÂs 
earnest hope that nuclear-weapon States would become parties to the Bangkok Treaty in the near 
future. As the depositary State, Thailand attached great importance to the creation of nuclear-weaponfree 
zones in all regions of the world. It had consistently endorsed resolutions in the First Committee 
of the General Assembly that supported regional nuclear-weapon-free zones and hoped that countries 
in regions without nuclear-weapon-free zones would be able to agree on the establishment of one 
shortly. In that connection, his country welcomed the latest report of the Director General on the 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East which indicated a possible convergence of views 
among Member States in the Middle East on convening a forum on experience of possible relevance to 
the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 

80. Turning to safeguards and verification issues, he expressed support for the international 
communityÂs efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic means. 
While his Government fully supported the inalienable right of every party to the NPT to peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy, it believed that all three pillars of the NPT needed to be equally upheld. Iran should 
cooperate fully with the Agency, especially in the light of the latest report of the Director General on 
the matter. At the same time, all parties concerned should engage in constructive dialogue and refrain 
from confrontation. 
81. Thailand also shared the international communityÂs interest in a peaceful, stable and 
denuclearized Korean Peninsula and noted with concern the regrettable recent decision of the DPRK 
to re-activate its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. He called on the DPRK to allow Agency inspectors 
back into the country to continue their verification work at the earliest opportunity. Diplomatic efforts 
through the six-party talks process and other forums was urgently required to avert further 
deterioration of the situation. 
82. The global nuclear renaissance offered both opportunities and challenges. For newcomer 
countries, enhanced regional cooperation Â in close coordination with the Agency Â on nuclear 
safety issues might prove to be a productive way forward. Thailand reiterated its commitment to 
further advancing that important agenda during its chairmanship of ASEAN. A clear message had to 
be sent that, when it came to nuclear safety, there was no room for compromise or complacency. 
States should inculcate a nuclear safety culture in the minds of present and future generations. Only 
confidence building and proper dialogue could foster the necessary public support for the development 
of nuclear power plants. 
Mr 
Ghisi 
(Italy), 
President, 
resumed 
the 
chair. 


83. Mr DIATTA (Senegal) said that the nuclear energy dilemma had been at the forefront of the 
international communityÂs concerns for the past half-century. There was widespread agreement on the 
value of nuclear energy for all States in areas such as health, agriculture and power generation, inter 
alia. At the same time, the use of nuclear energy entailed certain safety and security risks. 
84. The scientific discoveries that could be used to further the social well-being of humanity 
brought with them responsibility. Fortunately, States were ready to shoulder that responsibility by 
undertaking voluntary commitments to radiological protection, nuclear safety, nuclear waste 
management and rapid notification of nuclear accidents. 
85. However, the sharing of knowledge and know-how was inadequate, given that many countries 
lagged behind in the field of science and technology. African countries, in particular, felt the effect of 
that inequality between States. Nevertheless, they, like all States, had a legitimate desire to use nuclear 
energy to promote their development, as illustrated by the establishment of AFRA. He encouraged the

12 


international community to give greater support to AFRA, which had been strengthened further 
through the Pelindaba Treaty establishing Africa as a nuclear-weapon-free zone, which Treaty Senegal 
had already ratified. 

86. Declining fossil fuel reserves and fluctuating prices heightened the need for alternative energy 
sources. Nuclear energy was an attractive option for electricity generation, seawater desalination, 
agricultural development, medicine and industry. Following the example of other countries, Senegal 
was not excluding the possibility of building research reactors and nuclear power plants on its 
territory. After 48 years of Agency membership, his country had started to prepare the ground for 
nuclear power generation. It aimed to achieve energy self-sufficiency through alternative energy 
sources, including nuclear power, for the well-being of society. 
87. In that connection, Senegal was completing the ratification process for the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological 
Emergency, the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
88. A draft law on radiological protection and nuclear safety had been submitted to Parliament. The 
implementing decree of the law included, inter alia, rules for the administration and operation of the 
competent authority for radiological protection. The decree had been reviewed by the Government, 
pending the promulgation of the law on radiological protection and nuclear safety. 
89. Senegal had engaged in extensive scientific and technical cooperation with the Agency in such 
areas as application of the SIT (which had earned SenegalÂs research institutions reference centre 
status) nutritional research and development for women, and medicine. His Government was deeply 
grateful to the Agency for its contribution to social and health-related development in Senegal and 
stood ready to explore options for even broader cooperation. 
23. 
Examination 
of 
delegatesÂ 
credentials 
(GC(52)/29) 


90. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met earlier in the day to examine the 
credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. Since that meeting 
the Secretariat had received credentials in due form for Armenia and Germany. After discussion, the 
Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft resolution contained in 
paragraph 7 of its report contained in document GC(52)/29, with the reservations and positions 
expressed in the report. 
91. Mr QUEISI (Jordan) said that JordanÂs acceptance of the credentials submitted by the Israeli 
delegation should on no account be understood as covering any occupied Arab territories, but only the 
area within the borders as at 4 June 1967. 
92. Mr ELDIN ELAMIN (Sudan) said that, although Sudan had submitted its credentials to the 
Secretariat, its name had been omitted from the list in document GC(52)/29. 
93. Mr KHALIL (Egypt) said acceptance by Egypt of the report of the General Committee did not 
imply recognition of the occupation by Israel of any of the occupied Arab territories, including 
Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and the Shebaa Farms.

94. Mr BORHANIPOUR (Islamic Republic of Iran), endorsing the views expressed by Jordan and 
Egypt, said that IranÂs acceptance of the General CommitteeÂs report in no way implied its recognition 
of the Israeli regime. 
95. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 7 of document GC(52)/29.

Election 
of 
members 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
(GC(52)/8 
and 
23) 
115. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a procedure 

whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a particular area, no 
secret ballot would be held provided that there was no objection; balloting would take place only for 
those areas where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the 
rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time. If it was agreeable to the Conference, he would proceed 
with the election of members to the Board of Governors in the manner outlined. 

116. It was so decided. 
117. The PRESIDENT drew attention to document GC(52)/8 containing a list of the Agency 
Member States designated to serve on the Board from the end of the current session of the Conference 
until the end of the 53rd (2009) session. He recalled that, under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, he 
had to inform the General Conference of the elective places on the Board that had to be filled. To that 
end, document GC(52)/23 had been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to elect eleven 
members of the Board from the seven categories listed. 
118. Agreement had been reached on the candidates for the vacancies to be filled in all area groups 
with the exception of the Middle East and South Asia, where more than one candidate was listed for 
the one vacancy to be filled. Accordingly, a secret ballot would have to be held in order to elect the 
candidate from that area group. 
119. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Argentina, Cuba and Uruguay to the 
three vacant seats for Latin America. 
120. Argentina, Cuba and Uruguay were duly elected. 
121. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Spain and Turkey to the 
two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
122. Spain and Turkey were duly elected. 
123. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Romania to the one 
vacant seat for Eastern Europe. 
124. Romania was duly elected. 
125. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Burkina Faso and Egypt 
to the two vacant seats for Africa. 
126. Burkina Faso and Egypt were duly elected. 
127. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Malaysia to the one 
vacant seat for South East Asia and the Pacific. 
128. Malaysia was duly elected. 
129. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect New Zealand to the 
floating seat for Africa/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from SEAP to fill.

130. New Zealand was duly elected. 
131. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) requested that the election of the member from the 
Middle East and South Asia group be deferred to enable members of that group to reach agreement on 
a candidate. 
132. The PRESIDENT asked whether there were any objections to that suggestion. 
133. Mr MONAWAR (Afghanistan) said that there was no reason to defer the election of the 
member from the Middle East and South Asia group as there had been sufficient time for 
consultations. 
134. The PRESIDENT said that, unless a motion was proposed under Rule 59 of the Rules of 
Procedure of the General Conference, the Conference should proceed to elect the member from the 
Middle East and South Asia group. 
135. Mr AL-HAMMADI (Qatar), supported by Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), 
endorsed SyriaÂs proposal to defer the election 
136. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), citing Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure, pointed out 
that two delegations had already spoken in favour of his proposal to defer the election. 
137. The PRESIDENT said that, Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure having been invoked, two 
delegates might speak in favour of, and two against the motion. 
138. Mr QUEISI (Jordan), supported by Mr SOLTANIEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), endorsed the 
proposal to defer the debate. 
139. Mr DENIAU (France) requested clarification with respect to the duration of the proposed 
adjournment. 
140. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) requested an adjournment of the debate until 5 p.m. 
141. Mr MONAWAR (Afghanistan) withdrew his objection to the proposed adjournment. 
142. The PRESIDENT said that election of the member from the Middle East and South Asia group 
would resume at 5 p.m. 
143. It was so agreed.

General 
Conference

Chair: 
Honourable 
Ruud 
Lubbers, 


Former 
Prime 
Minister 
of 
the 
Netherlands 


Mr. President, 

In this era of incessant change, Âthe futureÂ, it is said, Âhas a way of arriving unannouncedÂ. 
Organisations, therefore, face a constant challenge to try and discern the trends that are likely to affect 
their future and to map the way ahead. 

It is a tribute to the foresight of the AgencyÂs leadership that it has not waited for the future to descend 
on it. Instead, as the Director General Dr. Mohammed ElBaradei stated, the Agency has pro-actively 
ventured to Âthink big and to think long termÂ across the full range of its mandate. 

That Member States are the ultimate decision makers in matters relating to the AgencyÂs destiny is 
well understood. However, consideration by Member States of an issue of such importance can only 
be enriched by inputs from a variety of stake holders. The Agency has a complex mandate straddling 
issues relating to peace and security as well as development. In addressing the future of the IAEA, our 
deliberations at this yearÂs Scientific Forum greatly benefited from the Director GeneralÂs report 
Â20/20 
Vision 
for 
the 
futureÂ 
and the thoughtful set of wide ranging recommendations made by the 
Commission of Eminent Persons headed by the former Mexican President, Prof. Ernesto Zedillo, in 
the Report ÂReinforcing 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Order 
for 
Peace 
and 
ProsperityÂ. 

Our discussions, structured in four sessions, were fruitful, not only through the excellent presentations 
made by 21 distinguished speakers, but also through the interactions and discussions with the 
Scientific Forum audience as a whole, which consisted of a total of 280 registered participants. Our 
deliberations were technical and academic. It is my honour and pleasure to present the outcome of 
these deliberations. Of necessity, my presentation is selective. I outline themes and issues that have 
recurrently featured and provide you a broad brush picture. 

Mr President, 

These are uncertain times. A ÂstalemateÂ plagues the current nuclear order and needs to be addressed 
by Âsupranational meansÂ. As Senator Sam Nunn eloquently said in his address to the Forum, Âwe are 
in a race between cooperation and catastropheÂ. 

It is acknowledged that different expectations exist and will continue to exist on what the future holds 
in store. However, from our discussions it was evident that the Agency has over half a century of its 
existence assumed recognisable roles along well defined trajectories. 

. 
In certain spheres of activity it is the acknowledged lead actor globally. For example, 
verification of the fulfilment of non-proliferation commitments. 
. 
In certain other areas, for example in assessing nuclear 
energy 
as part of the global energy 
sector, the Agency plays an important role as the 
place in the world where long-term visions, 
strategies, innovation and nuclear planning can be discussed and Â hopefully Â be condensed 
into a shared view of all Member States on the nuclear future. The Agency also assists States in 
developing infrastructural requirements, energy assessments that support decision making. In

such tasks it works alongside other inter-governmental bodies, academic and professional 
institutions, industry groups and NGOs. While safety and security are national responsibilities, 
the development of international safety standards and nuclear security norms based on best 
practices is a key Agency role. 

. 
In yet other areas, such as the entire spectrum of development assistance, the role the Agency 
plays is strategic but modest, making specific targeted contributions in activities where nuclear 
techniques have a comparative advantage. 
Mr. President, 

Let me outline the contours of what participants at the Scientific Forum viewed as the AgencyÂs future 
along these trajectories. It is, of course, entirely possible that there may be drivers in the future that 
could lead to changes in these trajectories. 

It was an unfortunate twist of fate that the first public demonstration of nuclear technology was its 
destructive power. That association of nuclear technology with destructive capabilities has remained 
the predominant concern in the public perception of all things nuclear. Irrespective of the forum in 
which they are pursued, efforts towards nuclear disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation will 
remain crucial to the future of all aspects related to the public acceptance of nuclear technology. The 
perils of the ÂdarkÂ 
side of the nuclear equation are such that the AgencyÂs verification role will always 
remain, in the public's perception, an overwhelming priority. 

As the world economy grows, energy needs are poised to grow faster than supply. New nuclear 
facilities will be constructed, old ones modernized, the amounts of nuclear material, and sensitive 
knowledge will grow and spread, nuclear supply chains and trade will expand. Countries having no 
previous safeguards infrastructure or experience are planning to embark on nuclear power 
programmes. Bottlenecks in nuclear manufacturing and fuel services may appear which in turn could 
trigger construction of new nuclear fuel cycle facilities that could pose new proliferation risks. Threats 
posed by clandestine networks for the supply of nuclear goods and technologies are a concern. Access 
by non-state actors to weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery remains a worry. 
Expanding the effectiveness and efficiency of nuclear safeguards in such circumstances is not only 
important from a technical angle but also from the point of view of its political, economical, industrial 
and social impact. 

Much will depend on what will be the shared safeguards and verification standard applied in 2020. In 
case it would be, as it is widely expected, the combination of a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol, this would imply continuing changes to the verification culture and 
practices including more information-driven verification activities, use of state-of-the-art technologies, 
high caliber staff, outsourcing, etc. Since the AgencyÂs resources are unlikely to increase at the same 
pace as its increasing verification activities, efficiency requirements will also be greater. Transparency 
and cooperation with States and with nuclear vendors embedding safeguards features directly and 
deeply into their facility designs, systems and components, will play important roles. 

Initiatives have been launched to develop policies, concepts, technologies, expertise and infrastructure 
necessary to sustain the international safeguards system as its mission evolves over the next 25 years. 
Meeting successfully new global challenges needs also other innovations related to fourth (IV) 
generation reactor systems and multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. 

Past initiatives for multilateral nuclear cooperation did not result in any tangible results. Proliferation 
concerns were perceived as not serious enough. Economic incentives were seldom strong enough. 
Concerns about assurances of supply were paramount.

National pride also played a role, alongside expectations about the technological and economic spinoffs 
to be derived from nuclear activities. Many of these considerations may still be pertinent. 
However, the result of balancing these considerations today, in the face of a possible multiplication of 
nuclear facilities over the next decades and the possible increase in proliferation risks associated with 
sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, may well produce an environment more conducive to 
multilateral nuclear approaches in the 21st 
century that may help the expansion of nuclear power. 

Mr. President, 

Myriad technical issues of an evolutionary nature will form the Âbread and butterÂ tasks in the 
foreseeable future. On the other hand, it is imperative not to lose sight of the commitment of all of us 
to Âde-demonizeÂ nuclear technology. The genie cannot be put back into the bottle. We need, 
however, to be assured that it is up to no further harm. This can only be done if disarmament and arms 
control return as the focus of the international agenda. It is rightly pointed out that the Agency is not 
the lead agency or forum for nuclear disarmament. However, it must prepare for and be ready to 
respond to the technical needs of verification which will be required to be met as and when the 
political decisions are taken in the appropriate fora. As the Secretary General in his message to the 
fifty-second session of the General Conference indicated, future progress in nuclear disarmament may 
also bring opportunities for the Agency in the area of verification, transparency and irreversibility. 

Mr. President, 

It is estimated that the worldÂs energy needs could be 50 per cent higher in 2030 than they are today. 
There are rising expectations in the area of nuclear power that are gradually leading towards a 
renaissance of nuclear energy, through expanding programmes in ÂmatureÂ countries and through new 
programmes in ÂnewcomerÂ countries alike. As a result, the nuclear landscape in the next decades 
might look fundamentally different from that of today. A second important fact affecting the nuclear 
future is that the perceived or real concerns associated with the disposal of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste remain. To a large extent, public acceptance of the use of nuclear power depends on the 
solutions to this issue. 

The expectations from the Agency are likely to be: 

. 
A continuing demand for support stemming from operating nuclear installations. 
. 
In the short and medium term, requests for more support for ÂnewcomerÂ countries, either 
through providing planning and decision-making guidance or through direct assistance. 
. 
To ensure the sustainable development of nuclear energy, continued Agency support will be 
needed in finding appropriate solutions for the back-end issue, keeping in mind concerns linked 
to scarcity of resources, technical sustainability of the complete global nuclear system and 
public acceptance. 
. 
The Agency will be asked to contribute to innovation that will be key for building the nuclear 
fleet of tomorrow, be it in nuclear power technology, fuel cycle technology or innovations in 
institutional arrangements. 
. 
The Agency should continue to be an active player in the global debate on climate change, 
possibly also in connection with public acceptance campaigns, taking advantage of its role as a 
trusted international organization. 
The envisaged renaissance depends very much on the success of international cooperation and 
approaches, and thus on the Agency, in particular regarding confidence-building, communicating with 
the public and with governments, and in consensus-building through a global discussion. A bright 


GC(52)/OR.7

future of nuclear energy does not only depend on individual countriesÂ policies. It depends on all those 
who want to use its benefits to get it right every time, thus the world needs to do nuclear together. 

A stringent approach to safety and security is necessary to enable this renaissance. Measures to 
advance nuclear safety and security are important and should be achieved in a way which harmonises 
them. 

There is recognition that, while safety requirements are well established, not all safety problems have 
been resolved. In addition, security requirements continue to develop. Care must be taken to ensure 
that this process of continuous improvement results in harmony between safety and security. It is 
important to emphasize that the protection of people and the environment is the ultimate goal and that 
harmonization of safety and security is a means to achieve the end goal, it is not the end goal itself. 

Continuous international cooperation will be required to facilitate improvements to safety and 
security. Numerous challenges remain in harmonizing safety and security, in particular because 
security often involves sensitive information. The Agency has a leading role in this harmonization 
process through the definition of instruments, standards and norms and the provision of services. It 
will require strengthened capabilities including adequate resources to take on this expanded role and to 
continuously improve its standards, guidance and services. 

Mr. President, 

The development scenario is one of pressing, unfulfilled needs. According to a World Bank study 
released a little over a month ago, nearly one out of every four of the worldÂs population live on less 
than $1.25 a day. By 2015 more than a billion people will still be living on less than $1.25 per day. 
Many who have climbed above the $1.25 per day line will remain poor by the standards of rich or 
middle income countries. On the other hand, the UNÂs MDG Task Force has recently identified that 
only 5 countries have reached or exceeded the UNÂs ODA target of 0.7% of their Gross National 
Income in 2007. 

Amidst the vast expanse of unfulfilled needs, the validity, indeed the viability of an organisation 
adopting solely a normative role, while having the capacity to contribute its mite to developmental 
goals is a non sequitur. At the Forum, it was a widely shared belief that targeted assistance in human 
health, food and agriculture, environment and water resources are areas where nuclear technologies 
can make a difference. 

By way of illustration, let me provide a few examples of where Forum participants strongly felt that 
the Agency can and should be doing more, much more, in the future: 

. 
Cancer kills more people every year than AIDS, TB and malaria combined worldwide. More 
than 10 million people are expected to die of cancer in 2020, up from 7.9 million in 2007. More 
than 70% of cancer deaths now occur in low and middle income countries. While combating 
cancer is a multi-dimensional effort, nuclear techniques have a unique role in cancer diagnosis 
and therapy. 
. 
Radiation therapy Â a lifesaving component of treatment for over 50% of cancer patients in 
high income countries Â remains out of reach for millions of cancer patients in the developing 
world. The current shortage of radiotherapy machines in developing countries exceeds 
5000 machines. The Agency has unrivalled experience in the transfer of radiotherapy and 
diagnostic imaging technology and nuclear medicine procedures to developing countries as part 
of its support for the safe, effective and sustained implementation of radiotherapy and nuclear 
medicine services. However, the public health benefit of the AgencyÂs cancer-related activities 
can only be maximized if planned and coordinated within the context of national cancer control 
strategies in partnership with the WHO. In this context, the objective of PACT Â to create a

unified vision and operational framework for all IAEA cancer-related activities so as to achieve 
maximum public health impact in developing Member States Â was recognized as an 
extremely important and timely initiative on the part of the IAEA. 

. 
In his opening address to the General Assembly last week, the UN Secretary General 
Ban Ki-Moon reminded the world that in a single year, rice, the food staple that feeds half of the 
population, more than doubled in price setting off concerns regarding food security. If the target 
set by the UN of 50% more food annually by 2030 is to be met, food production must grow by 
2% per year. Historically, every quantum leap in food production in the past was based on a 
change in agrarian practices along two dimensions, namely a change in cultivation practices 
combined with genetic selection of new crops, varieties and breeds. The Joint FAO-IAEA 
Division is well placed to participate in and contribute to both these endeavours. It can assist in 
transforming cultivation practices by transferring methodologies aimed at making ecosystem 
services visible and valued by policy makers, starting with plant nutrient transformations in soil 
ecosystems, crops and livestock. Although water is a basic human need, nearly one billion 
people in the developing countries do not have access to safe drinking water and more than two 
billion lack basic sanitation facilities. Irrigation, responsible for nearly 40% of world food 
production, uses about 70% of total water withdrawals and increasingly relies upon groundwater 
resources. There are a number of issues associated with the energy-water nexus that will 
challenge both water and energy experts and planners. Water is used in a variety of ways in the 
energy sector. Similarly, energy is a critical requirement in the water sector. Finally, climate 
change and variability are leading to a more intense water-cycle with drastic impacts on the 
geographical distribution and availability of water. 
. 
Isotope and nuclear techniques have demonstrated their utility in understanding water dynamics, 
past climates and in assessing available resources. Isotopes help to rapidly and cost-effectively 
provide scientific information on, and understanding of water resources Â that may otherwise 
not be possible or may require observations over decades. There is also a continuing need for 
the Agency to build sufficiently trained capacity and to help countries use isotopes for their 
national water resource assessment and management efforts. To maximize the effectiveness of 
its work, the Agency needs to enhance partnerships with other UN and international 
programmes and agencies such as the World Bank, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), 
UNDP, WMO and UNESCO. 
Given the overwhelming nature of development needs, the scope for an enhancement of the AgencyÂs 
future role in this area remains vast. However, for this to happen, the provision of operational support 
through enhanced technical cooperation in partnership with other organisations will need to be 
supplemented by giving thought to overcoming factors that have impeded the full potential of nuclear 
technologies being realised. Working towards enhancing acceptability, accessibility and affordability 
of nuclear technologies for development will be the key to success of the Agency as an organisation 
contributing to development. 

Mr. President, 

In their capacity as specialists, the Forum participants did not delve into the financial and 
administrative matters of the Future Role of the IAEA. It was self-evident to all of us, and this is a fact 
I would like to emphasize, that growing expectations vis-Ã -vis the Agency will have to be 
accompanied by a consideration of the need for additional resources. Such resources should not be 
subject to artificial constraints. As President Eisenhower once said, Âthere is no victory at bargain 
basement prices.Â

To sum up, let me reiterate those five items which were the most relevant messages that we heard in 
the course of this Scientific Forum and which are vital from the point of view of the AgencyÂs dual 
mission for development and security: 

1. 
The nuclear landscape is changing. In modern organizations there is no success without a 
strategic framework, where a shared vision is a critical focal point giving shape and direction to 
the organizationÂs future. The world needs the Agency to plan to stay ahead of the curve and 
should provide it with the required mandate, strengthened capabilities and necessary resources. 
2. 
The Agency needs to provide more technical assistance to individual Member States, working 
through the transfer of technology, decision making support, planning tools, capacity and 
knowledge building and R&D coordination. 
3. 
The Agency needs to work towards enhancing acceptability, accessibility and affordability of 
nuclear technologies for development. 
4. 
The Agency needs to make sure that all existing and planned nuclear installations respect safety, 
security and safeguards requirements. 
5. 
The Agency needs to be the 
place in the world where technical visions are shared and Â 
hopefully Â harmonized to build one nuclear future that the world creates jointly. 
Mr. President, 

The path towards the future is a journey and not an end. When looking back at the history of the 
Agency in maybe 10, or 20, or 50 years, the process of discussions on the ÂFuture Role of the IAEAÂ, 
and all actions that we expect to be triggered by these considerations will form a milestone in the 
course adopted by the Agency. That the participants of the Scientific Forum were part of this process 
and hopefully will have contributed to the transition which comes about, is a matter of satisfaction to 
all of us who participated in this venture. We are honoured to have had the opportunity to be part of 
this process. Thank you.

7. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(continued) 
(GC(52)/9) 
1. 
Mr 
TAN 
(Singapore) 
recalled 
that 
2007 
had 
marked 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
founding 
of 
the 
Agency. 
After 
five 
decades 
of 
important 
progress, 
its 
activities 
remained 
vital 
in 
advancing 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
In 
that 
context, 
Singapore 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
initiative 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
face 
in 
future 
years. 
The 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency 
represented 
a 
timely 
exercise 
in 
examining 
ways 
of 
strengthening 
the 
three 
key 
pillars 
of 
nuclear 
safety, 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
nuclear 
verification. 
To 
that 
end, 
Singapore 
extended 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
stood 
ready 
to 
work 
with 
all 
stakeholders. 
2. 
With 
the 
upsurge 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
an 
option 
for 
many 
countries, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
as 
guardian 
of 
the 
peaceful, 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
gained 
renewed 
importance. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2007, 
a 
total 
of 
34 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
had 
been 
under 
construction 
around 
the 
world. 
That 
growth 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was 
mainly 
centred 
in 
Asia, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
regionÂs 
rapid 
economic 
growth 
and 
the 
accompanying 
rise 
in 
energy 
demand. 
3. 
Ensuring 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
remained 
a 
fundamental 
matter 
of 
common 
interest. 
The 
various 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
conventions, 
codes 
of 
conducts, 
safety 
guides 
and 
standards 
served 
as 
building 
blocks 
for 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
Singapore 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
setting 
the 
relevant 
benchmarks 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
through 
the 
various 
Agency 
instruments, 
peer 
reviews, 
assistance 
and 
review 
missions. 
Singapore 
commended 
the 
success 
of 
the 
fourth 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
held 
in 
April 
2008 
and 
in 
which 
Singapore 
had 
participated, 
and 
urged 
Member 
States 
that 
were 
not 
yet 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
join 
that 
important 
convention. 
4. 
Singapore 
also 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
global 
emergency 
preparedness 
through 
new 
and 
revised 
guidelines 
based 
on 
lessons 
learned 
from 
past 
responses. 
Given 
the 
transboundary 
nature 
of 
the 
matter, 
Singapore 
was 
supportive 
of 
a 
proactive 
approach 
in 
building 
bilateral 
and 
regional 
networks 
through 
which 
Member 
States 
could 
share 
their 
emergency 
response 
plans 
and 
work 
towards 
possible 
regional 
approaches 
to 
integrating 
their 
capabilities. 
Singapore 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
successful 
convening 
of 
the 
ConvEx-3 
full-scale 
international 
emergency 
response 
exercise 
in 
July 
2008 
in 
which 
Singapore 
had 
participated. 
The 
exercise 
had 
provided 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
for 
Singapore 
to 
test 
communication 
between 
its 
local 
agencies 
involved 
in 
nuclear/radiological 
emergencies 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre. 
5. 
Singapore 
supported 
greater 
regional 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
because 
such 
efforts 
helped 
build 
public 
confidence 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
In 
South 
East 
Asia, 
ASEAN 
had 
taken 
positive 
steps 
towards 
closer 
nuclear 
safety 
cooperation. 
That 
was 
a 
timely 
development 
as 
more 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
had 
either 
indicated 
an 
interest 
in 
or 
were 
pursuing 
nuclear 
energy 
programmes 
to 
meet 
their 
increasing 
energy 
demands. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
issue 
at 
their 
annual 
meeting 
in 
Singapore 
in 
August 
2007, 
the 
ASEAN 
Energy 
Ministers 
had 
endorsed 
in 
principle 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
safety 
subsector 
network 
to 
discuss 
nuclear 
safety 
issues. 
In 
2008, 
two 
meetings 
to 
discuss 
the 
network 
had 
been 
held 
and 
he 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
involved 
in 
the 
initial 
meeting.

6. 
The 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
must 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
ensuring 
nuclear 
security. 
Global 
security 
challenges 
continued 
to 
dominate 
the 
international 
agenda. 
States 
needed 
to 
be 
vigilant 
in 
protecting 
nuclear 
material 
and 
installations 
from 
potential 
terrorist 
threats 
and 
to 
combat 
those 
threats 
through 
joint 
action. 
Singapore 
remained 
committed 
to 
supporting 
efforts 
to 
combat 
terrorism 
in 
all 
forms 
and 
at 
all 
levels. 
In 
July 
2007, 
it 
had 
had 
the 
honour 
of 
hosting 
the 
pilot 
Agency 
subregional 
workshop 
on 
illicit 
nuclear 
trafficking 
information 
management 
and 
coordination 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
further 
such 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
7. 
Singapore 
was 
committed 
to 
fully 
implementing 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
on 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
by 
stepping 
up 
domestic 
vigilance 
and 
international 
cooperation. 
Also, 
Singapore 
was 
constantly 
reviewing 
its 
export 
controls 
system 
to 
identify 
ways 
to 
improve 
and 
strengthen 
it. 
Since 
January 
2008, 
Singapore 
had 
expanded 
its 
strategic 
goods 
control 
list 
to 
include 
the 
full 
lists 
of 
the 
four 
multilateral 
export 
control 
regimes: 
the 
NSG, 
the 
Wassenaar 
Arrangement, 
the 
Australia 
Group, 
and 
the 
Missile 
Technology 
Control 
Regime. 
8. 
The 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
had 
to 
be 
exercised 
alongside 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
non-proliferation 
obligations. 
Singapore 
firmly 
believed 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
should 
remain 
capable 
of 
responding 
credibly 
and 
effectively 
to 
new 
challenges 
within 
its 
mandate. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
regime 
should 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
providing 
safeguards 
assurances. 
The 
universalization 
of 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
were 
crucial 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
Singapore 
urged 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
undertake 
such 
commitments 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
In 
March 
2008, 
Singapore 
had 
concluded 
the 
modified 
SQP 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
9. 
Several 
cases 
of 
proliferation 
concern 
had 
come 
before 
the 
Agency 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
DPRK 
continued 
to 
pose 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Singapore 
remained 
deeply 
concerned 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
chosen 
to 
remain 
outside 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system, 
thereby 
depriving 
the 
international 
community 
of 
the 
necessary 
assurances 
about 
its 
nuclear 
material 
inventory 
and 
activities. 
Singapore 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
NPT, 
resume 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
accept 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
dismantle 
any 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent 
and 
verifiable 
manner. 
10. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
was 
another 
such 
issue. 
Singapore 
took 
note 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
recent 
report 
on 
Iran, 
contained 
in 
document 
GOV/2008/38, 
and 
urged 
Iran 
to 
implement 
all 
appropriate 
measures 
to 
dispel 
every 
doubt 
and 
to 
build 
confidence 
in 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date. 
His 
delegation 
remained 
hopeful 
that 
diplomatic 
efforts 
could 
lead 
to 
a 
peaceful 
and 
sustainable 
long 
term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue. 
11. 
On 
the 
positive 
side, 
Singapore 
was 
heartened 
by 
the 
full 
cooperation 
that 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
had 
extended 
to 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
led 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recent 
decision 
to 
continue 
to 
implement 
safeguards 
in 
that 
Member 
State 
as 
a 
routine 
manner. 
12. 
Beyond 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
facilitating 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
useful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
have 
a 
meaningful 
impact 
on 
the 
socio-economic 
growth 
of 
developing 
countries 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
Singapore 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
enhance 
its 
work 
to 
help 
developing 
countries, 
especially 
through 
technical 
cooperation 
aimed 
at 
capacity 
building, 
to 
meet 
the 
increasing 
demands 
for 
nuclear 
power. 
Fortunately, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
expanded 
considerably 
in 
recent 
years, 
in 
both 
the 
scope 
and 
number 
of 
its 
activities. 
The 
Agency 
was 
to 
be 
commended 
for 
establishing 
partnerships 
with 
international 
and 
regional 
development 
organizations 
to 
build 
greater 
synergies. 
Singapore 
remained 
firmly 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the

AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
cooperation 
through 
its 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
outreach 
efforts 
to 
assist 
other 
developing 
countries. 


13. 
Keenly 
aware 
that 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
effective 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
would 
require 
adequate, 
steady 
and 
sustainable 
funding, 
Singapore 
would 
pledge 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
2009 
TCF 
target. 
Also, 
Singapore 
reiterated 
its 
continued 
support 
for 
regional 
activities 
undertaken 
under 
the 
RCA. 
14. 
The 
common 
goal 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
by 
providing 
it 
with 
the 
necessary 
support 
and 
tools 
that 
it 
required 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
mandate. 
Singapore 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
colleagues 
on 
the 
excellent 
and 
professional 
work 
they 
had 
done 
within 
the 
constraints 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
limited 
resources. 
15. 
Mr 
TOUKAN 
(Jordan) 
said 
that 
Jordan, 
like 
other 
developing 
countries, 
was 
faced 
with 
real 
difficulties 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
obtain 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
to 
meet 
the 
countryÂs 
demand 
for 
electricity, 
which 
was 
expected 
to 
grow 
by 
more 
than 
6% 
annually. 
With 
limited 
conventional 
energy 
resources, 
Jordan 
imported 
95% 
of 
its 
energy 
needs, 
equivalent 
to 
52% 
of 
its 
GDP, 
from 
neighbouring 
countries. 
A 
further 
challenge 
was 
the 
shortage 
of 
water 
resources, 
which 
was 
compounded 
by 
a 
decline 
in 
rainfall 
and 
in 
the 
quality 
of 
drinking 
water. 
Jordan 
therefore 
urged 
the 
Agency 
and 
donor 
countries 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
in 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
generate 
electricity 
and 
for 
water 
desalination. 
16. 
Jordan 
had 
enacted 
law 
No. 
42 
of 
2007, 
as 
amended 
in 
2008, 
concerning 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
attached 
to 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister. 
Responsibility 
for 
its 
management 
and 
supervision 
was 
assigned 
to 
a 
Board 
of 
Commissioners, 
comprising 
a 
chairman 
and 
four 
members. 
Its 
main 
goals 
were 
the 
transfer 
and 
incorporation 
of 
nuclear 
peaceful 
technology 
with 
a 
view 
to 
building 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
Jordan 
was 
currently 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
States 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
feasibility 
study 
concerning 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
for 
electricity 
generation 
and 
seawater 
desalination. 
Negotiations 
had 
taken 
place 
on 
nuclear 
cooperation 
agreements 
with 
States 
possessing 
expertise 
in 
that 
area, 
including 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
Canada, 
France, 
China, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
Cooperation 
agreements 
had 
already 
been 
signed 
with 
the 
Governments 
of 
France 
and 
China, 
and 
memoranda 
of 
understanding 
had 
been 
signed 
with 
the 
Governments 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
Canada 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom. 
Also, 
the 
Jordanian 
Government 
had 
set 
up 
a 
company 
for 
the 
exploitation 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
deposits 
of 
natural 
uranium 
ore 
and 
phosphate 
ore. 
17. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
training 
human 
resources 
to 
work 
in 
nuclear 
energy 
related 
areas. 
Jordan 
was 
looking 
into 
the 
possibility 
of 
building 
a 
nuclear 
research 
reactor 
with 
a 
capacity 
of 
1Â5 
MW. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
had 
drawn 
up 
a 
comprehensive 
national 
plan 
providing 
for 
bachelorÂs 
degrees 
in 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 
masterÂs 
degrees 
in 
nuclear 
and 
medical 
physics 
in 
the 
Jordan 
University 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology, 
courses 
concerning 
radiation 
protection 
and 
radiation 
technology 
in 
a 
number 
of 
Jordanian 
universities, 
and 
courses 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
their 
applications 
in 
the 
countryÂs 
various 
higher 
education 
establishments. 
18. 
The 
assistance 
provided 
to 
Jordan 
under 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
national, 
regional 
and 
interregional 
projects 
had 
led 
to 
tangible 
development 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
projects 
was 
the 
SESAME 
Project, 
which 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
UNESCO. 
Jordan 
was 
currently 
cooperating 
with 
them 
on 
the 
building 
of 
human 
capabilities 
in 
accelerator 
physics 
and 
radiation 
applications 
of 
synchrotron 
light. 
Construction 
work 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
the 
facility 
would 
be 
officially 
opened 
on 
3 
November 
2008.

19. 
Jordan 
had 
announced 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
its 
intention 
to 
pay 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
2009 
in 
full. 
20. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
material 
and 
to 
the 
regulations 
governing 
the 
handling 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
the 
movement 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
The 
Government 
had 
enacted 
law 
No. 
43 
of 
2007 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
under 
which 
an 
independent 
authority 
for 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
activities 
attached 
to 
the 
office 
of 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
been 
established. 
Its 
purpose 
was 
to 
supervise 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
to 
draw 
up 
regulations 
and 
instructions 
regarding 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regulations 
and 
guidelines. 
Work 
would 
be 
done 
on 
developing 
and 
maintaining 
a 
national 
register 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
Jordan 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
that 
field 
and 
would 
assist 
it, 
in 
coordination 
with 
Member 
States, 
in 
application 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and 
its 
supplementary 
Guidance. 
21. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
were 
a 
vital 
component 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Jordan 
had 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
thereto 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
constituted 
a 
major 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and, 
in 
particular, 
to 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
region 
was 
still 
unable 
to 
implement 
international 
resolutions 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ. 
To 
achieve 
that 
goal, 
Israel 
must 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
thereby 
ensuring 
its 
universality 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
States 
of 
the 
region 
could 
then 
concentrate 
on 
socio-economic 
development 
instead 
of 
investing 
their 
resources 
in 
an 
arms 
race, 
which 
only 
escalated 
tension 
and 
increased 
distrust. 
22. 
Mr 
TZOTCHEV 
(Bulgaria), 
said 
his 
country 
pursued 
a 
consistent 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
policy. 
As 
a 
State 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
CTBT, 
Bulgaria 
encouraged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
both 
treaties. 
The 
NPT 
provided 
a 
solid 
foundation 
for 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
played 
Â 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
Â 
a 
very 
important 
role 
in 
its 
implementation. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
must 
be 
strengthened 
further, 
including 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
23. 
His 
delegation 
hoped 
that 
a 
diplomatic 
solution 
would 
be 
found 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
The 
DPRKÂs 
decision 
to 
deny 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspectors 
access 
to 
the 
reprocessing 
plant 
in 
Yongbyon 
and 
to 
remove 
the 
Agency 
seals 
and 
surveillance 
equipment 
was 
regrettable. 
However, 
the 
process 
of 
negotiation 
should 
continue. 
His 
Government 
would 
support 
all 
steps 
leading 
to 
a 
Korean 
Peninsula 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
24. 
The 
worldÂs 
complex 
and 
rapidly 
changing 
security 
environment 
brought 
with 
it 
new 
transboundary 
challenges, 
including 
the 
risk 
of 
terrorists 
acquiring 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
technologies. 
The 
international 
communityÂs 
response 
to 
that 
complex 
problem 
must 
be 
collective 
and 
multifaceted. 
The 
existing 
system 
of 
treaties 
and 
initiatives 
provided 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
mechanisms 
that 
made 
such 
a 
response 
possible. 
25. 
Bulgaria 
had 
an 
ambitious 
nuclear 
programme 
in 
place, 
with 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
in 
operation, 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
WWER-440 
type 
reactor 
units 
forthcoming, 
and 
plans 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
well 
advanced. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
towards 
constructing 
a 
dry 
storage 
facility 
for 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
in 
preparation 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
repository 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste. 
Also, 
Bulgaria 
had 
over 
2000 
industrial, 
medical 
and 
scientific 
facilities 
using 
sources 
of 
ionizing 
radiation. 
26. 
Bulgaria, 
which 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
GNEP, 
believed 
that 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
expand 
nuclear 
energy 
worldwide. 
It 
also 
believed 
that 
the 
development 
and 
deployment 
of 
advanced 
fuel 
cycle

technologies, 
protection 
of 
the 
environment 
and 
reduction 
of 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
were 
achievable 
goals 
under 
that 
initiative. 


27. 
Another 
important 
initiative 
for 
the 
progress 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
INPRO, 
which 
helped 
Member 
States 
build 
competence 
in 
developing 
innovative 
nuclear 
energy 
systems. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
INPRO, 
Bulgaria 
was 
convinced 
that 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the 
nuclear 
sector. 
28. 
Modernization 
of 
Units 
5 
and 
6 
of 
the 
BulgariaÂs 
Kozloduy 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
completed 
according 
to 
schedule 
in 
2007. 
The 
programme 
had 
been 
the 
first 
and 
to 
date 
the 
only 
one 
to 
implement 
all 
the 
recommendations 
for 
improving 
WWER-1000 
units. 
To 
ensure 
the 
transparency 
of 
the 
process 
and 
to 
benefit 
from 
independent 
expertise, 
his 
Government 
had 
invited 
an 
Agency 
mission 
Â 
to 
be 
conducted 
in 
November 
2008 
Â 
to 
assist 
Bulgarian 
experts 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
results. 
29. 
His 
delegation 
shared 
the 
view 
expressed 
in 
the 
Annual 
Report 
that 
the 
rising 
expectations 
for 
nuclear 
power 
were 
based 
on 
growing 
energy 
demand, 
concern 
over 
national 
energy 
supply 
security, 
the 
increasing 
price 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
global 
environmental 
concerns. 
To 
meet 
those 
expectations, 
Member 
States 
must 
recognize 
that 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
not 
feasible 
without 
meeting 
internationally 
agreed 
safety 
levels, 
applying 
appropriate 
technology 
and 
ensuring 
trained 
personnel. 
In 
that 
regard, 
his 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
their 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
and 
enhance 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
efforts 
to 
facilitate 
international 
collaboration 
on 
the 
matter. 
He 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
supporting 
national 
and 
international 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
publication 
of 
new 
safety 
guidelines 
and 
standards 
and 
the 
use 
of 
safety 
services 
in 
support 
of 
the 
wider 
application 
of 
those 
standards 
should 
be 
encouraged. 
30. 
An 
agreement 
had 
been 
signed 
between 
the 
Bulgarian 
National 
Electricity 
Company 
and 
the 
Russian 
Atomstroyexport 
company 
in 
2006 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
new 
Belene 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
The 
Bulgarian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agency 
had 
now 
approved 
the 
site 
and 
had 
issued 
permission 
for 
designing 
a 
nuclear 
facility. 
Once 
work 
on 
the 
technical 
design 
safety 
assessment, 
safety 
analysis 
report 
and 
a 
probabilistic 
safety 
assessment 
of 
the 
new 
plant 
had 
been 
completed, 
his 
Government 
would 
be 
looking 
to 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
Agency 
for 
support 
and 
assistance. 
31. 
Another 
important 
issue 
was 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Under 
BulgariaÂs 
strategy 
for 
spent 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
adopted 
in 
2004, 
it 
planned 
to 
build 
a 
national 
repository 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
by 
2015. 
The 
repository 
would 
be 
a 
multibarrier 
near-surface 
facility, 
designed 
for 
the 
radioactive 
waste 
generated 
by 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
nuclear 
applications. 
32. 
In 
2008, 
all 
the 
spent 
fuel 
from 
the 
Bulgarian 
research 
reactor 
had 
been 
repatriated. 
Those 
activities 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Russian 
Research 
Reactor 
Fuel 
Return 
programme, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
Agency. 
33. 
Technical 
cooperation 
remained 
an 
essential 
tool 
in 
contributing 
to 
sustainable 
social 
and 
economic 
development 
in 
Member 
States. 
His 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
high 
rate 
of 
attainment 
(almost 
96%) 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
in 
2007, 
the 
first 
year 
of 
the 
current 
biennium. 
In 
2008, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
European 
Regional 
Profile 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
The 
document 
would 
be 
used 
as 
a 
planning 
tool 
for 
the 
development 
of 
regional 
programming 
for 
2009-2013 
in 
four 
strategic 
areas, 
namely 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
nuclear 
energy, 
human 
health, 
and 
isotope 
and 
radiation 
technology 
applications. 
The 
Profile 
was 
helping 
to 
shift 
the 
balance 
from 
national 
to 
regional 
programmes, 
as 
illustrated 
by 
the 
new 
project 
concepts 
for 
the 
2009 
Â 
2011 
cycle. 
In 
that 
connection,

he 
informed 
the 
Conference 
that 
Bulgaria 
had 
officially 
confirmed 
its 
voluntary 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
2009. 


34. 
Mr 
EL-KHOURY 
(Lebanon) 
said 
the 
Agency 
was 
playing 
an 
important 
role 
in 
meeting 
contemporary 
challenges 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
energy, 
health, 
food 
security, 
water 
resources, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
climate 
change, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
slogan 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ, 
to 
which 
might 
be 
added 
Âatoms 
for 
comprehensive 
social 
securityÂ. 
35. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
Arab 
States, 
including 
Lebanon, 
were 
endeavouring 
to 
establish 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
repeatedly 
urged 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
nuclear 
weapons 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
fact 
that 
such 
weapons 
existed 
was 
no 
longer 
denied 
even 
by 
Israeli 
decision-makers, 
but 
the 
intransigence 
of 
successive 
Israeli 
Governments 
prevented 
any 
progress 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
in 
the 
peace 
process. 
All 
initiatives 
had 
failed 
and 
the 
vicious 
circle 
was 
compounded 
by 
double 
standards 
and 
the 
interpretation 
of 
international 
law 
in 
different 
ways 
according 
to 
the 
temporal 
and 
geographical 
circumstances. 
IsraelÂs 
intransigence 
was 
a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
had 
stated 
that 
the 
need 
for 
the 
NPT 
to 
become 
universal 
could 
not 
be 
stressed 
enough. 
36. 
Lebanon 
had 
been 
suffering 
for 
decades 
from 
the 
consequences 
of 
IsraelÂs 
aggressive 
policies. 
The 
impact 
of 
the 
most 
recent 
attack 
in 
July 
2006 
was 
still 
threatening 
civil 
peace. 
Thousands 
of 
cluster 
bombs 
were 
strewn 
around 
an 
area 
of 
40 
million 
square 
metres 
and 
Israel 
refused 
to 
provide 
maps 
of 
their 
whereabouts. 
As 
a 
result, 
14 
Lebanese 
nationals 
had 
been 
killed 
and 
38 
wounded, 
according 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
Mine 
Action 
Coordination 
Centre. 
Moreover, 
Israel 
had 
still 
failed 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1701 
(2006). 
It 
continued 
to 
occupy 
territory 
in 
southern 
Lebanon 
and 
violated 
Lebanese 
airspace 
on 
a 
daily 
basis. 
37. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
programme 
with 
Lebanon 
included 
projects 
aimed 
at 
training 
human 
resources, 
developing 
the 
scientific 
and 
technological 
capabilities 
of 
Lebanese 
institutions 
engaged 
in 
using 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
and 
assisting 
supervisory 
bodies 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
ionizing 
radiation. 
More 
than 
200 
technicians 
and 
scientists 
had 
recently 
received 
training 
in 
radiation 
monitoring, 
in 
the 
use 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
in 
medicine, 
industry, 
the 
environment 
and 
materials 
science, 
also 
in 
the 
application 
of 
appropriate 
legislation 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
public 
and 
private 
sectors, 
universities 
and 
higher 
education 
establishments. 
He 
commended 
in 
particular 
the 
role 
of 
ARASIA 
in 
radiation 
protection 
and 
radiation 
physics. 
38. 
Lebanon 
had 
also 
received 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
strengthening 
nuclear 
security 
and 
had 
just 
established 
the 
first 
border 
post 
for 
radiation 
monitoring 
at 
MasnaÂa. 
That 
programme 
was 
also 
being 
supported 
by 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
and 
would 
eventually 
cover 
all 
air, 
sea 
and 
land 
border 
crossings 
in 
Lebanon. 
39. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
pursuit 
of 
its 
mandate 
needed 
to 
be 
reviewed 
on 
a 
regular 
basis, 
and 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
provided 
valuable 
guidelines 
for 
the 
coming 
decades. 
40. 
Mr 
QUIMBAYA 
MORALES 
(Colombia) 
said 
that 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
were 
fundamental 
principles 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
foreign 
policy. 
Those 
important 
issues 
should 
be 
addressed 
multilaterally 
with 
full 
respect 
for 
the 
rights 
and 
obligations 
of 
States 
and 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
entire 
international 
community. 
Colombia 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
was 
part 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
NWFZ, 
complied 
with 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
supported 
multilateral 
initiatives 
to 
free 
the 
world 
from 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
In 
addition, 
as 
proof 
of 
its 
transparent 
policy 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear

energy 
and 
to 
contribute 
to 
Agency 
verification 
and 
international 
security, 
Colombia 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
May 
2005. 


41. 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
NPTÂs 
collective 
security 
system, 
based 
as 
it 
was 
on 
disarmament, 
non-
proliferation 
and 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
was 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
As 
a 
party 
to 
that 
instrument, 
Colombia 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
prevent 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
so-called 
Ânuclear 
clubÂ 
and 
to 
control 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
proliferation. 
For 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
system 
to 
be 
effective, 
all 
States 
needed 
to 
make 
a 
commitment 
to 
it. 
Colombia 
therefore 
called 
for 
renewed 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT 
with 
a 
view 
to 
making 
it 
both 
efficient 
and 
universal. 
42. 
Colombia, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Agency 
since 
1960, 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
and 
supported 
its 
statutory 
functions, 
namely 
verification, 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
Those 
competencies 
conferred 
on 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
terrible 
effects 
of 
its 
non-peaceful 
application, 
had 
ensured 
an 
ever-increasing 
membership 
and 
had 
made 
the 
Agency 
an 
indispensable 
international 
forum 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
resources 
to 
improve 
lives. 
Colombia 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contribution 
to 
meeting 
basic 
needs 
by 
promoting 
training, 
knowledge 
transfer 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
for 
development. 
The 
enormous 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
areas 
fundamental 
for 
development, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
transfer 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
transparency 
of 
Member 
StatesÂ 
nuclear 
programmes, 
and 
its 
activities 
to 
develop 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
culture 
would 
benefit 
generations 
to 
come. 
43. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
FAO 
decision 
to 
extend 
its 
cooperation 
arrangement 
with 
the 
Agency 
until 
the 
end 
of 
2009, 
and 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
deploy 
its 
best 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
continuity 
of 
FAO 
support 
to 
the 
Joint 
FAO/IAEA 
Division 
of 
Nuclear 
Techniques 
in 
Food 
and 
Agriculture, 
given 
the 
huge 
benefits 
it 
brought 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sectors 
of 
the 
least 
developed 
countries. 
44. 
He 
drew 
special 
attention 
to 
PACT 
and 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
work 
implemented 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
various 
fields 
to 
improve 
the 
availability 
of 
trained 
human 
resources. 
It 
was, 
however, 
worrying 
that 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
did 
not 
have 
assured, 
predictable 
and 
sufficient 
funding. 
Work 
should 
continue 
on 
mobilizing 
resources 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
to 
help 
achieve 
sustainable 
development 
goals. 
Colombia, 
which 
had 
benefited 
from 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
many 
areas, 
supported 
the 
programme 
through 
its 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF, 
and 
by 
paying 
its 
NPCs 
on 
time 
and 
participating 
in 
cost 
sharing. 
45. 
As 
regards 
the 
2007Â2008 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle, 
he 
highlighted 
two 
national 
projects 
related 
to 
determining 
optimal 
techniques 
in 
support 
of 
humanitarian 
demining 
activities 
and 
to 
the 
use 
and 
safety 
of 
the 
nuclear 
research 
reactor. 
Adapting 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
support 
of 
humanitarian 
demining 
was 
vitally 
important 
and 
the 
related 
project 
was 
consistent 
with 
ColombiaÂs 
aims 
in 
the 
field 
of 
safety. 
46. 
Colombia 
appreciated 
the 
fast 
response 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security 
to 
its 
request 
for 
cooperation 
in 
capacity 
building 
and 
acquiring 
equipment 
and 
technology 
for 
the 
detection 
and 
management 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
During 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2008, 
training 
activities 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
Colombia 
and 
technology 
and 
knowledge 
had 
been 
transferred, 
enabling 
33 
illegal 
radioactive 
sources 
to 
be 
seized, 
thus 
combating 
a 
crime 
that 
had 
been 
previously 
unknown 
in 
the 
country. 
47. 
Expressing 
his 
countryÂs 
concern 
over 
the 
existence 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
networks 
in 
radioactive 
material, 
equipment 
and 
components, 
he 
underscored 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continued 
work, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
all 
Member 
States, 
to 
uncover 
the 
structure 
and 
membership 
of 
such 
networks.

48. 
At 
the 
regional 
level, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
successes 
achieved 
during 
the 
24 
years 
of 
the 
existence 
of 
ARCAL, 
which 
had 
contributed 
to 
promoting 
and 
strengthening 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries. 
49. 
Colombia 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
resulting 
in 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Commission 
of 
Eminent 
Persons 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
Agency 
(GOV/52/INF/4). 
Noting 
that 
the 
report 
set 
down 
the 
vision 
of 
its 
authors 
and 
was 
not 
binding 
in 
nature, 
he 
said 
any 
mechanism 
to 
review 
or 
amend 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
legal 
instruments 
would 
require 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
Member 
States. 
50. 
Regarding 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
work 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT, 
he 
affirmed 
that, 
as 
a 
multilateral 
organization 
and 
by 
virtue 
of 
its 
statutory 
mandate, 
the 
Agency 
was 
competent 
to 
fulfil 
that 
task. 
51. 
Proliferation 
and 
terrorism 
threats 
must 
be 
addressed 
jointly 
at 
all 
levels. 
An 
appropriate 
collective 
security 
system 
would 
have 
to 
be 
based 
not 
only 
on 
full 
respect 
for 
the 
rights 
of 
States 
and 
their 
legal 
equality, 
but 
would 
also 
have 
to 
take 
into 
consideration 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
developing 
world. 
That, 
together 
with 
a 
firm 
commitment 
to 
disarmament, 
would 
help 
to 
build 
a 
future 
where 
the 
nuclear 
threat 
did 
not 
exist 
and 
make 
the 
legitimate 
aspiration 
for 
development 
shared 
by 
most 
countries 
in 
the 
world 
a 
reality. 
52. 
Mr 
KIRAKOSSIAN 
(Armenia) 
said 
that, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
current 
nuclear 
renaissance, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
had 
become 
more 
important 
and 
its 
mandate 
had 
to 
be 
strengthened. 
53. 
In 
2007, 
Armenia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
47 
countries 
for 
which 
the 
broader 
safeguards 
conclusion 
had 
been 
drawn. 
Also, 
it 
had 
submitted 
a 
national 
report 
under 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
which 
had 
elicited 
valuable 
recommendations. 
As 
part 
of 
ArmeniaÂs 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency, 
every 
year 
it 
accepted 
up 
to 
30 
missions 
to 
verify 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
its 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
including 
its 
seismic 
and 
operational 
safety. 
An 
ISSAS 
mission 
was 
planned 
for 
October 
2008 
and 
an 
IPSART 
mission 
for 
March 
and 
April 
2009. 
The 
recommendations 
of 
the 
two 
missions 
would 
be 
incorporated 
in 
future 
measures 
aimed 
at 
safety 
upgrades 
of 
the 
Armenia 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
at 
Metsamor. 
54. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
six 
national 
projects 
involving 
20 
governmental 
and 
non-governmental 
organizations 
were 
being 
implemented. 
Armenia 
had 
participated 
in 
30 
regional 
projects 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
national 
projects 
and 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
assistance. 
55. 
Since 
the 
51st 
General 
Conference, 
Armenia 
had 
taken 
significant 
steps 
towards 
improving 
the 
safety 
of 
its 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
Dry 
storage 
capacity 
for 
nuclear 
waste 
had 
been 
enlarged 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
French 
company 
AREVA; 
12 
additional 
modules 
had 
been 
constructed 
to 
help 
deal 
with 
the 
waste 
management 
problem 
for 
another 
35 
to 
40 
years. 
Recently 
a 
new 
educational 
centre 
had 
been 
constructed 
at 
the 
Armenia 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
to 
serve 
as 
a 
training 
facility 
for 
plant 
personnel. 
Several 
safety 
improvement 
measures 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
2007 
and 
2008 
and 
others 
were 
to 
be 
performed 
during 
outage 
in 
2008. 
The 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
allocated 
US 
$1 
million 
for 
that 
purpose 
in 
2007 
and 
$600 
000 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2008. 
The 
plan 
for 
safety 
upgrading 
of 
the 
plant, 
which 
had 
been 
revised 
in 
2005, 
would 
be 
fully 
implemented 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2009, 
by 
which 
time 
an 
additional 
$3 
million 
would 
have 
been 
spent. 
A 
further 
safety 
upgrade 
stage 
had 
been 
elaborated 
for 
the 
years 
2009Â2016. 
The 
Government 
had 
taken 
the 
decision 
to 
decommission 
the 
existing 
unit 
in 
2016 
and 
had 
already 
approved 
a 
preliminary 
timetable 
and 
budget 
for 
that 
purpose. 
56. 
Turning 
to 
developments 
in 
the 
legislative 
field, 
he 
said 
that 
ArmeniaÂs 
law 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
revised 
in 
2005, 
needed 
to 
be 
amended, 
especially 
now 
that 
Armenia 
had 
serious

plans 
to 
construct 
a 
new 
unit 
to 
replace 
the 
operational 
one 
after 
its 
closure. 
The 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
make 
urgent 
amendments 
to 
the 
existing 
law 
as 
an 
interim 
measure 
before 
engaging 
in 
the 
lengthy 
process 
of 
adopting 
a 
new 
one. 


57. 
Since 
December 
2005, 
yearly 
meetings 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
donor 
countries 
had 
been 
held 
dedicated 
to 
the 
safety 
upgrading 
of 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
In 
2008, 
the 
EBRD 
had 
announced 
its 
intention 
to 
allocate 
Â100 
000 
for 
a 
feasibility 
study 
and 
for 
decommissioning. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
reported 
that 
it 
was 
going 
to 
spend 
$2.8 
million, 
mainly 
for 
the 
development 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
storage, 
and 
that 
in 
the 
future 
it 
would 
concentrate 
on 
a 
project 
related 
to 
security 
issues. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
had 
announced 
two 
additional 
projects 
to 
be 
implemented, 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
had 
said 
that 
it 
would 
focus 
on 
decommissioning 
projects. 
The 
Russian 
Federation 
had 
recently 
offered 
$10 
million 
for 
several 
projects 
to 
cover 
various 
aspects 
of 
safety 
upgrading, 
including 
technical 
aspects, 
general 
examination, 
equipment 
and 
training 
of 
personnel. 
58. 
The 
Government 
of 
Armenia 
had 
decided 
to 
join 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
Governments 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
International 
Uranium 
Enrichment 
Centre 
in 
Angarsk. 
He 
thanked 
all 
donor 
countries 
as 
well 
as 
other 
partner 
countries 
for 
their 
continuous 
assistance 
and 
experience 
sharing. 
59. 
He 
emphasized 
his 
countryÂs 
interest 
in 
INPRO 
projects, 
especially 
those 
concerning 
countries 
with 
a 
small 
grid 
energy 
supply. 
Armenia 
was 
actively 
participating 
in 
a 
collaborative 
project 
on 
implementation 
issues 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
smaller 
countries 
and 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
attend 
a 
GNEP 
conference 
in 
Paris. 
60. 
There 
was 
no 
doubt 
that 
solidarity 
in 
combating 
terrorism 
was 
now 
of 
major 
importance 
for 
the 
international 
community 
in 
general 
and 
for 
the 
nuclear 
community 
in 
particular. 
Armenia, 
like 
many 
other 
countries, 
had 
created 
an 
emergency 
management 
centre. 
In 
July 
2008, 
it 
had 
organized 
a 
seminar 
and 
exercise 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
the 
relevant 
agencies, 
regional 
authorities, 
regional 
rescue 
offices 
and 
personnel 
from 
the 
Armenia 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
responsible 
for 
physical 
protection. 
Another 
exercise 
was 
planned 
for 
December 
2008. 
To 
further 
develop 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
an 
INSSP 
had 
been 
elaborated 
together 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security 
touching 
on 
various 
aspects 
of 
physical 
protection, 
including 
improvement 
of 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework, 
prevention, 
detection, 
response 
and 
human 
resource 
development. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
INSSP, 
a 
project 
for 
physical 
protection 
system 
upgrades 
at 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
signed 
with 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
was 
to 
provide 
Â1 
580 
000 
for 
that 
project. 
Armenia 
had 
recently 
joined 
the 
Nuclear 
Smuggling 
Outreach 
Initiative, 
a 
United 
States 
effort 
to 
eliminate 
nuclear 
smuggling 
through 
activities 
in 
the 
four 
major 
fields 
of 
prevention, 
detection, 
response 
and 
fighting 
against 
corruption. 
Armenia, 
the 
seventh 
country 
to 
have 
joined 
the 
Initiative, 
appealed 
to 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
follow 
suit. 
It 
was 
an 
important 
part 
of 
international 
collaboration 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
61. 
Such 
initiatives 
were 
inalienable 
parts 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
would 
facilitate 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
to 
be 
held 
in 
2010. 
In 
addition, 
Armenia 
encouraged 
States 
to 
ratify 
the 
CTBT, 
which 
was 
another 
important 
international 
instrument 
aimed 
at 
the 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
62. 
Mr 
WIN 
(Myanmar) 
said 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
playing 
an 
essential 
role 
in 
providing 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
peaceful, 
safe 
and 
secure 
applications 
of 
atomic 
energy 
in 
various 
fields. 
Through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
a 
contribution 
to 
global 
efforts 
to 
combat 
poverty, 
hunger 
and 
disease, 
and 
was 
also 
supporting 
environmental 
sustainability 
and 
the 
health 
of 
mothers 
and 
children. 
Its 
role 
in 
promoting 
development 
programmes 
around 
the

world 
for 
the 
betterment 
of 
humankind 
using 
nuclear 
technologies 
was 
unique 
and 
should 
be 
expanded. 


63. 
Myanmar 
had 
eight 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
for 
the 
year 
2007Â2008, 
involving 
its 
Ministries 
of 
Health, 
Education, 
Livestock 
and 
Fisheries, 
Agriculture 
and 
Irrigation, 
and 
Science 
and 
Technology. 
The 
total 
allocation 
for 
Myanmar 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle 
was 
$1.3 
million. 
Since 
2000, 
the 
assistance 
that 
had 
been 
received 
by 
Myanmar 
under 
the 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
totalled 
$5.23 
million. 
The 
largest 
shares 
of 
assistance 
had 
been 
provided 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiation 
health 
and 
medicine 
(26%), 
radiation 
applications 
in 
food 
and 
agriculture 
(19%), 
nuclear 
radiation 
safety 
and 
security 
(17%), 
general 
atomic 
energy 
development 
(14%) 
and 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 
technology 
(11%). 
64. 
His 
delegation 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
providing 
equipment, 
expertise 
and 
training 
through 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Such 
assistance 
had 
contributed 
to 
MyanmarÂs 
national 
development 
efforts 
in 
many 
areas, 
especially 
in 
health, 
agriculture, 
food, 
livestock 
breeding 
and 
industry, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
human 
resource 
development 
for 
nuclear 
science. 
65. 
Myanmar 
acknowledged 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
supporting 
the 
implementation 
of 
international 
instruments 
for 
nuclear 
safety, 
the 
development 
and 
application 
of 
safety 
standards 
and 
safety 
guides, 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national 
safety 
infrastructures 
of 
Member 
States 
had 
made 
a 
contribution 
to 
strengthening 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
66. 
As 
a 
developing 
country, 
Myanmar 
had 
a 
programme 
of 
promoting 
the 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
development 
purposes. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
medical 
diagnosis 
and 
in 
industry, 
as 
well 
as 
in 
academic 
R&D 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology, 
was 
gradually 
increasing 
and 
so 
it 
was 
important 
to 
establish 
an 
adequate 
infrastructure 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
Myanmar 
was 
also 
working 
towards 
ensuring 
the 
effective 
control 
and 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
radiation 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
In 
that 
area 
also, 
Agency 
assistance 
was 
requested 
in 
establishing 
and 
strengthening 
infrastructures, 
including 
capacity 
building 
and 
the 
transfer 
of 
technical 
expertise. 
67. 
To 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
to 
establish 
effective 
nuclear 
security 
regimes, 
it 
was 
essential 
throughout 
the 
world 
to 
strengthen 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials, 
their 
associated 
operational 
nuclear 
facilities, 
their 
locations 
and 
their 
transport. 
Myanmar 
confirmed 
its 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
and, 
in 
particular, 
its 
activities 
to 
provide 
nuclear 
security 
training 
to 
improve 
the 
practical 
nuclear 
security 
skills 
of 
relevant 
personnel 
in 
Member 
States. 
68. 
Myanmar 
highly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
monitoring 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
agreements, 
which 
were 
intended 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
in 
providing 
the 
necessary 
assurances 
regarding 
compliance 
with 
those 
agreements. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
verification 
activities 
would 
remain 
important 
in 
providing 
assurances 
to 
the 
international 
community 
that 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
facilities 
were 
not 
diverted 
for 
non-peaceful 
purposes. 
69. 
Myanmar 
had 
signed 
the 
NPT 
in 
1992, 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
SQP 
in 
1995, 
and 
the 
CTBT 
in 
1996. 
It 
had 
also 
signed 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
Nuclear 
Weapon-Free 
Zone 
at 
the 
fifth 
ASEAN 
formal 
summit 
held 
in 
Bangkok 
in 
December 
1995, 
which 
had 
come 
into 
force 
in 
1997 
and 
was 
aimed 
at 
the 
complete 
disarmament 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Myanmar 
believed 
that 
NWFZs 
in 
various 
regions 
of 
the 
world 
were 
effective 
measures 
for 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
contributing 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament.

70. 
Reiterating 
his 
appreciation 
and 
thanks 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
to 
the 
Secretariat, 
he 
reaffirmed 
his 
countryÂs 
belief 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
an 
essential 
role 
in 
promoting 
and 
facilitating 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy 
and 
in 
nuclear 
weapon 
non-
proliferation. 
71. 
Mr 
ABDRAKHMANOV 
(Kazakhstan) 
said 
that 
recent 
events 
had 
again 
demonstrated 
how 
difficult 
it 
was 
to 
create 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
mutual 
confidence 
in 
the 
world. 
Successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
was 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
of 
prevention 
of 
the 
further 
development 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
was 
therefore 
of 
paramount 
importance 
to 
have 
an 
efficient 
NPT 
regime 
and 
to 
take 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
it. 
That 
meant, 
first 
and 
foremost, 
steadfast 
adherence 
to 
the 
commitments 
made 
under 
the 
NPT. 
72. 
In 
February 
2007, 
Kazakhstan 
had 
ratified 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
May 
that 
year. 
His 
country 
was 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
nearly 
all 
initiatives 
to 
combat 
the 
nuclear 
threat, 
including 
the 
G8 
Global 
Partnership 
against 
the 
Spread 
of 
Weapons 
and 
Materials 
of 
Mass 
Destruction, 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative, 
and 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
In 
addition, 
his 
country 
had 
welcomed 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
proposed 
by 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
in 
2006. 
In 
demonstration 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
international 
security 
and 
its 
support 
for 
collective 
international 
efforts 
to 
counter 
terrorism, 
Kazakhstan 
had 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
also 
had 
hosted 
the 
3rd 
meeting 
of 
participants 
in 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
in 
Astana 
in 
June 
2007. 
73. 
Kazakhstan 
was 
taking 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
radiation 
border 
control 
and 
to 
upgrade 
further 
its 
system 
for 
combating 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials. 
It 
fully 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
on 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
74. 
His 
country 
had 
joined 
the 
GNEP, 
and 
had 
signed 
its 
Statement 
of 
Principles 
in 
September 
2007. 
Kazakhstan 
shared 
the 
GNEPÂs 
vision 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
cooperation 
to 
enable 
safe 
and 
secure 
expansion 
of 
civil 
nuclear 
energy. 
Involvement 
in 
the 
GNEP 
would 
give 
Kazakhstan 
new 
momentum 
in 
the 
development 
of 
its 
national 
atomic 
industry 
and 
energy 
sectors. 
75. 
Kazakhstan 
abided 
by 
all 
the 
accepted 
norms 
in 
its 
export 
control 
policies 
and, 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
NSG, 
was 
taking 
effective 
measures 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
It 
had 
set 
up, 
and 
was 
continuously 
improving, 
a 
system 
for 
combating 
illicit 
nuclear 
trafficking. 
Thorough 
scrutiny 
of 
the 
introduction 
of 
new 
restrictions 
on 
nuclear 
technology 
transfer 
was 
needed 
to 
avoid 
unjustified 
barriers 
being 
placed 
in 
the 
path 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
development. 
76. 
By 
giving 
up 
the 
worldÂs 
fourth 
largest 
nuclear 
arsenal, 
Kazakhstan 
had 
made 
a 
historic 
contribution 
to 
enhancing 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
and 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
commitment 
to 
its 
international 
obligations. 
Recognizing 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
highly 
enriched 
material, 
KazakhstanÂs 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mineral 
Resources 
had 
adopted 
a 
five-year 
programme 
to 
convert 
its 
WWR-K 
research 
reactor 
to 
LEU 
fuel. 
Furthermore, 
safe 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
BN-350 
fast 
breeder 
reactor 
in 
Aktau 
was 
continuing. 
77. 
Kazakhstan 
was 
implementing 
the 
new 
edition 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
Projects 
to 
strengthen 
control 
over 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
and 
to 
manage 
sources 
in 
a 
safe 
and 
secure 
fashion 
were 
being 
implemented 
successfully. 
Instruments 
for 
introducing 
a 
national 
register 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
had 
been 
prepared 
and 
an 
inventory 
of 
radiation 
sources 
in 
Kazakhstan 
was 
being 
carried 
out. 
His 
country 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
support 
and 
assistance 
provided 
to 
those 
programmes 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
participating 
countries.

With 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Kazakhstan, 
the 
Nuclear 
Technologies 
Park 
company 
had 
been 
registered 
and 
had 
begun 
its 
operations 
in 
Kurchatov. 
The 
companyÂs 
purpose 
was 
to 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
the 
development 
of 
peaceful 
atomic 
energy 
applications, 
including 
nuclear 
power 
development, 
in 
Kazakhstan. 
A 
heavy 
ion 
accelerator 
had 
entered 
into 
service 
in 
Astana 
in 
2007, 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
tokomak 
for 
materials 
research 
was 
under 
way 
in 
Kurchatov. 
The 
construction 
of 
a 
large 
nuclear 
medicine 
centre, 
supported 
by 
the 
Government, 
was 
being 
planned 
in 
Almaty. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
country, 
his 
Government 
was 
planning 
to 
create 
a 
special 
authority 
to 
coordinate 
the 
relevant 
national 
programmes. 
79. 
Kazakhstan 
was 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
Central 
Asia, 
an 
initiative 
which 
Central 
Asian 
States 
had 
formulated 
in 
the 
Almaty 
Declaration 
of 
1997. 
The 
initiative 
had 
become 
an 
important 
contribution 
by 
Kazakhstan 
and 
other 
States 
of 
the 
region 
to 
strengthening 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
In 
2006, 
the 
Ministers 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs 
and 
their 
representatives 
from 
Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan 
and 
Uzbekistan 
had 
signed 
the 
Central 
Asian 
Nuclear-Free-Zone-Treaty 
in 
Semipalatinsk. 
80. 
In 
2007, 
Kazakhstan 
had 
signed 
an 
intergovernmental 
agreement 
with 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
on 
the 
organization 
of 
an 
International 
Uranium 
Enrichment 
Centre 
in 
Angarsk. 
Kazakhstan 
believed 
that 
such 
centres, 
under 
strict 
Agency 
control, 
would 
be 
a 
basis 
for 
the 
application 
of 
all 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
to 
the 
most 
sensitive 
stages 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
They 
would 
also 
support 
the 
principles 
outlined 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technologies. 
81. 
In 
his 
statement 
at 
the 
G8 
Summit 
in 
July 
2006, 
the 
President 
of 
Kazakhstan 
had 
stressed 
that 
global 
security 
could 
be 
ensured 
only 
through 
complete 
nuclear 
disarmament 
since 
the 
possession 
of 
such 
weapons 
posed 
a 
direct 
threat 
to 
humanity. 
82. 
It 
was 
time 
for 
all 
to 
think 
about 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
and 
global 
energy 
security. 
His 
Government 
supported 
the 
development 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
under 
strict 
international 
control, 
in 
particular 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Any 
State 
that 
satisfied 
the 
requirement 
for 
transparency 
under 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency 
should 
have 
the 
right 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
build 
nuclear 
power 
reactors. 
Ways 
had 
to 
be 
found 
to 
resolve 
recent 
conflict 
situations 
by 
rebuilding 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
countries 
without 
restricting 
their 
right 
to 
technological 
development 
and 
access 
to 
knowledge. 
On 
account 
of 
their 
experience, 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
were 
in 
a 
good 
position 
to 
address 
such 
complex 
issues. 
83. 
Control 
over 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
should 
be 
improved 
to 
prevent 
the 
diversion 
of 
fissile 
material 
for 
military 
purposes. 
One 
approach 
was 
to 
establish 
a 
body 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency 
that 
would 
ensure 
the 
reliable 
supply 
of 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
manage 
safe 
storage 
and 
waste 
processing. 
Political, 
commercial 
and 
financial 
issues 
would 
need 
to 
be 
resolved 
prior 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
an 
entity. 
Although 
the 
idea 
might 
appear 
unrealistic 
at 
present, 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
start 
moving 
in 
that 
direction. 
84. 
Mr 
GALANXHI 
(Albania) 
said 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
efficient 
uses 
of 
resources 
for 
Member 
States 
and 
it 
was 
important 
to 
strengthen 
activities 
in 
that 
regard. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
that 
TCF 
contributions 
had 
reached 
a 
record 
level 
of 
$83.6 
million 
in 
2007, 
while 
the 
rate 
of 
attainment 
had 
increased 
to 
95.6%. 
The 
higher 
target 
for 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
2009 
would 
go 
further 
towards 
meeting 
Member 
StatesÂ 
needs. 
The 
Albanian 
Government 
was 
committed 
to 
paying 
its 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time.

85. 
Nuclear 
and 
isotope 
techniques 
continued 
to 
make 
substantive 
contributions 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
human 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
resource 
management 
and 
the 
environment. 
Albania 
was 
involved 
in 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
related 
to 
monitoring 
environmental 
radioactivity, 
particularly 
in 
the 
assessment 
of 
the 
marine 
environment 
of 
the 
Mediterranean 
Sea 
and 
air 
pollution 
in 
the 
Mediterranean 
region, 
and 
to 
improving 
clinical 
practices 
in 
radiation 
oncology 
and 
radiotherapy 
services. 
At 
the 
regional 
cooperation 
level, 
good 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
education 
and 
training 
in 
support 
of 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
national 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
control 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
and 
in 
upgrading 
national 
capabilities 
in 
controlling 
public 
exposure. 
86. 
As 
a 
beneficiary 
of 
PACT, 
Albania 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
strengthening 
national 
cancer 
control 
activities 
and 
was 
very 
appreciative 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
that 
regard. 
87. 
While 
Albania 
was 
aware 
that 
nuclear 
technology 
transfer 
was 
a 
long 
process 
and 
that 
it 
would 
require 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
for 
many 
years 
to 
come, 
national 
nuclear 
power 
and 
non-power 
applications 
had 
prospects. 
For 
the 
first 
time, 
his 
Government 
was 
seriously 
considering 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
power 
generation. 
Initial 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
in 
that 
regard, 
and 
consultations 
with 
the 
Agency 
were 
under 
way. 
88. 
The 
fight 
against 
organized 
crime 
and 
terrorism 
remained 
a 
top 
priority 
for 
Albania. 
It 
had 
improved 
its 
border 
controls, 
seeking 
Agency 
advice 
on 
establishing 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
to 
prevent 
the 
theft, 
diversion 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials. 
In 
addition, 
Albania 
supported 
global 
initiatives 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
89. 
Albania 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol 
which, 
if 
fully 
implemented, 
could 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
investigative 
powers 
to 
verify 
compliance 
with 
NPT 
safeguards 
obligations 
and 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
respond 
quickly 
in 
the 
event 
of 
indications 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material, 
facilities 
or 
activities. 
Thus, 
Albania 
had 
signed 
Â 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
Â 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
Moreover, 
Albania 
was 
taking 
legislative 
measures 
to 
prepare 
and 
adopt 
a 
comprehensive 
national 
atomic 
law 
that 
would 
ensure 
control 
over 
all 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
obligations, 
requirements 
and 
standards. 
90. 
Mr 
KEBEDE 
(Ethiopia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
finished 
preparing 
its 
CPF 
for 
the 
period 
2007Â2012 
with 
strong 
technical 
support 
from 
the 
Agency. 
The 
CPF 
identified 
national 
priority 
areas 
in 
which 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
could 
make 
significant 
contributions. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Government 
was 
reviewing 
the 
countryÂs 
institutional 
framework 
as 
part 
of 
national 
efforts 
to 
create 
the 
necessary 
institutional 
capacity 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
meet 
international 
obligations 
to 
ensure 
the 
peaceful, 
safe 
and 
secure 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
transformation 
process 
should 
strengthen 
the 
institutional 
framework 
for 
the 
SSAC, 
the 
regulatory 
services 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
91. 
Ethiopia 
was 
involved 
in 
a 
number 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
animal 
health 
and 
productivity, 
human 
health, 
water 
resource 
management, 
non-destructive 
testing, 
energy 
planning, 
nuclear 
instrumentation 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
The 
project 
with 
the 
highest 
priority 
remained 
the 
Southern 
Rift 
Valley 
Tsetse 
Eradication 
Project, 
which 
aimed 
to 
eradicate 
tsetse 
flies 
from 
25 
000 
km2 
of 
land 
using 
the 
SIT. 
The 
project 
was 
gradually 
moving 
towards 
achievement 
of 
its 
objectives 
and 
had 
reached 
a 
decisive 
stage 
where 
the 
cooperation 
of 
all 
partners 
was 
more 
crucial 
than 
ever. 
The 
most 
pressing 
need 
was 
the 
acquisition 
of 
additional 
equipment 
and 
materials 
to 
intensify 
suppression 
of 
tsetse 
populations, 
a 
prerequisite 
to 
application 
of 
the 
SIT. 
As 
the 
project 
approached 
its 
operational 
phase, 
Agency 
cooperation 
was 
needed 
to 
provide 
high 
technology 
and 
ensure 
skilled, 
experienced 
human 
resources. 
For 
its 
part, 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government 
was 
establishing 
an 
autonomous 
and 
more 
flexible 
project 
management 
structure 
and 
was 
purchasing 
an 
industrial

irradiator 
for 
the 
tsetse 
rearing 
and 
sterilization 
centre. 
It 
also 
planned 
to 
provide 
local 
short-and 
long-
term 
training 
courses 
with 
an 
emphasis 
on 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
in 
order 
to 
upgrade 
the 
knowledge 
and 
skills 
of 
professional 
and 
technical 
staff. 
Ethiopia 
called 
on 
all 
development 
partners 
to 
intensify 
their 
support 
for 
the 
project 
since 
its 
outcomes 
would 
have 
significant 
implications 
for 
the 
remaining 
36 
African 
nations 
affected 
by 
tsetse 
and 
trypanosomosis. 
He 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Agency, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
China, 
Japan, 
the 
OPEC 
Fund 
for 
International 
Development 
and 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
for 
their 
generous 
technical 
and 
financial 
assistance 
to 
the 
project. 


92. 
Although 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
progressing 
well, 
Ethiopia 
still 
had 
only 
one 
radiotherapy 
centre 
with 
a 
single 
cobalt 
therapy 
machine 
to 
serve 
more 
than 
75 
million 
people. 
Preliminary 
data 
indicated 
that 
only 
around 
400 
cancer 
patients 
received 
radiotherapy 
per 
year, 
despite 
an 
estimated 
115 
000 
new 
cancer 
cases 
per 
year. 
The 
Ethiopian 
Government 
was 
committed 
to 
ensuring 
that, 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
priority, 
immediate 
action 
was 
taken 
in 
that 
regard 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
development 
partners. 
93. 
Ethiopia 
commended 
the 
initiative 
under 
AFRA 
to 
review 
the 
relevance, 
achievements 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
agreementÂs 
policies, 
strategies 
and 
procedures 
of 
operation. 
The 
policy 
review 
seminar 
held 
in 
Egypt 
in 
November 
2007 
had 
achieved 
positive 
outcomes 
with 
regard 
to 
ownership 
by 
governments 
party 
to 
AFRA, 
but 
Agency 
support 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
required. 
94. 
Ethiopia 
had 
completed 
the 
formulation 
of 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
for 
2009Â2011 
using 
the 
interactive, 
Internet-based 
PCMF. 
Short-term 
courses 
of 
training 
on 
the 
PCMF 
would 
allow 
that 
tool 
to 
be 
used 
optimally. 
95. 
Ethiopia 
had 
ratified 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty 
in 
conformity 
with 
its 
long-standing 
commitment 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Ethiopia 
called 
on 
fellow 
African 
countries 
to 
ratify 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
96. 
Member 
States 
had 
growing 
expectations 
of 
the 
Agency, 
primarily 
owing 
to 
the 
ever 
increasing 
opportunities 
and 
challenges 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
had 
to 
be 
made 
available 
and 
a 
balance 
maintained 
in 
the 
resources 
allocated 
to 
safeguards, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
technical 
cooperation. 
It 
was 
also 
imperative 
to 
upgrade 
the 
AgencyÂs 
laboratory 
and 
computing 
facilities 
and 
to 
enhance 
its 
management 
information 
system. 
97. 
The 
Joint 
FAO/IAEA 
Division 
of 
Nuclear 
Techniques 
in 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
creating 
synergy 
between 
those 
two 
organizations. 
Ethiopia 
urged 
the 
FAO 
to 
maintain 
and 
reinforce 
that 
partnership. 
98. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
dedication 
and 
hard 
work 
to 
make 
cooperation 
with 
his 
country 
more 
relevant, 
efficient 
and 
effective. 
99. 
Mr 
KAMANDA 
BATARINGAYA 
(Uganda) 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
work 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and, 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
observe 
safety, 
security 
and 
safeguards 
measures. 
100. 
UgandaÂs 
President, 
Yoweri 
Kagutta 
Museveni, 
and 
its 
Government 
were 
committed 
to 
worldwide 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
recognized 
the 
role 
that 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
could 
play 
in 
socio-economic 
development. 
As 
proof 
of 
its 
commitment, 
Uganda 
had 
ratified 
the 
NPT 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
urged 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
101. 
The 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
in 
Uganda 
was 
limited 
to 
such 
areas 
as 
the 
diagnosis 
of 
diseases, 
cancer 
treatment, 
improvements 
in 
agriculture, 
control 
of 
disease 
vectors,

industrial 
testing 
and 
water 
resource 
studies. 
The 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
enhancing 
the 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
in 
the 
country. 
Particular 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
radiotherapy 
applications 
for 
cancer 
treatment 
and 
in 
mutation 
breeding 
techniques 
for 
the 
development 
of 
virus-resistant 
cassava 
and 
sweet 
potato 
varieties. 


102. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
growing 
energy 
demand 
and 
limited 
potential 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
the 
Government 
of 
Uganda 
intended 
to 
explore 
the 
feasibility 
of 
including 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
in 
its 
future 
energy 
mix. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
to 
establish 
the 
competences 
and 
infrastructure 
required 
for 
a 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
103. 
Although 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
improving 
lives 
worldwide, 
its 
application, 
if 
not 
properly 
regulated, 
could 
have 
serious 
health 
and 
environmental 
consequences. 
With 
that 
in 
mind, 
the 
Government 
of 
Uganda 
had 
enacted 
an 
atomic 
energy 
act 
in 
May 
2008. 
The 
new 
law 
would 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
all 
fields, 
including 
power 
generation, 
while 
ensuring 
safety, 
security 
and 
safeguards. 
Uganda 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
developing 
that 
law. 
104. 
In 
July 
2008, 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
Chef 
de 
Cabinet 
had 
visited 
Uganda 
for 
high 
level 
consultations 
on 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
The 
outcome 
of 
those 
consultations 
would 
guide 
future 
applications 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
improve 
the 
standard 
of 
living 
of 
the 
Ugandan 
people. 
105. 
Mr 
BAMBA 
(CÃ´te 
dÂIvoire) 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
over 
the 
previous 
year 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
areas 
including 
nuclear 
safety, 
transport 
safety, 
waste 
management, 
protection 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
and 
nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
applications. 
106. 
Since 
joining 
the 
Agency 
in 
1963, 
CÃ´te 
dÂIvoire 
had, 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation, 
successfully 
implemented 
a 
number 
of 
projects 
relating 
to 
animal 
production 
and 
health, 
improvements 
in 
crop 
yield, 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
It 
had 
implemented 
an 
extensive 
programme 
to 
develop 
its 
water 
and 
mining 
resources 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
energy 
requirements 
that 
were 
increasing 
as 
a 
result 
of 
social 
and 
industrial 
development. 
His 
Government 
had 
taken 
the 
decision 
to 
consider 
nuclear 
power 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
a 
sustainable 
energy 
supply 
and 
was 
seeking 
to 
strengthen 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
that 
end. 
107. 
His 
country 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
working 
together 
with 
the 
international 
community 
to 
achieve 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity, 
and 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
he 
hoped 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
be 
able 
to 
advance 
towards 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
including 
disarmament. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
proposal 
to 
sign 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
had 
been 
approved. 
108. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
strategy 
for 
poverty 
reduction, 
his 
Government 
had 
submitted 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
approval 
programmes 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development 
with 
considerable 
socio-economic 
impact 
on 
the 
population. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
increasing 
number 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
human 
health, 
animal 
production 
and 
health, 
nuclear 
science 
and 
applications, 
and 
radiation 
protection, 
which 
had 
resulted 
in 
capacity 
building 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
his 
country. 
His 
Government 
was 
seeking 
to 
strengthen 
the 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
as 
a 
first 
step 
in 
its 
vision 
for 
nuclear 
power 
development. 
The 
next 
step 
would 
involve 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
national 
atomic 
energy 
commission 
and 
regulatory 
authority. 
He 
expressed 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
gratitude 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
continued 
to 
receive 
from 
the 
Agency. 
109. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
efforts 
to 
pay 
all 
its 
APC 
arrears 
and 
noted 
that 
it 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
paying 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF.

110. 
For 
some 
time 
now, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
been 
paying 
increased 
attention 
to 
environmental 
issues 
and 
the 
problems 
associated 
with 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
toxic 
and 
radioactive 
substances. 
The 
Agency 
should 
increase 
its 
efforts 
to 
deal 
with 
contamination 
from 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources 
and 
to 
protect 
the 
environment. 
It 
should 
consider 
the 
use 
of 
adapted 
techniques 
for 
the 
management 
of 
environmental 
risks. 
His 
countryÂs 
recent 
experience 
with 
toxic 
waste 
had 
highlighted 
not 
only 
how 
fragile 
its 
infrastructure 
and 
methods 
of 
control 
were 
but 
also 
the 
need 
for 
strengthened 
international 
cooperation. 
111. 
The 
efforts 
undertaken 
within 
the 
AFRA 
programme 
had 
helped 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
Member 
States 
and 
to 
develop 
national 
and 
regional 
human 
resources 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
and 
should 
be 
further 
encouraged. 
The 
programme 
provided 
an 
ideal 
framework 
for 
the 
countries 
involved 
to 
develop 
and 
strengthen 
their 
national 
capacities. 
CÃ´te 
dÂIvoire, 
for 
its 
part, 
was 
committed 
to 
enhancing 
its 
cooperation 
and 
to 
greater 
involvement 
of 
its 
national 
institutions 
in 
the 
AFRA 
programme.

Election 
of 
members 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
(resumed) 
(GC(52)/8 
and 
23) 
112. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
that 
the 
vacant 
seat 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
for 
2008Â2009 
for 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia 
still 
remained 
to 
be 
filled. 
113. 
Mr 
KUMAR 
(India), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia 
group 
said 
that 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
had 
withdrawn 
its 
candidature 
for 
the 
vacant 
seat 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
maintaining 
consensus 
and 
facilitating 
the 
work 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
Thus 
there 
was 
now 
consensus 
among 
the 
members 
to 
propose 
Afghanistan 
as 
the 
candidate 
for 
the 
vacant 
seat. 
114. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
elect 
Afghanistan 
to 
the 
vacant 
seat 
for 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia. 
115. 
Afghanistan 
was 
duly 
elected.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2007 
(resumed) 
(GC(52)/9) 
116. 
Mr 
LAMINE 
(Niger) 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
as 
a 
uranium 
producer, 
reaffirmed 
its 
total 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives 
of 
preventing 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
military 
purposes 
and 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
used 
in 
the 
safest 
possible 
way. 
Niger 
participated 
actively 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
strengthening 
the 
related 
international 
legal 
framework. 
It 
was 
committed 
to 
working 
closely 
with 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
all 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity. 
117. 
Recognizing 
the 
importance 
of 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
radiation 
protection, 
Niger 
had 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
organize 
ISSAS 
and 
IRRS 
missions 
to 
assist 
it 
in 
setting 
up 
an 
SSAC 
and 
in 
helping 
mining 
companies, 
the 
customs 
service, 
the 
regulatory 
authority 
and 
all 
other 
stakeholders 
to 
play 
their 
role 
in 
implementing 
NigerÂs 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
its 
additional

protocol, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
2005 
and 
2007, 
respectively. 
The 
ISSAS 
missions 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
September 
2007 
and 
in 
February 
2008, 
and 
the 
IRRS 
mission 
in 
December 
2007. 
Niger 
hoped 
that 
implementation 
of 
the 
recommendations 
resulting 
from 
those 
missions 
would 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
country, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
others, 
to 
achieve 
its 
national 
and 
international 
objectives 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
radiation 
protection 
for 
the 
public 
and 
environment. 


118. 
Niger 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
the 
spheres 
of 
human 
health 
(particularly 
cancer 
control), 
agriculture, 
stockbreeding, 
water 
resource 
management, 
the 
environment 
and 
energy. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
at 
the 
results 
achieved 
by 
various 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
119. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
programme 
to 
improve 
the 
national 
health 
system, 
Niger 
had 
made 
efforts 
to 
combat 
cancer, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
which 
was 
growing 
rapidly 
in 
the 
country. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
Government 
had 
committed 
$1.8 
million 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
national 
radiotherapy 
centre 
for 
cancer 
treatment. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance, 
particularly 
by 
training 
staff 
and 
providing 
expert 
assistance 
and 
equipment, 
so 
that 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
that 
vital 
project 
for 
Niger 
could 
reach 
completion. 
In 
its 
effort 
to 
combat 
poverty 
and 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
of 
those 
suffering 
from 
cancer, 
his 
country 
had 
been 
providing 
free 
treatment 
for 
gynaecological 
cancers 
since 
2007. 
120. 
Niger 
was 
one 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
largest 
producers 
of 
uranium 
and 
was 
currently 
experiencing 
a 
resurgence 
in 
related 
activities. 
The 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
developing 
its 
mining 
sector 
while 
respecting 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
Niger 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
concerning 
radiation 
safety, 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
mining 
waste, 
and 
dosimetry, 
particularly 
internal 
exposure 
monitoring. 
121. 
His 
country 
intended 
to 
set 
up, 
with 
Agency 
support, 
a 
national 
INIS 
centre, 
which 
would 
mark 
a 
major 
step 
forward 
for 
its 
management 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge. 
The 
centreÂs 
mission 
would 
be 
to 
evaluate, 
take 
an 
inventory 
of, 
and 
reorganize 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
information 
system 
with 
a 
view 
to 
better 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
NigerÂs 
benefit. 
122. 
Niger 
needed 
to 
re-energize 
its 
agricultural 
and 
stockbreeding 
sectors, 
which 
employed 
more 
than 
80% 
of 
the 
working 
population, 
and 
thus 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
aimed 
at 
increasing 
agricultural 
and 
animal 
production. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
those 
fields, 
and 
more 
specifically 
in 
improving 
varieties 
and 
animal 
nutrition, 
could 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
addressing 
the 
development 
challenges 
posed 
by 
food 
security, 
combating 
poverty 
and 
environmental 
management. 
Niger 
was 
also 
hoping 
to 
apply 
isotopic 
techniques 
to 
study 
the 
silting 
up 
of 
the 
river 
Niger 
and 
pesticide 
use. 
123. 
Niger 
welcomed 
Agency 
assistance 
through 
regional 
and 
subregional 
programmes 
and 
intended 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
AFRA 
programme, 
from 
which 
it 
had 
already 
benefited 
greatly. 
With 
the 
support 
of 
AFRA 
and 
under 
a 
special 
programme 
of 
NigerÂs 
President, 
a 
biotechnology 
laboratory 
costing 
$300 
000 
was 
currently 
under 
construction. 
124. 
Mr 
ELWAZER 
(Palestine) 
said 
that 
soon 
after 
its 
establishment, 
the 
Palestinian 
National 
Authority 
had 
set 
up 
the 
Palestinian 
Energy 
Authority, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
divisions 
of 
which 
was 
the 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Department, 
which 
promoted 
the 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
environmental 
protection, 
agriculture 
and 
the 
water 
sector. 
125. 
Three 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
had 
been 
implemented 
during 
the 
period 
2007Â2008 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
and 
supporting 
environmental 
radiation 
monitoring, 
strengthening 
radiation 
protection, 
and 
training 
human 
resources 
in 
nuclear 
science. 
Agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
Agency 
support 
for 
four 
projects 
during 
the 
2009Â2011 
cycle 
concerning 
the 
development 
of 
Palestinian 
national 
capacities 
to 
deal 
with 
radiation 
accidents, 
support 
for 
the 
development 
of

services, 
the 
production 
of 
a 
radiation 
map 
of 
Palestine, 
and 
support 
for 
the 
national 
human 
resources 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
programme. 


126. 
The 
situation 
in 
Palestine 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
implement 
projects 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency, 
especially 
with 
respect 
to 
expert 
visits 
and 
the 
delivery 
of 
equipment. 
Moreover, 
the 
Israeli 
occupation 
authorities 
imposed 
closures 
of 
Palestinian 
territory 
which 
made 
it 
impossible 
for 
students, 
especially 
those 
from 
Gaza, 
to 
obtain 
permits 
for 
travel 
outside 
Palestine. 
The 
blockade 
of 
Gaza 
had 
turned 
it 
into 
the 
worldÂs 
biggest 
prison. 
Palestine 
had 
been 
divided 
up 
into 
discontinuous 
enclaves 
and 
Palestinians 
had 
to 
contend 
with 
more 
than 
600 
roadblocks. 
The 
worst 
hit 
area 
was 
that 
surrounding 
Jerusalem. 
The 
cityÂs 
character 
had 
been 
transformed 
and 
its 
Muslim 
and 
Christian 
holy 
places 
were 
threatened. 
127. 
Notwithstanding 
those 
circumstances, 
the 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Department 
had 
implemented 
a 
number 
of 
projects. 
However, 
it 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
organize 
regular 
workshops 
because 
of 
the 
closures, 
the 
lack 
of 
equipment 
and, 
above 
all, 
the 
shortage 
of 
experts. 
He 
therefore 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
persist 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
remedy 
the 
situation. 
Palestine 
hoped 
for 
further 
cooperation 
in 
environment 
protection 
and 
training 
in 
dealing 
with 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
accidents, 
especially 
since 
part 
of 
its 
territory 
was 
only 
40 
kilometres 
from 
IsraelÂs 
Dimona 
nuclear 
reactor. 
It 
constituted 
a 
major 
threat 
to 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
and 
the 
environment 
because 
of 
its 
age 
and 
the 
repeated 
occurrence 
of 
nuclear 
accidents. 
128. 
There 
was 
an 
urgent 
need 
for 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
especially 
Israel, 
to 
apply 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
their 
nuclear 
activities 
as 
a 
confidence-building 
measure 
and 
a 
step 
towards 
strengthening 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
creating 
a 
NWFZ. 
The 
Arab 
States 
strongly 
supported 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
was 
supported 
by 
a 
large 
number 
of 
delegations 
participating 
in 
the 
Conference. 
He 
warmly 
thanked 
the 
member 
States 
of 
NAM 
and 
the 
Organization 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Conference 
for 
their 
support 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
corresponding 
agenda 
item 
and 
called 
on 
the 
Conference 
to 
discuss 
it 
and 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
129. 
IsraelÂs 
failure 
to 
implement 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
to 
agree 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
an 
insurmountable 
obstacle 
to 
comprehensive 
peace 
and 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
region. 
He 
therefore 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
compel 
Israel 
to 
sign 
the 
NPT. 
130. 
The 
President 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority 
had 
announced 
a 
preliminary 
plan 
for 
national 
reconciliation 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Government 
of 
national 
unity, 
which 
would 
hold 
parliamentary 
and 
presidential 
elections 
and 
reorganize 
the 
Palestinian 
security 
system 
with 
Arab 
support. 
131. 
Mr 
TÃTH 
(Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty 
Organization) 
said 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
Commission, 
which 
now 
had 
180 
members, 
was 
to 
promote 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
establish 
a 
global 
verification 
regime 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
its 
provisions. 
Nine 
more 
countries 
still 
had 
to 
ratify 
the 
CTBT 
for 
it 
to 
enter 
into 
force, 
and 
almost 
150 
had 
ratified 
it 
to 
date. 
132. 
The 
Commission 
was 
making 
all 
the 
necessary 
preparations 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
verification 
regime 
would 
be 
ready 
from 
the 
first 
day 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
which 
was 
no 
small 
task. 
The 
system 
itself 
was 
to 
comprise 
337 
facilities 
in 
89 
countries, 
each 
hosting 
a 
diverse 
range 
of 
recording 
equipment 
using 
four 
key 
technologies. 
The 
system 
would 
be 
operated 
and 
maintained 
continuously 
by 
nearly 
500 
operators 
around 
the 
globe. 
The 
Global 
Communications 
Infrastructure 
(GCI) 
would 
relay 
recorded 
data 
through 
six 
geostationary 
satellites 
back 
to 
Vienna 
in 
real 
time. 
A 
team 
of 
experts 
at 
the 
International 
Data 
Centre 
(IDC) 
would 
analyse 
incoming 
information 
and

compare 
it 
to 
Treaty-specific 
timelines, 
while 
Member 
States 
and 
institutions 
across 
the 
globe 
could 
view 
the 
data 
simultaneously 
in 
possibly 
the 
most 
open 
verification 
democracy 
of 
its 
kind. 
Should 
the 
need 
arise, 
an 
on-site 
inspection 
team 
could 
be 
sent 
to 
survey 
an 
area 
of 
approximately 
1000 
km2 
for 
a 
potential 
nuclear 
blast. 


133. 
A 
number 
of 
important 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
build 
the 
verification 
regime. 
Nearly 
70% 
of 
the 
International 
Monitoring 
System 
(IMS) 
had 
been 
certified 
and, 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2008, 
250 
facilities 
would 
be 
transmitting 
data 
back 
to 
the 
IDC 
in 
Vienna. 
During 
the 
current 
mid-term 
cycle, 
the 
number 
of 
facilities 
in 
operation 
had 
tripled 
and 
all 
the 
key 
technologies 
of 
the 
verification 
system 
had 
been 
developed. 
The 
event 
in 
the 
DPRK 
had 
underscored 
the 
importance 
of 
increasing 
the 
number 
of 
noble 
gas 
stations, 
which 
would 
have 
doubled 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2008. 
Had 
the 
new 
stations 
with 
improved 
geographical 
saturation 
been 
in 
place 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
DPRK 
event, 
the 
readings 
would 
have 
been 
50 
times 
higher 
than 
those 
recorded 
in 
2006. 
134. 
The 
CommissionÂs 
migration 
to 
the 
new 
GCI 
platform 
was 
virtually 
complete, 
and 
GCI 
II 
was 
now 
relaying 
data 
across 
the 
globe. 
The 
volume 
of 
data 
transmitted 
from 
monitoring 
facilities 
to 
the 
IDC 
had 
tripled 
in 
recent 
years, 
and 
the 
daily 
volume 
of 
data 
products 
provided 
to 
CTBT 
States 
Parties 
had 
doubled. 
Software 
improvements 
had 
led 
to 
the 
delivery 
of 
more 
detailed 
and 
significantly 
higher 
quality 
data 
products. 
As 
the 
benefits 
derived 
from 
those 
products 
had 
expanded, 
so 
had 
access 
to 
them. 
More 
than 
1000 
authorized 
institutions 
in 
over 
100 
countries 
had 
direct 
access 
to 
the 
data 
generated 
by 
the 
IMS, 
and 
those 
data 
were 
proving 
to 
be 
increasingly 
useful, 
not 
just 
for 
verification, 
but 
also 
in 
civil 
and 
scientific 
applications. 
For 
example, 
the 
CommissionÂs 
system 
was 
the 
fastest, 
most 
reliable 
and 
highest 
quality 
provider 
of 
data 
to 
international 
and 
national 
tsunami 
warning 
centres. 
Data 
provision 
arrangements 
had 
just 
been 
signed 
with 
Japan, 
the 
Philippines 
and 
Australia, 
and 
similar 
arrangements 
would 
soon 
be 
signed 
with 
Indonesia 
and 
other 
countries. 
The 
regime 
had 
led 
to 
a 
new 
standard 
of 
verification, 
representing 
democracy 
in 
the 
verification 
of 
multilateral 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
instruments. 
The 
Commission 
had 
initiated 
an 
international 
scientific 
studies 
project 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
international 
scientific 
community 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
assessing 
the 
capability 
of 
the 
verification 
system 
and 
exploring 
whether 
the 
scientific 
community 
could 
provide 
additional 
tools 
to 
further 
improve 
data 
analyses. 
The 
project 
would 
be 
concluded 
in 
2009, 
with 
a 
conference 
held 
in 
June 
for 
all 
participants. 
135. 
In 
September 
2008, 
a 
team 
of 
trained 
inspectors 
had 
gone 
to 
Kazakhstan 
to 
conduct 
the 
first 
integrated 
field 
exercise 
of 
its 
kind 
under 
the 
concept 
of 
on-site 
inspection. 
The 
exercise 
had 
provided 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Commission 
to 
test 
most 
of 
the 
major 
elements 
of 
its 
on-site 
inspection 
regime. 
Two 
hundred 
participants 
had 
been 
deployed 
on 
the 
former 
nuclear 
weapon 
test 
site 
of 
Semipalatinsk, 
an 
area 
roughly 
the 
size 
of 
a 
small 
country. 
They 
had 
taken 
over 
50 
tonnes 
of 
equipment 
to 
be 
tested 
over 
30 
days 
in 
the 
field. 
Mock 
negotiations 
had 
been 
conducted, 
technical 
procedures 
had 
been 
practised, 
and 
integrated 
analysis 
had 
been 
performed 
on 
location. 
A 
wide 
range 
of 
equipment 
and 
technologies 
had 
been 
thoroughly 
put 
through 
their 
paces. 
Radionuclide 
surveys, 
ground 
and 
aerial 
gamma 
arrays, 
environmental 
sampling 
and 
passive 
seismological 
monitoring 
had 
been 
carried 
out. 
Many 
valuable 
lessons 
had 
been 
learned, 
and 
the 
field 
exercise 
would 
contribute 
significantly 
towards 
achieving 
on-site 
inspection 
readiness 
by 
the 
time 
the 
CTBT 
entered 
into 
force. 
136. 
Instead 
of 
talking 
about 
separate 
components 
of 
the 
verification 
regime, 
it 
was 
now 
possible 
to 
talk 
about 
an 
integrated 
system, 
functioning 
in 
a 
holistic 
way. 
However, 
much 
work 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
Many 
of 
the 
stations 
to 
be 
completed 
were 
the 
most 
difficult 
ones 
for 
technical, 
financial 
and 
political 
reasons. 
Sustaining 
the 
investments 
already 
made 
was 
proving 
to 
be 
a 
significant 
challenge 
as 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
issues 
emerged. 
In 
addition, 
the 
financial 
situation 
dictated 
substantially 
the 
realities 
of 
what 
could 
be 
achieved.

137. 
A 
ban 
on 
nuclear 
testing 
was 
more 
necessary 
than 
ever 
and 
there 
were 
compelling 
reasons 
to 
establish 
the 
CTBT. 
A 
nuclear 
energy 
renaissance 
was 
expected 
and 
the 
predicted 
annual 
growth 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
over 
the 
next 
20 
years 
would 
raise 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
that 
would 
need 
to 
be 
addressed, 
such 
as 
ensuring 
a 
system 
for 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
that 
was 
fair, 
secure, 
safe 
and 
safeguarded. 
There 
would 
be 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
countries, 
facilities, 
institutions 
and 
individuals 
managing 
a 
wider 
array 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
components, 
and 
significantly 
more 
fissile 
material, 
making 
it 
more 
difficult 
than 
ever 
to 
differentiate 
between 
prohibited 
and 
permitted 
nuclear 
activities. 
Conclusions 
as 
to 
whether 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
being 
used 
for 
peaceful 
or 
non-peaceful 
purposes 
would 
be 
based 
more 
on 
political 
than 
technical 
grounds. 
138. 
The 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
to 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
a 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime, 
which 
had 
been 
weakened 
in 
recent 
years. 
The 
CTBT, 
together 
with 
other 
necessary 
measures, 
could 
help 
to 
strengthen 
it. 
The 
CTBT 
was 
the 
last 
and 
most 
visible 
legal 
and 
technical 
barrier 
to 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
it 
could 
keep 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime 
from 
unravelling 
in 
the 
twenty-first 
century. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
an 
increasingly 
complex 
global 
security 
environment, 
such 
challenges 
could 
not 
be 
ignored. 
They 
had 
to 
be 
regulated 
and 
faced 
collectively 
if 
they 
were 
to 
be 
overcome. 
139. 
The 
CTBT 
was 
essential 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
proliferation 
and 
the 
achievement 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Not 
only 
was 
it 
an 
important 
measure 
in 
its 
own 
right, 
but 
it 
also 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
act 
as 
a 
catalyst 
for 
progress 
in 
other 
crucial 
areas 
of 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
would 
be 
an 
important 
step 
with 
regard 
to 
bringing 
the 
CTBT 
into 
force, 
as 
a 
demonstration 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
The 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
was 
just 
around 
the 
corner; 
the 
corner 
simply 
had 
to 
be 
turned.

Implementation 
of

and

(GC(52)/L.4) 


140. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
because 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.4 
had 
only 
been 
tabled 
that 
day, 
some 
delegations 
had 
raised 
objections 
pursuant 
to 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
For 
that 
reason 
he 
suggested 
postponing 
discussion 
of 
the 
agenda 
item 
until 
the 
subsequent 
day. 
141. 
It 
was 
so 
decided.

Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in

Middle 
East 
(GC(52)/10/Rev.1,

142. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
item 
had 
been 
included 
on 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
resolution 
GC(51)/RES/17, 
adopted 
by

the 
preceding 
year. 
In 
accordance 
with

of 
that 
resolution, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
submitted

resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt 
and 
document 
GC(52)/L.6 
containing 
amendments 
thereto 
proposed 
by 
Israel. 


143. 
Mr 
FAWZY 
(Egypt), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
the 
document 
had 
been 
prepared 
in 
support 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
field 
of 
safeguards, 
pursuant 
to 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
NPT. 
The 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
had 
assigned 
high 
priority 
to 
the 
accession 
of 
all 
the 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
placement 
of 
all 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
region 
under 
full-scope 
safeguards. 
When 
the 
Treaty 
had 
been 
extended 
indefinitely 
in 
1995, 
a 
resolution 
on 
the 
Middle 
East 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
the 
international 
community 
expressing 
concern 
at 
the 
continued 
presence 
of 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
region, 
which 
undermined 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
as 
a 
whole. 
144. 
Egypt 
had 
sponsored 
a 
similar 
draft 
resolution 
on 
many 
previous 
occasions. 
In 
2007, 
Egypt 
had 
updated 
the 
resolution, 
after 
no 
amendment 
had 
been 
made 
to 
it 
in 
14 
years 
and 
no 
practical 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
implement 
it. 
Egypt 
had 
undertaken 
intensive 
consultations 
on 
that 
draft 
resolution 
for 
five 
months 
with 
all 
the 
parties 
concerned, 
including 
Israel, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
consensus. 
Unfortunately, 
Israel 
and 
several 
other 
parties 
had 
refused 
to 
join 
consensus 
and 
disregarded 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
put 
pressure 
on 
the 
Arab 
countries 
in 
their 
endeavours 
to 
submit 
another 
draft 
resolution 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities. 
Egypt 
had 
unequivocally 
rejected 
any 
linking 
of 
those 
two 
issues. 
Israel 
and 
other 
States 
had 
requested 
a 
vote 
on 
EgyptÂs 
2007 
draft 
resolution 
and 
the 
consensus 
had 
been 
broken. 
145. 
New 
amendments 
had 
been 
introduced 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution 
now 
before 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
meet 
the 
concerns 
of 
a 
number 
of 
parties 
and 
with 
a 
view 
to 
returning 
to 
consensus. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
should 
take 
responsibility 
for 
achieving 
the 
goal 
of 
placing 
all 
the 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Egypt 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
by 
consensus 
or, 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
vote, 
to 
support 
it 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
other 
international 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
forums. 
To 
avert 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
the 
international 
community 
must 
fulfil 
its 
responsibility 
to 
deal 
with 
all 
relevant 
issues 
in 
the 
region 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
law 
and 
without 
double 
standards. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
the 
General 
Conference 
voted 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
would 
send 
a 
message 
to 
the 
States 
of 
the 
region 
regarding 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
when 
it 
came 
to 
upholding 
the 
principles 
they 
professed 
to 
embrace. 
He 
hoped 
the 
message 
would 
be 
positive, 
convincing 
States 
that 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
applied 
full-scope 
safeguards 
to 
their 
facilities 
that 
they 
had 
made 
the 
right 
choice, 
and 
reaffirming 
that 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
in 
particular, 
met 
their 
commitments 
and 
showed 
their 
resolve 
against 
States 
that 
had 
flouted 
international 
disarmament 
norms 
and 
refused 
to 
assume 
any 
non-proliferation 
or 
safeguards 
commitments. 
146. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel), 
presenting 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
made 
numerous 
attempts 
to 
reach 
out 
to 
its 
sponsor 
in 
order 
to 
find 
a 
way 
to 
accommodate 
IsraelÂs 
position 
and 
views 
in 
the 
text 
and 
to 
regain 
consensus 
in 
the 
Vienna 
spirit. 
Unfortunately, 
those 
attempts 
had 
been 
unsuccessful, 
leaving 
Israel 
with 
no 
choice 
but 
to 
table 
its 
amendments 
officially 
and 
bring 
them 
to 
a 
vote 
at 
the 
General 
Conference. 
The 
amendments 
were 
modest 
but 
indispensable 
for 
his 
country. 
147. 
The 
first 
proposed 
amendment, 
adding 
an 
operative 
paragraph 
after 
operative 
paragraph 
1, 
addressed 
the 
regrettable 
situation 
that 
non-compliance 
with 
legally 
binding 
obligations 
had 
become 
widespread 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
application 
of 
safeguards 
was 
a 
synonym 
for 
compliance 
with 
obligations 
and 
the 
latest 
developments 
in 
the 
field 
of 
proliferation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
showed 
that 
the 
issue 
was 
one 
that 
the 
international 
community 
could 
no 
longer 
ignore.

148. 
The 
second 
proposed 
amendment, 
changing 
the 
wording 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
4, 
had 
been 
imported 
from 
a 
General 
Assembly 
resolution. 
The 
original 
wording 
had 
been 
designed 
to 
strike 
the 
right 
balance 
between 
the 
various 
operative 
paragraphs. 
Israel, 
while 
not 
in 
favour 
of 
including 
language 
imported 
from 
the 
General 
Assembly 
owing 
to 
the 
difference 
in 
nature 
of 
the 
two 
forums, 
was 
prepared 
Â 
for 
the 
purposes 
of 
flexibility 
Â 
to 
accept 
the 
original 
wording 
rather 
than 
oppose 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
paragraph 
altogether. 
149. 
The 
third 
proposed 
amendment, 
adding 
an 
operative 
paragraph 
after 
operative 
paragraph 
6, 
was 
based 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
other 
regions 
in 
establishing 
a 
NWFZ. 
It 
demonstrated 
the 
need 
for 
mutual 
recognition, 
good 
neighbourliness, 
mutual 
acceptance 
and 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations. 
The 
way 
to 
achieve 
security 
was 
to 
set 
a 
final 
objective, 
start 
modestly 
and 
proceed 
carefully, 
since 
confidence 
building 
was 
a 
lengthy 
process. 
Resistance 
to 
a 
step-by-step 
approach 
was 
not 
conducive 
to 
achieving 
the 
goal 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ. 
150. 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
NAM, 
quoted 
the 
final 
declaration 
of 
the 
MovementÂs 
15th 
Ministerial 
Conference 
held 
in 
Tehran 
from 
27 
to 
30 
July 
2008: 
ÂThe 
Ministers 
reiterated 
their 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
As 
a 
priority 
step 
to 
this 
end, 
they 
reaffirmed 
the 
need 
for 
the 
speedy 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
paragraph 
14 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
687 
(1991) 
and 
the 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
They 
called 
upon 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
take 
urgent 
and 
practical 
steps 
towards 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
proposal 
initiated 
by 
Iran 
in 
1974 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone 
and, 
pending 
its 
establishment, 
they 
demanded 
on 
Israel, 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
has 
not 
joined 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Non-Proliferation 
of 
Nuclear 
Weapons 
(NPT) 
nor 
declared 
its 
intention 
to 
do 
so, 
to 
renounce 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay, 
to 
place 
promptly 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
IAEA 
full-scope 
safeguards 
according 
to 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
to 
conduct 
its 
nuclear 
related 
activities 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
They 
called 
for 
the 
earliest 
implementation 
of 
relevant 
IAEA 
resolutions 
on 
ÂApplication 
of 
IAEA 
Safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
EastÂ. 
They 
expressed 
great 
concern 
over 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
capability 
by 
Israel 
which 
poses 
a 
serious 
and 
continuing 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
neighbouring 
and 
other 
States, 
and 
condemned 
Israel 
for 
continuing 
to 
develop 
and 
stockpile 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
In 
this 
context 
they 
also 
condemned 
the 
statement 
made 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
of 
Israel 
on 
11 
December 
2006, 
related 
to 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
by 
Israel. 
They 
urged 
the 
continued 
consideration 
of 
the 
issue 
of 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
IAEA, 
including 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
its 
52nd 
Session. 
They 
were 
of 
the 
view 
that 
stability 
cannot 
be 
achieved 
in 
a 
region 
where 
massive 
imbalances 
in 
military 
capabilities 
are 
maintained 
particularly 
through 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
allow 
one 
party 
to 
threaten 
its 
neighbours, 
and 
the 
region. 
They 
further 
welcomed 
the 
initiative 
by 
H.E. 
Mr. 
Mohammed 
Hosni 
Mubarak, 
President 
of 
the 
Arab 
Republic 
of 
Egypt, 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
from 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
in 
this 
context, 
they 
took 
into 
consideration 
the 
draft 
resolution 
tabled 
by 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group, 
before 
the 
Security 
Council 
on 
29 
December 
2003 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
They 
stressed 
that 
necessary 
steps 
should 
be 
taken 
in 
different 
international 
fora 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
zone. 
They 
also 
called 
for 
the 
total 
and 
complete 
prohibition 
of 
the 
transfer 
of 
all 
nuclear-related 
equipment, 
information, 
material 
and 
facilities, 
resources 
or 
devices 
and 
the 
extension 
of 
assistance 
in 
the 
nuclear 
related 
scientific 
or 
technological 
fields 
to

Israel. 
In 
this 
regard, 
they 
expressed 
their 
serious 
concern 
over 
the 
continuing 
development 
whereby 
Israeli 
scientists 
are 
provided 
access 
to 
the 
nuclear 
facilities 
of 
one 
NWS. 
This 
development 
will 
have 
potentially 
serious 
negative 
implications 
on 
security 
in 
the 
region 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reliability 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime.Â 


151. 
NAM 
noted 
with 
regret 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
finding 
that 
he 
continued 
to 
be 
unable 
to 
make 
further 
progress 
in 
fulfilling 
his 
mandate 
pursuant 
to 
resolution 
GC(51)/RES/17 
regarding 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
NAM 
also 
regretted 
IsraelÂs 
continued 
insistence 
that 
progress 
in 
that 
regard 
be 
made 
contingent 
upon 
other 
developments 
related 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
rather 
than 
contributing 
to 
such 
developments. 
NAM 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
finding 
that 
there 
was 
a 
consensus 
that 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
would 
be 
further 
strengthened 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
it 
believed 
that 
every 
effort 
must 
be 
made 
to 
translate 
that 
consensus 
into 
urgent 
and 
practical 
steps. 
152. 
NAM 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
to 
develop 
an 
agenda 
and 
modalities 
for 
a 
forum 
on 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
existing 
NWFZs 
for 
establishing 
such 
a 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
For 
such 
a 
forum 
to 
be 
successful, 
its 
agenda 
should 
reflect 
the 
consensus 
within 
the 
international 
community 
on 
the 
importance 
of 
establishing 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
NAM 
welcomed 
the 
convergence 
of 
views 
on 
convening 
the 
forum 
and 
requested 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
continue 
consultations 
with 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
agree 
upon 
the 
agenda 
and 
modalities, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
convening 
a 
productive 
forum 
as 
early 
as 
practicable. 
153. 
NAM 
hoped 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
presented 
by 
Egypt 
could 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
154. 
Mr 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
said 
that 
the 
amendments 
proposed 
by 
Israel 
added 
nothing 
to 
EgyptÂs 
draft 
resolution, 
which 
affirmed 
the 
need 
for 
all 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
accept 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
with 
a 
view 
to 
building 
confidence. 
IsraelÂs 
tabling 
of 
amendments 
was 
a 
manoeuvre 
to 
prevent 
consensus, 
which 
Syria 
was 
unable 
to 
accept. 
155. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria), 
expressing 
her 
countryÂs 
support 
for 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt, 
said 
the 
text 
was 
balanced 
and 
addressed 
all 
the 
relevant 
concerns. 
156. 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
her 
own 
country, 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt, 
which 
had 
been 
submitted 
in 
good 
time. 
IsraelÂs 
proposed 
amendments 
were 
a 
delaying 
tactic 
intended 
to 
complicate 
the 
decision-making. 
157. 
Mr 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran), 
also 
expressing 
support 
for 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt, 
said 
IsraelÂs 
proposed 
amendments 
were 
a 
clear 
indication 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
had 
for 
years 
been 
held 
hostage 
to 
the 
peace 
process. 
They 
were 
an 
attempt 
to 
perpetuate 
a 
vicious 
circle, 
and 
Iran 
therefore 
rejected 
them. 
158. 
Mr 
TOUKAN 
(Jordan) 
lent 
his 
countryÂs 
support 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt, 
particularly 
its 
affirmation 
of 
the 
need 
for 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
159. 
Ms 
PETERSEN 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela) 
expressed 
her 
countryÂs 
hope 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt 
could 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
without 
amendment. 
160. 
Mr 
AYOUB 
(Iraq) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
decided 
not 
to 
propose 
further 
amendments 
to 
EgyptÂs 
draft 
resolution, 
but 
support 
it 
as 
it 
stood. 
Iraq 
rejected 
IsraelÂs 
proposed 
amendments. 
161. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
proposed 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
Rule 
76 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
the 
amendments 
be 
voted 
on 
first.

162. 
Mr 
DENIAU 
(France) 
requested 
a 
short 
suspension 
for 
the 
European 
Union 
to 
coordinate 
its 
position 
in 
view 
of 
the 
new 
situation 
that 
had 
arisen. 
163. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
requested, 
pursuant 
to 
Rule 
72 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
on 
each 
amendment 
proposed 
by 
his 
country. 
164. 
Mr 
ZNIBER 
(Morocco), 
recalling 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
important 
responsibilities 
as 
regards 
maintaining, 
strengthening 
and 
promoting 
respect 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
said 
his 
country 
strongly 
hoped 
that 
consensus 
could 
be 
reached 
on 
the 
issue. 
165. 
Mr 
OTHMAN 
(Syria) 
reminded 
delegates 
of 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
regarding 
proposals 
and 
amendments. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
8.20 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
8.50 
p.m. 


166. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
the 
request 
made 
by 
the 
delegate 
of 
Israel 
for 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
on 
each 
of 
the 
amendments 
proposed. 
167. 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation), 
supported 
by 
Mr 
YANG 
Dazhu 
(China), 
said 
that 
pursuant 
to 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
voting 
on 
the 
Israeli 
amendments 
should 
be 
deferred 
until 
the 
following 
day. 
168. 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
NAM 
and 
supported 
by 
Mr 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
and 
Mr 
MOHAMAD 
(Malaysia), 
said 
that 
the 
Conference 
should 
take 
action 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
at 
the 
present 
meeting. 
169. 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
reiterated 
that 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
clearly 
indicated 
that 
the 
Israeli 
amendments 
could 
not 
be 
put 
to 
the 
vote 
now. 
170. 
Mr 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
appealed 
to 
the 
delegate 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
to 
withdraw 
his 
objection 
so 
that 
a 
decision 
on 
the 
text 
could 
be 
taken. 
171. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
in 
accordance 
with 
established 
practice, 
the 
word 
ÂconsiderationÂ 
in 
Rule 
63 
should 
be 
understood 
to 
include 
voting. 
172. 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
said 
that, 
while 
not 
seeking 
to 
challenge 
the 
President, 
he 
would 
like 
clarification 
of 
the 
PresidentÂs 
interpretation 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
173. 
Mr 
RAUTENBACH 
(Director, 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs) 
said 
that, 
in 
accordance 
with 
established 
practice, 
the 
term 
ÂconsiderationÂ 
should 
be 
interpreted 
to 
include 
voting. 
If 
ÂconsiderationÂ 
meant 
merely 
ÂdiscussionÂ, 
the 
last 
sentence 
of 
Rule 
63 
would 
be 
repetitive. 
174. 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
said 
that 
in 
his 
many 
years 
at 
the 
Agency 
he 
had 
not 
been 
aware 
of 
any 
such 
practice. 
175. 
Mr 
HORVATIC 
(Croatia) 
said 
that, 
according 
to 
his 
understanding 
of 
Rule 
63, 
the 
presiding 
officer 
should 
have 
the 
latitude 
to 
decide 
on 
how 
to 
proceed. 
176. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
exercising 
his 
discretion 
under 
Rule

he 
would 
rule

as 
requested 
by 
the

of 
Israel 
under 
Rule 
72 
of 
the

of 
Procedure. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
objection, 
he 
took 
it 
that 
his 
ruling 
was 
acceptable. 
177. 
It 
was 
so 
agreed.

The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that

189. 
There 
were 
45 
votes 
in 
favour 
and 
34 
against, 
with 
28 
abstentions. 
The 
amendment 
was 
adopted. 
190. 
Mr 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
his 
country 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
amendments 
because 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt 
covered 
the 
concerns 
of 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
and 
indeed 
of 
the 
entire 
world. 
The 
idea 
that 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
should 
be 
called 
upon 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
international 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
relating 
to 
safeguards 
was 
surprising, 
coming 
from 
a 
country 
that 
had 
not 
even 
signed 
a 
safeguards 
agreement. 
If 
the 
objective 
was 
to 
strengthen 
mutual 
confidence 
in 
the 
region, 
the 
way 
to 
do 
so 
was 
by 
first 
establishing 
a 
NWFZ 
and 
then 
to 
continue 
the 
peace 
process. 
191. 
Mr 
AMANO 
(Japan) 
said 
his 
delegation 
had 
abstained 
in 
the 
voting 
on 
the 
amendments 
because 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
time 
following 
their 
distribution, 
preventing 
him 
from 
receiving 
instructions 
from 
his 
capital. 
192. 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
said 
his 
delegation 
had 
been 
forced 
to 
abstain 
during 
the 
voting 
on 
the 
amendments 
over 
a 
procedural 
issue. 
He 
regretted 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
voting 
had 
not 
been 
postponed 
so 
that 
all 
delegations 
might 
obtain 
instructions 
from 
their 
governments. 
193. 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
her 
delegation 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
amendments, 
which 
it 
saw 
as 
dilatory 
and 
obstructive. 
Cuba 
vehemently 
opposed 
in 
particular 
the 
call

on 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
international 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
relating 
to 
safeguards. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
did 
not 
have 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
thus 
the 
only 
country 
in 
that 
region 
not 
covered 
by 
that 
wording. 
That 
was 
an 
affront 
to 
morality. 


194. 
Mr 
JAFFEER 
(Sri 
Lanka) 
said 
his 
delegation 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
first 
two 
amendments 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
common 
position 
reached 
among 
the 
members 
of 
the 
NAM. 
On 
the 
third 
amendment, 
his 
delegation 
had 
abstained, 
owing 
to 
what 
it 
saw 
as 
a 
convergence 
of 
views. 
195. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
deplored 
the 
lack 
of 
consensus 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
Egypt. 
Algeria 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
amendments 
proposed 
by 
Israel 
because 
the 
original 
draft 
was 
balanced 
and 
took 
full 
account 
of 
concerns 
about 
regional 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
vote 
attested 
to 
the 
persisting 
discord 
between 
Member 
States 
on 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
there. 
It 
highlighted 
the 
amount 
of 
work 
still 
to 
be 
done 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
common 
view 
on 
those 
matters, 
which 
directly 
affected 
the 
collective 
security 
of 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission, 
in 
particular 
with 
respect 
to 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
signed 
the 
NPT. 
Concerning 
the 
third 
amendment, 
she 
said 
that 
adding 
the 
reference 
to 
the 
peace 
process 
only 
threw 
fire 
on 
the 
flames 
and 
exacerbated 
a 
politicization 
of 
the 
Agency 
that 
some 
had 
already 
deplored. 
That 
was 
not 
the 
intention 
of 
the 
original 
text 
proposed 
by 
Egypt. 
196. 
Mr 
YANG 
Dazhu 
(China) 
said 
his 
delegation, 
which 
had 
supported 
the 
Russian 
FederationÂs 
call 
for 
a 
postponement, 
had 
abstained 
during 
the 
voting 
on 
the 
amendments 
because 
they 
had 
been 
distributed 
at 
such 
a 
late 
hour 
before 
the 
voting 
that 
he 
had 
not 
had 
time 
to 
get 
instructions 
from 
his 
capital. 
197. 
Mr 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
the 
reason 
why 
his 
delegation 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
first 
amendment 
was 
because 
it 
conveyed 
the 
message 
that 
the 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
was 
not 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
was 
not 
called 
upon 
to 
do 
anything. 
The 
voting 
on 
the 
second 
amendment 
proved 
that 
most 
of 
the 
international 
community 
had 
serious 
concerns 
and 
called 
upon 
Israel 
to 
join 
and 
apply 
the 
NPT. 
198. 
Mr 
STACEY 
MORENO 
(Ecuador) 
and 
Mr 
HIGUERAS 
RAMOS 
(Peru) 
said 
their 
delegations 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
amendments 
because 
they 
added 
nothing 
of 
substance 
to 
the 
excellent 
original 
text 
proposed 
by 
Egypt. 
199. 
Mr 
ELDIN 
ELAMIN 
(Sudan) 
said 
his 
delegation 
had 
voted 
against 
the 
amendments 
because 
the 
original 
text 
was 
a 
balanced 
one 
and 
the 
additions 
voided 
it 
of 
its 
content. 
They 
allowed 
Israel 
to 
avoid 
joining 
the 
NPT 
and 
continue 
to 
hold 
the 
peace 
process 
hostage, 
as 
it 
had 
been 
doing 
for 
decades. 
200. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
invited 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
proceed 
to 
take 
a 
decision 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.1, 
"Application 
of 
IAEA 
Safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
EastÂ, 
as 
amended. 
201. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
proposed 
the 
addition, 
after 
the 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
2 
that 
had 
been 
inserted 
by 
the 
first 
Israeli 
amendment, 
of 
another 
new 
paragraph, 
reading: 
ÂCalls 
upon 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
accede 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
conventionsÂ. 
202. 
Mr 
AL-SAUD 
(Saudi 
Arabia), 
Ms 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
Mr 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic), 
Mr 
ZNIBER(Morocco), 
Mr 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
and 
Mr 
MOHAMAD 
(Malaysia) 
supported 
the 
proposal 
by 
the 
representative 
of 
Algeria. 
203. 
Mr 
LÃDEKING 
(Germany) 
asked 
for 
clarification 
of 
the 
wording. 
204. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
said 
she 
could 
be 
flexible 
about 
the 
exact 
wording 
and 
location 
of 
the 
additional 
text 
she 
had 
proposed. 
The 
main 
idea 
was 
to 
restore 
the 
balance 
and 
clarity 
of 
the 
text 

GC(52)/OR.8

following 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
2, 
which 
made 
no 
sense 
as 
Israel 
was 
not 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 


205. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
said 
the 
concerns 
expressed 
by 
the 
delegate 
of 
Algeria 
were 
already 
covered 
in 
the 
text. 
The 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
2 
spoke 
of 
compliance 
with 
international 
commitments 
and 
the 
former 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
(now 
4) 
referred 
to 
adherence 
to 
international 
non-proliferation 
regimes. 
He 
therefore 
opposed 
the 
Algerian 
proposal, 
which 
only 
disrupted 
the 
balance 
in 
the 
newly 
amended 
text. 
206. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
did 
not 
agree 
that 
the 
idea 
she 
wished 
to 
include 
was 
well 
reflected 
in 
the 
paragraphs 
cited 
by 
the 
representative 
of 
Israel 
and 
pressed 
for 
the 
adoption 
of 
her 
proposal, 
which 
had 
been 
supported 
by 
several 
countries. 
207. 
Mr 
TOUKAN 
(Jordan), 
and 
Ms 
PETERSEN 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela), 
Mr 
BEN 
AYED 
(Tunisia) 
and 
Mr 
ASSAIDI 
(Yemen) 
supported 
the 
proposal 
made 
by 
Algeria. 
208. 
Mr 
DENIAU 
(France), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
it 
would 
be 
preferable 
to 
see 
the 
proposal 
in 
writing. 
He 
requested 
a 
suspension 
of 
the 
meeting 
for 
consultations. 
209. 
Mr 
KUMAR 
(India) 
said 
that 
Rule 
63 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
should 
be 
applied, 
thereby 
giving 
delegates 
24 
hours 
to 
see 
how 
the 
Algerian 
proposal 
fitted 
in 
with 
the 
newly 
amended 
text. 
210. 
Mr 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
the 
24-hour 
rule 
had 
already 
been 
waived 
for 
certain 
amendments; 
he 
hoped 
the 
same 
approach 
would 
be 
applied 
to 
the 
Algerian 
proposal. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
10.25 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
11.25 
p.m. 


211. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
three 
documents 
had 
been 
circulated 
during 
the 
suspension: 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
amended 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.1, 
the 
proposal 
made 
by 
Algeria 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.7 
and 
a 
proposal 
made 
by 
Arab 
Member 
States 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.8. 
212. 
He 
asked 
the 
representative 
of 
Algeria 
whether 
the 
text 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.7, 
reading 
ÂCalls 
upon 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Non-proliferation 
TreatyÂ, 
was 
an 
accurate 
reflection 
of 
her 
proposal 
to 
insert 
a 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.1. 
213. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
said 
that, 
while 
the 
text 
was 
not 
exactly 
what 
she 
had 
proposed, 
following 
consultations 
with 
the 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
supported 
her 
proposal, 
it 
was 
now 
the 
preferred 
language. 
214. 
Mr 
DENIAU 
(France), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
that 
the 
proposed 
amendment 
was 
redundant 
as 
its 
content 
was 
already 
covered 
by 
operative 
paragraph 
4 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.1. 
Nevertheless, 
he 
would 
be 
prepared 
to 
accept 
the 
wording 
of 
AlgeriaÂs 
original 
proposal, 
namely 
ÂCalls 
upon 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
accede 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
conventions". 
215. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
requested 
a 
vote 
on 
the 
Algerian 
proposal. 
216. 
Ms 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria), 
responding 
to 
a 
question 
put 
by 
Mr 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation), 
said 
the 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
would 
be 
added 
after 
operative 
paragraph 
1 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.1. 
217. 
Mr 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
requested 
a 
roll-call 
vote. 
218. 
At 
the 
request 
of 
Mr 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
was 
taken.

221. 
There 
were 
92 
votes 
in 
favour 
and 
1 
against, 
with 
7 
abstentions. 
The 
proposed 
amendment 
was 
adopted. 
222. 
Ms 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
she 
had 
abstained 
because 
the 
proposal 
was 
already 
covered 
by 
operative 
paragraph 
4 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.1. 
The 
amendment 
just 
adopted 
meant 
that 
a 
consensus 
was 
now 
impossible. 
223. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
he 
had 
voted 
against 
a 
redundant 
proposal, 
the 
content 
of 
which 
was 
already 
covered 
by 
other 
paragraphs 
in 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
224. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
applicability 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
at 
best 
limited. 
Three 
of 
the 
four 
widely 
recognized 
cases 
of 
non-compliance 
with 
legally 
binding 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
225. 
In 
January 
1993, 
the 
Israeli 
Government 
had 
approved 
a 
set 
of 
long 
term 
goals 
for 
achieving 
security 
and 
arms 
control 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
had 
called 
on 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
establish 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
a 
mutually 
verifiable 
zone 
free 
from 
ground-to-ground 
missiles 
and 
chemical, 
biological 
and 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Fifteen 
years 
later, 
Israel 
had 
not 
given 
up 
hope 
that 
the 
States 
of 
the 
region 
would 
one 
day 
engage 
in 
a 
multilateral, 
cooperative 
dialogue 
to 
that 
end. 
226. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Middle 
East 
had 
witnessed 
significant 
and 
dangerous 
developments 
regarding 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
Some 
countries 
had 
been 
developing 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
total 
disregard 
of 
their 
international 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
and 
contrary 
to 
their 
stated 
policy. 
The 
Israeli 
GovernmentÂs 
policy 
regarding 
the 
NPT 
therefore 
remained 
unchanged. 
227. 
Mr 
ZNIBER 
(Morocco), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
sponsored 
the 
proposal 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.8, 
expressed 
regret 
that 
the 
spirit 
of 
Vienna 
had 
not 
prevailed 
in 
discussions 
regarding 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
sense 
of 
unity 
and 
generosity 
that 
had 
served 
successive 
sessions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
so 
well 
was 
gradually 
slipping 
away, 
making 
it 
even 
more 
difficult 
to 
create 
conditions 
for 
progress.

228. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
focused 
on 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
yet 
one 
of 
the 
amendments 
proposed 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.6, 
and 
adopted 
without 
consensus, 
had 
created 
conditionality 
between 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
peace 
process. 
The 
proposal 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.8 
sought 
to 
restore 
a 
sense 
of 
unity 
among 
Member 
States, 
and 
he 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
229. 
Mr 
DENIAU 
(France), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
that 
the 
proposal 
introduced 
by 
the 
representative 
of 
Morocco 
contradicted 
the 
third 
amendment 
proposed 
by 
Israel 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.6, 
which 
had 
already 
been 
adopted. 
IsraelÂs 
proposed 
amendment 
was 
based 
on 
the 
logical 
truth 
that 
a 
climate 
of 
confidence 
and 
security 
needed 
to 
be 
created 
before 
a 
NWFZ 
could 
be 
established. 
The 
proposal 
by 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States, 
however, 
suggested 
the 
opposite; 
that 
a 
NWFZ 
could 
be 
established 
even 
if 
there 
was 
not 
a 
favourable 
climate 
to 
start 
with. 
The 
proposal 
rendered 
the 
draft 
resolution 
illogical 
and 
contradictory 
and, 
furthermore, 
it 
appeared 
to 
contradict 
Rule 
66 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
the 
Procedure. 
The 
European 
Union 
could 
not 
therefore 
accept 
it. 
230. 
Mr 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
requested 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
on 
the 
proposal 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(52)/L.8. 
231. 
Mr 
ZNIBER 
(Morocco) 
reiterated 
that 
he 
wished 
the 
proposed 
amendment 
to 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
Given 
the 
reactions 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
the 
proposal, 
he 
requested 
a 
suspension 
to 
allow 
him 
to 
consult 
with 
the 
representatives 
of 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States. 
The 
meeting 
rose 
at 
12 
midnight.

19. 
Implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Democratic 
PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
(resumed) 
(GC(52)/L.4) 


1. Ms GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE (Canada), introducing draft resolution GC(52)/L.4 on the 
implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between the Agency and the Democratic PeopleÂs 
Republic of Korea (DPRK), said that approximately 50 Member States had now sponsored it. The text 
was a balanced one: the achievements of the Six-Party process and the efforts of the parties to meet 
their commitments were welcomed, but the importance of early resumption of disablement work at 
Yongbyon was stressed. The Agency and its Director General were commended for their efforts to 
resolve the DPRK nuclear issue and the action taken by the Board of Governors was endorsed. The 
draft resolution was supported by all five of the six parties to the Six-Party Talks that were members 
of the Agency. She hoped that it would be adopted by consensus. 
2. Mr SHIM Yoon-joe (Republic of Korea) said that there had been some progress in the situation 
in the DPRK during the past year. The DPRK had submitted a declaration on its nuclear programmes, 
and in July 2008 the Six-Party Talks heads of delegation had reached a consensus on full and balanced 
implementation of second-phase action and agreed to establish a verification and monitoring 
mechanism within the framework of the Six-Party Talks. 
3. Regrettably, however, the DPRK had suspended disablement activities at Yongbyon and taken 
steps to restart the nuclear facilities there. The AgencyÂs seals and surveillance equipment had been 
removed from the reprocessing plant and the DPRK Government had informed Agency inspectors of 
its intention to reintroduce nuclear material into the reprocessing plant without allowing them access 
to it. 
4. The DPRK should refrain from such action, which would have a serious impact on the Six-Party 
Talks, and resume disablement activities. 
5. The Six-Party Talks were the most effective way of resolving the DPRK nuclear issue, and, if 
they were to move forward, all parties must fulfil their commitments and complete the second-phase 
actions, including the adoption of a verification protocol, in a timely manner. Also, the Agency should 
continue its monitoring and verification activities at DPRK nuclear facilities. 
6. The draft resolution now before the Conference, of which his country was a sponsor, 
emphasized the need for the DPRK to comply fully with the NPT and cooperate with the Agency in 
the implementation of comprehensive safeguards. His country would work closely with the Agency, 
the other parties to the Six-Party Talks and the international community at large to resolve the DPRK 
nuclear issue in a peaceful and expeditious manner, with the continuing valuable support of the 
Agency. 
7. Mr AMANO (Japan) said that his country appreciated the AgencyÂs monitoring and verification 
activities at the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and the significant contributions of the Agency to the 
Six-Party process.

8. Japan, while acknowledging the submission by the DPRK of its nuclear programmes to Agency 
verification in June 2008, noted that the DPRK had not agreed to a detailed verification framework 
and had taken steps to reverse the disablement of the Yongbyon facilities. 
9. His delegation had listened with serious concern to the statement on the situation in the DPRK 
made by the AgencyÂs Deputy Director General of Safeguards to the Board of Governors the week 
before. In its view, the DPRK must agree to a detailed verification framework, and also complete the 
disablement of the Yongbyon facilities by October, as agreed at the meeting of Six-Party Talks heads 
of delegation in July. 
10. Further work was needed within the framework of the Six-Party process in order to complete 
implementation of the second-phase actions. The DPRK must abandon all nuclear weapons and 
existing nuclear programmes, as stated in the Joint Statement issued in September 2005. Japan would 
continue to cooperate with the other partners for full implementation of the Joint Statement. 
11. The DPRK must also comply fully with United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1718 (2006) and with its obligations under the NPT and its safeguards agreement. In 
addition, it must take transparency measures, including the provision of such access to individuals, 
documentation, equipment and facilities as deemed necessary by the Agency. 
12. The Agency had an essential role to play in the process of abandonment by the DPRK of its 
nuclear programmes, including monitoring and verification at the Yongbyon facilities, and a possible 
role in relation to the declaration by the DPRK on its nuclear programmes. His country, with partners, 
would continue to strongly support the Agency. 
13. Mr TANG Guoqiang (China) said that there were four points regarding which the international 
community had a common understanding. Firstly, there was a need to promote the denuclearization of 
the Korean Peninsula and the normalization of relations between States in order to restore peace and 
stability in the region in the interests of all. Secondly, the Six-Party Talks were a pragmatic way of 
resolving the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and important for an increase in 
understanding and trust. Thirdly, it was important to preserve the hard-won achievements of the 
Six-Party process so far, which had been made possible by the political will, wisdom, flexibility and 
patience displayed by the parties. Finally, all parties should redouble their efforts to expedite the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. They must continue their dialogue, whatever the 
circumstances, in order to increase mutual trust and cooperation. If all the parties fulfilled their 
commitments and were prepared to compromise, the present difficulties could be overcome. China, 
which was currently chairing the Six-Party Talks, would continue to work with the other parties and 
the international community at large to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
14. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that the reckless actions of the DPRK had caused his Government 
grave concern. The DPRK was a source of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. At least 
half a dozen countries in the Middle East had received DPRK weapons through black-market or other 
covert channels, and there was mounting evidence that Middle East countries were copying the 
DPRK's unlawful and dangerous practices. He called upon the international community to take note of 
those dangerous developments and their likely consequences. 
15. Mr BERDENNIKOV (Russian Federation) said that the Agency should play a central role in 
efforts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, since no other organization was in such a 
good position to do so. He hoped that the draft resolution before the Conference would be adopted by 
consensus.

16. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(52)/L.4 without a vote. 
17. 
It was so decided.

Oral 
report 
by 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
(GC(52)/L.5) 


18. Mr NIEWODNICZANSKI (Chairman of the Committee of the Whole) presented the outcome 
of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda item 16, ÂStrengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to 
nuclear science, technology and applicationsÂ. The draft resolutions recommended by the Committee 
had been clustered along the lines of the main areas of the AgencyÂs work in order to make the results 
of its deliberations more transparent and readable and to provide clearer guidance for the Secretariat. 
19. The Committee recommended to the General Conference the adoption of draft resolutions A 
(ÂNon-power nuclear applicationsÂ), B (ÂNuclear power applicationsÂ) and C (ÂNuclear knowledgeÂ) 
in document GC(52)/L.5. 
20. As recommended by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions 
contained in document GC(52)/COM.5/L.5 were adopted. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
10.50 
a.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
1 
p.m. 


20. 
Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
(resumed) 
(GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2, 
GC(52)/L.8) 
21. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco), speaking on behalf of the sponsors of the proposal contained in 
document GC(52)/L.8, said that one of the amendments proposed in document GC(52)/L.6 had created 
a link of conditionality between the Middle East peace process and the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The Arab Group considered that establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was an issue of fundamental importance and that it was 
vital not to confuse matters by linking it to another issue. Adoption of the proposal made by the Arab 
Group would restore the balance of the original draft resolution (contained in document GC 
(52)/L.1)and show that the General Conference was committed to the preservation of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and to efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the troubled region 
of the Middle East. 
22. Mr DANIELI (Israel), recalling that paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution had been 
proposed by his country and accepted by the General Conference, said that his delegation would like a 
roll-call vote to be held on the amendment proposed by the Arab Group in document GC(52)/L.8. 
23. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) suggested that the new paragraph proposed in document GC(52)/L.8 
be amended to read: ÂConsiders, in this context, that establishing an NWFZ in the Middle East would 
contribute to peace and stability in the regionÂ.

24. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco), responding to a question put by the PRESIDENT, said that, if the Arab 
GroupÂs proposal was adopted by consensus, the Group as a whole would no doubt accept the wording 
suggested by the representative of Algeria. 
25. If a vote was going to be held on the proposal, the members of the Arab Group would need time 
to consult before voting started. 
26. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that both the proposal made in document GC(52)/L.8 and the 
amended version just suggested by the representative of Algeria ran counter to the spirit of 
paragraph 9 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2, which had been 
proposed by Israel. His delegation would vote against the proposal whether it was amended or not. 
27. If the General Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(52)/L.1/Mod.2 by consensus, his delegation would join the consensus, but it would express a 
reservation regarding paragraph 2, which called upon all States in the Middle East region to accede to 
the NPT.
