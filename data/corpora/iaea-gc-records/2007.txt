Â 
Opening 
of 
the 
session 
1. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
declared 
open 
the 
51st 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
2. 
In 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
48 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
he 
invited 
delegates 
to 
observe 
one 
minute 
of 
silence 
dedicated 
to 
prayer 
or 
meditation. 
All 
present 
rose 
and 
stood 
in 
silence 
for 
one 
minute. 


3. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
said 
during 
the 
historic 
50th 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Agency 
had 
rededicated 
itself 
to 
expanding 
and 
expediting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
the 
next 
fifty 
years. 
During 
the 
previous 
year, 
it 
had 
been 
able 
to 
accelerate 
and 
enlarge 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity 
and 
had 
taken 
important 
steps 
to 
establish 
and 
administer 
safeguards 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
materials 
were 
not 
used 
to 
further 
any 
military 
purpose. 
4. 
He 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
wise 
and 
innovative 
leadership, 
which 
had 
made 
the 
Agency 
indispensable 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
against 
a 
background 
of 
the 
need 
to 
eliminate 
all 
nuclear 
weapons. 
All 
Member 
States 
should 
support 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General, 
enabling 
them 
to 
fulfil 
their 
statutory 
mandate. 
1. 
Election 
of 
officers 
and 
appointment 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
5. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
invited 
nominations 
for 
the 
office 
of 
President 
of 
the 
Conference. 
6. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia 
Group, 
proposed 
Mr. 
Hamze 
(Lebanon). 
7. 
Mr. 
Hamze 
(Lebanon) 
was 
elected 
President 
by 
acclamation. 
8. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
congratulated 
Mr. 
Hamze 
on 
his 
election 
and 
wished 
him 
every 
success 
in 
his 
task. 
Mr. 
Hamze 
(Lebanon) 
took 
the 
Chair. 


9. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
Member 
States, 
in 
particular 
those 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
Asia 
Group, 
for 
the 
confidence 
they 
had 
placed 
in 
him 
by 
nominating 
him 
as 
President 
and 
commended 
his 
predecessor, 
Ambassador 
Minty 
of 
South 
Africa, 
for 
his 
outstanding 
efforts 
and 
wisdom 
in 
steering 
the 
work 
of 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
Conference. 
10. 
Over 
the 
previous 
two 
decades, 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
unique 
achievements 
in 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
its 
work. 
It 
had 
rightly 
earned 
the 
worldÂs 
support 
and 
approval 
in 
its 
endeavours 
to 
promote 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ.

11. 
In 
developing 
countries, 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
seen 
as 
a 
legitimate 
means 
of 
achieving 
the 
sustainable 
development 
goals 
of 
societies. 
The 
availability 
of 
energy 
and 
the 
diversification 
of 
energy 
sources 
remained 
the 
basis 
for 
any 
serious 
initiative 
to 
alleviate 
poverty, 
improve 
living 
conditions 
and 
prevent 
marginalized 
communities 
from 
succumbing 
to 
extremism 
and 
fanaticism, 
and 
from 
sliding 
into 
violence, 
which 
affected 
all. 
There 
was 
growing 
conviction 
of 
the 
need 
to 
establish 
mechanisms 
for 
development, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
future 
technological 
innovations 
were 
undoubtedly 
essential 
to 
mitigate 
hazards 
and 
increase 
economic 
benefits. 
12. 
The 
need 
to 
enhance 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
nuclear 
verification 
and 
safety 
systems 
was 
increasing 
all 
the 
time, 
and 
required 
the 
establishment 
without 
delay 
of 
serious 
programmes 
for 
developing 
specialized 
national 
frameworks, 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
regional 
partnership 
and 
adherence 
to 
the 
regulations 
and 
rules 
of 
the 
Agency. 
States 
should 
also 
be 
aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
inculcating 
an 
appropriate 
culture 
and 
encouraging 
public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
13. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
political 
interest 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role, 
he 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
scientific 
and 
technical 
aspects 
of 
its 
activities, 
and 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
entitled 
ÂGlobal 
Challenges 
and 
the 
Development 
of 
Atomic 
Energy: 
the 
Next 
25 
YearsÂ, 
which 
would 
take 
place 
alongside 
the 
fifty-first 
session 
of 
the 
Conference. 
He 
looked 
forward 
to 
enhancement 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
ability 
to 
build 
effective 
partnerships 
among 
States. 
14. 
Since 
its 
creation 
half 
a 
century 
previously, 
the 
Agency 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
system 
in 
promoting 
peace 
and 
international 
cooperation. 
His 
country, 
Lebanon, 
and 
the 
Arab 
Group 
of 
which 
it 
was 
honoured 
to 
be 
a 
member, 
had 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes, 
reiterating 
on 
every 
occasion 
their 
commitment 
to 
international 
conventions 
designed 
to 
achieve 
peace 
and 
nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
They 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
commitment 
of 
all 
parties 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
NPT 
was 
a 
fundamental 
step 
that 
could 
no 
longer 
be 
avoided, 
requiring 
the 
support 
and 
understanding 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
15. 
With 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
51st 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Agency 
was 
moving 
into 
a 
new 
phase, 
which 
he 
hoped 
would 
meet 
the 
aspirations 
for 
sustainable 
investment 
in 
nuclear 
technologies 
and 
for 
serious 
commitment 
to 
their 
exclusively 
peaceful 
use. 
The 
Agency 
had 
made 
outstanding 
achievements 
thanks 
to 
the 
wise 
and 
courageous 
management 
of 
its 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
team, 
whom 
he 
encouraged 
to 
establish 
more 
cooperation 
programmes. 
He 
invited 
those 
countries 
that 
were 
in 
a 
position 
to 
do 
so 
to 
increase 
their 
financial 
contributions 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
easier 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
achieve 
its 
objectives. 
16. 
He 
recalled 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
Rules 
34 
and 
40 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
the 
Conference 
normally 
elected 
eight 
Vice-Presidents, 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole, 
and 
five 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
Â 
resulting 
in 
a 
General 
Committee 
of 
15 
members. 
17. 
He 
proposed 
that 
the 
delegates 
of 
Egypt, 
Germany, 
Malaysia, 
Peru, 
the 
Philippines, 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
be 
elected 
as 
Vice-Presidents; 
that 
Ms. 
Feroukhi 
(Algeria) 
be 
elected 
as 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole; 
and 
that 
the 
delegates 
of 
Croatia, 
Cuba, 
the 
Holy 
See, 
Lithuania 
and 
Norway 
be 
elected 
as 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee. 
18. 
The 
PresidentÂs 
proposals 
were 
accepted.

19. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
further 
proposed 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
deal 
with 
items 
2, 
3, 
4, 
5, 
7 
and 
8 
in 
that 
order, 
pending 
receipt 
of 
the 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendation 
on 
the 
provisional 
agenda. 
20. 
The 
PresidentÂs 
proposal 
was 
accepted. 
2. 
Applications 
for 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
(GC(51)/9, 
10, 
11, 
12 
and 
23) 


21. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
drew 
attention 
to 
documents 
GC(51)/9, 
GC(51)/10, 
GC(51)/11, 
GC(51)/12 
and 
GC(51)/23 
containing 
applications 
for 
membership 
by 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
Bahrain, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Burundi, 
the 
Republic 
of 
the 
Congo, 
Nepal 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Cape 
Verde 
respectively. 
The 
five 
applications 
had 
been 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
which 
had 
also 
submitted 
five 
draft 
resolutions 
for 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Conference. 
22. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
the 
five 
draft 
resolutions. 
23. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
24. 
Mr. 
BIN 
AHMED 
BIN 
MOHAMMAD 
AL-KHALIFA 
(Kingdom 
of 
Bahrain), 
speaking 
under 
Rule 
30, 
thanked 
the 
Conference 
for 
its 
unanimous 
decision 
to 
accept 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
BahrainÂs 
application 
to 
become 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
consistent 
with 
BahrainÂs 
conviction 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
important 
universal 
and 
international 
role 
to 
play, 
and 
with 
his 
countryÂs 
wish 
to 
strengthen 
that 
role. 
Bahrain 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
encouraging 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
in 
preventing 
its 
use 
in 
connection 
with 
atomic 
weaponry 
or 
other 
nuclear 
devices. 
25. 
Bahrain, 
which 
had 
ratified 
the 
NPT 
on 
3 
November 
1998 
and 
the 
CTBT 
on 
12 
April 
2004, 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
together 
with 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
achieve 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
objectives. 
He 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
important 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff, 
and 
commended, 
in 
particular, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
implementing 
safeguards. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
effectively 
implement 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
accordance 
with 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(50)/RES/16, 
in 
view 
of 
their 
importance 
in 
consolidating 
and 
strengthening 
mutual 
trust 
in 
the 
region 
and 
contributing 
positively 
to 
initiatives 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
26. 
Bahrain, 
for 
its 
part, 
would 
sign 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
NPT 
during 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
Conference. 
It 
would 
be 
initiating 
the 
necessary 
constitutional 
and 
legal 
procedures 
to 
accept 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
in 
order 
to 
contribute 
fully 
and 
effectively 
to 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
world 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity.

the 
past 
five 
decades, 
and 
to 
consider 
the 
challenges 
ahead. 


ÂThe 
activities 
of 
the 
IAEA 
are 
more 
important 
than 
ever 
to 
advance 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
promote 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
reduce 
the 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


ÂAccess 
to 
reliable 
and 
affordable 
sources 
of 
energy 
is 
essential 
for 
development. 
The 
growth 
in 
demand 
for 
energy 
will 
likely 
be 
highest 
in 
developing 
counties, 
several 
of 
which 
may 
turn 
to 
nuclear 
power 
to 
help 
meet 
this 
need. 
Yet 
concerns 
over 
dependency 
on 
foreign 
sources 
of 
supply 
continue 
to 
inhibit 
wider 
use 
of 
this 
technology. 
In 
response, 
the 
IAEA 
has 
long 
been 
a 
central 
forum 
for 
exploring 
multilateral 
frameworks 
for 
assuring 
supplies 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
peaceful 
uses, 
while 
promoting 
other 
such 
uses 
outside 
the 
energy 
sector. 


ÂReaping 
these 
benefits, 
however, 
requires 
new 
levels 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
addressing 
security 
and 
environmental 
challenges, 
especially 
from 
spent 
fuel 
and 
waste 
management, 
both 
very 
familiar 
subjects 
at 
the 
IAEA. 


ÂIn 
addition, 
the 
Agency 
is 
also 
facing 
many 
challenges 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Future 
progress 
in 
disarmament 
may 
eventually 
lead 
to 
new 
roles 
for 
the 
IAEA, 
especially 
in 
the 
disposition 
of 
nuclear 
weapon 
material. 
With 
respect 
to 
non-proliferation, 
the 
IAEA 
is 
continuing 
its 
engagement 
with 
Iran 
and 
is 
once 
again 
implementing 
certain 
safeguards 
activities 
in 
the 
Democratic 
PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
The 
Agency 
is 
promoting 
the 
Additional 
Protocol 
to 
strengthen 
safeguards, 
seeking 
greater 
transparency 
in 
export 
controls, 
and 
working 
to 
strengthen 
the 
physical 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
thereby 
reducing 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


ÂAs 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
United 
Nations, 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
working 
together 
with 
you 
in 
meeting 
the 
challenges 
ahead. 
We 
must 
redouble 
our 
efforts 
to 
revitalize 
the 
international 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
agenda, 
and 
rid 
the 
world 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
your 
deliberations 
and 
decisions 
will 
help 
us 
reach 
that 
objective. 


ÂIn 
that 
spirit, 
please 
accept 
my 
best 
wishes 
for 
a 
successful 
and 
productive 
conference.Â

Statement 
by 
the 
Federal 
Minister 
for 
European 
and 
International 
Affairs 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria 
28. 
Ms. 
PLASSNIK 
(Federal 
Minister 
for 
European 
and 
International 
Affairs 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria) 
said 
that, 
when 
the 
first 
Agency 
officials 
had 
started 
work 
in 
August 
1957 
in 
ViennaÂs 
Grand 
Hotel, 
they 
had 
broken 
new 
ground. 
They 
had 
been 
part 
of 
an 
organization 
with 
a 
novel 
mandate, 
designed 
for 
a 
new 
political 
era, 
and 
had 
taken 
office 
in 
a 
city 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
a 
divided 
Europe 
Â 
very 
much 
a 
symbol 
of 
the 
times. 
Today 
the 
Agency, 
with 
its 
impressive 
track 
record, 
which 
included 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
2005, 
had 
become 
an 
indispensable 
institution 
in 
the 
global 
security 
architecture. 
29. 
There 
were 
two 
areas 
in 
which 
the 
Agency 
currently 
assumed 
core 
responsibilities 
and 
urgently 
needed 
political 
support: 
the 
first 
concerned 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
worldwide 
partnership 
to 
control

sensitive 
nuclear 
technologies, 
in 
particular 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing, 
and 
the 
second 
related 
to 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
further 
as 
an 
instrument 
to 
contribute 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
confidence. 


30. 
In 
his 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
speech 
in 
1953, 
President 
Eisenhower 
had 
proposed 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
atomic 
energy 
agency 
out 
of 
concern 
about 
the 
accumulation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
their 
proliferation. 
When 
States 
had 
attended 
the 
first 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
the 
Vienna 
Konzerthaus, 
the 
world 
had 
faced 
a 
nuclear 
arms 
race. 
Today, 
the 
imminent 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
war 
had 
moved 
backstage 
in 
peopleÂs 
minds 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
immediate 
political 
concern. 
However, 
the 
international 
community 
could 
not 
afford 
to 
neglect 
the 
dangers 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
being 
developed 
or 
traded 
on 
the 
black 
market, 
nor 
exclude 
the 
possibility 
of 
nuclear 
material 
ending 
up 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorists. 
31. 
The 
core 
issues 
of 
the 
late 
1950s 
were 
still 
relevant: 
there 
were 
expectations 
about 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
the 
atom, 
in 
particular 
as 
a 
source 
of 
energy, 
and 
about 
the 
need 
to 
address 
safety 
and 
security 
issues 
that 
might 
arise 
from 
such 
technology, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
its 
abusive 
use 
for 
weapons. 
32. 
Over 
the 
previous 
fifty 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
vital 
contributions 
to 
many 
important 
projects 
related 
to 
the 
development 
agenda. 
Nuclear 
technologies 
had 
been 
developed 
to 
increase 
food 
production, 
fight 
diseases 
and 
manage 
groundwater 
resources. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
provided 
assistance 
in 
energy 
planning, 
advising 
more 
than 
100 
countries 
on 
the 
development 
of 
appropriate 
national 
energy 
strategies. 
33. 
Despite 
a 
revival 
of 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
energy, 
many 
people 
across 
the 
globe 
continued 
to 
have 
strong 
and 
serious 
reservations 
about 
the 
issue. 
Concerns 
about 
the 
effects 
of 
nuclear 
radiation 
on 
health 
and 
the 
environment, 
accidents 
at 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
and 
the 
possible 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
technology, 
had 
convinced 
a 
number 
of 
States 
to 
renounce 
nuclear 
power 
altogether. 
Austria 
was 
one 
of 
the 
countries 
to 
believe 
that 
the 
risks 
of 
atomic 
energy 
far 
outweighed 
the 
advantages. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
high 
environmental 
and 
financial 
costs 
over 
time 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
a 
sustainable 
solution 
to 
the 
nuclear 
waste 
problem, 
it 
did 
not 
consider 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
make 
a 
valid 
contribution 
to 
the 
efforts 
directed 
against 
climate 
change. 
34. 
Although 
every 
State 
had 
the 
right 
to 
choose 
its 
energy 
sources, 
States 
should 
be 
united 
on 
the 
need 
to 
address 
urgently 
and 
prevent 
the 
potential 
misuse 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes 
or 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
Agency 
had 
significantly 
contributed 
to 
containing 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
nuclear 
energy 
by 
developing 
safety 
standards 
and 
monitoring 
instruments, 
such 
as 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol. 
It 
was 
the 
duty 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
ensure 
that 
those 
standards 
were 
fully 
implemented. 
35. 
There 
was 
also 
a 
need 
for 
a 
global 
partnership 
that 
enabled 
access 
to 
energy, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
ensuring 
safety 
and 
security. 
Such 
a 
partnership 
must 
be 
based 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
and 
she 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
in 
that 
regard. 
36. 
At 
the 
first 
meeting 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
she 
had 
proposed 
a 
regime 
in 
which 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities 
would 
be 
placed 
under 
multilateral 
control. 
All 
transactions 
regarding 
nuclear 
fuel 
would 
be 
made 
through 
a 
Ânuclear 
fuel 
bankÂ, 
ensuring 
that 
all 
countries 
received 
the 
fuel 
they 
required. 
Accordingly, 
there 
would 
be 
no 
need 
for 
States 
to 
develop 
national 
fuel 
cycles 
and 
technologies 
individually 
as 
all 
States 
could, 
through 
the 
Agency, 
share 
control 
over 
such 
facilities 
as 
partners. 
37. 
History 
showed 
that 
such 
an 
approach 
could 
work. 
After 
the 
disastrous 
experience 
of 
the 
Second 
World 
War, 
the 
European 
States 
had 
agreed 
to 
multilateralize 
the 
production 
of 
war-sensitive 
industrial 
sectors. 
The 
decision 
to 
do 
so 
had 
been 
radical, 
but 
the 
prospect 
of 
lasting 
peace 
and 
trust 

GC(51)/OR.1 
17 
September 
2007,

had 
made 
it 
worthwhile 
to 
offer 
shared 
control. 
Today, 
five 
decades 
of 
peace 
and 
ever-closer 
relations 
among 
a 
growing 
membership 
proved 
that 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
founders 
had 
been 
right. 
A 
divided 
continent 
had 
become 
a 
zone 
of 
freedom, 
peace 
and 
prosperity. 


38. 
She 
would 
encourage 
States 
to 
engage 
fully 
in 
the 
debate 
over 
the 
coming 
months 
on 
a 
multilateral 
system 
for 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
and 
to 
treat 
it 
for 
what 
it 
was: 
a 
fundamentally 
political 
issue, 
and 
a 
means 
to 
improve 
international 
security 
and 
stability 
that 
required 
first 
and 
foremost 
political 
will. 
If 
the 
proliferation 
of 
sensitive 
technology 
were 
to 
be 
avoided, 
technical 
parameters 
had 
to 
be 
established 
together 
with 
a 
genuine 
and 
sustainable 
global 
partnership 
of 
political 
determination. 
39. 
Referring 
to 
international 
threats, 
the 
former 
United 
Nations 
Secretary-General 
Kofi 
Annan 
had 
once 
said 
that 
the 
one 
area 
where 
there 
was 
a 
total 
lack 
of 
any 
common 
strategy 
was 
the 
one 
that 
might 
well 
present 
the 
greatest 
dangers 
of 
all: 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Indeed, 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
increasingly 
under 
pressure. 
Several 
States 
had 
developed 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes 
and 
some 
now 
possessed 
such 
weapons 
Â 
a 
direct 
challenge 
to 
the 
NPT 
system. 
There 
were 
other 
problems 
including 
black 
market 
proliferation, 
illicit 
trade, 
an 
alarming 
rise 
in 
military 
spending 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Most 
disappointing 
to 
a 
country 
like 
Austria 
was 
the 
stagnation 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
The 
sheer 
number 
of 
weapons 
today 
Â 
reportedly 
27 
000, 
of 
which 
12 
000 
were 
actively 
deployed 
Â 
remained 
so 
high 
that 
the 
vision 
of 
a 
world 
without 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
far 
from 
becoming 
a 
reality. 
40. 
In 
such 
a 
difficult 
situation, 
the 
Agency 
represented 
a 
positive 
constant 
and 
assumed 
its 
tasks 
with 
quiet 
reliability, 
proficiency 
and 
independence. 
It 
served 
as 
a 
forum 
for 
debate, 
a 
centre 
for 
technical 
expertise 
and 
a 
global 
nuclear 
watchdog. 
The 
recognition 
it 
had 
gained 
over 
the 
years 
and 
its 
reputation 
of 
trust 
were 
deserved, 
and 
owed 
much 
to 
the 
conscientious 
and 
insistent 
work 
of 
its 
Director 
General, 
his 
predecessors, 
and 
the 
many 
thousands 
of 
employees 
who 
had 
worked 
at 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
previous 
fifty 
years. 
Not 
only 
did 
the 
Agency 
deliver 
as 
an 
independent 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
institution, 
it 
also 
contributed 
directly 
and 
persuasively 
towards 
international 
confidence 
building. 
Accordingly, 
it 
was 
in 
Member 
StatesÂ 
interest 
to 
let 
the 
Agency 
do 
its 
work, 
as 
it 
had 
done 
over 
many 
years, 
without 
outside 
interference. 
41. 
In 
building 
a 
comprehensive 
strategy 
against 
nuclear 
weapons, 
Member 
States 
would 
rely 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
on 
the 
firm 
and 
solid 
foundation 
of 
the 
Agency. 
With 
political 
determination, 
an 
openness 
to 
new 
multilateral 
partnerships 
and 
the 
reliable, 
trusted 
help 
of 
the 
Agency, 
progress 
could 
be 
achieved 
over 
the 
coming 
years. 
The 
Ânew 
ageÂ 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
if 
it 
were 
to 
come 
about, 
must 
also 
become 
an 
age 
of 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
an 
age 
of 
cooperation 
and 
trust. 
5. 
Statement 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
42. 
The 
DIRECTOR 
GENERAL 
said 
that 
fifty 
years 
previously, 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
had 
been 
entrusted 
with 
the 
mission 
of 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
not 
become 
a 
cause 
for 
the 
destruction 
of 
humanity, 
but 
rather 
an 
engine 
for 
peace 
and 
prosperity. 
43. 
If 
the 
AgencyÂs 
history 
since 
that 
time 
were 
recalled, 
a 
number 
of 
milestones 
would 
stand 
out: 
the 
rapid 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
1960s 
and 
1970s; 
the 
landmark 
Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation 
Treaty 
of 
1970 
Â 
and 
the 
development 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
verification 
regime; 
the 
evolution 
of 
the 
technical 
assistance 
programme 
as 
a 
key 
vehicle 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
developing 
countries; 
and 
the 
development 
of 
international 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regimes. 
Throughout 
its 
history, 
the 
Agency 
had 
also 
faced 
a 
number 
of 
challenges 
and

painful 
experiences, 
necessitating 
change, 
adjustment 
and 
innovation: 
the 
1986 
accident 
at 
Chernobyl; 
the 
discovery 
of 
IraqÂs 
clandestine 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
in 
the 
early 
1990s; 
and 
the 
nuclear 
security 
challenge 
revealed 
in 
the 
aftermath 
of 
11 
September 
2001. 


44. 
In 
discussing 
recent 
developments 
and 
current 
challenges, 
it 
was 
important 
not 
to 
lose 
sight 
of 
the 
goals 
and 
ideals 
that 
had 
guided 
the 
Agency 
since 
its 
inception. 
They 
remained 
as 
relevant 
and 
meaningful 
today 
as 
they 
had 
been 
to 
the 
founders 
of 
the 
Agency. 
45. 
He 
had 
spoken 
in 
recent 
years 
of 
rising 
expectations 
for 
nuclear 
power. 
However, 
forecasting 
was 
always 
difficult. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
not 
so 
much 
to 
predict 
the 
future 
as 
to 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
plan 
and 
prepare 
for 
it. 
What 
seemed 
clear 
today 
was 
that 
there 
were 
three 
strong 
factors 
driving 
a 
renewed 
global 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power: 
the 
steady 
growth 
in 
energy 
demand; 
the 
increasing 
concerns 
about 
energy 
security; 
and 
the 
challenge 
of 
climate 
change. 
46. 
There 
were 
currently 
439 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
in 
operation 
in 
30 
countries. 
Those 
reactors 
supplied 
about 
15.2% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
electricity. 
To 
date, 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
concentrated 
in 
industrialized 
countries. 
However, 
the 
pattern 
was 
quite 
different 
in 
terms 
of 
new 
construction: 
15 
of 
the 
30 
reactors 
currently 
being 
built 
were 
in 
developing 
countries. 
47. 
The 
Agency 
had 
seen 
a 
substantial 
increase 
in 
requests 
for 
assistance 
with 
national 
energy 
studies. 
It 
was 
currently 
supporting 
studies 
in 
77 
Member 
States; 
29 
of 
those 
studies 
were 
exploring 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
potential 
option. 
48. 
Technological 
and 
institutional 
innovation, 
involving 
creative 
policy 
and 
infrastructure 
approaches, 
constituted 
a 
key 
factor 
in 
ensuring 
the 
long 
term 
sustainability 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
In 
some 
cases, 
a 
shared 
regional 
approach 
to 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure, 
construction 
and 
operation 
might 
be 
feasible. 
A 
good 
example 
was 
the 
ongoing 
cooperation 
among 
the 
Baltic 
States 
on 
energy 
strategies, 
which 
currently 
included 
collaboration 
with 
Poland 
on 
plans 
to 
construct 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
to 
help 
meet 
regional 
electricity 
demands. 
49. 
With 
regard 
to 
technology 
innovation, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
project 
had 
grown 
to 
28 
members. 
INPRO 
was 
now 
considering 
collaborative 
projects 
on 
specific 
technological 
issues 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
addressed 
for 
improved 
economics, 
safety, 
proliferation-resistance 
and 
other 
questions. 
It 
was 
also 
continuing 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
GIF. 
50. 
Given 
the 
fundamental 
importance 
of 
energy 
for 
development, 
it 
was 
important 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
actively 
pursue 
the 
design 
and 
production 
of 
small 
and 
intermediate-sized 
reactors. 
Successful 
production 
of 
safe 
and 
affordable 
reactors 
in 
that 
size 
range 
would 
be 
essential 
if 
nuclear 
power 
was 
to 
be 
a 
feasible 
option 
for 
countries 
and 
regions 
with 
small 
electrical 
grids. 
51. 
The 
expected 
expansion 
in 
nuclear 
power 
would 
drive 
a 
commensurate 
increase 
in 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services 
and 
the 
need 
for 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism. 
That 
could 
also 
increase 
the 
potential 
proliferation 
risks 
created 
by 
the 
spread 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology, 
particularly 
if 
more 
countries 
decided 
to 
create 
independent 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
plutonium 
separation 
facilities. 
Those 
trends 
pointed 
clearly 
to 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new, 
multilateral 
framework 
for 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
both 
the 
front 
and 
the 
back 
end. 
With 
respect 
to 
the 
front 
end, 
some 
parties 
had 
proposed 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
actual 
or 
virtual 
reserve 
fuel 
bank 
of 
last 
resort, 
under 
Agency 
auspices, 
for 
the 
assurance 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel. 
The 
bank 
would 
operate 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
apolitical 
and 
non-discriminatory 
non-proliferation 
criteria. 
Others 
were 
proposing 
to 
convert 
a 
national 
facility 
into 
an 
international 
enrichment 
centre, 
and 
there 
were 
other 
proposals 
to 
construct 
a 
new, 
multinational 
enrichment 
facility 
under 
Agency 
control. 
The 
Secretariat 
had 
examined 
those 
proposals 
and 
their 
associated 
legal, 
technical, 
financial 
and 
institutional 
aspects. 
In 
June, 
he 
had 

GC(51)/OR.1

reported 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
ÂoptionsÂ 
for 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
which 
he 
trusted 
would 
be 
of 
help 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
considering 
that 
important 
issue. 


52. 
Controlling 
nuclear 
material 
was 
a 
complex 
process; 
yet 
if 
no 
action 
were 
taken, 
it 
could 
be 
the 
AchillesÂ 
heel 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
In 
his 
view, 
an 
incremental 
approach 
was 
the 
way 
to 
move 
forward, 
beginning 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
equitable 
system 
for 
assurance 
of 
supply. 
The 
next 
step 
would 
seek 
to 
bring 
any 
new 
operations 
for 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
plutonium 
separation 
under 
multinational 
control. 
Over 
time, 
those 
multinational 
controls 
would 
also 
be 
extended 
to 
all 
facilities 
that 
already 
existed 
Â 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
countries 
were 
treated 
equally 
in 
terms 
of 
their 
nuclear 
capabilities. 
53. 
The 
Agency 
directed 
much 
of 
its 
scientific 
activity 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications 
related 
to 
health, 
agriculture, 
industry, 
water 
management 
and 
preservation 
of 
the 
environment. 
For 
example, 
since 
the 
previous 
September, 
the 
fundraising 
efforts 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
PACT 
programme 
had 
secured 
pledges, 
grants 
and 
donations 
amounting 
to 
over 
US 
$3 
million. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
its 
international 
partners, 
the 
Agency 
had 
continued 
to 
implement 
PACT 
Model 
Demonstration 
Sites 
to 
develop 
multidisciplinary 
cancer 
control 
capacity 
in 
Albania, 
Nicaragua, 
Sri 
Lanka, 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania, 
Vietnam 
and 
Yemen. 
As 
those 
projects 
matured, 
they 
would 
serve 
as 
platforms 
for 
larger 
scale 
regional 
fundraising. 
As 
with 
many 
other 
PACT 
activities, 
Agency 
collaboration 
with 
WHO 
had 
been 
steadily 
expanded 
through 
the 
development 
of 
the 
sites. 
54. 
For 
more 
than 
forty 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
benefited 
from 
an 
active 
partnership 
with 
the 
FAO 
through 
the 
Joint 
Division 
established 
in 
1967. 
With 
more 
than 
820 
million 
hungry 
people 
in 
the 
world, 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
food 
security 
and 
safety 
and 
increase 
crop 
productivity 
had 
never 
been 
more 
relevant. 
55. 
With 
thousands 
of 
new 
varieties 
of 
food 
crops 
released 
in 
dozens 
of 
countries 
over 
the 
past 
half 
century, 
plant 
breeding 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
real 
success 
stories 
of 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ. 
A 
recent 
regional 
project 
in 
Asia 
had 
used 
plant 
breeding 
to 
develop 
more 
than 
20 
new 
food 
crop 
varieties. 
For 
example, 
farmers 
in 
areas 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
affected 
by 
the 
December 
2004 
tsunami 
were 
now 
growing 
a 
high 
yielding, 
salinity 
tolerant 
variety 
of 
mung 
bean, 
a 
nutritious 
type 
of 
green 
bean. 
56. 
The 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
around 
the 
globe 
remained 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
With 
the 
renewed 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
generation, 
comparable 
attention 
and 
commitment 
must 
be 
given 
to 
ensuring 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
infrastructure 
that 
must 
go 
with 
it. 
57. 
The 
primary 
responsibility 
for 
safety 
rested 
with 
the 
operator 
of 
a 
nuclear 
facility 
or 
the 
user 
of 
a 
nuclear 
technique, 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
national 
government 
overseeing 
that 
operation 
or 
use. 
Technology 
could 
be 
transferred, 
but 
safety 
culture 
could 
not; 
it 
must 
be 
learned 
and 
embedded. 
For 
those 
countries 
embarking 
on 
nuclear 
power 
programmes, 
it 
was 
essential 
that 
they 
become 
part 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
and 
share 
responsibility 
for 
its 
sustainability. 
58. 
The 
strong, 
steady 
safety 
performance 
of 
recent 
years 
was 
reassuring. 
However, 
complacency, 
an 
overemphasis 
on 
cost 
savings, 
the 
impulse 
to 
cover 
up 
problems, 
or 
even 
falsification 
were 
hazards 
against 
which 
both 
operators 
and 
regulators 
must 
constantly 
guard. 
The 
recurrence 
of 
events 
with 
those 
characteristics 
made 
clear 
that 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
strong 
safety 
culture 
should 
always 
be 
viewed 
as 
a 
Âwork 
in 
progressÂ. 
59. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
review 
services 
used 
the 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
as 
a 
reference 
point 
and 
played 
an 
important 
part 
in 
evaluating 
their 
effectiveness. 
In 
2006 
the 
Agency 
had 
begun 
offering, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
the 
IRRS, 
which 
combined 
previous 
services 
ranging 
from 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
radiation 
safety 
to 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
Agency 
had 
conducted 
the 
first 
full-scope 

GC(51)/OR.1 
17 
September 
2007, 
Page 
9 


IRRS 
in 
France 
in 
November 
2006, 
covering 
all 
regulated 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
facilities, 
activities 
and 
practices. 
It 
had 
also 
conducted 
IRRS 
missions 
to 
Australia 
and 
Japan 
in 
June 
2007. 
With 
its 
modular 
approach, 
the 
IRRS 
was 
contributing 
towards 
a 
more 
active 
exchange 
of 
knowledge 
among 
senior 
regulators 
and 
harmonized 
regulatory 
approaches 
worldwide. 


60. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
had 
maintained 
its 
rapid 
pace 
of 
programme 
delivery. 
Implementation 
activities 
in 
2006 
had 
increased 
considerably 
over 
the 
previous 
year, 
and 
the 
indications 
were 
that 
implementation 
would 
again 
be 
high 
in 
2007. 
61. 
Among 
other 
efforts 
over 
the 
past 
year, 
the 
Agency 
had 
assisted 
in 
improving 
physical 
protection 
at 
facilities 
in 
nine 
States, 
helping 
to 
fix 
weaknesses 
in 
security 
systems 
at 
those 
facilities. 
It 
had 
also 
begun 
a 
project 
to 
help 
improve 
the 
security 
of 
research 
reactors 
that 
were 
supplied 
through 
Agency 
assistance, 
and 
it 
had 
started 
to 
address 
the 
security 
of 
transports 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
been 
able 
to 
assist 
29 
countries 
to 
improve 
their 
border 
detection 
capability. 
62. 
The 
Agency 
had 
started 
a 
process 
of 
transitioning 
from 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
strengthening 
nuclear 
security 
had 
been 
addressed 
as 
an 
ad 
hoc 
reaction 
to 
the 
prevailing 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
to 
a 
situation 
in 
which 
nuclear 
security 
would 
be 
addressed 
in 
a 
normative, 
sustainable 
manner. 
63. 
The 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
arms 
control 
regime 
continued 
to 
face 
a 
broad 
set 
of 
challenges. 
Effective 
verification 
must 
be 
supported 
by 
four 
essential 
elements: 
adequate 
legal 
authority; 
state-of-the-art 
technology; 
access 
to 
all 
relevant 
information; 
and 
sufficient 
human 
and 
financial 
resources. 
64. 
It 
was 
now 
more 
than 
ten 
years 
since 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
had 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Just 
over 
half 
of 
the 
162 
States 
with 
safeguards 
agreements 
currently 
had 
additional 
protocols 
in 
force. 
That 
included 
more 
than 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
countries 
with 
nuclear 
material 
under 
safeguards. 
But 
he 
would 
not 
call 
that 
satisfactory 
progress 
by 
any 
measure. 
More 
than 
100 
States 
had 
yet 
to 
conclude 
additional 
protocols, 
and 
31 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
not 
even 
brought 
into 
force 
their 
required 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency. 
65. 
He 
repeated 
that 
without 
safeguards 
agreements, 
the 
Agency 
could 
not 
provide 
any 
assurance 
about 
a 
StateÂs 
nuclear 
activities, 
and 
without 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
the 
Agency 
could 
not 
provide 
credible 
assurance 
regarding 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activity. 
He 
therefore 
urged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
bring 
into 
force 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
66. 
At 
the 
invitation 
of 
the 
DPRK, 
an 
Agency 
team 
had 
visited 
that 
country 
in 
June 
to 
work 
out 
agreed 
modalities 
for 
verification 
and 
monitoring 
by 
the 
Agency 
of 
the 
shutdown 
and 
sealing 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
The 
modalities 
had 
been 
implemented 
in 
subsequent 
visits. 
As 
of 
17 
July, 
the 
Agency 
been 
able 
to 
verify 
the 
DPRKÂs 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
67. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
return 
of 
the 
DPRK 
to 
the 
verification 
process 
and 
the 
active 
cooperation 
that 
the 
Agency 
team 
had 
received 
from 
the 
DPRK. 
The 
Agency 
looked 
forward 
to 
continuing 
to 
work 
with 
the 
DPRK 
as 
the 
verification 
process 
evolved. 
68. 
Regarding 
the 
implementation 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
he 
would 
make 
four 
points. 
First, 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
verify 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
in 
Iran. 
Iran 
had 
continued 
to 
provide 
the 
access 
and 
reporting 
needed 
to 
enable 
Agency 
verification 
in 
that 
regard. 
Second, 
Iran 
had 
provided 
the 
Agency 
with 
additional 
information 
and 
access 
needed 
to 
resolve 
a 
number 
of 
long 
outstanding 
issues, 
such 
as 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
past 
plutonium 
experiments. 
Third, 
contrary 
to 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
calling 
on 
Iran 
to 
take 
certain 
confidence-building 
measures, 
Iran 
had 
not 
suspended 
its 
enrichment-related 
activities, 
and 
was 
continuing 
with 
its 
construction 
of 
the 
heavy 
water 
reactor 
at 
Arak. 
That 
was 
regrettable. 
Fourth, 
while 
the 
Agency 
so 
far 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
verify 
certain 
important 
aspects 
relevant 
to 
the 
scope 
and 

GC(51)/OR.1

nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
Iran 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
agreed 
the 
past 
month 
on 
a 
work 
plan 
for 
resolving 
all 
outstanding 
verification 
issues. 
Those 
verification 
issues 
were 
at 
the 
core 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
confidence 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
programme 
and 
were 
what 
had 
prompted 
actions 
by 
the 
Security 
Council. 
IranÂs 
agreement 
on 
such 
a 
work 
plan, 
with 
a 
defined 
timeline 
Â 
in 
response 
to 
repeated 
requests 
by 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
Âwas 
therefore 
an 
important 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 
Naturally, 
IranÂs 
active 
cooperation 
and 
transparency 
was 
the 
key 
to 
full 
and 
timely 
implementation 
of 
the 
work 
plan. 
If 
the 
Agency 
were 
able 
to 
provide 
credible 
assurance 
about 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
past 
and 
current 
nuclear 
programme, 
that 
would 
go 
a 
long 
way 
towards 
building 
confidence 
about 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
could 
create 
the 
conditions 
for 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
durable 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue. 


69. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
mandate 
given 
to 
him 
by 
the 
General 
Conference, 
he 
had 
continued 
his 
consultations 
with 
the 
States 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
on 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
on 
the 
development 
of 
model 
agreements 
as 
a 
necessary 
step 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Middle 
East 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
The 
absence 
of 
such 
a 
zone 
reflected 
a 
major 
gap 
in 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
However, 
he 
regretted 
to 
say 
that, 
as 
in 
the 
past, 
he 
had 
no 
progress 
to 
report 
on 
either 
front. 
70. 
Fifty 
years 
previously, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
Â 
or 
the 
technical 
assistance 
programme, 
as 
it 
had 
then 
been 
known 
Â 
had 
looked 
very 
different. 
Member 
States 
lacked 
basic 
nuclear 
capacities, 
and 
the 
programme 
focused 
on 
building 
up 
nuclear 
expertise 
and 
helping 
give 
birth 
to 
the 
institutions 
and 
facilities 
that 
would 
support 
the 
safe 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
71. 
Today 
the 
picture 
had 
changed, 
due 
to 
the 
evolution 
of 
skills, 
infrastructure 
and 
needs 
in 
the 
Member 
States 
themselves. 
Several 
Member 
States 
were 
leaving 
behind 
their 
developing 
country 
status. 
The 
development 
of 
nuclear 
capacities 
and 
infrastructure 
in 
some 
regions 
had 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
SouthÂSouth 
cooperation, 
stimulating 
an 
increase 
in 
regional 
self-sufficiency 
and 
an 
expansion 
in 
collective, 
specialized 
expertise. 
Opportunities 
for 
cooperative 
ventures 
Â 
such 
as 
shared 
multinational 
management 
of 
common 
underground 
water 
aquifers, 
transborder 
programmes 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
disease 
vectors 
such 
as 
insect 
pests, 
and 
jointly 
owned 
and 
managed 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
Â 
were 
coming 
to 
the 
drawing 
board, 
adding 
new 
significance 
to 
technical 
cooperation. 
Those 
were 
positive 
trends. 
72. 
After 
prolonged 
discussions, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
recommended 
in 
July 
a 
budget 
for 
2008Â2009. 
That 
process 
had 
once 
again 
highlighted 
the 
urgent 
need 
for 
adequate 
resources 
to 
ensure 
effective 
delivery 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
as 
mandated 
by 
the 
Statute 
and 
as 
requested 
by 
its 
Member 
States. 
The 
Agency 
remained 
quite 
under-funded 
in 
many 
critical 
areas, 
a 
situation 
which, 
if 
it 
remained 
unaddressed, 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
steady 
erosion 
of 
its 
ability 
to 
perform 
key 
functions. 
That 
was 
not 
a 
sustainable 
approach 
to 
meeting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
financial 
needs. 
73. 
To 
remedy 
the 
untenable 
situation, 
he 
had 
tasked 
the 
Secretariat 
with 
conducting 
a 
detailed 
review 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
in 
the 
next 
decade 
in 
light 
of 
its 
statutory 
obligations, 
decisions 
of 
the 
Policy-making 
Organs 
and 
foreseen 
high 
priority 
activities, 
and 
of 
what 
resources 
would 
be 
needed 
to 
fund 
those 
activities. 
The 
study 
had 
been 
given 
the 
name 
Â20/20Â, 
reflecting 
the 
effort 
to 
look 
ahead 
to 
the 
year 
2020 
with 
the 
clearest 
possible 
vision. 
He 
intended 
to 
set 
up 
a 
high-level 
panel 
of 
experts 
to 
review 
the 
report, 
including 
providing 
guidance 
on 
appropriate 
funding 
levels 
and 
mechanisms. 
The 
report 
and 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
panel 
of 
experts 
would 
be 
presented 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
for 
consideration. 
74. 
As 
he 
had 
stated 
in 
2006, 
fifty 
years 
after 
the 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
initiative, 
the 
time 
had 
come 
to 
think 
of 
a 
new 
framework 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
Â 
a 
framework 
that 
accounted 
both 
for 
the 
lessons 
learned 
and 
the 
current 
reality. 
That 
new 
framework 
should 
in 
his 
view 
include 
swift 
and

concrete 
action 
to 
achieve 
a 
number 
of 
elements: 
first, 
robust 
technological 
development 
and 
innovation 
in 
nuclear 
power 
and 
nuclear 
applications; 
second, 
a 
new 
multinational 
framework 
for 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
both 
the 
front 
and 
the 
back 
end, 
to 
assure 
supply 
and 
curb 
proliferation 
risk; 
third, 
universal 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
as 
the 
standard 
for 
nuclear 
verification, 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
assurance 
about 
declared 
activities 
as 
well 
as 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
activities; 
fourth, 
recognition 
of 
the 
linkage 
between 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
and 
of 
the 
need 
for 
concrete 
and 
rapid 
progress 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament 
Â 
through 
deep 
cuts 
in 
existing 
arsenals, 
downgrading 
of 
alert 
levels 
for 
deployed 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
resuscitation 
of 
multilateral 
disarmament 
efforts 
Â 
starting 
with 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
the 
CTBT 
and 
the 
initiation 
of 
negotiations 
on 
a 
treaty 
that 
banned 
the 
production 
of 
nuclear 
material 
for 
weapons 
purposes 
and 
placed 
it 
under 
effective 
international 
control; 
fifth, 
a 
robust 
international 
security 
regime, 
in 
light 
of 
the 
diverse 
threats 
that 
the 
world 
faced; 
sixth, 
an 
effective 
and 
universal 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
that 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
for 
any 
expansion 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power; 
and 
seventh, 
sufficient 
funding 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
meet 
its 
increasing 
responsibilities 
in 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
manner. 


75. 
Before 
concluding, 
he 
emphasized 
that 
with 
regard 
to 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
Agency 
activity 
Â 
technology, 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
verification, 
international 
cooperation 
was 
key. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
fortunate 
to 
be 
based 
in 
a 
country 
that 
placed 
a 
high 
value 
on 
multilateralism 
and 
dialogue. 
It 
was 
no 
small 
compliment 
that 
that 
had 
become 
known 
as 
the 
Spirit 
of 
Vienna. 
Throughout 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fifty 
years, 
Austria 
had 
been 
an 
exceptionally 
gracious 
host. 
He 
paid 
tribute, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States, 
to 
the 
fifty 
years 
of 
generous 
hospitality 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria, 
and 
in 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
presence 
at 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Federal 
Minister 
for 
European 
and 
International 
Affairs, 
Ms. 
Ursula 
Plassnik, 
and 
thanked 
her 
for 
her 
inspiring 
and 
thought-provoking 
speech. 
76. 
At 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
statement, 
he 
had 
highlighted 
some 
of 
the 
challenges 
and 
achievements 
that 
stood 
out 
from 
a 
review 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
history. 
If 
one 
were 
to 
step 
closer 
and 
review 
that 
history 
in 
greater 
detail, 
there 
would 
be 
many 
other 
challenges 
and 
achievements, 
less 
dramatic 
perhaps, 
but 
equally 
reflective 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
ideal. 
One 
might 
notice 
the 
progress 
and 
setbacks 
in 
achieving 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
mission 
and 
the 
development 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
There 
had 
been 
the 
eradication 
of 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
in 
Zanzibar. 
One 
would 
note 
the 
assistance 
of 
international 
experts 
in 
helping 
country 
after 
country 
improve 
their 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
programmes, 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
networks 
and 
a 
host 
of 
safety 
conventions, 
and 
the 
sharp 
increase 
in 
assistance 
to 
Agency 
Member 
States 
in 
tightening 
border 
controls, 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
and 
improving 
the 
radiation 
protection 
of 
patients. 
77. 
And 
yet 
if 
one 
were 
to 
step 
even 
closer, 
one 
would 
see 
the 
day-to-day 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
staff: 
scientists, 
engineers, 
support 
staff, 
lawyers, 
managers, 
technicians, 
specialists 
and 
generalists 
of 
every 
description, 
and 
also 
the 
day-to-day 
efforts 
of 
Member 
State 
representatives 
Â 
those 
present 
today 
and 
in 
capitals, 
policy 
makers, 
scientists, 
diplomats 
and 
civil 
servants 
Â 
working 
in 
support 
of 
Agency 
goals. 
Those 
efforts 
might 
be 
less 
dramatic. 
However, 
it 
was 
when 
the 
picture 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
history 
was 
viewed 
in 
its 
totality 
that 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
could 
really 
be 
understood. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
mission 
was 
a 
continuous 
one, 
in 
good 
times 
and 
bad, 
and 
its 
professionalism, 
impartiality 
and 
independence 
were 
crucial 
both 
publicly 
and 
behind 
the 
scenes. 
78. 
As 
he 
had 
said 
in 
Oslo, 
when 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
honoured 
with 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
Â 
another 
landmark 
in 
its 
history, 
Âa 
durable 
peace 
is 
not 
a 
single 
achievement, 
but 
an 
environment, 
a 
process 
and 
a 
commitment.Â 
It 
was 
with 
that 
understanding 
that 
the 
organization 
looked 
to 
the 
future.

Contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2008 
(GC(51)/28) 


79. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
on 
14 
June 
2007, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
recommended 
a 
figure 
of 
US 
$80 
million 
as 
the 
target 
for 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
the 
year 
2008. 
Document 
GC(51/)28 
had 
attached 
to 
it 
a 
table 
showing 
the 
contributions 
that 
each 
Member 
State 
would 
need 
to 
make 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
its 
share 
of 
that 
target. 
80. 
The 
early 
pledging 
and 
payment 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
greatly 
helped 
the 
Secretariat 
in 
planning 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
All 
delegations 
in 
a 
position 
to 
do 
so 
were 
therefore 
urged 
to 
notify 
the 
Secretariat 
during 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
contributions 
that 
their 
Governments 
would 
be 
making 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
2008. 
81. 
He 
would 
report 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
session, 
under 
a 
later 
agenda 
item, 
on 
the 
contributions 
that 
had 
been 
pledged 
up 
to 
that 
time. 
He 
hoped 
that 
he 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
report 
favourably 
on 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
2008 
target 
figure 
already 
pledged.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(GC(51)/5) 


82. 
Mr. 
BOUOUNY 
(Tunisia), 
congratulating 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
50th 
anniversary, 
said 
that 
Tunisia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
States 
to 
ratify 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
in 
1957. 
His 
country 
gave 
high 
priority 
to 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development 
and 
was 
implementing 
an 
integrated 
national 
technological 
research 
and 
development 
programme. 
Expenditure 
on 
research 
and 
development 
had 
accounted 
for 
1% 
of 
gross 
domestic 
product 
in 
2004, 
a 
ratio 
that 
was 
expected 
to 
increase 
to 
1.25% 
by 
2009. 
Tunisia 
was 
also 
strongly 
convinced 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology. 
Its 
energy 
needs 
were 
steadily 
growing, 
and 
rising 
prices 
on 
international 
markets 
adversely 
affected 
its 
development 
efforts. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
limited 
fossil 
energy 
resources, 
Tunisia 
was 
looking 
for 
alternatives 
to 
traditional 
fuel 
sources 
and 
planned 
to 
launch 
a 
medium-power 
nuclear 
electricity 
generating 
plant 
by 
2020. 
83. 
Tunisia 
was 
also 
interested 
in 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
produce 
drinking 
water 
because 
of 
its 
location 
in 
a 
region 
that 
needed 
to 
manage 
carefully 
its 
scarce 
water 
resources 
and 
make 
use 
of 
various 
desalination 
technologies. 
It 
therefore 
supported 
all 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
use 
small-and 
medium-
sized 
reactors 
for 
that 
purpose. 
84. 
Tunisia 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
establish 
an 
international 
regime 
based 
on 
principles 
of 
solidarity, 
peace, 
justice 
and 
equality, 
and 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
assist 
it 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
mandate 
under 
the 
best 
possible 
circumstances. 
85. 
During 
the 
current 
year, 
the 
Agency 
was 
continuing 
to 
fund 
17 
national 
projects 
in 
Tunisia; 
his 
country 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
41 
African 
regional 
projects 
and 
7 
interregional 
projects. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
provided 
training 
facilities 
for 
national 
staff 
in 
various 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology. 
Tunisia 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
strengthening 
of 
such 
support 
under 
a 
country 
programme 
framework 
on 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
that 
it 
hoped 
to 
sign 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
In 
that 
context 
it 
also 
hoped 
to 
implement 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
that 
it 
had 
submitted 
for 
the 
period 
2009-2011.

86. 
Tunisia 
consistently 
paid 
its 
share 
of 
the 
Regular 
Budget, 
its 
target 
for 
voluntary 
contributions 
and 
funding 
for 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
It 
also 
continued 
to 
implement 
the 
agreed 
programme 
for 
the 
payment 
of 
arrears 
in 
respect 
of 
such 
projects. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
announce 
that 
Tunisia 
planned 
to 
pay 
its 
share 
of 
the 
target 
for 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
the 
coming 
year. 
87. 
Tunisia 
had 
completed 
the 
formalities 
required 
to 
accept 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
IV.A 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
It 
had 
also 
taken 
the 
necessary 
constitutional 
steps 
to 
accept 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
and 
would 
inform 
the 
Agency 
of 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
formalities 
in 
due 
course. 
88. 
Tunisia 
took 
a 
strong 
interest 
in 
joint 
Arab 
work 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency, 
which 
operated 
on 
the 
same 
principles 
as 
the 
Agency 
and 
which 
had 
its 
headquarters 
in 
Tunis. 
He 
therefore 
called 
for 
closer 
cooperation 
between 
the 
two 
Agencies. 
89. 
Tunisia 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
27 
AFRA 
projects. 
It 
had 
also 
organized 
a 
number 
of 
training 
courses 
under 
AFRAÂs 
auspices 
and 
had 
enabled 
Tunisian 
experts 
to 
attend 
AFRA 
training 
courses 
and 
workshops. 
90. 
The 
bilateral 
cooperation 
agreement 
on 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
between 
the 
National 
Nuclear 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Centre 
in 
Tunis 
and 
the 
French 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
been 
renewed 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2006. 
During 
the 
past 
decade 
the 
agreement 
had 
resulted 
in 
a 
number 
of 
major 
projects, 
including 
the 
installation 
of 
an 
electronic 
accelerator 
radiotherapy 
unit 
and 
the 
training 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
Tunisian 
experts. 
He 
took 
the 
opportunity 
to 
thank 
the 
French 
authorities 
and 
the 
Agency, 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
their 
productive 
cooperation 
would 
continue 
in 
the 
future. 
91. 
Tunisia 
took 
the 
view 
that 
States 
that 
enjoyed 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
should 
also 
comply 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
NPT, 
conclude 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
accede 
to 
other 
relevant 
treaties, 
especially 
the 
CPPNM, 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention. 
They 
should 
also 
comply 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
other 
regulations 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct 
as 
well 
as 
with 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
relevant 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
especially 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
In 
return, 
the 
countries 
concerned 
would 
have 
unimpeded 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
achieve 
their 
sustainable 
development 
goals. 
States 
that 
complied 
with 
the 
NPT 
were 
guaranteed 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
to 
develop 
a 
diversified 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
developed 
countries 
had 
a 
duty 
to 
assist 
others 
in 
achieving 
that 
aim. 
92. 
The 
international 
community 
would 
not 
fully 
succeed 
in 
averting 
the 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
by 
enhancing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
thereby 
promoting 
international 
peace 
and 
stability 
unless 
such 
action 
was 
combined 
with 
vigorous 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
without 
exception 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Tunisia 
reiterated 
its 
call 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
particularly 
nuclear 
weapons, 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
urged 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
take 
appropriate 
steps 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal, 
especially 
by 
placing 
all 
nuclear 
facilities, 
including 
those 
of 
Israel, 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
93. 
Mr 
CRAVINHO 
(Portugal), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
that 
the 
candidate 
countries 
Croatia, 
the 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia 
and 
Turkey, 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Stabilization 
and 
Association 
Process 
and 
potential 
candidates 
Albania, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
Montenegro 
and 
Serbia, 
the 
EFTA 
country 
Iceland, 
member 
of 
the 
European 
Economic 
Area, 
as 
well 
as 
Moldova 
and 
Ukraine, 
associated 
themselves 
with 
the 
statement 
that 
he 
was 
about 
to 
make.

94. 
The 
European 
Union 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
dedication 
and 
commitment 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
through 
its 
activities 
as 
the 
focal 
point 
for 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
safety, 
and 
wished 
the 
Agency 
further 
success 
in 
the 
years 
ahead. 
95. 
The 
most 
important 
challenges 
to 
non-proliferation 
currently 
being 
faced 
by 
the 
international 
community 
were 
non-compliance 
with 
the 
safeguards 
obligations 
stemming 
from 
the 
NPT 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
highly 
sensitive 
nuclear 
items. 
Those 
challenges 
had 
acute 
implications 
for 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
for 
its 
current 
programme 
of 
work. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
Â 
an 
instrument 
that 
was 
becoming 
ever 
more 
vital 
as 
threats 
increased. 
The 
European 
Union 
had 
committed 
itself 
actively 
to 
a 
positive 
outcome 
of 
the 
first 
Preparatory 
Committee 
meeting 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference; 
it 
was 
essential 
that 
the 
current 
NPT 
review 
cycle 
produce 
tangible 
results 
that 
built 
on 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
NPT 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
regime 
and 
to 
strengthen 
its 
implementation. 
96. 
The 
prime 
objective 
of 
safeguards 
was 
to 
detect 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
for 
use 
in 
nuclear 
weapons. 
As 
such, 
they 
were 
an 
essential 
tool 
in 
support 
of 
the 
political 
goal 
of 
sustaining 
an 
environment 
in 
which 
nuclear 
energy 
should 
be 
used 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
NPT. 
It 
was 
well 
known 
that 
some 
States 
with 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
force 
had 
still 
developed 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes, 
illustrating 
the 
limitations 
inherent 
in 
those 
agreements. 
The 
European 
Union 
considered 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
additional 
protocols 
constituted 
the 
current 
Agency 
verification 
standard. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that, 
as 
of 
December 
2006, 
31 
States 
Parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
not 
yet 
brought 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
into 
force 
and 
that 
more 
than 
100 
States 
had 
no 
additional 
protocol 
in 
force. 
The 
European 
Union 
therefore 
encouraged 
all 
States 
to 
sign, 
ratify 
and 
implement 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
to 
undertake 
the 
necessary 
steps 
to 
bring 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
into 
force 
without 
delay. 
97. 
The 
European 
Union 
fully 
endorsed 
the 
Director 
General's 
call 
for 
full 
cooperation 
from 
all 
States 
in 
tracing 
the 
supply 
routes 
and 
sources 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
related 
materials. 
It 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
strong 
national 
and 
internationally 
coordinated 
export 
controls 
in 
order 
to 
tackle 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
procurement 
networks, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
threat 
of 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
by 
non-State 
actors. 
The 
European 
Union 
urged 
all 
States 
with 
SQPs 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
conclude 
an 
exchange 
of 
letters 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
give 
effect 
to 
the 
standardized 
text 
and 
modified 
criteria 
in 
order 
to 
reinforce 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
98. 
The 
European 
Union 
reaffirmed 
its 
understanding 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
as 
the 
final 
arbiter 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
in 
order 
to 
take 
appropriate 
action 
in 
the 
event 
of 
non-
compliance 
with 
NPT 
obligations. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
had 
to 
address 
a 
number 
of 
challenges 
to 
the 
safeguards 
system 
that 
had 
put 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
under 
pressure. 
While 
much 
remained 
to 
be 
achieved 
in 
order 
to 
dismantle 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme, 
the 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
developments 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
The 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
facilities 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
measures 
by 
the 
Agency 
were 
significant 
first 
steps 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
the 
dismantlement 
of 
the 
programme. 
The 
European 
Union 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
swift 
and 
full 
implementation 
of 
commitments 
contained 
in 
the 
19 
September 
2005 
Joint 
Statement. 
It 
also 
called 
upon 
the 
DPRK 
to 
implement 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
1718 
(2006) 
and 
abandon 
promptly 
and 
dismantle 
completely 
the 
nuclear 
weapons-related 
programme 
in 
a 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
Union 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
continued 
implementation 
of 
the 
ad 
hoc 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
arrangement 
between 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
shut 
down, 
seal 
and 
dismantle 
the 
Yongbyon 
facilities 
in 
a 
complete, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
exploring 
possibilities 
of 
making 
a 
specific 
contribution 
to 
the 
Agency's 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
activities 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would

return 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
under 
the 
NPT, 
and 
towards 
full 
compliance 
with 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
1718 
(2006). 


99. 
The 
European 
Union 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
continuing 
professional 
and 
impartial 
efforts 
in 
implementing 
verification 
activities 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
in 
trying 
to 
resolve 
the 
long 
outstanding 
issues 
relating 
to 
the 
nature 
and 
history 
of 
that 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
rightly 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
IranÂs 
compliance 
with 
international 
calls 
to 
build 
confidence; 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
work 
plan 
could 
contribute 
to 
that 
objective. 
The 
Union 
hoped 
that 
the 
understandings 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
the 
modalities 
of 
resolution 
of 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
would 
lead 
without 
further 
delay 
to 
the 
long-
awaited 
answers 
from 
Iran. 
The 
Union 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
the 
resolution 
of 
the 
outstanding 
issue 
of 
IranÂs 
P-1 
and 
P-2 
centrifuge 
technology, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
work 
plan, 
and 
hoped 
that 
that 
issue 
would 
be 
completely 
resolved 
by 
the 
November 
session 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
The 
Union 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
Secretariat 
reporting 
on 
that 
issue. 
100. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
fulfilled 
the 
obligations 
established 
by 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
1696 
(2006), 
1737 
(2006) 
and 
1747 
(2007) 
or 
taken 
the 
steps 
required 
by 
the 
Board. 
The 
Union 
deeply 
regretted, 
in 
particular, 
that 
Iran 
had 
continued, 
and 
even 
further 
developed, 
its 
enrichment 
activities, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
heavy 
water 
reactor 
at 
Arak. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
General's 
appeal 
for 
a 
'double 
time-out' 
of 
all 
enrichment-related 
activities 
and 
of 
sanctions. 
The 
European 
Union 
would 
support 
the 
suspension 
of 
sanctions 
if 
the 
Agency 
verified 
that 
Iran 
had 
entirely 
suspended 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
It 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
efforts 
to 
find 
a 
negotiated 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue. 
A 
comprehensive 
package, 
which 
included 
active 
support 
in 
building 
new 
light 
water 
power 
reactors 
using 
state 
of 
the 
art 
technology, 
had 
been 
proposed 
to 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
in 
June 
2006 
and 
again 
more 
recently. 
The 
door 
to 
negotiations 
remained 
open, 
with 
Iran 
having 
consistently 
been 
offered 
the 
option 
of 
re-entering 
negotiations. 
101. 
Multilateralizing 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
was 
a 
challenging 
objective 
with 
roots 
already 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
founding 
documents. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
report 
concerning 
possible 
new 
frameworks 
for 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy: 
options 
for 
the 
assurance 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
and 
had 
presented 
to 
the 
Secretariat 
a 
non-paper 
on 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
which 
contained 
a 
set 
of 
criteria 
against 
which 
proposals 
could 
be 
assessed. 
It 
was 
of 
great 
importance 
not 
only 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
the 
issue, 
but 
also 
to 
build 
consensus, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
European 
Union 
Member 
States 
had 
presented 
individual 
contributions 
on 
the 
subject. 
Efforts 
should 
be 
pursued 
to 
develop 
access 
guarantees 
and 
establish 
relevant 
multilateral 
provisions 
without 
unduly 
interfering 
with 
market 
conditions. 
102. 
A 
number 
of 
important 
developments 
relevant 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
recently 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
European 
Union. 
In 
March 
2007 
the 
European 
Council 
had 
adopted 
a 
global 
plan 
of 
action 
on 
energy 
for 
2007Â2009; 
it 
had 
noted 
the 
European 
CommissionÂs 
assessment 
of 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
meeting 
the 
growing 
concerns 
about 
safety 
of 
energy 
supply 
and 
carbon 
dioxide 
emission 
reductions, 
while 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
were 
paramount 
in 
the 
decision-making 
process; 
confirmed 
that 
it 
was 
for 
each 
and 
every 
Member 
State 
to 
decide 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
rely 
on 
nuclear 
energy; 
stressed 
that 
that 
had 
to 
be 
done 
while 
further 
improving 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste; 
and 
suggested 
that 
broad 
discussion 
on 
the 
opportunities 
and 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
take 
place 
among 
all 
relevant 
stakeholders. 
103. 
The 
European 
Commission 
had 
also 
put 
forward 
an 
illustrative 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
indicated 
that 
greater 
harmonization 
of 
safety 
requirements 
for 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
European 
Union 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
the 
future 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
In 
July 
2007, 
the 
European 
Commission 
had 
established 
a 
high-level 
group 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
The 

GC(51)/OR.1

European 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Forum 
would 
begin 
its 
work 
in 
Bratislava, 
Slovakia, 
in 
November 
2007, 
bringing 
together 
representatives 
from 
government, 
industry 
and 
civil 
society. 
Furthermore, 
a 
technology 
platform 
on 
sustainable 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
be 
launched 
by 
the 
European 
Commission 
in 
September 
2007 
to 
coordinate 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
terms 
of 
research 
infrastructure 
and 
technological 
development. 


104. 
With 
regard 
to 
investments 
in 
the 
nuclear 
power 
sector, 
the 
European 
Investment 
Bank 
had 
indicated 
in 
July 
2007 
that 
financing 
might 
be 
requested 
for 
new 
generation 
capacity, 
in 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
in 
research 
activities, 
subject 
to 
certain 
conditions 
and 
bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
right 
of 
individual 
Member 
States 
to 
determine 
their 
energy 
mix. 
105. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
every 
effort 
made 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
develop 
a 
strong 
management 
and 
a 
clear 
definition 
of 
cross-cutting 
activities. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
financial 
and 
human 
resources 
to 
meet 
effectively 
its 
overall 
responsibilities 
related 
to 
technical 
cooperation. 
European 
Union 
Member 
States 
not 
only 
contributed 
a 
substantial 
share 
of 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
but 
also 
provided 
significant 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
ensure 
that 
resources 
from 
the 
TCF 
were 
spent 
first 
and 
foremost 
in 
developing 
countries 
that 
had 
actually 
contributed 
to 
the 
Fund; 
the 
European 
Union 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
contribute 
in 
full, 
and 
on 
time, 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
likewise 
to 
make 
voluntary 
contributions. 
106. 
Enhanced 
coordination 
among 
all 
relevant 
parties 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
an 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
impact 
on 
human 
health, 
agricultural 
development, 
the 
environment 
and 
other 
areas. 
The 
European 
Union 
endorsed 
the 
encouragement 
from 
the 
External 
Auditor 
to 
improve 
interaction 
with 
United 
Nations 
organizations 
and 
other 
institutions, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
that 
regard 
by 
the 
Agency, 
a 
positive 
example 
of 
which 
was 
PACT. 
107. 
The 
European 
Union 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide. 
Although 
safety 
was 
mainly 
a 
national 
responsibility, 
its 
implications 
went 
beyond 
national 
boundaries; 
its 
continuous 
improvement 
must 
be 
a 
priority 
for 
all 
Member 
States, 
and 
international 
cooperation 
on 
the 
issue 
was 
crucial. 
The 
European 
Union 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
fostering 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
and, 
in 
particular, 
efforts 
to 
update 
and 
extend 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards. 
108. 
The 
European 
Union 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response, 
and 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
become 
contracting 
parties 
to 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
Early 
Assistance 
Convention 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
It 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
installation 
safety; 
all 
States 
with 
nuclear 
facilities 
should 
make 
use 
of 
Agency 
expertise 
and 
consider 
peer-review 
missions 
such 
as 
OSART 
and 
IRRS. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
work 
on 
improving 
the 
safety 
of 
research 
reactors, 
in 
particular 
through 
implementation 
of 
the 
relevant 
code 
of 
conduct. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
with 
their 
respective 
peer 
review 
mechanisms, 
constituted 
important 
tools 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
The 
European 
Union 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
them 
without 
further 
delay. 
109. 
The 
European 
Union 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
following 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
it 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
European 
directive 
on 
the 
control 
of 
high-activity 
sealed 
sources 
and 
orphan 
sources. 
The 
European 
Union 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
declare 
their 
political 
commitment 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct. 
Safety 
and 
security 
were 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
when 
transporting 
radioactive 
material 
within 
or 
across 
the 
borders, 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
noted 
with 
appreciation 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
that 
area 
and 
recognized 
the 
usefulness 
of 
the 
TranSAS 
in 
promoting 
the 
strict 
application 
of

the 
Transport 
Regulations. 
The 
European 
Union 
also 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
continuing 
work 
of 
the 
INLEX 
Group. 


110. 
Highly 
effective 
levels 
of 
safety, 
safeguards 
and 
security 
in 
all 
aspects 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
were 
an 
indispensable 
condition 
for 
the 
exercise 
of 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
Parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
was 
indisputable 
that 
the 
right 
to 
peaceful 
use 
could 
be 
exercised 
only 
by 
NPT 
States 
Parties 
and 
in 
accordance 
with 
NPT 
obligations. 
111. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
education 
and 
training 
programmes 
which 
met 
the 
needs 
of 
both 
developing 
and 
developed 
countries 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
as 
founding 
supporter 
of 
the 
World 
Nuclear 
University 
deserved 
wholehearted 
recognition 
and 
support. 
The 
European 
Union 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
development 
of 
projects 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles, 
which 
might 
improve 
safety, 
non-proliferation, 
and 
the 
minimization 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
unique 
role 
through 
INPRO 
in 
bringing 
together 
all 
interested 
Member 
States 
to 
consider 
jointly 
innovations 
in 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycle 
systems. 
112. 
The 
CPPNM 
was 
one 
of 
the 
instruments 
that 
underpinned 
the 
international 
nuclear 
security 
framework; 
the 
European 
Union 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
Convention 
entered 
into 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
and 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
Convention, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
its 
amendment. 
113. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
the 
major 
donor 
to 
the 
NSF, 
and 
had 
adopted 
joint 
actions 
in 
support 
of 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
verification. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
providing 
assistance 
to 
third 
countries 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
the 
security 
and 
safety 
of 
their 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
highly 
radioactive 
sources, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
combating 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials. 
114. 
The 
European 
Union 
supported 
the 
conversion 
of 
surplus 
nuclear 
weapons 
material 
into 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
civilian 
use, 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
sites, 
and 
the 
assistance 
to 
countries 
to 
enhance 
their 
export 
controls. 
It 
had 
provided 
technical 
assistance 
covering 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
nuclear 
security 
to 
the 
successor 
States 
of 
the 
Soviet 
Union 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
candidate 
States 
under 
the 
TACIS 
and 
Phare 
programmes, 
and 
the 
geographical 
scope 
of 
that 
assistance 
was 
now 
being 
broadened 
under 
the 
Instrument 
for 
Stability, 
the 
Instrument 
for 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Cooperation, 
and 
the 
Instrument 
for 
Pre-accession 
Assistance, 
which 
had 
replaced 
the 
Phare 
programme 
and 
TACIS. 
115. 
The 
European 
Union 
attributed 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism, 
and 
strongly 
supported 
all 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear, 
biological, 
chemical 
and 
radiological 
weapons 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
General 
AssemblyÂs 
unanimous 
adoption 
of 
the 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
on 
7 
July 
2007, 
and 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
it 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
The 
European 
Union 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
implement 
those 
provisions 
of 
the 
Convention 
that 
had 
particular 
relevance 
for 
the 
Agency. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
European 
Union 
noted 
with 
appreciation 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
through 
its 
ongoing 
activities 
and 
technical 
expertise. 
116. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
worldÂs 
focal 
point 
for 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
had 
an 
indispensable 
global 
role 
in 
nuclear 
verification. 
Competence, 
commitment, 
independence 
and 
neutrality 
had 
been 
the 
AgencyÂs 
criteria 
in 
responding 
to 
the 
requests 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
reiterated 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
Agency. 
117. 
Mr. 
AGHAZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
the 
51st 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
to 
give 
details 
of 
the 
discrimination 
it 
had 
suffered 
during 
thirty 
years 
of 
injustice. 
Before 
the 
Islamic 
revolution,

States 
research 
and 
planning 
institutes 
had 
been 
about 
to 
conduct 
studies 
with 
a 
view 
to 
producing 
23 
000 
MW 
of 
nuclear 
electricity 
in 
Iran. 
Construction 
of 
the 
Bushehr 
power 
plant 
had 
begun 
and 
contracts 
for 
building 
two 
more 
plants 
and 
supplying 
them 
with 
fuel 
had 
been 
concluded 
with 
France. 
Moreover, 
it 
had 
been 
decided 
that 
Iran 
would 
be 
provided 
with 
a 
considerable 
amount 
of 
yellowcake 
processed 
in 
the 
United 
Kingdom. 
In 
other 
words, 
a 
race 
had 
begun 
to 
build 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
Iran 
and 
to 
develop 
increasingly 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
countryÂs 
future 
energy 
needs. 


118. 
Since 
the 
revolution, 
cooperation, 
including 
that 
to 
complete 
the 
Bushehr 
plant, 
had 
ceased. 
France 
had 
terminated 
its 
activities 
regardless 
of 
its 
contractual 
obligations. 
It 
had 
confiscated 
50 
tons 
of 
uranium 
hexafluoride 
due 
to 
be 
delivered 
to 
Iran, 
its 
main 
legal 
owner; 
equipment 
worth 
billions 
of 
dollars 
bought 
by 
Iran 
for 
the 
Bushehr 
plant 
had 
been 
allowed 
to 
decay 
in 
Italian 
and 
German 
ports; 
and 
Siemens 
had 
refused 
to 
deliver 
the 
fuel 
needed 
to 
operate 
the 
plant. 
It 
had 
been 
decided 
to 
discontinue 
cooperation, 
and 
any 
country 
that 
cooperated 
with 
Iran 
in 
the 
area 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
put 
under 
pressure. 
Although 
it 
complied 
with 
the 
NPT, 
Iran 
had 
faced 
sanctions, 
proof 
of 
the 
double 
standards 
applied 
by 
some 
Western 
countries 
to 
nuclear 
energy. 
119. 
Four 
years 
after 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
had 
come 
to 
international 
attention, 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
certain 
Western 
countries 
were 
not 
interested 
in 
the 
removal 
of 
ambiguities 
about 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
but 
were 
rather 
adhering 
to 
the 
cessation 
and 
privation 
policy. 
Over 
those 
four 
years, 
Iran 
had 
been 
subjected 
to 
increasing 
unilateral 
pressure 
through 
abuse 
of 
the 
international 
media 
and 
other 
tools. 
As 
proof 
of 
its 
goodwill, 
Iran 
had 
taken 
successive 
positive 
steps 
towards 
cooperation, 
but 
its 
flexibility 
had 
been 
met 
only 
with 
hostile 
demands 
for 
the 
cessation 
of 
all 
nuclear 
activities. 
Whereas 
Iran 
had 
cooperated 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
taken 
a 
technical 
and 
professional 
approach, 
some 
Western 
countries 
had 
behaved 
in 
an 
illegal 
and 
deceptive 
manner, 
imposing 
restrictions 
and 
sanctions 
against 
his 
country. 
Moreover, 
Iran 
had 
received 
no 
appropriate 
response 
to 
its 
proposal 
to 
reassure 
the 
international 
community 
by 
establishing 
an 
international 
consortium 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
country's 
uranium 
enrichment 
programme. 
120. 
Iran 
had 
reached 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
modalities 
for 
removing 
ambiguities 
regarding 
its 
nuclear 
agenda. 
Nevertheless, 
one 
country 
was 
making 
irrational 
attacks 
on 
Iran, 
in 
defiance 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community. 
Iran 
had 
done 
all 
it 
could 
to 
create 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
dialogue 
and 
fruitful 
negotiations 
with 
the 
West 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
so. 
Yet 
certain 
Western 
countries 
would 
not 
allow 
any 
other 
sovereign 
States, 
including 
developing 
countries, 
to 
own 
modern 
nuclear 
technology; 
they 
preferred 
to 
confront 
Iran 
rather 
than 
try 
to 
understand 
it. 
In 
doing 
so, 
they 
had 
rejected 
logical 
interaction 
with 
a 
great 
nation 
that 
had 
thousands 
of 
years 
of 
civilization. 
Iran 
would 
not 
forget 
their 
discriminatory 
behaviour. 
For 
three 
decades 
the 
West 
had 
lost 
a 
golden 
opportunity 
to 
cooperate 
with 
Iran, 
and 
instead 
had 
shown 
its 
people 
nothing 
but 
hostility, 
something 
even 
Western 
intellectuals 
and 
scientists 
were 
forced 
to 
acknowledge. 
121. 
In 
the 
fifty 
years 
since 
the 
confrontation 
with 
certain 
Western 
countries 
over 
the 
nationalization 
of 
its 
oil 
industry, 
Iran 
had 
taken 
major 
steps 
towards 
independence, 
development 
and 
advanced 
technology, 
and 
would 
continue 
on 
that 
path 
with 
pride. 
It 
would 
eventually 
be 
vindicated 
because 
the 
discriminatory 
policies 
were 
bound 
to 
fail. 
The 
Iranian 
nation 
hoped 
that 
those 
States 
would 
draw 
from 
lessons 
of 
the 
past 
and 
choose 
the 
path 
of 
cooperation, 
as 
there 
was 
no 
alternative 
to 
logical, 
honest 
and 
rational 
interaction. 
No 
country 
could 
stand 
in 
the 
way 
of 
a 
great 
nation 
such 
as 
Iran, 
as 
it 
was 
not 
afraid 
of 
paying 
the 
price 
of 
upholding 
its 
strength. 
Iran 
interpreted 
all 
threats 
and 
intimidation 
as 
signs 
of 
its 
enemiesÂ 
weaknesses. 
122. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
was 
developing 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
meet 
part 
of 
its 
energy 
needs, 
and 
would 
never 
renounce 
its 
inalienable 
and 
legal 
right 
to 
benefit 
from 
that 
technology. 
Iran 
had 
always 
sought 
lasting 
regional 
and 
global 
peace 
and 
stability, 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
conduct 

GC(51)/OR.1

its 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
a 
transparent, 
lawful 
and 
responsible 
manner. 
Having 
chosen 
the 
reasonable 
path 
of 
negotiation, 
interaction, 
and 
non-discriminatory 
long-term 
cooperation 
to 
achieve 
a 
comprehensive 
agreement, 
Iran 
hoped 
that 
other 
parties 
would 
do 
likewise. 


123. 
Mr. 
NAKAGAWA 
(Japan), 
having 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
staff 
on 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
experienced 
a 
powerful 
earthquake 
in 
the 
Niigata 
Prefecture 
on 
July 
16 
2007. 
The 
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
located 
very 
near 
the 
epicentre, 
had 
been 
violently 
shaken. 
Although 
the 
operating 
reactors 
had 
been 
shut 
down 
safely 
as 
designed 
and 
there 
had 
been 
no 
effect 
on 
the 
surrounding 
environment, 
some 
of 
the 
plantÂs 
non-safety-
related 
structures, 
systems 
and 
components 
had 
been 
affected. 
More 
detailed 
inspections 
by 
the 
Japanese 
authorities 
were 
being 
undertaken 
and 
the 
seismic 
safety 
of 
each 
unit 
was 
being 
re-evaluated. 
124. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
countries 
most 
prone 
to 
earthquakes 
in 
the 
world, 
Japan 
had 
a 
duty 
to 
share 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
its 
experience 
internationally 
and 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
further 
enhancement 
of 
safety 
measures. 
His 
country 
had 
therefore 
decided 
to 
receive 
an 
Agency 
expert 
mission 
during 
the 
preceding 
month. 
He 
expressed 
gratitude 
for 
the 
prompt 
report 
based 
on 
the 
missionÂs 
detailed 
observations. 
Japan 
would 
provide 
relevant 
information 
and 
share 
lessons 
learned 
at 
the 
forthcoming 
senior 
regulatorsÂ 
meeting. 
His 
country 
also 
planned 
to 
hold 
an 
international 
expertsÂ 
workshop; 
it 
was 
determined 
to 
continue 
to 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
enhance 
international 
nuclear 
safety. 
125. 
The 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was 
expected 
to 
expand 
worldwide 
to 
meet 
increasing 
energy 
demands 
and 
to 
combat 
global 
warming. 
In 
May 
2007, 
the 
Japanese 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
announced 
the 
ÂCool 
Earth 
50Â 
initiative 
on 
climate 
change. 
Under 
that 
proposal, 
Japan 
would 
promote 
international 
efforts 
to 
expand 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
to 
provide 
assistance 
in 
areas 
including 
infrastructure 
development 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
developing 
countries, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
an 
effective 
international 
post-2012 
framework. 
126. 
When 
introducing 
or 
expanding 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
fully 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
that 
regard 
had 
become 
even 
more 
important 
and 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
document 
concerning 
milestones 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
infrastructure 
for 
nuclear 
power 
was 
laudable 
and 
timely. 
International 
cooperation, 
either 
through 
bilateral 
or 
multilateral 
information 
exchange 
and 
the 
sharing 
of 
experience, 
or 
through 
international 
organizations, 
should 
be 
promoted 
to 
make 
effective 
use 
of 
the 
knowledge 
and 
results 
gained 
through 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
JapanÂs 
technology 
and 
experience 
could 
be 
usefully 
shared 
to 
maintain 
and 
strengthen 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security. 
In 
the 
coming 
year, 
Japan 
would 
start 
to 
develop 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
cost-effective 
next-generation 
light-water 
reactors. 
It 
would 
also 
continue 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
international 
forums 
such 
as 
the 
GIF, 
the 
GNEP 
and 
INPRO, 
and 
to 
promote 
international 
cooperation 
on 
the 
development 
of 
Generation 
IV 
reactors 
and 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
reactors, 
which 
contributed 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation. 
On 
September 
16 
2007, 
a 
statement 
of 
principles 
had 
been 
signed 
at 
the 
GNEP 
Ministerial 
Meeting 
attended 
by 
a 
number 
of 
new 
partners. 
Cooperation 
under 
that 
new 
framework 
would 
start 
shortly. 
127. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Japan 
assisted 
countries 
planning 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power 
such 
as 
Indonesia, 
Kazakhstan 
and 
Vietnam 
in 
developing 
infrastructures 
to 
ensure 
non-proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security. 
128. 
Japan 
actively 
supported 
cooperation 
through 
regional 
frameworks. 
It 
made 
a 
considerable 
contribution 
to 
the 
RCA 
and 
also 
supported 
the 
Forum 
for 
Nuclear 
Cooperation 
in 
Asia, 
a 
framework 
to 
facilitate 
voluntary 
cooperation 
among 
the 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
through 
equal 
partnership. 
It 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
Asia.

As 
a 
citizen 
of 
the 
only 
country 
to 
have 
suffered 
atomic 
bombings, 
he 
believed 
that 
nuclear 
weapons 
should 
never 
be 
used 
again. 
If 
used 
with 
caution 
and 
reason, 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
promote 
more 
comfortable 
and 
affluent 
living. 
Japan 
had 
strictly 
limited 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
peaceful 
purposes 
since 
the 
enactment 
of 
its 
Atomic 
Energy 
Basic 
Law 
in 
1955 
upon 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
Since 
then, 
it 
had 
gained 
international 
confidence 
through 
strict 
implementation 
of 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
concluded 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
1977, 
the 
early 
conclusion 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
Expanded 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
expected, 
as 
the 
progress 
towards 
starting 
the 
industrial 
operation 
of 
the 
Rokkasho 
large-scale 
commercial 
reprocessing 
plant 
had 
shown. 
Japan 
continued 
to 
uphold 
its 
established 
policy 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
through 
the 
strict 
application 
of 
safeguards. 
130. 
The 
international 
community 
currently 
faced 
a 
number 
of 
serious 
challenges, 
such 
as 
the 
nuclear 
issues 
concerning 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery, 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Nuclear 
proliferation 
was 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
and 
there 
was 
a 
pressing 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
first 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
Review 
Conference 
of 
the 
Parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
been 
held 
in 
Vienna 
from 
30 
April 
to 
11 
May 
2007, 
and 
had 
been 
chaired 
by 
Japan. 
Despite 
some 
difficulties, 
there 
had 
been 
common 
recognition 
of 
the 
need 
to 
promote 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
NPT. 
The 
Committee 
appeared 
to 
have 
made 
a 
good 
start 
towards 
ensuring 
the 
success 
of 
the 
2010 
Review 
Conference. 
131. 
The 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
vital 
in 
order 
to 
reinforce 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
would 
be 
most 
realistically 
and 
effectively 
achieved 
through 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Japan 
had 
been 
conducting 
various 
activities 
in 
that 
regard, 
focusing 
on 
the 
Asian 
region. 
Recent 
examples 
included 
the 
Agency 
Regional 
Seminar 
for 
Asia/Pacific 
on 
Multilateral 
Verification 
of 
Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation 
Undertakings: 
IAEA 
Safeguards 
Agreements, 
Small 
Quantities 
Protocols 
and 
Additional 
Protocols 
held 
in 
Sydney 
in 
July 
2006, 
and 
the 
high-level 
national 
seminar 
in 
Hanoi, 
Vietnam 
on 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
number 
of 
countries 
that 
had 
concluded 
additional 
protocols 
had 
risen 
from 
39 
to 
83 
over 
the 
previous 
three 
years. 
He 
encouraged 
those 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
132. 
The 
nuclear 
test 
announced 
by 
the 
DPRK 
in 
October 
2006, 
and 
its 
build-up 
of 
ballistic 
missile 
capabilities, 
constituted 
threats 
to 
the 
peace 
and 
security 
not 
only 
of 
Japan 
but 
also 
of 
the 
entire 
international 
community, 
and 
represented 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
NPT 
regime. 
He 
called 
for 
the 
progressive 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1718 
(2006). 
The 
initial 
actions 
agreed 
at 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
including 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility, 
had 
been 
implemented. 
Discussions 
of 
the 
next 
phase 
were 
underway. 
Japan 
continued 
to 
work 
actively 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
with 
the 
DPRK, 
including 
abductions, 
and 
nuclear 
and 
missile 
issues, 
and 
achieving 
a 
normalization 
of 
relations 
with 
the 
DPRK. 
Moreover, 
Japan 
had 
made 
a 
positive 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
activities 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
133. 
IranÂs 
pursuit 
and 
expansion 
of 
uranium 
enrichment-related 
activities 
in 
defiance 
of 
calls 
from 
the 
international 
community 
was 
regrettable, 
and 
he 
expressed 
hope 
that 
Iran 
would 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
issues. 
However, 
that 
step 
alone 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
eradicate 
all 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
concerns 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme; 
Iran 
had 
to 
make 
further 
efforts 
to 
restore 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
by 
responding 
sincerely 
to 
the 
requirements 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
relevant 
Agency 
Board 
resolutions 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolutions, 
including 
the 
suspension 
of 
uranium 
enrichment-related 
activities 
and 
the 
heavy 
water-related 
programme, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
ratification 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Japan 
continued 
to 
work 
with 
the 
international 
community 
to 
achieve 
a 
peaceful 
and 
diplomatic 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue.

Japan 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
countries 
to 
have 
presented 
proposals 
regarding 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
contributing 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
possible 
new 
framework 
that 
was 
effective 
and 
acceptable 
to 
Member 
States. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
based 
on 
those 
proposals 
in 
June 
2007, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
taking 
part 
in 
the 
substantive 
discussions 
on 
the 
issue 
at 
the 
Agency. 
135. 
It 
was 
imperative 
that 
the 
international 
community 
collectively 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
security 
in 
order 
to 
counter 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Japan 
welcomed 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
to 
which 
it 
had 
become 
a 
State 
Party 
in 
August 
2007. 
It 
was 
also 
conducting 
internal 
consultations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
an 
early 
conclusion 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
In 
November 
2006, 
Japan 
had 
hosted 
an 
Agency 
meeting 
on 
strengthening 
nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
Asian 
countries, 
utilizing 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
NSF. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
field. 
136. 
The 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
announced 
by 
Presidents 
Bush 
and 
Putin 
in 
July 
2006 
acknowledged 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
and 
activities 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
Japan 
had 
consistently 
supported 
that 
Initiative 
and 
had 
participated 
actively 
as 
an 
initial 
partner. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
international 
community 
regarding 
measures 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
important 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
area. 
137. 
High-level 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
peer 
review 
among 
the 
regulatory 
authorities 
of 
countries 
with 
advanced 
nuclear 
safety 
regulations 
were 
useful 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
safety. 
Japan 
had 
received 
an 
IRRS 
mission 
the 
preceding 
June, 
and 
had 
been 
pleased 
to 
share 
the 
results 
of 
the 
review 
with 
nuclear 
power 
user 
countries 
and 
to 
contribute 
to 
enhancing 
nuclear 
safety 
internationally. 
The 
results 
of 
an 
evaluation 
of 
comprehensive 
checks 
on 
power 
generation 
facilities 
conducted 
in 
Japan 
had 
been 
compiled 
in 
April 
2007 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
safety 
regulations 
to 
prevent 
the 
recurrence 
of 
data 
falsification 
at 
such 
facilities. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
ensure 
nuclear 
safety. 
138. 
The 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
was 
essential 
for 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
right 
to 
freedom 
of 
navigation 
under 
international 
law, 
Japan 
had 
conducted 
such 
transport, 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
so, 
while 
employing 
the 
most 
stringent 
safety 
measures 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
standards. 
It 
also 
engaged 
in 
dialogue 
with 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
States, 
building 
confidence 
and 
enhancing 
mutual 
understanding. 
His 
Government 
hoped 
that 
the 
usefulness 
of 
such 
constructive 
dialogue 
as 
well 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
valuable 
activities 
in 
that 
area 
would 
be 
further 
recognized 
in 
other 
international 
organizations 
such 
as 
the 
United 
Nations. 
139. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
ensuring 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
was 
increasing, 
and 
various 
ways 
of 
ensuring 
continuing 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
should 
be 
considered 
against 
the 
background 
of 
the 
serious 
budgetary 
constraints 
of 
donor 
countries. 
Japan 
would 
closely 
follow 
the 
study 
of 
the 
budgetary 
requirements 
for 
the 
forthcoming 
ten 
years 
and 
the 
work 
of 
the 
high-level 
panel 
of 
experts 
proposed 
by 
the 
Director 
General. 
He 
urged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
make 
efficient 
use 
of 
the 
budget 
through 
project 
prioritization 
and 
cost 
reduction, 
taking 
full 
advantage 
of 
its 
management 
know-how. 
140. 
Mr. 
BODMAN 
(United 
States 
of 
America) 
began 
his 
statement 
by 
reading 
out 
a 
message 
from 
President 
Bush: 
ÂTo 
those 
gathered 
for 
the 
51st 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency, 
please 
accept 
my 
best 
wishes 
for 
a 
successful 
meeting.

ÂEvery 
nation 
has 
a 
responsibility 
to 
the 
cause 
of

and 
we 
must 
continue 
to 
work 
together 
to 
ensure 
that 
countries 
that 
uphold 
their 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
can 
access 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy; 
while 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 


ÂIn 
order 
to 
keep 
critical 
resources 
from 
terrorist 
networks 
and 
proliferant

we 
must 
implement 
the 
best 
methods 
to 
safely 
and 
securely 
store, 
transport, 
and 
dispose 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
and 
the 
IAEA 
has 
a 
key 
role 
to 
play 
in 
these 
efforts. 
The 
United

will 
continue 
working 
with 
our 
international 
partners 
to 
reduce 
nuclear

by 
advancing 
global

ÂTo 
address 
the 
growing 
need 
for

in 
developing 
countries, 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
and 
I 
announced 
the 
Declaration 
on 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Nonproliferation 
this 
past 
July. 
This 
joint 
effort 
complements 
the 
Global 
Nuclear

Partnership 
announced 
last

and 
reflects 
our 
common 
goal 
to 
make 
nuclear

available 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
to 
states 
that 
meet 
their

offering 
viable 
alternatives 
to 
developing 
the 
sensitive 
technologies 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 


ÂFifty 
years 
ago, 
the 
IAEA 
was 
established 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
oversee 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy 
around 
the 
world. 
Today, 
this 
important 
agency 
continues 
to 
confront 
the 
threat 
of 
international 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
As 
you 
celebrate 
five 
decades 
of 
service, 
I 
applaud 
the 
IAEA 
for 
your 
global 
leadership 
and 
commitment 
to 
building 
a 
more 
secure 
and 
prosperous 
world. 
Best 
wishes 
for 
a 
successful 
conference.Â 


141. 
Clean 
energy 
and 
security 
were 
two 
issues 
that 
transcended 
national 
boundaries 
and 
interests 
and 
presented 
challenges 
as 
well 
as 
opportunities. 
Modern 
civilization 
and 
economic 
wellbeing 
required 
adequate 
and 
reliable 
supplies 
of 
energy. 
In 
the 
next 
25 
years, 
global 
energy 
consumption 
was 
expected 
to 
rise 
by 
over 
50%, 
with 
70% 
of 
that 
growth 
occurring 
in 
emerging 
economies. 
However, 
half 
the 
worldÂs 
people 
had 
no 
access 
to 
reliable 
or 
modern 
forms 
of 
power 
and 
were 
thus 
condemned 
to 
economic 
insecurity, 
underdevelopment 
and 
poor 
living 
standards. 
Swift 
and 
decisive 
action 
was 
needed 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
for 
energy 
in 
ways 
that 
slowed 
the 
increase 
in 
greenhouse 
gases 
and 
pollution, 
while 
enabling 
economic 
growth. 
The 
common 
global 
strategy 
must 
include 
measures 
that 
encouraged 
efficiency, 
conservation, 
innovation 
and 
a 
greater 
use 
of 
clean, 
renewable 
and 
alternative 
sources 
of 
energy. 
142. 
Sun 
and 
wind, 
while 
abundant, 
were 
intermittent 
sources 
of 
energy: 
nuclear 
power 
was, 
at 
present, 
the 
only 
mature 
technology 
which 
could 
supply 
large 
amounts 
of 
power, 
without 
the 
emission 
of 
greenhouse 
gases, 
to 
meet 
the 
expected 
growth 
in 
the 
demand 
for 
energy. 
However, 
that 
same 
power 
had 
the 
potential 
for 
massive 
destruction 
when 
used 
in 
weapons. 
New 
cooperative 
efforts 
were 
needed 
to 
reaffirm 
countriesÂ 
commitment 
to 
extending 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
confronting 
attempts 
at 
proliferation 
and 
strengthening 
international 
non-proliferation 
agreements 
and 
controls 
over 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
materials. 
143. 
The 
previous 
day, 
he 
had 
hosted 
a 
ministerial 
meeting 
of 
the 
GNEP, 
at 
which 
16 
countries 
had 
signed 
a 
statement 
of 
principles 
establishing 
the 
PartnershipÂs 
goals. 
The 
Partnership 
was 
committed 
to 
promoting 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
clean 
source 
of 
power, 
reducing 
proliferation 
risks 
and 
addressing 
the 
burden 
of 
nuclear 
waste. 
It 
aimed 
to 
offer 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
that 
provided 
significant 
non-proliferation 
advantages 
by 
ending 
the 
production 
of 
separated 
plutonium, 
drawing 
down 
plutonium 
and 
spent 
fuel, 
and 
assuring 
reliable 
fuel 
services. 
It 
invited 
other 
States 
with 
the 
same 
vision 
to 
join 
it 
in 
expanding 
the 
civilian 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power.

144. 
No 
State 
could 
deal 
effectively 
with 
the 
challenges 
of 
energy 
demand, 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
waste 
on 
its 
own. 
Energy 
markets, 
and 
the 
consequences 
of 
energy 
choices, 
were 
global. 
Enduring 
solutions 
would 
require 
common 
approaches, 
shared 
aims, 
cooperation 
and 
consistent, 
unwavering 
effort. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
reliable 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
civilian 
use: 
his 
Government 
commended 
the 
proposals 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Secretariat 
and 
some 
Member 
States 
to 
introduce 
alternative 
supply 
arrangements 
and 
reserves 
of 
nuclear 
fuel. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
would 
shortly 
begin 
downblending 
17 
tonnes 
of 
HEU 
to 
create 
a 
commercial 
reserve 
of 
nuclear 
fuel. 
In 
the 
Declaration 
on 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Non-Proliferation, 
the 
Presidents 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
had 
called 
upon 
all 
supplier 
States 
to 
assist 
recipient 
countries 
with 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
reactors, 
training 
and 
financing. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
infrastructure 
development 
was 
a 
vital 
one: 
his 
Government 
was 
to 
invest 
US 
$1 
million 
in 
training 
and 
assistance 
projects 
for 
the 
infrastructure 
milestones 
identified 
by 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
In 
order 
to 
prevent 
illicit 
programmes 
such 
as 
those 
in 
the 
DPRK 
and 
Iran, 
all 
countries 
must 
insist 
on 
complete 
transparency 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Agency's 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Real 
penalties 
must 
be 
imposed 
on 
countries 
that 
evaded 
their 
obligations. 
145. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
security 
for 
weapons-grade 
uranium 
and 
plutonium 
and 
for 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Security 
upgrades 
for 
fissile 
materials 
under 
the 
Bratislava 
Initiatives 
launched 
by 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
should 
be 
completed 
by 
late 
2008. 
The 
two 
countries 
had 
undertaken 
to 
remove 
from 
defence 
use 
or 
eliminate 
approximately 
870 
tonnes 
of 
HEU 
and 
68 
tonnes 
of 
weapons-grade 
plutonium 
-enough 
nuclear 
material 
to 
make 
over 
42 
000 
nuclear 
weapons. 
By 
2012, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
would 
have 
reduced 
its 
stockpile 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
to 
half 
of 
its 
2001 
level, 
and 
it 
had 
already 
almost 
doubled 
the 
rate 
at 
which 
retired 
nuclear 
weapons 
were 
dismantled. 
He 
could 
announce 
today 
that 
it 
was 
shortly 
to 
remove 
an 
additional 
nine 
tonnes 
of 
weapons-grade 
plutonium 
from 
its 
defence 
stocks, 
which 
would 
be 
reprocessed 
for 
use 
in 
commercial 
nuclear 
reactors 
in 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
146. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
must 
be 
robust 
and 
capable 
of 
addressing 
proliferation 
threats. 
In 
2008, 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy 
planned 
to 
launch 
a 
next 
generation 
safeguards 
programme, 
which 
would 
ensure 
that 
modern 
technology, 
the 
best 
scientific 
expertise 
and 
adequate 
resources 
were 
made 
available 
to 
meet 
the 
AgencyÂs 
expanding 
responsibilities. 
147. 
Any 
country 
using 
or 
aspiring 
to 
use 
nuclear 
power 
must 
introduce 
national 
controls 
and 
regulations 
for 
its 
safe 
and 
secure 
use. 
Any 
incident, 
whether 
arising 
from 
terrorism, 
human 
or 
mechanical 
error 
or 
the 
failure 
of 
safeguards, 
would 
erode 
public 
confidence 
and 
seriously 
damage 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
148. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
sought 
universal 
adherence 
to 
and 
full 
compliance 
with 
international 
non-proliferation 
requirements. 
Where 
capacity-building 
mechanisms 
existed, 
such 
as 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative, 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
the 
nuclear 
emergency 
conventions, 
and 
the 
Agency's 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety 
programmes, 
his 
Government 
encouraged 
participation, 
leveraging 
of 
resources 
and 
coordination 
of 
assistance. 
149. 
In 
order 
to 
facilitate 
nuclear 
trade 
and 
promote 
fair 
competition, 
an 
international 
nuclear 
liability 
regime 
was 
also 
required: 
his 
country 
was 
working 
towards 
ratification 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Supplementary 
Compensation 
for 
Nuclear 
Damage 
of 
1997, 
and 
urged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
do 
likewise. 
With 
political 
vision, 
will 
and 
cooperation, 
the 
prerequisites 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
21st 
century 
could 
be 
established 
and 
sustained.

Ms. 
GÃNCZ 
(Hungary) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
had 
celebrated 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
solemn 
event 
in 
Budapest 
that 
had 
been 
attended 
by 
some 
of 
the 
key 
figures 
who 
had 
cooperated 
with 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
past 
fifty 
years, 
including 
many 
current 
and 
retired 
high-level 
officials. 
In 
those 
fifty 
years, 
her 
country 
had 
learnt 
how 
to 
transform 
experience 
into 
constructive 
power. 
New 
challenges 
now 
had 
to 
be 
faced, 
such 
as 
the 
continued 
quest 
for 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
capacity 
building, 
and 
the 
changing 
requirements 
in 
terms 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
Agency 
should 
seek 
new 
ways 
of 
disseminating 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
maintaining 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
while 
identifying 
new 
ways 
to 
increase 
nuclear 
verification 
activities. 
151. 
The 
threat 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery 
continued 
to 
pose 
a 
pressing 
global 
security 
challenge 
in 
the 
twenty-first 
century. 
Strengthened 
multilateral 
cooperation 
was 
required 
in 
order 
to 
uphold 
the 
relevant 
international 
treaties 
and 
export 
control 
regimes. 
The 
proliferation 
trends 
over 
the 
previous 
year 
had 
given 
cause 
for 
alarm, 
and 
her 
country 
shared 
the 
concerns 
expressed 
by 
the 
delegate 
of 
Portugal 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
regarding 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
required 
by 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
and 
the 
Security 
Council 
to 
suspend 
its 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
Those 
steps 
were 
indispensable 
if 
Iran 
were 
to 
re-establish 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
152. 
The 
good 
results 
achieved 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
concerning 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
would 
send 
a 
positive 
signal 
to 
the 
international 
community. 
Hungary 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
process 
aimed 
at 
achieving 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
in 
a 
peaceful 
manner. 
Developments 
relating 
to 
the 
North 
Korean 
nuclear 
issue 
had 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
153. 
Hungary 
had 
welcomed 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
and 
she 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
her 
country 
had 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
in 
April 
2007. 
Moreover, 
recognizing 
the 
international 
security 
challenges 
posed 
by 
new 
forms 
of 
terrorism, 
Hungary 
had 
recently 
decided 
to 
become 
a 
partner 
nation 
to 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
154. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
should 
constitute 
the 
current 
verification 
standard. 
Hungary 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
States 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
industries 
to 
ensure 
the 
application 
of 
such 
measures, 
and 
it 
supported 
all 
efforts 
to 
aimed 
at 
further 
strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
155. 
Hungary 
had 
taken 
a 
close 
interest 
in 
the 
challenging 
issue 
of 
multilateralizing 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
Mutual 
understanding 
between 
all 
parties 
concerned 
could 
be 
enhanced 
by 
addressing 
concerns 
over 
the 
proliferation-sensitive 
parts 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
and 
reducing 
the 
risk 
of 
proliferation. 
Hungary 
would 
be 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
relevant 
discussions 
and 
international 
efforts. 
156. 
Hungary 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
and 
took 
a 
proactive 
approach 
in 
implementing 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
Technical 
cooperation 
had 
been 
remarkably 
successful 
in 
the 
Europe 
region, 
and 
Hungary 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
intention 
to 
shift 
the 
focus 
from 
national 
projects 
to 
regional 
ones. 
However 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
same 
region 
had 
different 
needs. 
In 
Europe, 
resources 
saved 
as 
a 
result 
of 
decreasing 
demands 
from 
some 
Member 
States 
should 
be 
used 
for 
those 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
where 
needs 
were 
growing. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
success. 
The 
Hungarian 
Government 
had, 
despite 
its 
budgetary 
constraints, 
made 
serious 
effort 
to 
meet 
its 
voluntary 
contributions, 
and 
she 
encouraged 
other 
States 
to 
follow 
HungaryÂs 
example.

1. Mr. KIM Woo-Sik (Republic of Korea) said that his country regarded the achievement of the 
United Nations Millennium Development Goals as conditional upon securing sustainable energy 
sources. The Republic of Korea was confident that nuclear power would increasingly play a 
significant role in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals since it fitted the 
sustainability criteria better than any other available sources. Furthermore, the use of nuclear 
technology in the agricultural, medical and industrial sectors had efficiently and effectively helped in 
combating poverty and hunger as well. 
2. The Republic of Korea had successfully constructed and operated nuclear power plants since 
1978. It was now the worldÂs sixth largest country in terms of nuclear power generation, and had 20 
nuclear power plants. Nuclear power supplied 40% of electricity for the country; four more nuclear 
power plants were under construction and another four were in the planning stage. The Republic of 
Korea welcomed the close cooperation with Member States, in particular in the construction of largescale 
plants, and the opportunity to share its experience in the development of small and medium-sized 
reactors. It hoped that its efforts and experience in using an integrated modular reactor for seawater 
desalination and power generation could help other Member States that were suffering from a shortage 
of water. 
3. The Republic of KoreaÂs third comprehensive nuclear promotion plan, launched in January 
2007 as a five-year plan, would facilitate the expanded application of nuclear technology in nuclear 
energy development, medicine, agriculture and the preservation of the environment. 
4. The Republic of Korea was a strong supporter of international collaboration in the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy, and had been actively participating in INPRO and the GIF; his country was 
committed to the innovation of nuclear facilities and fuel cycles in collaboration with Member States. 
5. Nuclear fusion was an important tool to address future energy demand, and his country expected 
that the Agency would play the leading role in developing the safety principles, guidelines and 
technical standards for fusion systems. 
6. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be promoted in accordance with the highest 
standards of nuclear safety, and close collaboration among Member States in that regard should be 
further consolidated. The respective international conventions had greatly contributed to securing 
nuclear safety, and the Republic of Korea reaffirmed its commitment to comply with them. The 
Republic of Korea would also maintain its efforts to secure nuclear safety domestically. In that regard, 
he said that Yonggwang Units 5 and 6 had been evaluated in 2007 as the safest nuclear power plants 
ever, following the comprehensive OSART review. Kori Unit 1 had been successfully peer-reviewed 
for the safety aspects of long-term operation in July 2007. The Republic of Korea had established a 
national radiological emergency plan and implemented radiological emergency laws to protect the 
public and the environment from the possible harmful effects of accidents; it was now working on the 
technological partnership between the AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre and AtomCARE, and 
welcomed expanded cooperation with Member States. The Republic of Korea planned to develop the 
nuclear safety school at the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety into a more globalized centre for sharing 
experience and competence, and for contributing to the improvement of global nuclear safety.

7. One of the most critical issues in his countryÂs nuclear energy sector had been settled in 2005. 
Following a referendum, the countryÂs first radioactive waste repository was to be located in a 1.98 
million m2 
area on the coast near Gyeongju; initially it would house 100 000 drums of radioactive 
waste underground, and 800 000 drums when completed. His country also planned to build a proton 
accelerator and move the headquarters of the state-run Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Company to the 
region. 
8. Over the last fifty years, the Republic of Korea had successfully developed nuclear technology 
through various cooperation programmes with the Agency. In commemoration of the AgencyÂs 50th 
anniversary, a special conference had been hosted in Seoul in July 2007. The 2007 Summer Institute 
of the World Nuclear University had successfully been held in his country in 2007. The Republic of 
Korea also hosted the RCA Regional Office and welcomed the opportunity to share nuclear 
knowledge and expertise with Member States through educational programmes and local 
communities. 
9. Since ratification of the NPT, the Republic of Korea had held the firm position that peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy should comply with the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Since 
his countryÂs proclamation in 2004 of the four principles for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, it had 
made every effort to strengthen its legal and institutional framework in order to reinforce its national 
nuclear control system. In 2006, the Korea Institute of Nuclear Non-proliferation and Control had been 
established as an independent organization for the purpose of nuclear material accounting and control, 
and the provision of compulsory education for nuclear control. The Republic of Korea was working 
closely with the Agency to implement integrated safeguards. By strengthening its nuclear material 
accounting system, the Republic of Korea would be making every possible effort to ensure the safe 
and thorough management of even the smallest amount of nuclear materials. 
10. Peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue was vital for solid peace on the Korean Peninsula 
and for the promotion of peace and prosperity in North East Asia. The visits to the DPRK by the 
Director General and the Agency inspection team in March and July 2007 had been a very significant 
step towards settlement of the issue. His country requested the Agency and Member States to provide 
continuous support for the peaceful settlement of the DPRK nuclear issue. 
11. Despite difficult conditions, the Republic of Korea had laid the foundation for the most active 
programme for the peaceful uses of nuclear technology in the world thanks to the support of the 
Agency and Member States, and it was now time for it to give back what it had received. His country 
would continue its efforts to deepen cooperation with its many international partners who might be in 
need of its knowledge and experience in promoting the use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. 
12. Mr. ASSELBORN (Luxembourg) congratulated the Agency, in its 50th anniversary year, for its 
tireless efforts to achieve its main objectives, namely the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, nuclear 
safety and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
13. Although the threat of a nuclear disaster was not as immediate as it had been when the Agency 
had been established, the world was facing new threats. Under cover of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, or through illicit buying networks, States were attempting to acquire nuclear or military 
radiological capability in blatant contradiction to the non-proliferation regime. Despite the undeniable 
progress made in the reduction of strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons, the existence of 
thousands of warheads in the arsenals of the major powers remained a matter of concern for nuclear 
disarmament. In order to prevent a new arms race, standards in the field of non-proliferation must be 
strengthened and the nuclear-weapon-States must commit themselves to the progressive reduction of 
their nuclear arsenals.

14. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime, and Luxembourg 
remained committed to its three mutually reinforcing pillars. Non-compliance with safeguards 
obligations under the NPT and the illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear materials and equipment 
constituted the greatest threats to the non-proliferation regime. Efforts must be made to preserve the 
integrity of that regime, and to strengthen implementation of the NPT through the revision process. 
15. Safeguards agreements alone were not enough to prevent the development of clandestine 
nuclear programmes. All States should therefore sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol, and 
ensure compliance with their safeguards agreements. 
16. The CTBT was another important tool in the nuclear disarmament process, and its entry into 
force would help to raise global security. He therefore called on those States that had not yet done so, 
in particular those listed in Annex 2 of the Treaty, to sign and ratify the Treaty with a view to its early 
entry into force. It was also essential that progress be made on a non-discriminatory, universal treaty 
prohibiting the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons and in other explosive 
devices. 
17. Luxembourg welcomed the recent developments in the DPRK. The shutdown of the Yongbyon 
facility and the implementation of surveillance and verification activities by the Agency were a first 
step towards compliance by the DPRK with its international obligations and towards the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. He hoped that efforts in that regard would be continued. 
Luxembourg urged the DPRK to implement Security Council resolution 1718 (2006) and to 
completely dismantle its nuclear programme in a verifiable and irreversible manner, and to return to 
the NPT immediately. 
18. The recent agreement between the Agency and the Islamic Republic of Iran was a step in the 
right direction, and Luxembourg fully supported the Director GeneralÂs ongoing efforts to resolve the 
outstanding issues. However, Luxembourg was concerned that Iran had not always taken the necessary 
steps to comply with the three relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular regarding the 
suspension of enrichment-related activities. It called upon Iran to suspend any such activities with a 
view to achieving the Âdouble time-outÂ suggested by the Director General. It was politically illadvised 
to evoke the possibility of war with Iran; the option of military intervention should be 
discounted at all costs, and every effort should be made to explore all possible diplomatic channels. 
Iran should implement the recent agreement with the Agency, and Luxembourg encouraged it to 
reconsider the offer forward in 2006 by the European Union High Representative on behalf of China, 
France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. 
19. Luxembourg fully supported the steps being taken to prevent terrorist groups gaining access to 
nuclear weapons or explosive devices. It had recently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism, and had taken an active part in the process to amend the CPPNM. 
20. As a party to the NPT, Luxembourg recognized the right of each State to use nuclear energy to 
meet growing energy demand. However, it had chosen not to produce nuclear energy to meet its 
energy needs. The demand for access to nuclear fuel and the supply of enriched uranium was likely to 
increase significantly in the years to come, and it was important to prevent the uncontrolled expansion 
of enrichment centres and attempts to harness the technology for military purposes. Luxembourg 
welcomed the initiative of the Agency and the options put forward by different States, including the 
European Union, to establish a multilateral mechanism for the assured supply of nuclear fuel Â 
ideally in the form of a fuel bank under the auspices of the Agency. He encouraged the Agency and 
the States concerned to engage in productive discussions in order to establish such a mechanism. 
21. In view of its geographical location and the proximity of power plants to its borders, 
Luxembourg attached great importance to all issues relating to nuclear safety. It had developed a plan 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17 
September 
2007, 
Page 
4 


for intervention in the event of a nuclear accident; the emergency plan was regularly the subject of 
national, bilateral and international exercises. International cooperation was essential in order to 
strengthen nuclear safety, waste management, physical protection of nuclear material and action in the 
event of a radiological emergency. He urged those States that had not already done so to accede to and 
implement the relevant conventions as soon as possible and to benefit from exchanges of expertise. 
Luxembourg, for its part, had sought to maintain an international dialogue and had concluded bilateral 
agreements with France and Belgium providing for close collaboration on all aspects of nuclear safety. 

22. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was one of the most effective tools to promote 
the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, and served to improve the quality of life in 
many developing countries. Luxembourg welcomed the progress made through the programme and 
urged the Agency to strengthen its technical cooperation activities. The Agency could, as in previous 
years, count on Luxembourg's support. 
23. Mr. BASHA (Albania), expressing his appreciation to those who had supported AlbaniaÂs 
candidacy for election to the Board of Governors, said that Albania would do its utmost to meet 
expectations. 
24. AlbaniaÂs commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation was a foreign policy priority, as 
was the need to meet obligations under the relevant international treaties. His Government therefore 
attached particular importance to the implementation of all General Conference resolutions and Board 
decisions, especially those that aimed at ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the international 
safeguards system. He called on all countries to cooperate fully with the Agency and to comply with 
relevant Security Council resolutions concerning nuclear enrichment and reprocessing activities. 
25. His Government had signed an additional protocol and procedures for its ratification had begun. 
The final legislative measures would also be taken to complete and adopt a comprehensive national 
atomic law that would include safeguards-related issues and the relevant structures to ensure that all 
nuclear and radiation-related obligations, requirements and standards were met. 
26. Albania attached equal importance to all other non-safeguards-related activities. His 
Government recognized that the application of nuclear technologies made an important contribution to 
development and to national plans and programmes. Efforts were being made to ensure radiation 
protection, safety and security in the application of non-power nuclear technologies; to improve and 
consolidate the regulatory framework; to adapt and harmonize relevant national infrastructures; and 
consolidate the legal basis for all nuclear-related activities. 
27. Albania sought to reap maximum benefits from the AgencyÂs experience and expertise through 
the technical cooperation programme and PACT. His Government would continue to honour its 
national commitments in that regard, including by paying in full and on time its financial obligations 
to the Agency. His country was grateful to the Agency for its extensive cooperation and support in the 
implementation of a wide range of projects that had yielded positive results in the country, in 
particular in the area of human health. His Government welcomed the AgencyÂs focus on human 
health, and hoped that it would be further strengthened. Albania would continue to demonstrate its full 
commitment to such projects and activities, including through continued cost-sharing. 
28. His Government attached high priority to continuing cooperation in the area of nuclear security, 
which was essential in preventing and combating terrorist activities, the illicit trafficking of 
radioactive materials, and in reducing radiological threats. His country would continue to fully support 
the AgencyÂs activities aimed at promoting the safe and peaceful use of nuclear technology in all 
Member States.

29. Mr. SUN Qin (China) read out a message from Mr. Wen Jiabao, in which the Premier of the 
State Council of the PeopleÂs Republic of China congratulated the Director General and the Agency on 
its 50th anniversary, and noted that, after half a century of development, nuclear energy was now 
widely used in areas such as industry, agriculture, human health and the environment and had 
contributed substantially to the sustainable development of humanity. The Agency, as the only 
international body responsible for nuclear affairs, had always discharged its statutory responsibilities 
faithfully, and had made unremitting efforts to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and prevent 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons worldwide. The award of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize had 
demonstrated that the international community recognized and supported the AgencyÂs important role 
in that regard. The development of the peaceful use of nuclear energy was both an opportunity and a 
challenge, and China would continue to support the Agency in its work. 
30. Speaking on behalf of his delegation, he said that with rapid global economic development, the 
contradiction between energy supply and environmental protection was becoming increasingly 
prominent. A growing number of countries were looking to nuclear energy as a clean, safe and mature 
technology for large-scale application. While some developed countries continued their nuclear power 
expansion, more and more developing countries were starting to develop or were considering 
developing nuclear power. China was one of the countries to have announced ambitious plans for 
developing nuclear power, and certain countries in South East Asia and the Middle East were making 
active preparations for the construction of their first nuclear power plants. The development of nuclear 
energy was gaining strong momentum worldwide. 
31. Over the previous year, important nuclear power developments had taken place in China. With 
Units 1 and 2 of the Tianwan nuclear power plant having started commercial operation in May and 
August 2007, the country now had eleven nuclear power reactors in operation with a total installed 
capacity of 9 100 MW. In order to meet the target of 40 000 MW of installed nuclear power capacity 
by 2020 and a further 18 000 MW under construction, China had started to introduce advanced 
Generation III nuclear power technology. It continued to meet the rapidly growing demand for power 
through the construction of several Generation II-plus nuclear power units, characterized by proven 
technology, safe performance and strong competitiveness. China had both accelerated the construction 
of new plants and intensified research into high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and fast reactors. The 
construction of a 20 MW experimental fast reactor and initial research into certain key technologies 
for a 200 MW high-temperature gas-cooled reactor project were underway. China had also 
participated actively in the AgencyÂs INPRO project, and had become a full member of the GIF and of 
ITER in November 2006. 
32. China cooperated extensively with the Agency and other member States by hosting relevant 
international conferences. The China Atomic Energy Authority and the Agency would jointly host a 
ministerial conference on nuclear power for the 21st century in Beijing in 2009. He encouraged 
ministers responsible for nuclear affairs from all countries to attend. 
33. The past year had seen both the revitalization of nuclear power and serious challenges to nuclear 
non-proliferation. The international community must work together to address urgently challenges 
relating to the safety of nuclear facilities, waste management, radioactive source management and the 
implementation of safeguards obligations by Member States. It must further dispel concerns about 
nuclear energy development and work towards sustainable development. 
34. China welcomed the AgencyÂs achievements in the areas of promotion and non-proliferation. 
In 2006, new resources for technical cooperation had increased in comparison to the previous year, as 
had rates of attainment and programme implementation, which had had a positive impact on socioeconomic 
development in Member States. The Agency had supported Member States in developing 
and improving national nuclear safety regulation and emergency response systems by providing 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17

2007, 
Page 
6 


integrated safety review services, issuing basic safety standards, coordinating nuclear emergency 
response and radioactive source regulation, and offering technical training. The Agency had also used 
extrabudgetary funds to give developing countries additional assistance in the area of safety. 

35. The Agency had taken active measures to implement nuclear security programmes to counter 
the growing threat of international nuclear terrorism. It had published a series of nuclear security 
documents, updated the Illicit Trafficking Database, provided security guidance for large-scale public 
events, and held seminars and training courses to help Member States enhance their nuclear security 
capacity. At the end of 2006, the CAEA-IAEA Joint Training Centre on Nuclear Safeguards and 
Security had been formally established in Beijing. The Centre would provide training services to 
China and other Member States in the Asia-Pacific region. In June 2007, China had signed a practical 
cooperation arrangement with the Agency that involved targeted cooperation on nuclear security for 
the 2008 Olympic Games and the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai. China appreciated the AgencyÂs 
assistance in the area of nuclear security and commended the Agency on its efforts to prevent nuclear 
terrorism globally. 
36. As international verification became increasingly arduous, the Agency was faced with the 
challenge of improving its verification methodology and its capacity to analyse environmental 
samples, in order to ensure that verification and safeguards conclusions were accurate and timely. 
China would support the AgencyÂs efforts to update the software and hardware of its safeguards 
laboratories and increase the number and capacity of network laboratories through cooperation with 
Member States. In August 2007, China had signed a cooperation arrangement with the Agency to 
launch its safeguards support programme formally, attesting to its efforts to help strengthen the 
Agency's safeguards system and verification capacity. 
37. During the past year, the Agency had played a major role in resolving the DPRK and Iranian 
nuclear issues. It had monitored and verified the shutdown and sealing of nuclear facilities in the 
DPRK and agreed a work plan to resolve outstanding issues with Iran. Its objectivity, impartiality and 
professionalism had won broad appreciation from the international community, including China. 
38. The Agency had assisted Member States in promoting nuclear technology through technical 
cooperation programmes, thus helping to maintain the importance of nuclear power in the global 
energy mix and expand the application of nuclear technology in various fields. In order to cast off the 
shadows of the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear accidents, the Agency had cooperated with 
Member States in drawing up a series of legal instruments relating to nuclear safety, including the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention. The work of the AgencyÂs OSART and IRRT 
teams and of INSARR had also helped to increase nuclear safety worldwide. 
39. Despite the AgencyÂs outstanding achievements in promoting nuclear energy development and 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, much remained to be done. Several key issues 
required increased attention. With the rapid development of the global economy and the threat posed 
by climate change, increasing numbers of developing countries were turning to nuclear energy. The 
AgencyÂs actions to assist Member States in developing nuclear safety regulatory systems and 
infrastructures, building managerial capabilities for running industrial programmes, and providing 
staff education and training had a direct bearing on the sustainable development of the international 
nuclear energy industry. 
40. As the share of nuclear energy in the global energy mix continued to grow, assured supply of 
nuclear fuel had become a key concern of the international community. In view of the complexities 
involved, careful consideration should be given to the development of a multilateral mechanism for 
nuclear fuel supply, with a view to achieving a practical solution acceptable to all parties concerned, in 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17

7 


particular the developing countries. The issue was essentially economic and technological in nature 
and should not be politicized. 

41. Efforts to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons must complement each other. In discharging its non-proliferation mandate, the Agency must 
develop new concepts and techniques to ensure the effectiveness of its verification regime and deal 
with new situations and issues appropriately. The Agency had faithfully implemented its mandate over 
the previous 50 years, and he was convinced that the Agency would achieve new glories in the 50 
years to come. 
42. Ms. SONJICA (South Africa), welcoming the new members of the Agency, said that is was 
encouraging to note the increasing representation of the African continent in the Agency. South Africa 
welcomed the positive developments with regard to the DPRK nuclear programme, including the 
initial actions agreed to during the six-party talks. South Africa welcomed the ad hoc monitoring and 
verification arrangement that was being implemented by the Agency with the cooperation of the 
DPRK, but remained concerned that the Agency was still unable to draw any conclusions regarding 
the DPRKÂs nuclear activities. It was South AfricaÂs hope that the DPRK would return to the NPT 
process, eliminate all its nuclear weapons and place all its material and facilities under Agency 
safeguards. 
43. With regard to the implementation of NPT safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran, South 
Africa noted that the Agency continued to be able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear 
material, and that Iran had been providing the Agency with access to declared nuclear material, 
including the required nuclear material accountancy reports in connection with the declared nuclear 
material and facilities. It was also noteworthy that important progress had been made to resolve some 
of the outstanding issues regarding IranÂs nuclear programme. Full implementation of the agreed work 
plan between Iran and the Agency in accordance with the timelines set out therein, could help to build 
the necessary confidence to spark the resumption of negotiations between Iran and all concerned 
parties. That would avoid a confrontation, which no one desired and which would have catastrophic 
consequences for all. The Director General had placed the international community on a path towards 
the peaceful resolution of the issues surrounding the Iranian nuclear programme. 
44. South Africa was a proponent of nuclear disarmament and a supporter of a nuclear-weapon-free 
world. The NPT remained the only international instrument that not only sought to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons but also contained the legal commitment for their elimination. The 
only absolute guarantee against the use of such weapons was their complete elimination and the 
assurance that they would never be produced again. As long as some countries had nuclear weapons, 
there would be others who would aspire to possess them. The continued possession of nuclear 
weapons, or the retention of the nuclear weapons option by some States, created the very real danger 
that they might be used or might fall into the hands of non-State actors. 
45. The pursuance of energy security was not only a right of all States but also a global 
responsibility; it was necessary to ensure that no unwarranted restrictions were imposed on the right of 
States to pursue nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Further modalities for preventing the diversion 
of those sensitive technologies might be required in order to ensure that such activities could be 
pursued with the necessary assurances. South Africa strongly supported a non-discriminatory approach 
that would assure the supply of nuclear fuel, whilst fully respecting the choices of States and 
protecting their inalienable right to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, consistent with their nonproliferation 
obligations. South Africa's recent draft nuclear energy policy and strategy, currently 
under public discussion, provided the framework for an extensive nuclear programme. South AfricaÂs 
policy was driven by issues of security of energy supply and global climate change as well as making 
use of national strategic mineral resources for economic development. The resurgence in the use of 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17

2007,

8 


nuclear energy for electricity production was strong, and many countries, including South Africa, had 
realized the need to diversify their energy mix. Approximately 6% of South AfricaÂs electricity was 
generated from nuclear, and the electricity utility, Eskom, was currently investigating the expansion of 
its nuclear power capacity to 20 000 MW by 2025. Eskom was considering advanced pressurized 
water reactors with a combined capacity of around 3500 MW. Initial processes of acquiring 
environmental authorizations had begun and negotiations with vendors were expected to start in the 
next six months. High-temperature pebble bed modular reactor technology was under development by, 
with the intention of constructing a 165 MW electric demonstration nuclear reactor system on the 
Koeberg site, near Cape Town, and a fuel plant at Pelindaba, near Pretoria. The required 
environmental and nuclear licensing authorizations were being obtained. Pebble bed modular reactor 
technology was focused not only on electricity production but also on process heat applications for 
industry. 

46. South Africa had signed a CPF for 2006Â2010 with the Agency and contributed regularly to the 
technical cooperation programme, with South African experts carrying out missions in Member States. 
The completion and demonstration of the conditioning unit for sealed high-activity radioactive sources 
by the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation in March 2007 had been a great success. In 
partnership with the Agency, South Africa would be hosting a regional conference on energy and 
water for sustainable development in 2008. South Africa also hosted a number of workshops and 
training courses, and was grateful for the AgencyÂs continued support for capacity building. In the past 
year, the Agency had been requested to assist in the establishment of a regional regulatory forum on 
radiation safety. South Africa had hosted an international workshop on a common framework for the 
safety of radioactive waste management and disposal in July 2007. 
47. South Africa was committed to the use of Agency safety standards as a benchmark, and 
recommended greater harmonization between the requirements related to safety and those related to 
security, since they were interdependent in many cases. In the past year South Africa had had two 
visits from the AgencyÂs Department of Nuclear Safety and Security, which had included interaction 
with all State role-players involved in monitoring exports and imports; a clear programme aimed at 
strengthening nuclear security, with special emphasis on border control, had been developed. An illicit 
trafficking workshop for the region had been hosted by the Agency with a view to strengthening 
controls over the movement of nuclear material. 
48. South Africa encouraged the Secretariat to work tirelessly to ensure that the representation of 
developing countries was improved. The employment of greater numbers of women in professional 
posts should also continue to receive special attention. 
49. Monsignor MAMBERTI (Holy See) said that, in his Angelus address on 29 July 2007, Pope 
Benedict XVI had recalled the important fiftieth anniversary of the Agency with the following words: 
ÂPrecisely today, in fact, is the fiftieth anniversary of the entry into force of the Statute of the 
Agency, instituted with the mandate to Âaccelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy 
to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world.Â 

ÂThe Holy See, fully approving the goals of this Organization, has been a member of it since its 
founding and continues to support its activity. 

ÂThe epochal changes that have occurred in the last 50 years demonstrate how, in the difficult 
crossroads in which humanity finds itself, the commitment to encourage non-proliferation of 
nuclear arms, to promote a progressive and agreed-upon nuclear disarmament and to support the 
use of peaceful and safe nuclear technology for authentic development, respecting the 
environment and ever mindful of the most disadvantaged populations, is always more present 
and urgent.

ÂI therefore hope that the efforts of those who work with determination to bring about these 
three objectives may be achieved, with the goal that Âthe resources which would be saved could 
then be employed in projects of development capable of benefiting all their people, especially 
the poor.Â 

ÂIt is also good on this occasion to repeat how: ÂIn place of ... the arms race, there must be 
substituted a common effort to mobilize resources toward objectives of moral, cultural and 
economic development, redefining the priorities and hierarchies of values.Â 

ÂAgain we entrust to the intercession of Mary Most Holy our prayer for peace, in particular so 
that scientific knowledge and technology are always applied with a sense of responsibility and 
for the common good, in full respect for international rights ...Â 

50. His words were an exhortation to the entire international community to commit itself seriously 
in order to achieve, with effectiveness, three objectives that were intimately linked, namely: the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons, nuclear disarmament, and the peaceful and secure use of nuclear 
technology. 
51. All peaceful uses of nuclear technology must be guided by two principles: they must be 
respectful of the environment and they must be ever mindful of the most disadvantaged populations. 
There were many benefits to be gained from the use of nuclear technology in such vital areas as food 
security and, above all, medicine. The work that the Agency carrying out through its technical 
cooperation programme, and in particular PACT, could not but receive strong support from the Holy 
See. Such activities were to be read within a wider moral context, in view of their repercussions not 
only for present generations but also for future ones. Finances allotted for such activities were seen as 
investments in the future of humanity, a future which, in the words of the Pope, might be capable of 
applying scientific and technical knowledge with a sense of responsibility and for the common good, 
while fully respecting international law. Concerted efforts should be made by all to encourage the nonproliferation 
of nuclear weapons and to promote a progressive and agreed nuclear disarmament. 
52. Non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament were interdependent and mutually reinforcing; and 
their transparent and responsible implementation represented one of the principal instruments, not only 
in the fight against nuclear terrorism, but also in the concrete realization of a culture of life and of 
peace capable of promoting effectively the integral development of peoples. Those objectives were 
moral imperatives; they were also politically possible. 
53. Since its inception, the Agency had consolidated and strengthened the three pillars that formed 
the basis of its mandate; it had promoted the peaceful uses of nuclear technologies through research 
and technical cooperation, fostered nuclear safety and security through the elaboration and 
implementation of an effective, world-wide security regime based on conventions, standards and 
assistance to Member States, and performed verification activities. During the last half century, some 
difficulties had obviously arisen due to the complexity of the nuclear issue. Nuclear technology 
developed rapidly and dramatically, giving rise to continuously evolving difficulties, which 
represented major challenges for the near future. He drew attention in that regard to the black market 
for nuclear material, which also involved non-State actors, to the slow pace of nuclear disarmament, 
and to the difficulties faced in implementing the entire non-proliferation regime itself. 
54. Such challenges could be seriously faced only by cultivating a culture of peace founded on the 
primacy of law and respect for human life. A multilateral approach, permeated by dialogue and 
honesty, as well as by responsible cooperation among all parties within the international community, 
must be reinforced as the best way to ensure that a future of peace for everyone was found not only in 
international accords on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also in a determined 
commitment to seek their reduction and definitive dismantling. Such a multilateral approach must be

marked by the development of a new paradigm of collective security, in which each country 
recognized the clear limits of recourse to nuclear weapons for its own security. 

55. Humanity was at a difficult crossroads, characterized by ever-increasing interdependence 
involving economic, political, social and other factors. The use of force no longer represented a 
sustainable, long-term solution: it nourished a reciprocal diffidence and used enormous resources in a 
near-sighted way. The temptation to confront new situations with old systems must be avoided. 
56. As the Pope had stated, it was necessary to redefine the priorities and hierarchies of values with 
a view to engaging in a common effort to mobilize resources in order to achieve moral, cultural and 
economic development. In order to promote such an approach, efforts must be made to encourage 
serious multilateralism based on a renewed collective sense of security, which could build a real 
climate of peace and trust, and which recognized that development, solidarity and justice were none 
other than the true name for a lasting peace. 
6. 
Arrangements 
for 
the 
Conference 
(a) 
Adoption 
of 
the 
agenda 
and 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion 
57. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the agenda for the 
current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in document GC(51)/1 with 
the exception of item 22, as there were no vacancies on the Agency's Staff Pension Committee. It had 
also recommended that the agenda consist of all the items on the supplementary list of items for 
inclusion in the agenda contained in document GC(51)/20. With regard to the allocation of items for 
initial discussion, the Committee had recommended that the items listed in documents GC(51)/1 and 
GC(51)/20 be taken up for discussion as indicated in those documents. It had also recommended that 
the order of items be as set out in those documents. 
58. Mr. ZARKA (Israel) said that, regrettably some States had again presented an agenda item on 
the so-called Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat. Israel had chosen not to challenge the adoption of 
the agenda in order not to politicize further the meeting. 
59. There had been many alarming proliferation developments in recent years in the Middle East; 
none of them had involved Israel, but all of them had challenged its security. The developments 
demonstrated the alarming attitude of some regional States to their international commitments in the 
nuclear domain. There was no basis for the agenda item, and IsraelÂs policy concerning the 
implications of the item remained unchanged. 
60. The General CommitteeÂs recommendations were accepted. 
(b) 
Closing 
date 
of 
the 
session 
and 
opening 
date 
of 
the 
next 
session 
61. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the Conference set 
Friday, 21 September 2007 as the closing date of the fifty-first regular session and Monday, 
29 September 2008 as the opening date of the fifty-second regular session, which would be held in 
Vienna. 
62. The General CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted.

Â 
Restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
63. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee, which had had before it requests from the 
Dominican Republic, Georgia and Moldova for the restoration of their voting rights, had postponed 
consideration of the requests, and of any other such requests received, until its following meeting.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(resumed) 
(GC(51)/5) 
64. Mr. CHOWDHURY (Bangladesh) congratulated the new Member States, Bahrain, Burundi, 
Cape Verde, Republic of Congo and Nepal, on their membership of the Agency. Nuclear science and 
technology had made enormous strides over the fifty years of the AgencyÂs existence, with advances 
in medical diagnostics and cancer treatment, basic scientific research, industry and agriculture, and 
could be expected to advance even more rapidly in future. 
65. The worldÂs poorest countries faced hunger, chronic poverty, killer diseases, poor access to 
sanitation and safe drinking water and a lack of modern sources of energy. Many developing countries 
in Asia and Africa, like his own, had vulnerable economies characterized by extremely high 
population density, a low resource base and a high incidence of natural disasters that had adverse 
implications for long-term savings, investment and economic growth. Bangladesh was also facing new 
development challenges in the context of globalization. His GovernmentÂs policy emphasized poverty 
reduction and social development, but these presupposed a reliable supply of energy and electricity. 
66. The ongoing global energy crisis was already having a telling effect on the development 
endeavours of developed and developing countries alike, particularly in those countries that had few 
energy resources of their own. If the very low per capita energy consumption of the developing 
countries were to increase even modestly, the impact on both the availability and the price of fossil 
fuels would be enormous. Bangladesh had limited energy resources of its own, and per capita 
consumption of energy and electricity was currently among the lowest in the world. ÂCleanÂ nuclear 
technology, which posed a much lower threat to the environment than earlier technologies, provided a 
practical solution to meet the countryÂs increasing demand for energy. He called upon the Agency to 
play a more proactive role in helping developing countries to introduce nuclear power into their 
energy mix. 
67. Qualified human resources were essential for the safety, security, reliability and successful 
implementation of any nuclear power project. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission 
maintained a core team of dedicated scientists, engineers and technical staff, but it would need to be 
increased as the nuclear power plant programme expanded, despite the existing budgetary constraints. 
Another major challenge to the construction of nuclear power plants in the developing countries was 
financing, since such projects were very capital-intensive. Bangladesh hoped to obtain financing 
through foreign-aid programmes, ÂsoftÂ loans from the World Bank, or other innovative financing 
schemes. He called upon the Agency to use its influence with the World Bank and UNDP to ensure 
that nuclear power, being a ÂcleanÂ technology, was included in their sustainable environment 
management projects. The Agency should make every effort to minimize the barriers to the 
construction of nuclear power plants in developing countries, and he hoped that the Agency's activities 
to promote innovative financing options would provide assistance in that regard. The international 

GC(51)/OR.2

September 
2007,

12 


treaties and conventions which the Agency enforced helped to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and secure the world for future generations. 

68. The Agency could make a significant contribution to the fight against cancer in developing 
countries. His Government was setting up a positron emission tomography and computed tomography 
facility, and he gratefully acknowledged the technical cooperation that Bangladesh had received in 
setting up nuclear medicine and low-dose radiotherapy facilities for cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
However, more technical assistance was needed to provide safe and effective radiotherapy services. 
He likewise acknowledged the AgencyÂs support for the assessment of underground water aquifers, 
intended to combat the acute problem of contamination of groundwater with arsenic. Nuclear 
technology had the potential to address some of the problems caused by a rising world population and 
the increasing shortage of clean drinking water. 
69. Bangladesh was fully committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Its nuclear energy 
programme was transparent, and it had signed all relevant international non-proliferation and 
verification instruments. His Government had intensified its activities in nuclear safety and radiation 
control. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission performed its nuclear regulatory activities in 
accordance with the countryÂs nuclear safety charter, which laid out the philosophy of a nuclear safety 
culture. He called upon the Agency for assistance in the establishment of an effective and independent 
regulatory body. 
70. He expressed his appreciation of the assistance provided by the Agency with regard to research 
and development in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, especially human resource development and 
project-oriented technical assistance. He hoped that such support would continue. 
71. Bangladesh was active in various RCA projects, including collaborative research programmes. 
They were very effective because they gave countries the opportunity to share experiences within a 
region and should be expanded. The scope of the project concerning energy and nuclear power should 
be enhanced. Programmes on the application of nuclear techniques in industry, medicine, agriculture 
and other sectors would help the RCA countries to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. 
72. A vision for the next fifty years of the Agency should be formulated on the basis of the 
successes and experiences of the first fifty years. One of its major objectives should be to seek to 
achieve parity between the rich and poor, developed and developing nations, North and South, and 
East and West. 
73. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland) said that Poland, as a founding member of the Agency, 
was particularly proud of the creation of the organization and of the activities carried out over the past 
half century in order to implement the concept of ÂAtoms for peaceÂ. Those activities had been well 
balanced and reflected the important role played by the Agency in the areas of verification, safety and 
security and promotion of nuclear technology. 
74. The NPT played a vital role in maintaining the global non-proliferation regime. It was 
regrettable that, at the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT, States Parties had been 
unable to agree on ways to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty. Given the positive outcome of 
the first Preparatory Committee meeting, Poland hoped that it would be possible to adopt a consensus 
document at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
75. The universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements, and 
additional protocols was a prerequisite for a credible and effective safeguards system. Following its 
decision to accede to the European Union, Poland had, with effect from 1 March 2007, replaced its 
bilateral safeguards agreement and additional protocol by the trilateral safeguards agreement and 
additional protocol that was obligatory for European Union Member States. Poland called on those 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17 
September 
2007, 
Page 
13 


countries that had not yet done so to join the AgencyÂs safeguards system without delay. States with 
SQPs should also conclude an exchange of letters with the Director General to reinforce the 
safeguards system. He hoped that, the fifth Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the 
Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty being held in September 2007 would serve to bring forward 
the entry into force of the instrument, thereby strengthening nuclear non-proliferation worldwide. 
Poland was one of the 44 States whose ratification was required for the Treaty to enter into force, and 
had ratified the Treaty in 1999. 

76. Poland continued to support fully the AgencyÂs activities aimed at protecting the world from 
nuclear terrorism. A valuable instrument in support of those efforts was the CPPNM, as amended 
in 2005 to facilitate wider and more universal application of its provisions. Poland had completed the 
procedures for the ratification of the amendment to the Convention in 2007 and called on other States 
to follow suit. 
77. In 2006, Poland had decided to join the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, and had already 
returned all unirradiated nuclear material of Russian origin to the Russian Federation. The core of 
PolandÂs nuclear research reactor was currently being converted to LEU. Plans had also been made for 
spent fuel of Russian origin to be repatriated to the Russian Federation; however implementation had 
been delayed for administrative reasons. Poland followed closely the various international proposals 
for formulating multilateral conditions of access to nuclear fuel-related activities. 
78. Poland was pleased to note that the number of States signing the Nuclear Safety Convention and 
the Joint Convention continued to increase. The forthcoming fourth Review Meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Nuclear Safety Convention scheduled to be held in April 2008 was likely to 
produce outcomes comparable to those achieved in the past. Poland's report for the meeting had been 
prepared and would be submitted on time. 
79. Poland welcomed the improved quality of the revised nuclear safety standards, international 
action plans and codes of conduct, particular those relating to the safety and security of radiation 
sources and the safety of research reactors. Those documents played a significant role in minimizing 
the risks posed by insufficient control of radioactive sources or potential malicious acts against 
research reactors. 
80. In view of plans to introduce nuclear power in the future, Poland was exploring possibilities of 
cooperation with Lithuania and other countries in the region and had joined the GNEP. His country 
was interested in progress in the development of new nuclear technology and in the improvement of 
attendant safety programmes. In that connection, he stressed the importance of the Agency's 
involvement in the INPRO project and its membership of the GIF. Its role in promoting nuclear 
technology could not be overestimated, and Agency initiatives relating to hydrology, human health 
and nutrition should be supported. The results achieved in the framework of PACT, in particular, were 
impressive and a good example of partnership between the Agency and other relevant parties. 
PolandÂs commitment to that Programme had been demonstrated by the extrabudgetary payments it 
had made in 2006; similar action was being considered for 2007. 
81. His country also supported the AgencyÂs cooperation with other organizations, including 
collaboration in basic sciences, particularly in view of the need for better management of nuclear 
knowledge. The Agency had an important role to play in that regard, and should intensify its efforts to 
ensure the availability of the qualified manpower needed to sustain the current level of scientific and 
engineering activities relating to nuclear technology. It should also organize relevant studies and other 
educational activities in Member States. In view of the AgencyÂs limited financial resources, and given 
the real interest on the part of the nuclear industry in educational activities, he suggested that 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17 
September 
2007, 
Page 
14 


extrabudgetary funds might be made available. His country fully supported all relevant initiatives to 
address the issue. 

82. The technical cooperation programme had always been an integral component of the AgencyÂs 
statutory mandate. Poland was a good example of a country that had moved away from being a mere 
recipient to becoming a real partner and an important donor. Together with other European Union 
Member States, Poland contributed to TCDC initiatives, and Polish public institutions participated 
actively in a range of regional projects, offering their knowledge and expertise to other Member 
States. 
83. Assured financing was crucial to the implementation of the Agency's technical cooperation 
activities. All Member States, both donors and recipients, should show their commitment to the 
programme by pledging and paying on time and in full their shares of the TCF target and their NPCs. 
His country strongly supported the application of the due account principle, and was pleased to report 
that Poland had already prepared to pledge and pay its share of the target. 
84. Mr. CRAXI (Italy) underlined his countryÂs appreciation for the important role played by the 
Agency throughout its fifty years of existence. In undertaking its institutional tasks the Agency had 
become an indispensable reference point for international cooperation on the safe and peaceful use of 
atomic energy, and played an irreplaceable role in the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. Italy supported all the activities undertaken by the Agency, and was ready to assume the 
responsibilities associated with membership of the Board of Governors. 
85. The NPT constituted the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and was an essential 
basis for nuclear disarmament. The Treaty underpinned the safeguards system, and its collapse would 
leave a void and could result in a shift away from a multilateral, universal system to a regionally 
disparate one. Parallel progress must be made all three pillars of the Treaty through the strengthening 
of safeguards, achievement of disarmament commitments, and recognition of the responsibilities 
associated with the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
86. Italy believed that any expansion of the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes should be 
accompanied by careful efforts to prevent proliferation as a result of the spread of sensitive nuclear 
technologies. Italy was following with interest the idea of establishing a new framework concerning 
multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, and encouraged the Secretariat to pursue the matter 
seriously. 
87. Practical steps should be taken in order to relaunch the disarmament and non-proliferation 
agenda. The additional protocol should be applied universally and should, together with safeguards 
agreements, become the standard for Agency verification. It should also be a prerequisite in order to 
obtain nuclear materials and technologies. There should be a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, and 
Italy looked forward to the entry into force of the CTBT Â an important element of the global 
disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. Italy would support the commencement of 
negotiations towards the adoption of a fissile material cut-off treaty, in which the Agency could play 
an important role. Such a treaty would constitute a significant step towards nuclear disarmament, an 
obstacle to nuclear terrorism, and would help to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. 
88. Italy remained convinced that the safeguards system constituted the most effective instrument 
for combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular since a multilateral 
approach was essential to increase the credibility of non-proliferation. It was vital to be able to verify 
compliance with the multilateral norms in force and to detect violations.

89. His country welcomed the efforts of the Director General and the verification activities of 
Agency inspectors, particularly in Iran and the DPRK. Italy trusted that the work plan for the 
clarification of outstanding issues agreed with Iran would be applied in its entirety and without delay. 
90. New forms of international cooperation such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Global 
Threat Reduction Initiative, the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism and the G8 Global Partnership were playing a major role in combating nuclear 
proliferation and terrorism. Italy recognized the need to strengthen measures to prevent the risk of 
nuclear terrorism in particular. 
91. Each country needed to accord top priority to nuclear safety. Italy attached great importance to 
the development of a global nuclear safety regime based on international instruments including 
conventions, which were being adopted by an increasing number of Member States, and the AgencyÂs 
safety standards series. The main activities to be addressed at national level in the field of the peaceful 
uses of atomic energy related to the deactivation and dismantling of existing nuclear facilities, and 
radioactive waste and spent fuel management. Italy supported the Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources, and supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of 
Radioactive Sources. From 2001 to 2006, the Italian Government had invested considerably in 
maintaining and improving safety and security at facilities in the process of being decommissioned, 
and would continue to do so for the next 30 months. Italy was committed to the highest international 
standards of safety and security. 
92. In the field of nuclear technology, Italy supported the strengthening of international cooperation 
and participation in new programmes and projects at both European and international levels. Italy's 
national research agencies, universities and industries participated in several European framework 
projects devoted to nuclear security, innovative nuclear systems and advanced fuel cycles. It also 
participated in bilateral agreements, and a national research and development programme concerning 
the national electricity system had been financed for three years by the Ministry of Economic 
Development. 
93. Italy was an active supporter of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and paid its 
contributions to the TCF in full and on time. It also provided significant extrabudgetary resources, and 
Italy was now the second largest donor for programmes of particular interest such as those on 
improving radiotherapy techniques for cancer treatment and the use of isotope techniques in 
connection with nutrition in Africa. 
94. ItalyÂs universities and health institutions had been working with the Agency in the provision of 
technical assistance, in particular in the field of nuclear medicine, through the organization of 
numerous scientific visits and fellowships. Moreover, through UNESCO, Italy contributed 85% of the 
budget of the ICTP whose activities and programmes aimed at promoting international cooperation 
among scientists from all countries. The ICTP was contributing to the achievement of the Millennium 
Development goals, and had trained more than 100 000 researchers from more than 100 countries over 
the previous forty years. 
95. Mr. ALI (Pakistan) said that the Agency enjoyed tremendous respect for the role it played in 
introducing the benefits of nuclear energy into power generation, medicine, agriculture, hydrology, 
geology, industry, the environment and basic sciences. Pakistan was one of the top beneficiaries of the 
AgencyÂs technical and cooperation programme, and was grateful to the Department of Technical 
Cooperation for its assistance. Pakistan, in its turn, had shared its experiences, provided the services of 
experts and offered training and work experience to help other countries. 
96. Nuclear power provided the secure energy supply required for industrial development and was a 
ÂcleanÂ technology, which helped to counter the threat of climate change. Developing countries, which 

GC(51)/OR.2 
17 
September 
2007, 
Page 
16 


faced a major expansion in their demand for energy, should make nuclear energy a more important 
element in their energy mix, but they could not do so without the support of the industrialized nations. 
At present, nuclear energy produced 8800 MW of PakistanÂs annual energy output, which was only 
4.5% of the countryÂs projected energy requirements for the year 2030. His Government hoped for 
international assistance in its plans to expand power generation to meet the demands of a growing 
economy. 

97. Pakistan welcomed the recent initiatives on assurances of supply, and was studying the various 
options with great interest. Any mechanism must be completely trustworthy and should encourage the 
expansion of nuclear power generation through the assured supply of nuclear fuel and other related 
services in a non-discriminatory manner. Pakistan was building a uranium conversion and enrichment 
facility to provide fuel for its nuclear power plants, which it intended to place under Agency 
safeguards. 
98. PakistanÂs safeguards record had remained immaculate in recent decades. A comprehensive 
export control act had been adopted to keep track of materials, goods, technologies and equipment 
related to nuclear and biological weapons and their delivery systems. An oversight board had also 
been established to monitor the implementation of export controls, including those imposed by the 
NSG and other international bodies. 
99. PakistanÂs first nuclear power plant, KANUPP, had been in operation since 1972. Its scheduled 
operational life had been extended by 15 years thanks to extensive refurbishment and safety 
upgrading. A demonstration desalination facility at the KANUPP plant was now expected to open in 
2008. The countryÂs second nuclear power plant, CHASNUPP, was operating satisfactorily; a second 
unit was being constructed on the same site, and Pakistan appreciated the assistance provided by the 
Chinese Government. 
100. PakistanÂs nuclear facilities had an excellent safety record, thanks in part to the nuclear safety 
expertise of the Agency. However, continued international cooperation was essential if countries were 
to have access to the equipment they needed to meet the modern, higher standards of safety and 
reliability in nuclear facilities. The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority had used the AgencyÂs 
safety standards as a basis for its own national regulations governing nuclear installations. His 
Government greatly appreciated the valuable assistance it had received from the Agency in the area of 
nuclear safety and security. 
101. Pakistan was committed to the use of nuclear science and technology for economic 
development. Its nuclear agriculture centres had developed 57 varieties of crops with high yields and 
high resistance to pests and diseases. The nuclear medicine and oncology centres operated by the 
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission provided state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment facilities, and 
the first positron emission tomography facility was under construction. He expressed his appreciation 
for the extensive cooperation and assistance provided by the Agency in those areas. 
102. The Agency was one of the most efficiently run United Nations organizations. Its statutory 
functions were both technically and scientifically challenging and therefore financially demanding. He 
supported the Director GeneralÂs plan to establish a high-level panel of experts to consider options for 
financing the Agency's activities over the next decade, and hoped that the study would also consider 
the need for sufficient, assured and predictable funding for technical cooperation activities. 
103. Mr. ALSUWAYIEL (Saudi Arabia) said that the AgencyÂs record over the past first fifty years 
in encouraging peaceful and safe uses of nuclear energy and preventing its diversion to military uses 
had been impressive. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Agency and its Director General 
conveyed a strong message of support for their work on behalf of security and development.

104. Saudi Arabia strongly supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at promoting peaceful 
applications of nuclear science and technology, nuclear power and the nuclear fuel cycle, food 
production, human health, water resources, management of the environment and industrial 
applications. It also supported the AgencyÂs plans to preserve global nuclear safety and security and to 
ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Moreover, the technical cooperation programme 
played an effective role in raising living standards in Member States, improving government services 
and providing guidance for national development plans. 
105. Saudi Arabia concurred with the view that development depended on the availability of modern 
reliable energy sources, and that current global energy shortages would become more acute. In view of 
the important role played by nuclear energy in electricity generation, many governments planned to 
use nuclear power to meet their current and future needs. It was therefore essential to address issues 
such as exorbitant costs, the safe processing and disposal of radioactive waste, and the risk of 
proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to reassure the general public of the safety of nuclear energy. 
106. Verification of nuclear non-proliferation had become increasingly difficult as more and more 
countries implemented nuclear energy programmes, creating opportunities for diversion of materials 
used in the nuclear fuel cycle at the stages of uranium-235 enrichment and the reprocessing of spent 
fuel. Binding international treaties involving effective verification and the imposition of sanctions in 
the event of non-compliance were thus the only way of preventing proliferation. 
107. Saudi Arabia supported the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and urged the 
international community to work seriously towards ridding the Middle East of weapons of mass 
destruction in order to strengthen regional and international peace and security. His country stressed 
the need to place nuclear facilities in countries of the Middle East region under Agency safeguards and 
urged all countries of the region to accede to the NPT. 
108. Saudi Arabia agreed with the Director GeneralÂs assessment of the changes that had occurred in 
the area of non-proliferation: the emergence of an extensive black market network engaged in he 
trafficking of nuclear material and equipment; the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive 
nuclear technology in a large number of developing countries; and the faltering of the international 
communityÂs nuclear disarmament efforts. His country believed, however, that the persistent reliance 
by some countries on nuclear weapons to guarantee their security might encourage others to seek a 
similar deterrent. Eight or nine countries were now known to possess 27 000 nuclear warheads. They 
posed a threat to which the Middle East was also exposed, Israel having recently announced the wellknown 
fact that it possessed nuclear weapons. 
109. The international community must work jointly to build a conventional security system that did 
not depend on nuclear weapons. Such a system would be based on the following steps: prevention of 
nuclear or radioactive material from falling into the hands of extremist groups; control of productive 
processes involving nuclear material that could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons; and 
acceleration of nuclear disarmament. 
110. Saudi Arabia commended the AgencyÂs pioneering humanitarian work under PACT and had 
responded to the AgencyÂs call for the establishment of a voluntary fund for the purpose. It had also 
responded to the call for donations to the project to make the AgencyÂs documents in its official 
languages available in electronic form, providing the equivalent of 10% of the capital required for the 
project. 
111. In additional to bilateral technical cooperation projects with the Agency involving research and 
training in medical, agricultural, industrial and water resources management, Saudi Arabia participated 
in regional technical cooperation projects with the member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council, 
including joint assessment of power generation plans for the coming decades, the feasibility of the

nuclear power option for seawater desalination, other uses of nuclear technology for sustainable 
development, improvement of the regulatory and legislative structure for radiation protection and 
safety, and enhancement of technological expertise in the areas of nuclear security and radiation 
protection. 

112. He assured the Arab Member States that had supported Saudi ArabiaÂs candidacy for 
membership of the Board of Governors for the forthcoming term that it would discharge its 
responsibilities with due diligence. 
113. Ms. KOZMIDIS LUBURIC (Serbia), having noted that Serbia associated itself fully with the 
statement of the European Union, said that Serbia had, despite many structural, political and economic 
changes over the past fifteen years, remained a member of the Agency, in keeping with its traditional 
commitment to the use of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
114. Serbia supported the AgencyÂs vital activities in the area of nuclear and radiation safety. Her 
GovernmentÂs policy was to ensure that nuclear energy respected the environment and benefited 
present and future generations. Serbia was strongly committed to strengthening further its national 
nuclear system and bringing it into line with international safety standards and practices, and 
improving its nuclear statutory and regulatory infrastructure, inter alia by strengthening national 
capacities and human resources. Her Government was working to ensure that the decommissioning of 
the research reactor at the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences and other activities were carried out 
under the strictest possible conditions of radiation control and safety. Serbia supported the AgencyÂs 
efforts to improve international safety standards, recommendations and relevant international legal and 
political instruments. 
115. Her Government attached great importance to nuclear security issues and was committed to 
pursuing international cooperation to strengthen national nuclear security systems and mechanisms. 
With the assistance of the Agency and other international actors, Serbia was making ongoing progress 
in upgrading its ability to combat illicit trafficking and improving its national physical protection 
system for gaining control over orphan sources. Serbia had signed the amendments to the CPPNM in 
June 2005 and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in 
September 2005, and it had been one of the first countries to ratify the latter, in July 2006. Serbia 
supported all Agency initiatives aimed at strengthening links and joint initiatives among States to 
prevent potential acts of terrorism. It fully endorsed initiatives such as the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative and Security Council resolutions 1373 (2001), 1540 (2004) and others aimed at enhancing 
the mechanisms and capabilities of countries in combating nuclear terrorism. Serbia also supported 
efforts to strengthen the NSF, joint actions by the Agency and the European Union, and was working 
to bring national legislation into line with the legal provisions of the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
116. In 2002, with the assistance of the Agency, the United States of America and the Russian 
Federation, Serbia had removed fresh nuclear fuel from the research reactor at the Vinca Institute, and 
shipped it to its country of origin, the Russian Federation. The decommissioning of the reactor was a 
goal to which her Government was strongly committed and for which further assistance from the 
Agency and the international community was indispensable. 
117. Serbia would continue to support the AgencyÂs programme on strengthening the effectiveness 
and improving the efficiency of verification measures and efforts to develop integrated safeguards in 
accordance with the NPT, to which Serbia had been a party since the beginning. Her delegation 
reaffirmed SerbiaÂs intention to sign an additional protocol as soon as the technical, administrative and 
human-resources capacity had been established.

118. Serbia strongly supported the further improvement of technical cooperation. Her delegation 
thanked the Department of Technical Cooperation, for its dedicated efforts to enhance cooperation 
with Member States in a variety of fields. Serbia appreciated the assistance received in making nuclear 
energy safe and secure. The AgencyÂs support was indispensable for attaining important national and 
international goals, in particular for countries like Serbia, which were upgrading and improving their 
mechanisms in various areas. It was to be hoped that the Agency would continue to increase its efforts 
in that regard. A new, updated CPF for Serbia was in the final phase of preparation, and would also 
help to promote cooperation. 
119. As in the past, Serbia had met all its financial obligations to the Agency, and would continue to 
do so in the future.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(continued) 
(GC(51)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
STAGNO-UGARTE 
(Costa 
Rica) 
stressed 
the 
important 
role 
played 
by 
safeguards 
in 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
in 
supporting 
the 
NPT, 
which 
must 
be 
complied 
with 
in 
full 
by 
every 
Member 
State 
at 
all 
times 
and 
in 
all 
circumstances. 
The 
additional 
protocols, 
which 
allowed 
for 
more 
intrusive 
inspection 
procedures, 
were 
essential 
to 
ensuring 
transparency 
and 
mutual 
confidence. 
2. 
There 
could 
be 
no 
exemptions 
from 
verification. 
Any 
restrictions 
or 
conditions 
placed 
on 
verification 
would 
undermine 
confidence. 
In 
response 
to 
the 
growing 
resistance 
of 
certain 
States, 
the 
international 
community 
must 
encourage 
extensive 
verification 
procedures, 
making 
use 
of 
all 
avenues 
offered 
by 
the 
existing 
legal 
framework 
for 
arms 
control. 
3. 
Costa 
Rica 
urged 
those 
countries 
which 
still 
had 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
facilities 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Nuclear-weapon 
States 
must 
make 
a 
genuine 
commitment 
to 
disarm 
by 
deactivating 
their 
nuclear 
systems, 
dismantling 
their 
stockpiles 
and 
destroying 
their 
weapons 
and 
delivery 
systems. 
His 
delegation 
rejected 
any 
justification 
or 
postponement 
based 
on 
the 
supposed 
deterrent 
effect 
of 
nuclear 
arsenals, 
and 
reiterated 
its 
call 
for 
those 
countries 
to 
adopt 
clear 
timetables 
for 
gradually 
achieving 
general 
and 
universal 
disarmament. 
4. 
The 
abolition 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
army 
had 
been 
a 
milestone 
in 
Costa 
Rican 
history. 
Panama 
and 
Haiti 
had 
recently 
completed 
a 
similar 
transformation. 
Unfortunately, 
enormous 
sums 
were 
still 
being 
squandered 
on 
equipping 
armed 
forces 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
other 
regions 
of 
the 
world. 
5. 
In 
keeping 
with 
Costa 
RicaÂs 
civilian 
tradition, 
the 
administration 
of 
President 
Oscar 
Arias 
SÃ¡nchez 
had 
introduced 
two 
international 
initiatives. 
One 
was 
for 
an 
arms 
trade 
treaty, 
a 
legally 
binding 
instrument 
to 
control 
weapons 
transfers, 
and 
the 
other 
was 
the 
Costa 
Rica 
Consensus, 
which 
was 
designed 
to 
secure 
recognition 
by 
international 
financial 
institutions 
and 
donor 
countries 
of 
those 
States 
which 
committed 
themselves 
to 
an 
Âethical 
investmentÂ 
of 
their 
resources 
by 
reducing 
military 
spending 
and 
increasing 
expenditure 
on 
health 
care, 
education 
and 
other 
social 
services. 
6. 
In 
that 
connection, 
a 
Âdisarmament 
weekÂ 
had 
been 
held 
in 
San 
JosÃ©, 
Costa 
Rica, 
from 
3 
to 
7 
September 
2007, 
at 
which 
a 
number 
of 
events 
had 
been 
organized 
to 
promote 
demilitarization 
and 
disarmament, 
including 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
Cluster 
Munition 
Coalition, 
a 
Latin 
American 
regional 
conference 
to 
promote, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
Tlatelolco 
model, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
cluster-bomb-free 
zone 
and 
the 
prohibition 
of 
the 
use 
of 
such 
weapons, 
and 
a 
seminar 
for 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
on 
the 
management 
and 
security 
of 
stockpiles 
of 
small 
arms 
and 
light 
weapons. 
7. 
Also 
in 
keeping 
with 
its 
traditional 
policy 
of 
promoting 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
Costa 
Rica 
had 
assumed 
the 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Commission 
of 
the 
CTBT 
for 
2007 
and, 
with 
Austria, 
was 
co-chairing 
the 
Conference 
on 
Facilitating 
the 
Entry 
into 
Force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
which 
had 
begun 
the 
day 
before 
in 
Vienna. 
His 
delegation 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
commit 
themselves 
to 
the 
CTBT. 
Those 
that 
had 
not 
done 
so 
should 
sign 
and 
ratify 
it 
without 
delay. 
8. 
Costa 
Rica, 
which 
had 
passed 
basic 
legislation 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
1969, 
was 
about 
to 
confirm 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
its 
support 
for 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 

GC(51)/OR.3

Radioactive 
Sources. 
It 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
to 
support 
Member 
States 
in 
establishing 
safety 
standards 
in 
conformity 
with 
Article 
III 
of 
its 
Statute. 


9. 
The 
three 
Agency 
pillars 
of 
technology 
transfer, 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
verification 
were 
of 
equal 
importance, 
and 
thus 
there 
should 
be 
a 
balance 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
resources 
earmarked 
for 
them. 
10. 
Costa 
Rica 
acknowledged 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
it 
had 
received 
over 
more 
than 
forty 
years, 
which 
had 
greatly 
helped 
to 
promote 
development 
and 
well-being 
in 
the 
country 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
human 
health, 
the 
environment, 
agriculture, 
in 
particular 
pest 
control, 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources, 
and 
radiological 
safety 
and 
protection. 
11. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
should 
assist 
countries, 
such 
as 
Costa 
Rica, 
which 
had 
achieved 
a 
certain 
level 
of 
development 
but 
needed 
to 
consolidate 
their 
national 
capacities 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
self-sufficiency 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
to 
be 
able 
to 
participate 
in 
horizontal 
cooperation 
activities 
to 
help 
other 
less-developed 
countries. 
12. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
work 
together 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
consolidate 
sustainable 
development 
and 
international 
security. 
13. 
Mr. 
SAEED 
(Sudan) 
took 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
golden 
jubilee 
to 
underline 
the 
importance 
of 
its 
role 
not 
only 
in 
applying 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
establishing 
NWFZs 
but 
also 
in 
making 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
option 
available 
to 
all 
Member 
States 
and 
bringing 
them 
diverse 
benefits 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
food 
security, 
health, 
poverty 
eradication 
and 
the 
development 
of 
human 
resources. 
14. 
Sudan 
complied 
fully 
with 
all 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
relevant 
international 
agreements 
that 
it 
had 
acceded 
to 
or 
ratified. 
All 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
taken 
steps 
to 
ratify 
those 
agreements 
should 
be 
encouraged 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
create 
an 
environment 
conducive 
to 
peace 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
Sudan 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
was 
taking 
steps 
to 
ratify 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention. 
It 
was 
also 
about 
to 
complete 
the 
formalities 
for 
ratification 
of 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty 
on 
creating 
an 
African 
NWFZ. 
15. 
Sudan, 
which 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
was 
drafting 
a 
law 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
guidelines, 
the 
most 
important 
feature 
of 
which 
was 
probably 
the 
strict 
separation 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
regulatory 
authority 
from 
the 
various 
users 
of 
radiation 
sources. 
16. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
for 
the 
project 
on 
sustainable 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
in 
Africa, 
including 
in 
Sudan. 
His 
country 
had 
hosted 
a 
project 
coordination 
meeting, 
which 
had 
recommended, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
building 
of 
sustainable 
African 
capacities 
for 
gathering 
and 
conditioning 
spent 
radioactive 
sources. 
17. 
Sudan 
had 
a 
strong 
interest 
in 
the 
nuclear 
option 
for 
electricity 
generation 
and 
hoped 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
that 
regard. 
The 
Sudanese 
Ministry 
of 
Energy 
and 
Mining 
had 
set 
up 
a 
national 
commission 
to 
study 
the 
feasibility 
of 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
produce 
electricity. 
18. 
The 
AFRA 
agreement 
had 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
implementing 
regional 
projects 
with 
Agency 
support, 
in 
coordinating 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
and 
in 
ensuring 
continuity 
of 
their 
results 
in 
Africa. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
called 
for 
support 
for 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
High-level 
African 
Regional 
Conference 
held 
in 
Algeria 
in 
January 
2007. 
19. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
joint 
action 
to 
develop 
the 
AgencyÂs 
water 
resources 
management 
programme, 
the 
production 
of 
potable 
water 
using 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
nuclear 
reactors 
and

PACT. 
It 
was 
also 
important 
to 
support 
the 
African 
UnionÂs 
PATTEC 
as 
well 
as 
all 
Agency 
activities 
aimed 
at 
developing 
innovative 
nuclear 
technology. 


20. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
and 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
promote 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
which 
were 
no 
less 
important 
than 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards, 
verification, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
other 
activities. 
Greater 
balance 
should 
be 
sought 
among 
those 
activities 
in 
order 
to 
fulfil 
Member 
StatesÂ 
aspirations 
to 
enhance 
their 
capacities 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
development. 
21. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
adopt 
policies 
based 
on 
fairness 
and 
equality 
and 
to 
avoid 
applying 
double 
standards, 
which 
undermined 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States. 
The 
Sudanese 
Government 
supported 
Arab 
and 
other 
countries 
that 
were 
deeply 
concerned 
about 
Israeli 
nuclear 
programmes, 
which 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
hence 
represented 
a 
threat 
to 
regional 
peace 
and 
security. 
Israel 
should 
be 
required 
to 
accede 
forthwith 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
22. 
Sudan 
fully 
supported 
the 
agreement 
concluded 
recently 
between 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
settling 
pending 
issues 
with 
respect 
of 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
hoped 
for 
a 
successful 
outcome. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
body 
that 
was 
competent 
to 
decide 
on 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme. 
Moreover, 
he 
stressed 
that 
every 
Member 
State 
had 
the 
right 
to 
develop 
a 
peaceful 
nuclear 
capability 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
NPT. 
23. 
Mr. 
BUGAT 
(France) 
said 
that, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
many 
challenges 
facing 
the 
international 
community 
over 
the 
central 
issues 
of 
non-proliferation, 
his 
country 
continued 
to 
attach 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
NPT. 
The 
Treaty 
limited 
risks 
by 
encouraging 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
allowing 
access 
to 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
while 
ensuring 
that 
no 
civilian 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
technologies 
were 
used 
for 
non-peaceful 
ends. 
Every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
support 
the 
Treaty 
and 
preserve 
its 
integrity 
from 
the 
challenges 
it 
currently 
faced. 
24. 
Although 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
agreed 
on 
a 
work 
plan 
on 
certain 
aspects 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
the 
fact 
that 
Iran 
was 
continuing 
its 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
activities 
was 
a 
cause 
for 
alarm. 
If 
Iran 
could 
not 
be 
persuaded 
to 
suspend 
those 
activities, 
as 
required 
by 
the 
relevant 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
more 
sanctions 
would 
be 
introduced, 
further 
isolating 
the 
Iranian 
authorities. 
Iran 
had 
made 
no 
commitment 
to 
implement 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
additional 
safeguards 
requested 
by 
the 
Agency. 
They 
were 
vital 
instruments 
for 
assessing 
IranÂs 
replies 
to 
its 
questions. 
25. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
DPRK, 
France 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
of 
13 
February 
2007. 
The 
return 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspectors 
and 
the 
confirmed 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
reactor 
were 
positive 
steps 
towards 
compliance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1718. 
The 
DPRK 
had 
chosen 
to 
abandon 
its 
military 
nuclear 
programme 
in 
a 
complete, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner, 
as 
required 
by 
that 
resolution. 
26. 
France 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
the 
move 
towards 
integrated 
safeguards. 
The 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
thereto 
were 
vital 
for 
boosting 
both 
the 
credibility 
of 
Treaty 
verification 
and 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
All 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
subscribe 
to 
those 
legal 
instruments. 
In 
that 
context, 
France 
would 
continue 
to 
encourage 
regional 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
universalization 
of 
that 
regime. 
27. 
Through 
its 
own 
programme 
of 
continuous 
support 
for 
Agency 
safeguards, 
which 
had 
recently 
celebrated 
its 
25th 
anniversary, 
France 
had 
helped 
to 
finance 
activities 
in 
French-speaking 
countries. 
That 
fruitful 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue, 
focusing 
in 
particular 
on 
strengthening 
the 
safeguards 
system 
through 
the 
use 
of 
new 
technologies.

28. 
To 
reduce 
the 
risks 
of 
proliferation, 
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
most 
sensitive 
nuclear 
equipment, 
technologies 
and 
materials 
should 
be 
more 
closely 
controlled. 
In 
that 
regard, 
the 
Agency 
had 
a 
central 
role 
to 
play 
in 
verifying 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
commitments. 
The 
threat 
of 
terrorism 
called 
for 
the 
utmost 
vigilance 
regarding 
the 
risk 
of 
the 
acquisition 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
or 
radioactive 
materials. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
do 
all 
it 
could 
to 
improve 
the 
already 
high 
level 
of 
protection 
and, 
of 
course, 
the 
Agency 
had 
a 
leading 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
regard. 
France 
supported 
Agency 
activities 
under 
the 
nuclear 
security 
plan 
by 
providing 
both 
financial 
and 
technical 
support. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
its 
amendment 
and 
welcomed 
the 
growing 
international 
support 
for 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
29. 
France, 
an 
active 
supporter 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
paid 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full. 
He 
highlighted 
in 
particular 
FranceÂs 
involvement 
under 
AFRA 
and 
ARCAL. 
30. 
Safety 
was 
crucial 
for 
continuing 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
France 
reiterated 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
in 
that 
area. 
France 
supported 
Agency 
activities 
aimed 
at 
improving 
every 
aspect 
of 
safety 
and, 
in 
2007, 
had 
decided 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
extrabudgetary 
programme 
on 
the 
seismic 
evaluation 
of 
existing 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
It 
also 
supported 
Agency 
efforts 
to 
organize 
IRRS 
missions 
and 
had 
itself 
requested 
one 
in 
November 
2006. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
safety 
of 
maritime 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials, 
France 
continued 
to 
hold 
talks 
with 
its 
transport 
and 
coastal 
partners 
to 
improve 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
confidence. 
31. 
France 
was 
pursuing 
an 
ambitious 
but 
responsible 
energy 
policy 
founded 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
safe 
supply 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
its 
strategy 
and, 
in 
2006, 
its 
58 
operating 
reactors 
had 
accounted 
for 
over 
78% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
electricity 
generation. 
Considerable 
sums 
had 
been 
earmarked 
for 
managing 
radioactive 
waste 
as 
France 
had 
opted 
for 
a 
closed 
fuel 
cycle. 
Looking 
to 
the 
future, 
in 
April 
2007 
France 
had 
authorized 
the 
construction 
of 
an 
EPR-type 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Flamanville 
with 
enhanced 
safety 
features. 
32. 
Research 
was 
the 
key 
to 
developing 
sustainable 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
France 
planned 
to 
build 
a 
new 
research 
reactor 
at 
Cadarache 
to 
study 
fuels 
and 
materials. 
The 
French 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(CEA) 
was 
also 
working 
on 
an 
innovative 
fast-neutron 
reactor 
prototype, 
which 
would 
offer 
new 
prospects 
for 
the 
fourth 
generation 
of 
reactors. 
33. 
With 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option 
being 
envisaged 
by 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
States, 
France 
had 
a 
vital 
role 
to 
play 
in 
international 
cooperation. 
Access 
to 
civilian 
nuclear 
technologies 
should 
benefit 
as 
many 
States 
as 
possible 
provided 
they 
respected 
their 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
and 
pursued 
their 
activities 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
good 
faith. 
France 
was 
playing 
an 
active 
part 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
determining 
how 
countries 
should 
set 
up 
an 
appropriate 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
efficient 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
issue 
of 
funding 
equipment 
for 
countries 
new 
to 
the 
technology 
called 
for 
detailed 
discussions 
involving 
the 
international 
financial 
institutions, 
in 
particular 
the 
World 
Bank. 
34. 
In 
addition, 
France 
was 
actively 
participating 
in 
international 
discussions 
on 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
fuel 
cycle. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
make 
constructive 
proposals 
so 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
be 
developed 
responsibly, 
in 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership 
(GNEP). 
Public 
acceptance 
hinged 
upon 
appropriate 
consideration 
of 
the 
associated 
safety, 
security, 
non-proliferation 
and 
environmental 
concerns. 
In 
2006, 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
for 
the 
first 
time 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
a 
resolution 
on 
nuclear 
power 
applications 
that 
had 
noted 
nuclear 
energyÂs 
contribution 
to 
supply 
security 
and 
to 
the 
reduction 
of 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
France 
would 
do 
all 
it 
could 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
same 
consensus 
was 
reached 
in 
2007.

35. 
Highlighting 
the 
importance 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
meeting 
future 
energy 
challenges, 
he 
pointed 
to 
FranceÂs 
involvement 
in 
ITER, 
to 
be 
sited 
at 
Cadarache, 
in 
discussions 
on 
innovative 
technologies 
under 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum 
(GIF), 
and 
also 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
project 
as 
a 
member 
of 
its 
Steering 
Committee. 
36. 
Mr. 
WUERMELING 
(Germany) 
said 
that 
growing 
energy 
needs 
and 
the 
problem 
of 
global 
warming 
had 
led 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
to 
announce 
plans 
to 
include 
or 
expand 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
their 
energy 
mix. 
Others 
had 
decided 
to 
stop 
using 
nuclear 
power 
because 
of 
the 
safety 
risks 
involved. 
Any 
substantial 
increase 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
worldwide 
would 
inevitably 
lead 
to 
an 
increase 
in 
demand 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
services, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
fuel 
supply, 
decommissioning 
and 
waste 
management. 
His 
delegation 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum, 
which 
was 
taking 
place 
simultaneously 
with 
the 
General 
Conference, 
would 
produce 
a 
fruitful 
exchange 
of 
views 
on 
those 
issues. 
37. 
Germany 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
between 
the 
Iranian 
Government 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
modalities 
to 
resolve 
the 
many 
outstanding 
questions 
about 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
programme. 
While 
the 
Iranian 
Government 
had 
been 
more 
cooperative 
in 
recent 
weeks, 
many 
doubts 
still 
remained 
about 
the 
true 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
its 
past 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
Government 
had 
so 
far 
refused 
to 
suspend 
critical 
activities 
relevant 
to 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
adopt 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
or 
comply 
with 
the 
decisions 
of 
the 
Security 
Council. 
Germany 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
with 
its 
partners 
in 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
to 
convince 
the 
Iranian 
Government 
to 
take 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
international 
community 
seriously 
and 
that 
it 
would 
do 
better 
to 
observe 
complete 
transparency 
in 
such 
a 
sensitive 
area 
as 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
38. 
Although 
the 
nuclear 
crisis 
in 
the 
DPRK 
remained 
a 
source 
of 
serious 
concern, 
important 
first 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
towards 
its 
resolution, 
with 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
reactor 
in 
July 
2007 
and 
verification 
of 
it 
by 
the 
Agency. 
The 
DPRK 
must 
now 
fully 
disclose 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
return 
to 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Success 
for 
the 
six-party 
process 
would 
provide 
clear 
proof 
of 
that 
regimeÂs 
effectiveness. 
39. 
An 
effective 
verification 
regime 
was 
of 
paramount 
importance 
and 
Germany, 
like 
many 
other 
Member 
States, 
believed 
that 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
combined 
with 
an 
additional 
protocol 
was 
the 
most 
appropriate 
standard. 
He 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
which 
had 
not 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
40. 
Recent 
proposals 
for 
mechanisms 
to 
assure 
supplies 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
included 
the 
six-party 
proposal, 
in 
which 
Germany 
was 
participating, 
to 
establish 
a 
multilateral 
enrichment 
facility 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
on 
options 
for 
assurance 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
(GOV/INF/2007/11) 
had 
been 
helpful 
in 
that 
regard. 
Germany, 
the 
Netherlands 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
recently 
submitted 
a 
joint 
statement 
concerning 
multilateral 
cooperation 
on 
energy 
security 
(INFCIRC/713). 
Much 
remained 
to 
be 
done; 
any 
future 
framework 
must 
provide 
a 
balance 
between 
non-proliferation 
aspects 
and 
the 
legitimate 
rights 
of 
potential 
consumer 
States 
to 
pursue 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
it 
was 
important 
to 
avoid 
undue 
distortion 
of 
the 
existing 
commercial 
market. 
The 
Agency 
would 
doubtless 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the 
process. 
Germany 
was 
keen 
to 
host 
an 
international 
symposium 
on 
the 
issue 
in 
Berlin 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2008. 
41. 
Germany 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
ambitious 
plans 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
In 
May 
2007, 
during 
the 
German 
Presidency 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
the 
European 
Council 
had 
approved 
the 
Council 
Conclusions 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Safe 
Management 
of 
Spent 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
and 
Radioactive 
Waste, 
which 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear 
safety. 
Also 
during 
the 
German 
Presidency, 
the 
G8 
group 
had 
reaffirmed 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
standards 
and 

GC(51)/OR.3

recommendations 
formed 
a 
sound 
basis 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
for 
national 
regulatory 
systems. 
Germany 
welcomed 
the 
increased 
importance 
accorded 
to 
self-assessment 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
missions. 
Germany 
was 
currently 
preparing 
for 
an 
OSART 
mission 
in 
October 
2007 
and 
an 
IRRS 
mission 
in 
mid-2008. 


42. 
Germany 
also 
welcomed 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
it 
intended 
to 
ratify 
before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
participate 
in 
Agency 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
further 
developments 
in 
that 
field. 
43. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
provided 
valuable 
assistance 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
management 
and 
environmental 
protection, 
which 
improved 
living 
conditions 
in 
Member 
States 
and 
their 
scientific 
and 
commercial 
potential. 
Germany 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
those 
activities. 
44. 
The 
Agency 
would 
inevitably 
face 
new 
challenges 
in 
the 
future, 
which 
would 
require 
effective 
management 
and 
priority-setting. 
Funding 
and 
staff 
levels 
could 
not 
expand 
beyond 
certain 
limits. 
Germany 
was 
willing 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
Â20/20Â 
initiative 
to 
study 
the 
consequences 
of 
those 
new 
challenges. 
With 
open-mindedness 
and 
flexibility 
on 
the 
part 
of 
all 
concerned, 
it 
would 
be 
possible 
to 
find 
an 
appropriate 
and 
economically 
viable 
way 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
the 
indispensable 
work 
it 
had 
begun 
fifty 
years 
before. 
45. 
Mr. 
YUTHAVONG 
(Thailand) 
said 
that 
for 
half 
a 
century 
the 
Agency 
had 
provided 
outstanding 
service 
to 
the 
global 
community 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
safety 
and 
verification. 
In 
the 
face 
of 
significant 
challenges 
in 
recent 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
defended 
and 
enhanced 
its 
integrity 
through 
unfaltering 
impartiality. 
Thailand, 
a 
founding 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
was 
proud 
to 
have 
contributed 
to 
its 
mission 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
so 
in 
the 
future. 
46. 
In 
July, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
given 
a 
keynote 
address 
at 
the 
sixth 
Congress 
on 
Science 
and 
Technology 
for 
Development 
in 
Bangkok, 
in 
which 
he 
had 
noted 
that 
nearly 
every 
aspect 
of 
development 
Â 
from 
reducing 
poverty 
to 
improving 
health 
care 
Â 
required 
reliable 
access 
to 
modern 
energy 
services. 
In 
that 
regard, 
the 
Thailand 
GovernmentÂs 
recent 
initiatives 
on 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
sustainable 
development 
were 
consistent 
with 
the 
need 
for 
clean, 
safe 
and 
secure 
energy 
options. 
Thailand 
was 
promoting 
a 
Âsufficiency 
economyÂ, 
taking 
a 
moderate, 
reasonable 
path 
towards 
economic 
development 
in 
the 
context 
of 
globalization 
and 
exploring 
all 
possible 
options. 
47. 
Energy 
consumption 
in 
Thailand, 
as 
in 
many 
other 
developing 
countries, 
had 
increased 
significantly. 
Although 
his 
country 
relied 
traditionally 
on 
fossil 
fuels, 
in 
particular 
petroleum 
products 
and 
natural 
gas, 
national 
energy 
security 
had 
been 
maintained 
through 
a 
diversity 
of 
energy 
sources. 
Thailand 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
clean 
and 
environmentally-friendly 
energy 
sources, 
and 
his 
Government 
continued 
to 
support 
research 
into 
alternative 
and 
renewable 
energy 
technologies. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
one 
such 
energy 
option. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
recent 
increases 
in 
oil 
prices 
and 
environmental 
concerns, 
his 
Government 
had 
adopted 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
option 
in 
its 
national 
power 
development 
plan 
for 
2007Â2021, 
providing 
for 
the 
generation 
of 
some 
4000 
MW 
of 
electricity 
by 
the 
year 
2020. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
came 
with 
responsibility, 
and 
Thailand 
would 
ensure 
that 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
was 
in 
place 
and 
that 
international 
standards 
were 
met. 
Funding 
had 
been 
obtained 
for 
the 
development 
of 
manpower, 
for 
public 
awareness 
and 
for 
safety 
and 
security 
programmes. 
Risk 
management 
was 
being 
given 
high 
priority 
in 
all 
stages 
of 
future 
planning 
as 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
efforts 
to 
obtain 
public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
development. 
48. 
Nuclear 
activities 
in 
Thailand 
had 
focused 
on 
R&D 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
science, 
and 
on 
the 
production 
and 
application 
of 
radioisotopes 
for 
medical, 
agricultural 
and 
industrial 
use. 
The 
nuclear 
infrastructure 
had 
been 
reorganized 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
as 
the 
regulatory 
agency, 
and 
the 
Thailand 
Institute 
of 
Nuclear 
Technology 
as 
the 
operating 
and 
R&D 
agency.

49. 
Thailand 
was 
keen 
to 
strengthen 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
launching 
its 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
The 
National 
Energy 
Policy 
Council 
(NEPC) 
had 
already 
begun 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
concerning 
technical 
assistance 
to 
support 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
programme. 
Thailand 
had 
also 
appointed 
a 
Nuclear 
Power 
Infrastructure 
Preparation 
Committee 
to 
assume 
overall 
responsibility 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure 
plan. 
Representatives 
of 
the 
Committee 
had 
already 
met 
with 
Agency 
experts; 
further 
discussions 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Thailand 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
month 
and 
a 
workshop 
arranged 
in 
early 
2008. 
50. 
The 
Thai 
people 
were 
enjoying 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
such 
fields 
as 
agriculture, 
nutrition, 
human 
health 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
The 
SIT 
had 
proven 
to 
be 
technically 
and 
economically 
feasible 
in 
Thailand. 
Food 
irradiation 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
promising 
and 
effective 
techniques, 
making 
it 
possible 
to 
meet 
standards 
for 
export 
controls 
and 
playing 
an 
important 
role 
in 
food 
security. 
Also, 
Thailand 
had 
started 
a 
national 
programme 
in 
isotope 
hydrology. 
It 
had 
a 
comprehensive 
water 
cycle 
plan 
aimed 
at 
improving 
irrigation 
lines 
for 
farming, 
protecting 
against 
subsidence 
and 
preparing 
for 
climate 
change. 
51. 
Having 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
efforts 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
and 
the 
Agenda 
21 
principles 
for 
sustainable 
development, 
he 
said 
that 
many 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
Thailand 
had 
grown 
out 
of 
the 
active 
cooperation 
between 
Thailand 
and 
the 
Agency, 
in 
particular 
through 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Thailand 
reaffirmed 
its 
continuing 
support 
for 
the 
TCF 
and 
recognized 
the 
need 
for 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable 
funding. 
52. 
Thailand 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
It 
had 
made 
every 
effort 
to 
ensure 
adherence 
to 
the 
international 
safety 
regime 
by 
reviewing 
and 
revising 
national 
legislation 
and 
procedures, 
thereby 
ensuring 
that 
Thailand 
was 
meeting 
its 
obligations 
and 
enhancing 
the 
regimeÂs 
effectiveness. 
As 
a 
State 
Party 
to 
the 
Early 
Notification 
and 
Assistance 
Conventions 
and 
other 
related 
conventions, 
Thailand 
had 
already 
participated 
in 
various 
training 
activities. 
53. 
His 
country 
reaffirmed 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
system 
as 
well 
as 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
concerning 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
particularly 
in 
the 
context 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
capacity 
to 
respond 
adequately 
to 
current 
and 
future 
proliferation 
challenges 
should 
be 
enhanced. 
Thailand 
was 
prepared 
to 
ratify 
the 
relevant 
protocols 
and 
conventions 
as 
soon 
as 
its 
domestic 
legal 
requirements 
had 
been 
met. 
54. 
Turning 
to 
non-proliferation, 
he 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
first 
preparatory 
meeting 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
more 
positive 
developments 
in 
the 
future. 
Global 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
should 
be 
matched 
by 
efforts 
of 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
address 
general 
and 
complete 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Thailand 
shared 
the 
views 
of 
NAM 
in 
that 
regard. 
55. 
Thailand 
remained 
committed 
to 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
develop 
research, 
produce 
and 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
under 
the 
NPT. 
It 
therefore 
supported 
IranÂs 
right 
do 
so, 
provided 
it 
complied 
with 
its 
international 
safeguards 
obligations 
and 
transparency 
measures. 
Thailand 
welcomed 
the 
work 
plan 
devised 
for 
Iran 
to 
address 
and 
resolve 
all 
outstanding 
issues 
within 
a 
definite 
timeline 
as 
it 
created 
another 
window 
of 
opportunity 
for 
dialogue 
and 
diplomacy. 
It 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
intensify 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
demonstrate 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
full 
and 
timely 
implementation 
of 
the 
work 
plan. 
All 
parties 
concerned 
should 
exercise 
patience 
to 
allow 
the 
negotiation 
process 
to 
take 
its 
course 
and 
avoid 
confrontation. 
56. 
Thailand 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
verifying 
and 
confirming 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
facility 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
which 
was 
as 
a 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 
It 
strongly 
encouraged 
the 

GC(51)/OR.3 
18

DPRK 
to 
continue 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
participation 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
a 
comprehensive 
peace 
and 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 


57. 
The 
year 
2007 
marked 
the 
tenth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
NWFZ 
under 
the 
Bangkok 
Treaty, 
which 
provided 
a 
timely 
opportunity 
to 
reflect 
on 
past 
progress 
and 
look 
to 
the 
future. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
plan 
of 
action 
endorsed 
in 
July 
by 
the 
Commission 
for 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
NWFZ, 
seeking 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Treaty. 
The 
establishment 
of 
the 
NWFZ 
underscored 
the 
regionÂs 
commitment 
to 
peace 
and 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
as 
a 
whole. 
58. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
said 
that 
human 
security 
depended 
to 
a 
large 
extent 
on 
freedom 
from 
want. 
Peaceful 
nuclear 
applications, 
including 
nuclear 
power 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
viable 
vehicle 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
Thailand 
had 
decided 
to 
opt 
for 
nuclear 
power 
with 
a 
view 
to 
diversifying 
its 
energy 
resources 
and 
to 
shield 
itself 
from 
external 
energy 
factors 
and 
the 
destabilizing 
effects 
of 
globalization. 
59. 
Mr. 
FERNÃNDEZ 
ZUCCO 
(Dominican 
Republic) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
particularly 
its 
efforts 
to 
guarantee 
the 
safe 
and 
reliable 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
to 
enable 
its 
Member 
States 
to 
benefit 
from 
those 
technologies 
through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Committed 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate 
Âto 
accelerate 
and 
enlarge 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity 
throughout 
the 
worldÂ, 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
was 
willing 
to 
cooperate 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
of 
its 
functions, 
including 
combating 
poverty 
in 
developing 
countries. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
importance 
his 
Government 
attached 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
the 
National 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
been 
elevated 
to 
ministerial 
status, 
enabling 
it 
to 
step 
up 
its 
activities 
on 
promoting 
nuclear 
energy 
applications 
and 
strengthening 
radiological 
protection 
nationwide. 
In 
the 
same 
spirit, 
his 
Government 
had 
made 
a 
commitment 
to 
pay 
in 
full 
all 
its 
outstanding 
arrears 
to 
the 
Agency. 
60. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
was 
committed 
to 
creating 
a 
satisfactory 
nuclear 
infrastructure, 
so 
that 
it 
could 
benefit 
safely 
and 
efficiently 
from 
nuclear 
applications 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
to 
guarantee 
radiological 
and 
physical 
security 
and 
meet 
the 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
materials. 
His 
Government 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
strengthening 
its 
radiological 
protection 
infrastructure, 
including 
training 
staff 
in 
handling 
radioactive 
sources, 
the 
disposal 
of 
disused 
sources, 
emergency 
response 
and 
controlling 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
materials. 
Also, 
it 
had 
set 
up 
regulatory 
bodies 
to 
coordinate 
controls 
at 
all 
points 
of 
entry 
and 
exit. 
61. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
acknowledged 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
strengthen 
cooperation 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
management. 
As 
a 
coastal 
State 
with 
a 
special 
interest 
in 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
maritime 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials, 
it 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
international 
regime 
on 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
process 
of 
dialogue 
among 
relevant 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
countries 
and 
stressed 
the 
need 
for 
shipping 
countries 
to 
notify 
coastal 
countries 
in 
advance 
of 
shipments 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
62. 
Nuclear 
energy 
applications 
lay 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
the 
search 
to 
solve 
the 
problems 
facing 
humanity. 
Over 
the 
previous 
half 
a 
century, 
those 
applications 
had 
expanded 
to 
practically 
every 
field 
of 
human 
activity. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
health, 
nuclear 
medicine 
for 
the 
prevention, 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
diseases, 
especially 
cancer 
and 
heart 
disease, 
was 
vital 
for 
saving 
human 
life. 
Isotope 
techniques 
played 
a 
very 
important 
role 
in 
many 
aspects 
of 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
such 
as 
detecting 
soil 
pollution, 
creating 
new 
plant 
varieties, 
controlling 
pests 
by 
means 
of 
the 
SIT 
and 
fortifying 
foods, 
especially 
for 
pregnant 
women. 
Nuclear 
techniques 
were 
also 
vital 
to 
improve 
understanding 
of 
water 
cycles 
and 
for 
the 
sustainable 
use 
of 
aquifers, 
and 
nuclear 
science 
provided 
effective 
tools 
for 
analysing 
air 
and 
sea

pollutants. 
Nuclear 
power 
now 
accounted 
for 
17% 
of 
the 
energy 
consumed 
worldwide 
and 
in 
future 
small 
and 
medium-sized 
reactors, 
combining 
electricity 
production 
with 
water 
desalination, 
would 
help 
to 
meet 
basic 
needs 
in 
developing 
countries. 


63. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
crucial 
for 
transferring 
nuclear 
technologies 
to 
developing 
countries. 
In 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
helped 
develop 
national 
capabilities 
for 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications. 
Thanks 
to 
Agency 
support, 
personnel 
had 
received 
training 
in 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
resources, 
the 
environment 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
the 
installation 
of 
cancer 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
facilities, 
the 
creation 
of 
dosimetry 
laboratories 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
radiation 
protection 
regulations. 
The 
wide 
range 
of 
ministries, 
directorates, 
universities, 
hospitals 
and 
other 
institutions 
that 
had 
benefited 
from 
Agency 
cooperation 
in 
his 
country 
reflected 
the 
extent 
of 
its 
impact. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
would 
continue 
to 
strengthen 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
focusing 
on 
areas 
where 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
contribute 
more 
effectively 
to 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
development 
priorities. 
64. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
also 
providing 
support 
for 
the 
Dominican 
RepublicÂs 
neighbour, 
Haiti. 
The 
Dominican 
Republic 
was 
cooperating 
closely 
with 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
Government 
of 
Haiti 
to 
help 
the 
Haitian 
people. 
It 
was 
taking 
part 
in 
many 
joint 
projects, 
in 
particular 
along 
the 
border, 
following 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Dominican 
and 
Haitian 
Joint 
Commission, 
to 
which 
the 
National 
Energy 
Commission 
of 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
belonged. 
Nuclear 
energy 
could 
continue 
to 
contribute 
considerably 
to 
joint 
solutions 
to 
the 
problems 
both 
countries 
faced 
and 
Agency 
support 
was 
welcome 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
mechanisms 
enabling 
the 
two 
countries, 
which 
shared 
a 
single 
island, 
to 
cooperate 
more 
closely. 
65. 
At 
the 
Ministerial 
Conference 
on 
ÂEnergy 
in 
a 
Changing 
WorldÂ, 
held 
in 
May 
2007 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
UNESCO, 
it 
had 
been 
agreed 
that 
access 
to 
adequate 
energy 
supplies 
should 
be 
accorded 
as 
much 
priority 
as 
health 
and 
education. 
Poverty 
reduction 
hinged 
on 
reducing 
dependence 
on 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
increasing 
diversification 
and 
on 
the 
use 
of 
cheaper, 
more 
environmentally 
friendly 
fuels. 
Priority 
should 
be 
given 
to 
developing 
energy 
production, 
such 
as 
biofuel, 
that 
would 
increase 
economic 
and 
environmental 
self-sufficiency, 
to 
fostering 
renewable 
energy 
and 
to 
studying 
different 
options 
for 
generating 
electricity 
and 
increasing 
energy 
efficiency. 
Most 
countries 
were 
net 
importers 
of 
hydrocarbons 
and 
were 
obliged 
to 
devote 
valuable 
resources 
that 
should 
be 
spent 
on 
health 
and 
education 
on 
fuel 
supplies. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
response 
to 
the 
growing 
interest 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation 
were 
important. 
His 
Government 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
studying 
that 
option. 
Small 
countries, 
like 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
might 
consider 
building 
mini-nuclear 
power 
plants. 
66. 
He 
drew 
particular 
attention 
to 
Agency 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
design 
of 
smaller, 
low-cost 
reactors 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
common 
criteria 
for 
developing 
and 
installing 
nuclear 
plants 
in 
developing 
countries, 
taking 
into 
account 
institutional 
and 
infrastructure 
factors 
and 
technology 
and 
design 
options. 
Those 
could 
offer 
viable 
solutions 
for 
countries 
like 
his 
own 
and 
Haiti. 
The 
Government 
of 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
was 
very 
interested 
in 
taking 
an 
active 
part 
in 
that 
process. 
67. 
His 
country 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
activities 
in 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
materials 
were 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
not 
for 
producing 
weapons. 
Thus, 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
signed 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
1973. 
Also, 
along 
with 
17 
other 
countries, 
it 
had 
accepted 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
SQP 
approved 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2005. 
During 
the 
General 
Conference 
he 
would 
be 
signing, 
on 
behalf 
of 
his 
Government, 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
his 
countryÂs 
safeguards 
agreement.

68. 
He 
concluded 
by 
reiterating 
the 
Dominican 
RepublicÂs 
support 
for 
and 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
ensure 
that 
atomic 
energy 
served 
peace 
and 
progress. 
The 
world 
was 
a 
safer 
place 
thanks 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
peaceful 
vision. 
69. 
Mr. 
WINKLER 
(Austria) 
said 
that 
now, 
more 
than 
ever 
before, 
the 
Agency 
was 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
world 
attention 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
global 
security. 
People 
were 
increasingly 
concerned 
about 
the 
dangers 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
threat 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
technology, 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
The 
pressing 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
dominated 
the 
political 
debate 
and 
was 
a 
major 
challenge 
for 
the 
international 
community. 
70. 
In 
her 
welcoming 
address 
the 
day 
before, 
AustriaÂs 
Foreign 
Minister 
Ursula 
Plassnik 
had 
called 
for 
a 
revitalization 
of 
the 
vision 
of 
a 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
under 
multilateral 
control 
as 
one 
possible 
solution. 
A 
multilateral 
approach 
could 
make 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
overcoming 
international 
tensions 
regarding 
the 
use 
or 
misuse 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology. 
Austria 
fully 
endorsed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assessment 
that 
the 
long-term 
goal 
must 
be 
a 
new 
multilateral 
framework 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
that 
would 
eventually 
include 
converting 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
facilities 
from 
national 
to 
multilateral 
operations 
and 
limiting 
such 
facilities 
to 
exclusively 
multilateral 
operations. 
71. 
The 
dual-track 
initiative 
proposed 
by 
Minister 
Plassnik 
at 
the 
meeting 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
held 
in 
Vienna 
earlier 
in 
the 
year 
would 
increase 
transparency 
beyond 
current 
Agency 
safeguards 
obligations 
and 
start 
a 
gradual 
multilateralization 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
under 
Agency 
auspices 
and 
control. 
72. 
One 
key 
element 
of 
such 
a 
regime 
would 
be 
a 
new 
approach 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
namely 
no 
distinction 
being 
made 
between 
the 
ÂhavesÂ 
and 
the 
Âhave-notsÂ, 
only 
between 
the 
ÂwantsÂ 
and 
the 
Âwant-notsÂ. 
For 
those 
that 
had 
chosen 
nuclear 
energy, 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
should 
be 
a 
strictly 
regulated 
but 
impartial 
and 
fair 
exercise. 
The 
only 
long-term 
alternative 
to 
open 
proliferation 
of 
sensitive 
technology 
was 
a 
system 
in 
which 
all 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
facilities 
were 
under 
multilateral 
control. 
73. 
A 
system 
in 
which 
all 
States 
felt 
that 
they 
had 
ownership 
of 
the 
sensitive 
technology 
would 
be 
the 
best 
way 
to 
counter 
a 
climate 
of 
mistrust. 
The 
EU 
could 
point 
to 
the 
success 
of 
its 
own 
founding 
instruments, 
which 
had 
multilateralized 
potentially 
dangerous 
goods 
and 
technologies 
and 
thereby 
contributed 
to 
the 
close 
relations 
of 
mutual 
confidence 
that 
EU 
members 
shared 
today. 
74. 
For 
Austria, 
the 
strength 
and 
foundation 
of 
the 
NPT 
was 
in 
the 
carefully 
crafted 
balance 
of 
its 
three 
pillars: 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
However, 
some 
actors 
were 
preventing 
the 
Agency 
from 
fulfilling 
its 
duties 
under 
the 
Treaty, 
thus 
calling 
into 
question 
the 
whole 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
cornerstone 
agreement 
of 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
system, 
which 
had 
been 
further 
undermined 
by 
recent 
developments. 
A 
strong 
commitment 
of 
the 
entire 
international 
community 
to 
enforcing 
compliance 
with 
the 
TreatyÂs 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
was 
urgently 
needed. 
If 
the 
basic 
bargain 
of 
the 
NPT 
came 
undone, 
if 
non-compliance 
was 
tolerated 
or 
exceptions 
were 
conceded, 
the 
system 
would 
seriously 
be 
harmed. 
75. 
There 
was 
a 
clear 
linkage 
between 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
The 
only 
sustainable 
long-term 
approach 
to 
addressing 
the 
dangers 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
was 
to 
reduce 
reliance 
on 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Consequently, 
States 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons 
must 
honour 
their 
commitments 
and 
take 
serious 
steps 
towards 
disarmament. 
That 
was 
becoming 
a 
matter 
of 
credibility. 
It 
was 
high 
time 
to 
overcome 
the 
differences 
that 
had 
characterized 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
debate 
in 
the 
past 
years 
and 
to 
reach 
a 
new 
consensus. 
76. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety, 
Austria 
welcomed 
the 
performance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
SCART. 
However, 
recent 
events 
in 
Europe 
and 
worldwide 
indicated 
that 
the 
safety 
culture 
was 
deteriorating 
in 

GC(51)/OR.3

11 


both 
the 
operating 
organizations 
and 
in 
regulatory 
oversight. 
That 
was 
a 
cause 
of 
concern 
and 
his 
delegation 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
increase 
its 
activities 
in 
that 
respect. 
Austria 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
measures 
within 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
to 
enhance 
the 
impact 
on 
safety 
improvement 
through 
measured 
change, 
as 
proposed 
by 
INSAG. 
It 
was 
concerned, 
however, 
that 
after 
fifty 
years 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
were 
still 
not 
fully 
applied 
by 
the 
entire 
nuclear 
community. 
It 
thus 
supported 
the 
Agency 
in 
its 
effort 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
safety 
standards 
were 
applied 
in 
a 
harmonized 
manner 
and 
to 
the 
full 
extent. 


77. 
Austria 
took 
note 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
information 
document 
entitled 
ÂConsiderations 
to 
Launch 
a 
Nuclear 
Power 
ProgrammeÂ, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
preconditions 
which 
the 
Agency 
set 
with 
regard 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
to 
relationships 
with 
neighbouring 
States 
and 
the 
international 
community. 
Austria 
shared 
the 
AgencyÂs 
view 
that 
strong 
involvement 
by 
all 
stakeholders, 
especially 
the 
citizens 
affected, 
was 
essential. 
That 
also 
held 
true 
in 
a 
transboundary 
context. 
78. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
examination 
of 
innovative 
and 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
technologies 
should 
focus 
on 
challenges 
arising 
from 
new 
technologies 
for 
the 
governments 
and 
regulatory 
authorities 
of 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
countries 
alike. 
Austria 
would 
therefore 
have 
difficulty 
accepting 
Agency 
activities 
designed 
to 
support 
the 
development 
of 
technologies 
for 
new 
and 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactors. 
That 
was 
clearly 
a 
matter 
for 
the 
nuclear 
industry. 
Instead, 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
a 
driving 
force 
in 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
of 
such 
nuclear 
installations. 
79. 
Many 
meetings, 
conferences 
and 
workshops 
in 
recent 
years, 
some 
of 
them 
co-organized 
by 
the 
Agency, 
had 
pointed 
to 
an 
imminent 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Despite 
nominal 
safety 
improvements 
in 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
the 
long 
list 
of 
near 
misses 
showed 
that 
serious 
accidents 
could 
never 
be 
excluded 
and 
nuclear 
installations 
could 
be 
only 
marginally 
protected 
against 
terrorist 
attacks. 
Proliferation 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
serious 
problem 
and 
a 
sustainable 
solution 
of 
the 
radioactive 
waste 
problem 
was 
not 
in 
sight. 
80. 
Looking 
ahead 
to 
the 
fourth 
review 
meeting 
under 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
which 
was 
due 
to 
take 
place 
soon, 
he 
said 
that 
Austria 
would 
continue 
to 
contribute 
to 
all 
international 
activities 
which 
aimed 
at 
improving 
safety 
levels 
worldwide. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
was 
a 
very 
important 
tool 
in 
that 
regard, 
and 
its 
review 
meetings 
provided 
a 
welcome 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
progress 
in 
Member 
States 
and 
exchange 
views 
on 
how 
best 
to 
implement 
its 
provisions. 
81. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
indispensable 
part 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Repeated 
cases 
of 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes 
that 
had 
gone 
undetected 
by 
traditional 
safeguards 
measures 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
that 
system. 
It 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
be 
able 
to 
draw 
safeguards 
conclusions 
regarding 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
all 
nuclear 
material 
in 
States. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
to 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
provided 
the 
Agency 
with 
much 
more 
complete 
insight 
into 
StatesÂ 
nuclear 
programmes, 
thereby 
making 
detection 
of 
clandestine 
activities 
possible. 
Austria 
therefore 
continued 
strongly 
to 
advocate 
adherence 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
it 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
negotiate 
and 
conclude 
additional 
protocols 
to 
their 
safeguards 
agreements 
without 
further 
delay. 
In 
AustriaÂs 
view, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol 
was 
a 
legal 
obligation 
for 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Regrettably, 
a 
number 
of 
such 
States 
had 
still 
not 
even 
concluded 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement. 
82. 
Austria 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
The 
amended 
Convention 
would 
be 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
both 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
but 
progress 
in 
the 
ratification 
of 
the 
2005 
amendment 
was 
disappointingly 
slow. 
His 
delegation 
encouraged 
all 
States 
Parties 
to 
that 
Convention 
to 
do 
their 
utmost 
to 
ensure 
the 
earliest 
possible 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendment.

83. 
Nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
trade 
could 
not 
take 
place 
without 
the 
proper 
nuclear 
security 
environment. 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
could 
supply 
nuclear 
items 
only 
if 
they 
could 
be 
confident 
that 
they 
were 
not 
misused 
for 
a 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
or 
for 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards, 
including 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
must 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
an 
effective 
physical 
protection 
system, 
effective 
measures 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
effective 
export 
controls. 
84. 
The 
Agency 
had 
proven 
often 
enough 
its 
reliability 
and 
efficiency 
on 
the 
international 
scene. 
With 
its 
special 
focus 
on 
monitoring, 
verification 
and 
assistance, 
it 
made 
a 
vital 
contribution 
to 
strengthening 
Vienna 
as 
a 
centre 
of 
competence 
for 
the 
interrelated 
issues 
of 
security 
and 
development. 
85. 
His 
Government 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
dedicated 
work 
of 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
previous 
year. 
As 
in 
the 
past, 
Austria 
would 
continue 
to 
lend 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
safer 
world. 
86. 
Mr. 
EL-KHOURY 
(Lebanon) 
said 
that 
Lebanon 
was 
still 
suffering 
the 
destructive 
consequences 
of 
IsraelÂs 
abominable 
attack 
on 
the 
country 
one 
year 
previously. 
However, 
thanks 
to 
the 
united 
stance 
of 
the 
Lebanese 
people 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Government 
and 
the 
resistance, 
Lebanon 
had 
come 
through 
its 
ordeal 
and 
drawn 
up 
a 
reconstruction 
plan. 
Yet 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
cluster 
bombs 
were 
still 
scattered 
over 
the 
south 
of 
the 
country, 
claiming 
innocent 
victims 
every 
day 
and 
restricting 
the 
freedom 
of 
movement 
and 
employment 
of 
the 
local 
population. 
The 
Israeli 
aggression 
thus 
continued 
to 
inflict 
damage 
even 
after 
the 
cessation 
of 
hostilities 
pursuant 
to 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1701(2006). 
The 
United 
Nations 
Human 
Rights 
Council 
had 
described 
such 
conduct 
as 
equivalent 
to 
war 
crimes. 
Lebanon 
warmly 
thanked 
Arab 
and 
other 
countries 
that 
had 
provided 
or 
pledged 
generous 
assistance 
for 
reconstruction 
in 
the 
form 
of 
grants 
and 
loans. 
87. 
It 
was 
hoped 
that 
the 
requisite 
measures 
to 
establish 
an 
international 
tribunal 
on 
the 
assassination 
of 
Prime 
Minister 
Rafiq 
Hariri 
would 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2007, 
reflecting 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
halt 
political 
violence 
and 
assassinations 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
justice 
prevailed 
in 
a 
peace-loving 
country 
that 
was 
a 
model 
in 
todayÂs 
troubled 
world 
of 
intercommunal 
coexistence 
and 
collaboration. 
88. 
LebanonÂs 
sufferings 
in 
summer 
2006 
illustrated 
the 
need 
for 
all 
States 
concerned 
to 
promote 
the 
implementation 
of 
international 
resolutions 
concerning 
the 
liberation 
of 
southern 
Lebanese 
territory 
that 
continued 
to 
be 
occupied 
by 
Israel, 
the 
release 
of 
Lebanese 
prisoners 
from 
Israeli 
jails, 
and 
the 
handover 
by 
Israel 
of 
maps 
indicating 
the 
location 
of 
mines 
planted 
in 
Lebanese 
territory 
prior 
to 
its 
withdrawal 
from 
part 
of 
that 
territory 
in 
2000 
and 
of 
a 
list 
of 
sites 
on 
which 
cluster 
bombs 
were 
dropped 
during 
the 
2006 
aggression. 
The 
international 
community, 
which 
had 
stood 
by 
Lebanon 
during 
and 
after 
the 
aggression, 
should 
now 
bring 
pressure 
to 
bear 
on 
Israel 
to 
halt 
its 
attacks 
and 
to 
comply 
with 
international 
resolutions 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
latest 
Arab 
peace 
initiative 
launched 
at 
the 
Beirut 
summit 
called, 
inter 
alia, 
for 
the 
return 
of 
Palestinian 
refugees 
to 
the 
land 
from 
which 
they 
were 
expelled 
in 
1948. 
89. 
Referring 
to 
the 
draft 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
concerning 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat, 
he 
said 
that 
IsraelÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
placing 
of 
its 
nuclear 
capabilities 
Â 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
had 
been 
confirmed 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
on 
11 
December 
2006 
Â 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
would 
reduce 
the 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region 
and 
hence 
in 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
approach 
the 
matter 
from 
the 
standpoint 
of 
its 
aspiration 
for 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace.

Lebanon 
believed 
that 
every 
State 
had 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
agreements 
concluded 
with 
the 
Agency. 
All 
issues 
related 
to 
that 
right 
should 
be 
addressed 
objectively 
without 
reference 
to 
political 
considerations. 
91. 
The 
Agency 
continuously 
supported 
the 
Lebanese 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission. 
It 
had 
drawn 
up 
a 
human 
resources 
training 
programme 
under 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
as 
well 
as 
specialized 
academic 
programmes. 
Projects 
to 
prevent 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
were 
currently 
being 
implemented. 
Lebanon 
was 
also 
establishing 
a 
national 
nuclear 
security 
commission 
pursuant 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540(2004). 
His 
country 
was 
particularly 
grateful 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
for 
its 
assistance 
during 
the 
Israeli 
aggression 
in 
2006 
in 
establishing 
whether 
there 
were 
any 
traces 
of 
depleted 
uranium 
or 
other 
radioactive 
material 
in 
areas 
subjected 
to 
bombardment 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
assistance 
of 
UNEP. 
Lebanon 
also 
greatly 
appreciated 
its 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation. 
92. 
Lebanon 
was 
taking 
steps 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
small 
number 
of 
conventions 
to 
which 
it 
was 
not 
yet 
a 
party. 
A 
few 
days 
previously 
it 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
SQP. 
The 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
had 
referred 
a 
bill 
concerning 
the 
Agreement 
on 
Privileges 
and 
Immunities 
to 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Deputies, 
and 
the 
Chamber 
of 
Deputies 
had 
authorized 
the 
Government 
to 
ratify 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty. 
93. 
Ms. 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria) 
said 
the 
Agency 
played 
a 
leading 
role 
in 
disseminating 
scientific 
knowledge 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
responsible 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
national 
development 
efforts. 
Algeria 
welcomed 
the 
Agency 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
ends 
and 
prevent 
its 
diversion 
for 
military 
purposes, 
which 
contributed 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
key 
objectives 
of 
disarmament, 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
94. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
of 
the 
2007 
General 
Conference 
on 
the 
development 
of 
atomic 
energy 
in 
the 
next 
25 
years 
would 
no 
doubt 
be 
a 
source 
of 
inspiration 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
95. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
the 
area 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
were 
praiseworthy. 
With 
over 
780 
projects 
in 
115 
Member 
States 
in 
2007, 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
come 
a 
long 
way 
since 
its 
modest 
beginnings 
in 
1957. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
contributed 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
civil 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
While 
the 
efforts 
of 
donor 
countries 
were 
commendable, 
greater 
financial 
resources 
were 
necessary 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
growing 
needs 
of 
Member 
States, 
especially 
developing 
countries. 
96. 
Much 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
AlgeriaÂs 
national 
cooperation 
programme 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
was 
being 
implemented 
in 
line 
with 
its 
CPF 
and 
the 
priorities 
identified 
in 
the 
2005Â2009 
national 
plan 
for 
economic 
recovery 
and 
preservation 
of 
natural 
resources, 
with 
80% 
of 
targets 
fulfilled 
in 
2006. 
Those 
positive 
results 
illustrated 
AlgeriaÂs 
commitment 
when 
it 
came 
to 
implementing 
projects 
and 
to 
paying 
its 
NPCs. 
Delays 
in 
the 
release 
of 
funds 
by 
the 
UNDP, 
however, 
had 
hampered 
the 
timely 
launch 
of 
certain 
projects. 
Algeria 
intended 
to 
make 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
2008 
and 
further 
enhance 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
period 
2009 
to 
2011. 
97. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
human 
health, 
Algeria 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
support 
anti-cancer 
efforts 
and 
the 
use 
of 
positron 
emission 
tomography. 
It 
that 
context, 
it 
was 
worth 
recalling 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
formally 
recognized 
AlgeriaÂs 
secondary 
dosimetry 
calibration 
laboratory 
as 
the 
regional 
centre 
for 
French-speaking 
Africa 
in 
July 
2006. 
Also, 
Algeria 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
PACT 
and 
had 
decided 
to 
earmark 
its 
2005 
surplus 
for 
relevant 
activities. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
coordination 
of 
the 
work 
of 
PACT, 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
WHO, 
which 
had 
facilitated 
the 
mobilization 
of 
greater 
financial 
resources. 
Algeria 
remained 
prepared 
to 
host 
a 
PACT 
regional 
centre 
for 
Africa.

Isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
were 
useful 
in 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
and 
access 
to 
drinking 
water, 
which 
were 
a 
strategic 
priority 
at 
the 
national 
and 
regional 
levels. 
Algeria 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
relevant 
objectives 
identified 
under 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
and 
by 
NEPAD, 
and 
had 
attended 
the 
Fourth 
World 
Water 
Forum 
and 
the 
Ministerial 
Conference 
in 
Mexico. 
Although 
the 
AgencyÂs 
publication 
of 
the 
Atlas 
of 
Isotope 
Hydrology 
for 
Africa 
was 
commendable, 
more 
should 
be 
done 
to 
strengthen 
the 
efforts 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
build 
national 
competencies 
in 
that 
crucial 
area. 
99. 
Algeria 
was 
also 
involved 
in 
the 
African 
UnionÂs 
PATTEC 
to 
eradicate 
the 
tsetse 
and 
trypanosomosis, 
which 
was 
being 
carried 
out 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
She 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
launching 
a 
pilot 
project 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
control 
desert 
locusts, 
following 
recommendations 
made 
at 
the 
regional 
conference 
on 
that 
pest 
held 
in 
Algiers 
in 
July 
2006. 
In 
that 
context, 
Algeria 
shared 
the 
concerns 
of 
the 
Group 
of 
77 
and 
China 
regarding 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
funds 
from 
FAO/IAEA 
joint 
projects, 
recommended 
in 
an 
independent 
external 
report 
on 
FAO 
activities. 
Such 
a 
step 
would 
not 
only 
undermine 
efforts 
to 
coordinate 
the 
implementation 
of 
projects 
between 
different 
United 
Nations 
agencies, 
but 
also 
hamper 
R&D 
efforts 
in 
developing 
countries. 
100. 
Member 
States 
should 
support 
measures 
aimed 
at 
the 
conservation 
of 
natural 
resources 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
Of 
particular 
relevance 
were 
national 
programmes 
for 
radiological 
monitoring 
of 
the 
marine 
environment 
and 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
analysis 
and 
radiotracers 
to 
identify 
pollutants. 
101. 
Algeria 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
regard 
to 
its 
energy 
development 
programme 
and 
had 
requested 
further 
support 
for 
developing 
nuclear 
electricity 
generation 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
its 
energy 
needs 
and 
provide 
an 
alternative 
to 
fossil 
energy 
sources. 
102. 
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
new 
Programme 
Cycle 
Management 
Framework 
had 
been 
very 
beneficial 
for 
Africa. 
The 
rate 
of 
implementation 
of 
regional 
programmes 
in 
2006 
had 
stood 
at 
77%, 
which 
illustrated 
the 
interest 
of 
African 
States 
and 
recipient 
institutions 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
103. 
Algeria 
continued 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
attainment 
of 
objectives 
under 
AFRA. 
Agency 
support 
was 
necessary 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
regional 
human 
resource 
capacity-building 
programme, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
promotion 
of 
young 
persons 
and 
women 
in 
science 
and 
technology. 
104. 
The 
High-level 
African 
Regional 
Conference 
on 
the 
Contribution 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy 
to 
Peace 
and 
Sustainable 
Development, 
organized 
by 
Algeria 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
9 
and 
10 
January 
2007, 
had 
adopted 
an 
action 
plan 
that 
had 
subsequently 
been 
endorsed 
by 
the 
African 
Union 
Summit 
of 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government. 
Implementation 
of 
that 
plan 
required 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
it 
was 
important 
to 
form 
strategic 
partnerships 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
regional 
cooperation 
programmes. 
105. 
In 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
regional 
project 
on 
sustainable 
energy 
development 
in 
Africa, 
the 
Secretariat 
should 
pursue 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
use 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
energy 
planning 
models 
and 
establish 
a 
framework 
for 
cooperation 
with 
the 
African 
Energy 
Commission 
(AFREC), 
whose 
headquarters 
were 
in 
Algiers. 
106. 
Algeria 
shared 
other 
StatesÂ 
concerns 
about 
terrorist 
threats. 
It 
firmly 
supported 
all 
instruments 
aimed 
at 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
implement 
its 
nuclear 
security 
plan. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
do 
more 
in 
that 
regard, 
inter 
alia 
by 
working 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Although 
the 
main 
responsibility 
for 
safety 
and 
security 
fell 
to 
States, 
pertinent 
international 
instruments, 
including 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Illicit 
Trafficking 
Database, 
which 
facilitated

information 
exchange 
between 
Member 
States, 
could 
help 
strengthen 
national 
and 
international 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard. 


107. 
Algeria 
had 
ratified 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
Its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
area 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
included 
the 
organization 
of 
a 
relevant 
national 
seminar 
in 
Algiers 
in 
February 
2006, 
followed 
by 
a 
RaSSIA 
mission 
and 
a 
mission 
to 
evaluate 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
108. 
The 
Agency 
must 
work 
towards 
finding 
a 
satisfactory 
solution 
to 
problems 
in 
the 
supply 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
for 
use 
in 
industry 
or 
medicine, 
striking 
a 
balance 
between 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
national 
development 
projects. 
109. 
Algeria 
trusted 
that 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
would 
continue 
to 
fulfil 
the 
AgencyÂs 
unique 
verification 
mission 
with 
integrity, 
impartiality 
and 
professionalism. 
Algeria 
had 
had 
the 
privilege 
to 
preside 
over 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
and 
had 
welcomed 
substantive 
discussions 
on 
the 
measures 
proposed 
by 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
For 
its 
part, 
Algeria 
was 
about 
to 
sign 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement. 
110. 
Training 
to 
improve 
SSACs 
and 
RSACs 
was 
essential. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Algeria 
supported 
the 
South 
African 
initiative 
to 
establish 
a 
Regional 
Regulatory 
Forum, 
for 
which 
Agency 
assistance 
had 
been 
requested. 
111. 
Algeria, 
which 
firmly 
opposed 
the 
militarization 
of 
outer 
space, 
was 
following 
with 
interest 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Commission 
on 
Safety 
Standards, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Scientific 
and 
Technical 
Subcommittee 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Committee 
on 
the 
Peaceful 
Uses 
of 
Outer 
Space. 
112. 
Algeria 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
NPT 
as 
a 
means 
to 
facilitate 
rapid 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
were 
intrinsically 
linked. 
The 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
a 
special 
responsibility, 
pursuant 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
to 
work 
resolutely 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
2007 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
shown 
worrying 
trends 
in 
that 
area, 
including 
the 
renaissance 
of 
the 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
arsenals 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
and 
the 
development 
of 
new 
hybrid 
nuclear 
weapons 
that 
did 
not 
require 
testing. 
She 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
intensify 
its 
efforts 
to 
rid 
the 
planet 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
commitments 
undertaken 
at 
the 
2000 
and 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences.

Algeria, 
as 
a 
co-sponsor 
of 
the 
Ministerial 
Conference 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
Article 
XIV 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
urged 
the 
ten 
States 
whose 
ratification 
was 
necessary 
for 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
that 
Treaty 
to 
speed 
up 
that 
process. 
114. 
The 
resumption 
by 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
of 
a 
substantive 
debate 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
the 
negotiation 
of 
a 
treaty 
prohibiting 
the 
production 
of 
fissile 
materials, 
a 
stop 
to 
the 
arms 
race 
in 
space, 
and 
security 
guarantees 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance. 
The 
declaration 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
non-proliferation 
joint 
actions 
issued 
by 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
Russia 
on 
3 
July 
2007 
should 
be 
implemented 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
an 
effective 
and 
verifiable 
reduction 
in 
strategic 
offence 
weapons. 
115. 
Algeria 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
on 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
paid 
tribute 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
that 
had 
facilitated 
that 
successful 
outcome. 
Algeria 
endorsed 
the 
process 
launched 
by 
the 
agreement, 
which 
had 
already 
led 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
activities, 
opened 
doors 
for 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations 
with 
the 
DPRK 
and 
a 
climate 
of 
peace 
and 
security 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula.

116. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
Iran 
nuclear 
issue, 
Algeria 
was 
of 
the 
view 
that 
all 
problems 
relating 
to 
peace 
and 
international 
security 
must 
be 
resolved 
through 
dialogue 
and 
cooperation. 
It 
therefore 
supported 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
that 
had 
culminated 
in 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
work 
plan 
to 
resolve 
outstanding 
questions 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
activities. 
She 
urged 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
maintain 
dialogue 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
a 
peaceful 
and 
lasting 
solution. 
117. 
Her 
delegation 
deplored 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
owing 
to 
the 
refusal 
by 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
submit 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
by 
Israel, 
as 
acknowledged 
by 
the 
Prime 
Minister 
himself, 
undermined 
the 
climate 
of 
trust 
created 
by 
the 
other 
States 
in 
the 
region 
by 
their 
joining 
the 
NPT, 
concluding 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
submitting 
their 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Furthermore, 
Israel 
was 
disregarding 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
international 
community 
by 
ignoring 
the 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
As 
a 
non-nuclear-weapon 
State 
and 
a 
signatory 
to 
all 
instruments 
pertaining 
to 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
including 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty, 
Algeria 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
continue 
his 
efforts 
to 
facilitate 
dialogue 
between 
States 
in 
the 
region 
on 
that 
strategic 
issue, 
which 
had 
repercussions 
for 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
region 
and 
the 
entire 
world. 
118. 
Given 
the 
renewed 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
energy 
worldwide 
and 
increased 
Agency 
membership, 
Algeria 
hoped 
that 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
which 
had 
been 
adopted 
following 
painstaking 
negotiations, 
would 
enter 
into 
force 
without 
undue 
delay. 
She 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
to 
ensure 
that 
membership 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
main 
governing 
body 
was 
a 
faithful 
reflection 
of 
the 
number 
and 
diversity 
of 
its 
Member 
States. 
119. 
Mr. 
KIRIENKO 
(Russian 
Federation) 
began 
his 
statement 
by 
reading 
out 
an 
address 
from 
President 
Putin: 
ÂI 
send 
my 
greetings 
to 
the 
participants 
at 
the 
51st 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency, 
and 
my 
congratulations 
on 
the 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
founding 
of 
the 
organization. 


ÂAll 
these 
years, 
the 
IAEA 
has 
been 
actively 
promoting 
the 
development 
of 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace, 
and 
monitoring 
compliance 
with 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
non-proliferation 
regime. 


ÂToday, 
the 
potential 
and 
unique 
capabilities 
of 
the 
IAEA 
are 
in 
ever 
greater 
demand. 
Thus, 
Russia 
is 
in 
favour 
of 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
role 
and 
authority 
of 
the 
Agency. 


ÂOne 
example 
of 
our 
successful 
cooperation 
is 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
IAEAÂs 
International 
Project 
on 
Innovative 
Nuclear 
Reactors 
and 
Fuel 
Cycles, 
pursuant 
to 
a 
Russian 
initiative. 


ÂRussia 
is 
also 
in 
favour 
of 
intensifying 
practical 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
global 
infrastructure 
capable 
of 
ensuring 
equal 
access 
by 
all 
interested 
parties 
to 
nuclear 
energy, 
as 
well 
as 
reliable 
compliance 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
A 
key 
element 
of 
this 
infrastructure 
would 
be 
international 
centres 
providing 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services, 
including 
enrichment, 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
IAEA. 
The 
first 
such 
centre 
has 
already 
been 
established 
in 
Russia.

ÂI 
am 
convinced 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
will 
continue 
in 
the 
future 
to 
promote 
effectively 
progress 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
dynamic 
development 
of 
advanced 
technologies, 
and 
strengthening 
of 
international 
stability 
and 
security. 


ÂI 
hope 
that 
your 
work 
is 
successful 
and 
fruitful.Â 


120. 
A 
reliable 
energy 
supply 
was 
essential 
for 
political 
stability 
and 
sustainable 
economic 
development. 
Over 
the 
next 
25 
to 
30 
years, 
the 
demand 
for 
energy 
would 
increase. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
fossil 
fuels 
would 
be 
gradually 
diminishing 
and 
concerns 
about 
the 
impact 
of 
energy 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
climate 
change 
would 
be 
growing. 
RussiaÂs 
decision 
to 
use 
nuclear 
power 
had 
not 
been 
simply 
a 
political 
one 
but 
was 
based 
on 
an 
appropriate 
legislative, 
financial 
and 
organizational 
infrastructure. 
121. 
There 
was 
a 
direct 
link 
between 
large-scale 
global 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
access 
by 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
to 
nuclear 
technologies, 
materials 
and 
equipment. 
That 
in 
turn 
raised 
questions 
about 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
and 
ecological 
safety, 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
materials, 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
risk 
reduction. 
States 
with 
a 
developed 
nuclear 
industry 
should 
therefore 
assist 
other 
States 
interested 
in 
developing 
nuclear 
power. 
122. 
On 
3 
July 
2007, 
the 
Presidents 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
had 
issued 
a 
declaration 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
non-proliferation 
joint 
actions, 
which 
reflected 
common 
approaches 
to 
a 
new 
format 
for 
cooperation 
to 
expand 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
implement 
existing 
initiatives 
in 
the 
field 
of 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
123. 
With 
the 
new 
challenges 
and 
threats 
facing 
the 
international 
community, 
the 
NPT 
was 
acquiring 
ever-greater 
significance, 
as 
was 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency. 
In 
January 
2006, 
the 
Russian 
President 
had 
put 
forward 
an 
initiative 
concerning 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
global 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure 
to 
ensure 
equal 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
all 
interested 
parties 
provided 
that 
they 
met 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
That 
initiative 
offered 
a 
real 
possibility 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
rapid 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
world 
while 
recognizing 
the 
need 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
highly 
sensitive 
technologies. 
RussiaÂs 
approach, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
for 
its 
national 
nuclear 
power 
development 
programme, 
was 
practical 
and 
carefully 
thought 
out. 
124. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
that 
uranium 
enrichment 
was 
a 
fundamental 
part 
of 
the 
process 
to 
manufacture 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
power 
plants 
and 
the 
most 
sensitive 
part 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
from 
the 
proliferation 
point 
of 
view, 
the 
first 
International 
Uranium 
Enrichment 
Centre 
had 
been 
established 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Angarsk 
in 
the 
Russian 
Federation. 
In 
accordance 
with 
an 
intergovernmental 
agreement 
signed 
on 
10 
May 
2007, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan 
were 
the 
founders 
of 
that 
Centre. 
It 
offered 
States 
an 
assured 
supply 
of 
enriched 
uranium 
enabling 
them 
meet 
their 
nuclear 
fuel 
needs 
without 
having 
to 
establish 
their 
own 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycles. 
It 
had 
been 
set 
up 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
open 
joint 
stock 
company 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
market 
conditions 
and 
to 
enable 
participating 
organizations 
to 
receive 
a 
share 
of 
the 
income 
and 
dividends 
from 
the 
Centre. 
It 
was 
open 
to 
organizations 
from 
third 
parties 
without 
any 
political 
conditions, 
and 
had 
been 
entered 
into 
the 
list 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities 
to 
which 
Agency 
safeguards 
could 
be 
applied. 
125. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear 
material 
bank 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
was 
prepared 
to 
offer 
a 
guaranteed 
supply 
of 
enriched 
uranium, 
to 
be 
managed 
by 
the 
Agency, 
sufficient 
for 
two 
loads 
for 
a 
1000 
MW 
reactor. 
The 
material 
could 
be 
supplied 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
event 
that 
a 
State 
that 
was 
developing 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
meeting 
its 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
was 
refused 
uranium 
for 
political 
reasons. 
His 
delegation 
hoped 
that 
the 
Russian 
offer 
of 
a 
guaranteed 
supply 
at 
the 
International 
Uranium 
Enrichment 
Centre, 
acting 
as 
a 
branch 
of 
the 
Agency 
bank, 
would 
be 
conducive 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
mechanism 
and 
help 
create 
a 
global 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
future.

126. 
Recently, 
16 
countries 
had 
signed 
a 
statement 
of 
principles 
concerning 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership, 
laying 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
new 
multilateral 
cooperation 
mechanism 
for 
expanding 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
All 
countries 
intending 
to 
use 
or 
develop 
nuclear 
power 
should 
be 
given 
a 
free 
choice 
of 
strategies 
in 
the 
area 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
to 
enable 
them 
to 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
energy, 
while 
reducing 
the 
proliferation 
risk. 
127. 
Russia 
attached 
great 
significance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
increasing 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
was 
the 
most 
effective 
tool 
in 
that 
regard. 
On 
14 
September, 
the 
State 
Duma 
had 
ratified 
the 
protocol 
additional 
to 
the 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
the 
USSR 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Russia 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
an 
additional 
protocol 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
pledged 
its 
continued 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
128. 
Russia 
was 
completing 
the 
work 
on 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
its 
industrial 
uranium 
and 
graphite 
reactors. 
It 
had 
already 
completed 
the 
dilution 
and 
conversion 
of 
weapons-grade 
uranium 
enriched 
to 
more 
than 
90% 
235U 
and 
more 
than 
313 
tonnes 
had 
been 
used 
as 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
By 
2013, 
more 
than 
500 
tonnes 
of 
highly 
enriched 
weapons-grade 
uranium 
would 
have 
been 
destroyed. 
129. 
The 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
had 
been 
joined 
by 
more 
than 
60 
countries 
to 
date. 
It 
sought 
to 
mobilize 
the 
efforts 
of 
States 
to 
meet 
their 
commitments 
under 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
CPPNM. 
130. 
Russia 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
assist 
States 
in 
developing 
and 
strengthening 
national 
systems 
for 
regulating 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
He 
drew 
particular 
attention 
in 
that 
regard 
to 
the 
meeting 
organized 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
promote 
an 
exchange 
of 
information 
on 
the 
implementation 
by 
States 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
131. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
support 
for 
INPRO, 
including 
financial 
assistance. 
It 
supported 
the 
implementation, 
during 
phase-II, 
of 
joint 
research 
in 
areas 
including 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactor 
and 
fuel 
cycle 
systems 
and 
their 
role 
in 
national, 
regional 
and 
global 
scenarios 
for 
the 
further 
development 
and 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
Russia 
suggested 
starting 
research 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
infrastructure, 
legal, 
institutional 
and 
other 
aspects 
of 
new 
forms 
of 
nuclear 
power 
development, 
the 
supply 
of 
fuel 
on 
condition 
of 
its 
return 
after 
use, 
and 
others. 
132. 
At 
the 
2007 
G8 
Summit 
in 
Heiligendamm, 
it 
had 
been 
noted 
that 
innovation 
was 
one 
of 
the 
crucial 
drivers 
of 
economic 
growth 
in 
countries. 
It 
was 
therefore 
agreed 
to 
take 
action 
to 
promote 
innovation 
as 
well 
as 
R&D. 
The 
INPRO 
project 
and 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum 
had 
become 
major 
initiatives 
to 
address 
issues 
associated 
with 
large-scale 
nuclear 
power 
development 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
international 
cooperation. 
In 
July 
2006, 
Russia 
had 
decided 
to 
become 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Forum, 
and 
the 
necessary 
procedures 
would 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2007. 
133. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
ensuring 
energy 
security 
at 
the 
global 
and 
national 
levels 
and 
in 
enabling 
all 
countries 
to 
harness 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
not 
be 
overemphasized. 
Russia 
wished 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
further 
success 
in 
their 
activities 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
134. 
Mr. 
LUKMAN 
(Nigeria), 
welcoming 
the 
AgencyÂs 
new 
Member 
States, 
encouraged 
more 
States 
to 
follow 
suit 
since 
enlarging 
the 
AgencyÂs 
membership 
would 
foster 
international 
cooperation 
in 
developing 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
in 
maintaining 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
in 
promoting 
nuclear 
non-proliferation.

Congratulating 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
50th 
anniversary, 
he 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
its 
work 
under 
the 
able 
leadership 
of 
the 
Director 
General. 
Over 
the 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
proved 
beyond 
doubt 
its 
ability 
to 
fulfil 
its 
tripartite 
mandate, 
including 
its 
commitment 
to 
enhancing 
cooperation 
among 
nations 
for 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
Nigeria 
remained 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
Agency 
in 
achieving 
its 
objectives. 
136. 
One 
of 
the 
Nigerian 
PresidentÂs 
highest 
priorities 
was 
ensuring 
an 
adequate 
energy 
supply 
to 
drive 
his 
countryÂs 
national 
development 
process. 
Nigeria 
was 
endowed 
with 
energy 
resources 
which, 
if 
properly 
and 
adequately 
harnessed, 
would 
galvanize 
the 
process 
of 
rapid 
industrial 
and 
socio-economic 
growth. 
He 
expressed 
gratitude 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
invaluable 
role 
in 
focusing 
NigeriaÂs 
national 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
assisting 
in 
fine-tuning 
the 
countryÂs 
national 
energy 
policy 
and 
renewable 
energy 
master 
plan 
in 
order 
to 
develop 
a 
proactive, 
holistic 
and 
sustainable 
solution. 
137. 
As 
part 
of 
initial 
efforts 
to 
solve 
its 
energy 
problem, 
Nigeria 
had 
taken 
measures 
to 
diversify 
and 
strengthen 
its 
national 
energy 
generation 
base 
to 
include 
nuclear 
electricity, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
partnership 
and 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
in 
achieving 
its 
objective. 
A 
technical 
framework 
and 
detailed 
implementation 
strategy 
had 
been 
produced, 
with 
the 
agreement 
of 
the 
Agency, 
for 
the 
deployment 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
Nigeria 
by 
the 
year 
2017. 
138. 
Nigeria 
was 
working 
hard 
to 
develop 
a 
culture 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
nuclear 
security 
in 
all 
areas. 
It 
had 
endorsed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
associated 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
in 
2006 
had 
promulgated 
domestic 
regulations 
on 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
the 
transportation 
of 
such 
sources. 
The 
Nigerian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
(NNRA) 
continued 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
improve 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
safety, 
security 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
and 
radiation 
protection 
measures. 
139. 
Greater 
use 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
the 
oil 
industry 
in 
Nigeria, 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
facilities 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
the 
need 
to 
manage 
waste 
generated 
by 
the 
small 
research 
reactor 
had 
necessitated 
the 
development 
and 
operation 
of 
appropriate 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facilities. 
140. 
The 
NNRA, 
working 
in 
tandem 
with 
the 
Agency, 
had 
developed 
a 
national 
regulatory 
framework 
which 
would 
establish 
and 
enforce 
safe 
and 
secure 
practices 
in 
its 
fledgling 
national 
nuclear 
industry. 
Plans 
and 
procedures 
for 
responding 
to 
any 
nuclear 
or 
radiological 
emergency 
were 
being 
prepared 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
standards 
and 
requirements, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
integration 
of 
the 
national 
nuclear 
radiological 
emergency 
response 
plan 
into 
national 
emergency 
management 
procedures. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
waste 
management, 
Nigeria 
had 
promulgated 
both 
a 
national 
policy 
on 
radioactive 
wastes 
and 
regulations 
on 
waste 
management. 
141. 
As 
proof 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
Nigeria 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
all 
the 
relevant 
treaties, 
including 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
Furthermore, 
it 
intended 
to 
increase 
its 
support 
for 
activities 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
by 
contributing 
financially 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
142. 
He 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
Agency 
assistance 
to 
his 
country 
under 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
energy 
planning, 
human 
health, 
food 
security, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
143. 
To 
ensure 
a 
solid 
foundation 
for 
its 
national 
nuclear 
electricity 
programme, 
the 
Nigeria 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
(NAEC) 
had 
been 
established 
in 
2006 
with 
a 
mandate 
to 
provide 
an 
institutional 
framework 
and 
technical 
capability 
to 
explore, 
exploit 
and 
harness 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful

applications. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Nigeria 
had 
already 
developed 
a 
significant 
capacity 
for 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
develop 
sustainable 
programmes 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
human 
resource 
development, 
support 
for 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management. 


144. 
Nigeria 
also 
looked 
forward 
to 
cooperation 
in 
building 
regional 
and 
subregional 
capacities 
to 
enhance 
regional 
integration 
in 
the 
development 
and 
use 
of 
facilities. 
The 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility 
at 
the 
Sheda 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Complex 
(SHETSCO), 
Abuja, 
was 
one 
such 
facility. 
It 
was 
a 
semi-commercial 
irradiator 
which 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
regional 
training 
centre 
for 
food 
irradiation 
and 
agricultural 
applications, 
including 
the 
SIT. 
145. 
The 
recent 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
advancement 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
had 
proven 
that 
multilateral 
diplomacy 
was 
indispensable 
in 
maintaining 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
an 
increasingly 
volatile 
and 
unpredictable 
world. 
He 
hoped 
that 
other 
regions 
of 
the 
globe 
with 
comparable 
situations 
could 
profit 
from 
the 
example 
set 
and 
move 
towards 
constructive 
regional 
cooperation. 
146. 
Mr. 
MARCUZZO 
DO 
CANTO 
(ABACC) 
said 
that 
Brazil 
and 
Argentina 
had 
developed 
a 
common 
understanding 
in 
nuclear 
matters 
through 
a 
long 
process 
of 
economic, 
political, 
technological 
and 
cultural 
integration, 
which 
was 
characterized 
by 
consensus. 
A 
number 
of 
bilateral 
mechanisms 
had 
been 
established, 
including 
the 
1991 
Agreement 
for 
the 
Exclusively 
Peaceful 
Use 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy, 
which 
contained 
a 
clear 
commitment 
to 
use 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
facilities 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
His 
own 
organization 
had 
been 
set 
up 
to 
administer 
the 
Common 
System 
for 
Accounting 
and 
Control 
of 
Nuclear 
Materials 
(SCCC). 
Under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement, 
also 
dating 
from 
1991, 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil 
accepted 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
material 
under 
their 
jurisdiction 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
such 
materials 
were 
not 
diverted 
for 
military 
purposes. 
The 
joint 
work 
by 
ABACC 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
created 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
mutual 
confidence 
and 
produced 
excellent 
results. 
147. 
No 
country 
should 
be 
excluded 
from 
the 
benefits 
of 
economic 
development. 
With 
greater 
awareness 
of 
the 
potential 
environmental 
impact 
of 
the 
associated 
increase 
in 
energy 
requirements, 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
set 
to 
play 
a 
leading 
role. 
A 
number 
of 
countries 
were 
turning 
to 
it 
as 
a 
reliable 
source 
of 
energy 
which 
did 
not 
contribute 
to 
the 
greenhouse 
effect. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
there 
was 
concern 
about 
the 
possibility 
of 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
for 
military 
purposes. 
Those 
that 
had 
access 
to 
the 
necessary 
scientific 
and 
technological 
expertise 
bore 
a 
major 
responsibility 
for 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
was 
both 
economically 
feasible 
and 
safe. 
The 
best 
way 
to 
guarantee 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was 
to 
promote 
understanding 
and 
cooperation 
among 
nations 
by 
means 
of 
mechanisms 
such 
as 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement. 
148. 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil 
had 
decided 
to 
reactivate 
their 
respective 
nuclear 
programmes. 
The 
Argentine 
Government 
was 
to 
invest 
some 
$3.5 
billion 
in 
its 
nuclear 
programme, 
while 
the 
Brazilian 
Minister 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology 
had 
recently 
declared 
that 
solar 
and 
wind 
energy 
were 
not 
feasible 
in 
Brazil 
on 
a 
large 
scale. 
ABACC 
would, 
therefore, 
have 
an 
even 
more 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
inspection, 
accounting 
and 
control 
for 
years 
to 
come. 
149. 
In 
2006, 
ABACC 
had 
been 
able 
to 
guarantee 
that 
all 
nuclear 
material 
and 
other 
safeguarded 
elements 
in 
both 
Argentina 
and 
Brazil 
were 
properly 
accounted 
for 
and 
used 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
That 
achievement 
had 
been 
made 
possible 
by 
the 
officials, 
technicians, 
inspectors, 
consultants 
and 
laboratories 
working 
under 
the 
organizationÂs 
senior 
supervisory 
body, 
the 
ABACC 
Commission. 
A 
policy 
had 
been 
developed 
to 
improve 
the 
qualifications 
of 
its 
officials 
and 
inspectors 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-destructive 
analysis, 
containment 
and 
surveillance, 
training 
and 
safeguards, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy 
and 
Euratom. 
ABACC 
took 

GC(51)/OR.3

21 


pains 
to 
ensure 
that 
existing 
managerial 
and 
operational 
staff 
transferred 
their 
knowledge, 
experience 
and 
skills 
to 
their 
successors. 


150. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
increasing 
safeguards 
efficiency, 
work 
was 
being 
done 
under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement 
to 
evaluate 
new 
safeguards 
technologies, 
such 
as 
surveillance 
devices 
and 
state-of-health 
transmission 
systems, 
as 
well 
as 
innovative 
safeguards 
approaches. 
A 
new 
UF6 
sampling 
method, 
the 
ABACC-Cristallini 
method, 
had 
been 
developed 
with 
promising 
results. 
It 
could 
lead 
to 
a 
reduction 
in 
sampling 
costs 
and 
in 
the 
number 
of 
rejections. 
151. 
He 
reaffirmed 
ABACCÂs 
commitment 
to 
improving 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
safeguards 
in 
Brazil 
and 
Argentina. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
share 
information 
as 
required 
under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement 
while 
preserving 
the 
necessary 
confidentiality.

1. Mr. HIMEDE (Mozambique) said that his country had only recently joined the Agency but was 
fully committed to its objectives as set out in its Statute. 
2. Mozambique supported the continuous review and strengthening of measures aimed at 
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including those under the safeguards 
system. Progress could only be made in securing the world against the threat of nuclear weapons if all 
Governments demonstrated genuine political will. It was therefore of vital importance that all States 
comply fully with their legal obligations in the area of non-proliferation and disarmament. 
3. The universalization of the safeguards system, including the additional protocol, was crucial to 
the success of the AgencyÂs verification activities and for global security. The implementation of 
integrated safeguards based on comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols would 
significantly enhance the efficiency of verification measures. In that connection, Mozambique had 
decided to conclude a safeguards agreement, a small quantities protocol and an additional protocol 
based on the model approved by the Board of Governors in 1997. They would enter into force as soon 
as all constitutional requirements were met. 
4. Great advances in the use of nuclear science and technology in such areas as agriculture, animal 
and human health and the environment had enhanced the role of nuclear science and technology in 
tackling major development challenges. Technical cooperation played an important role in increasing 
and disseminating the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the developing world. By 
assisting developing countries with the introduction of nuclear applications, the Agency was helping 
improve the living conditions of millions of people around the world. 
5. He called on all States, developing and developed alike, to step up their engagement in technical 
cooperation activities and commended those countries that made contributions to the TCF. 
Mozambique would soon pay its share of the TCF for 2006Â2007 and was committed to paying its 
2008 share. 
6. The Agency had a growing role to play as an international organization that assured the 
necessary balance between the use of nuclear energy for development needs and commitment to the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime. The fight against nuclear terrorism and illicit trafficking called for 
intensified international cooperation and Mozambique supported the AgencyÂs activities in that regard. 
Given the mounting challenges and threats to international peace and security, Member States should 
commit themselves to strengthening the AgencyÂs role. 
7. Mr. DAINIUS (Lithuania) said that nuclear non-proliferation and the pursuit of nuclear 
disarmament in accordance with the NPT were crucial to global peace and security. The continued 
vitality and integrity of the NPT depended on all countries working to resolve problems of regional 
instability and insecurity. His country greatly valued the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent the spread of 
nuclear weapons and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Lithuania continued to support the 
current NPT review process and felt it was vital that the 2010 NPT Review Conference produce 
substantive results. However, progress could only be made if all three pillars of the NPT were 
addressed equally.

8. The AgencyÂs safeguards system formed the core of the international non-proliferation regime. 
He called on those States which had not done so to reaffirm their commitment to the NPT regime and 
to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols with the Agency, since 
those two instruments were vital for further strengthening and increasing the credibility of the 
safeguards system and constituted the current global verification standard. Lithuania had begun to 
apply integrated safeguards in June 2007 and had completed the internal process of transition from its 
bilateral safeguards agreement to the trilateral agreement between Lithuania, Euratom and the Agency. 
9. In recent years, serious cases of non-compliance with NPT obligations had arisen which had 
caused great concern within the international community and had put the global nuclear nonproliferation 
regime at risk. 
10. It was regrettable that Iran had disregarded the obligation to suspend all enrichment-related 
activities, including research and development, despite numerous calls by the United Nations Security 
Council and the Agency. His country joined the international community in calling on Iran to comply 
with Security Council resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007), and stressed the 
importance of Iran implementing fully the provisions of its comprehensive safeguards agreement and 
the additional protocol, pending its ratification, and of its providing all information requested by the 
Agency. 
11. Equally, with respect to the DPRK, while his country welcomed the progress made through the 
six-party talks, and the fact that the Agency had been able to verify the shutdown of the Yongbyon 
nuclear facility, much remained to be done to establish a safe security environment on the Korean 
Peninsula. He expressed grave concern at the DPRKÂs self-declared possession of nuclear weapons 
and the related testing and called on the DPRK to comply fully with Security Council resolution 
1718 (2006) and to abandon promptly and dismantle completely its nuclear weapons programme in a 
verifiable and irreversible manner. In addition, it was important for the DPRK to reconfirm its full 
commitment to the NPT. 
12. The non-proliferation regime could not be separated from the broader issue of disarmament. The 
Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was 
being held concurrently with the current session of the General Conference and the challenges facing 
that Treaty needed to be borne in mind. Lithuania welcomed the growing number of countries that had 
signed and ratified the CTBT and urged States, and particularly Annex 2 States, to sign and ratify it 
without delay and without conditions. It also welcomed the revitalizing developments with respect to a 
fissile material cut-off treaty. Negotiations on a new multilateral instrument banning the production of 
fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices should be the next step in 
global efforts to promote both non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament. Lithuania was strongly 
committed to the requirements of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) which, together with export 
control regimes, provided States with possibilities for concerted action, cooperation and assistance in 
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
13. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of irresponsible regimes, and the possibility of 
terrorists gaining access to such weapons, posed a major challenge to the global security environment. 
His country was determined to act in concert with other countries in combating the growing risk of 
nuclear terrorism through such mechanisms as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, 
which his country had joined in May 2007, and the Proliferation Security Initiative, which provided a 
systematic approach for improved tangible international cooperation. Lithuania had hosted the first 
regional exercise under the latter Initiative in April 2007. 
14. During 2006, Lithuania had made steady progress with its preparatory work for ratifying the 
amendments to the CPPNM. The legislation governing physical protection had been reviewed and 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18

3 


updating priorities had been identified, and provisions had been added to the countryÂs nuclear energy 
law regarding the obligation to identify the design basis threat during transport of nuclear material. In 
October 2006, the national regulatory authority had organized a workshop in cooperation with the 
Agency to improve the countryÂs physical protection system and enhance the skills of experts in 
Lithuanian institutions who were involved in physical protection. 

15. Nuclear energy continued to play a significant role in LithuaniaÂs economy, accounting for 
approximately 70% of electricity generated. In view of the forthcoming closure of the remaining Unit 
2 of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, which was planned for the end of 2009, the issue of energy 
production and security of supply was being addressed with the utmost concern in Lithuania and the 
whole Baltic region. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided with the preparation of 
an energy study analysing energy supply options and security of energy supply in the Baltic States. 
16. After the closure of the Ignalina plant, the share of gas in the countryÂs energy mix would 
increase significantly. Since the region was dependent on a single, external gas supplier, closing the 
Ignalina plant would have a negative effect on energy security, as well as increasing CO2 
emissions, 
which was not in line with global efforts to address climate change. Nuclear energy was one of the 
most realistic and commercially feasible alternatives to traditional fossil fuels and developing it, along 
with renewables and other climate-friendly energy sources, could be of assistance in dealing with 
future challenges in the field of energy and climate change. 
17. A feasibility study carried out in 2006 on the construction of a new nuclear power plant in 
Lithuania had reached a positive conclusion and, in January 2007, the Lithuanian parliament had 
approved a national energy strategy which envisaged that course of action. In March 2007, Poland had 
joined the Baltic StatesÂ initiative to build a new nuclear power plant in Lithuania by signing a 
communiquÃ© on cooperation in the energy field. In line with its national energy strategy and the 
European UnionÂs energy policy strategy, the Lithuanian parliament had passed a law in June 
2007 establishing the legal basis for practical implementation of the project and the necessary 
conditions for constructive cooperation among four energy companies representing each participating 
country. The Agency had provided timely assistance by organizing a subregional meeting on 
challenges and opportunities related to the construction of a new nuclear power plant in the Baltic 
region, which had been hosted by Lithuania. 
18. Energy generation and reliable energy supply had become an integral part of the European 
political agenda. The best way to address energy security and ensure mutually beneficial cooperation 
among relevant actors was international cooperation and engagement based on the principles of 
mutual confidence and transparency. Lithuania, in cooperation with Poland, had organized a 
high-level energy summit in Vilnius, to be held in October 2007, which would cover issues relating to 
the European UnionÂs external energy policy, with particular attention to its Eastern dimension, and 
the search for new forms of cooperation among the main energy producers, consumers and transit 
countries. In addition to strengthening regional cooperation, a global vision on the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy should be sought. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership should be valuable in 
helping to meet growing energy demands worldwide using nuclear energy, while ensuring that such 
energy systems were used only for peaceful purposes. 
19. The decommissioning of the Ignalina nuclear power plant was currently one of the principal 
issues for his country. During 2006, the Agency had continued to provide assistance with the 
preparations for decommissioning of Unit 1, focusing on upgrading local capabilities and facilitating 
coordination with the projectÂs major international donor. A new project on management of 
radioactive waste arising from the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant had been launched in 
2007 to help ensure safe and effective waste management and increase the competence of the 
institutions involved. 

GC(51)/OR.4

20. In December 2006, the status of Unit 1 had been changed to final shutdown. In cooperation with 
international experts and the Agency, a programme for defuelling was under way and partially burned 
assemblies were being transported from Unit 1 to Unit 2, following authorization by the regulatory 
authority. Over 60% of the fuel assemblies had already been transferred. In early 2007, a mission had 
been undertaken by the AgencyÂs Review of Accident Management Programmes service to the State 
Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate to assist its review of the draft severe accident management 
guidelines and the related technical justification documentation, which were being prepared by the 
Ignalina plant. The AgencyÂs team had concluded that the documents provided a well developed and 
structured approach to mitigate core damage accidents. A number of important hardware changes had 
been implemented voluntarily at the plant to mitigate severe accidents more effectively. 
21. The radioactive waste management strategy covered the disposal of waste arising from the 
operation and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. Short-lived very low-level waste would be 
disposed of directly in a landfill-type repository, while short-lived low-and intermediate-level waste 
would be placed in a near-surface repository with reinforced concrete vaults. The tendering process for 
design of the repository for very low-level waste had been initiated. In the first half of 2007, the 
Lithuanian Radioactive Waste Management Agency had completed an environmental impact 
assessment for the near-surface repository for short-lived low-and intermediate-level waste and had 
finalized international consultations with Belarus and Latvia regarding transboundary impact. The 
assessment report had served as a basis for the decision of the Ministry of Environment to allow 
construction of the near-surface repository in the vicinity of the Ignalina plant. 
22. With Agency assistance, Lithuania was devoting significant resources to further enhancing and 
strengthening the regulatory infrastructure for control of radiation sources, exposure to ionizing 
radiation and radiation emergencies. It understood the importance of the Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the associated Guidance on the Import and Export of 
Radioactive Sources, the provisions of which had been transposed into national legislation and were 
being implemented. A system for controlling occupational, natural and medical exposure had been 
established and the results of its operation were apparent: doses among occupationally exposed 
workers and patients were decreasing and the population was becoming better informed about 
exposure. Recognizing the importance of participation in the Information System on Occupational 
Exposure for decreasing doses among workers in the nuclear sector, his country took an active part in 
the activities of the Regional European and Central Asian ALARA Network, which was a very 
effective tool for maintaining radiation protection levels already achieved. Increasing attention was 
being paid to quality systems of analytical laboratories, and his country appreciated the activities of 
the Analytical Laboratories for the Measurement of Environmental Radioactivity network. 
23. Proper funding of technical cooperation activities was of great importance to Lithuania, which 
had fulfilled its commitment to the TCF and would continue to do so. Lithuania had more than 
13 yearsÂ experience of beneficial cooperation with the Agency and was willing to continue its active 
participation in technical cooperation activities, gradually becoming a donor country, through such 
measures as hosting of regional workshops and seminars and provision of training. The number of 
foreign specialists trained was expected to rise from 30 in 2006 to 50 in 2007 and Lithuania remained 
dedicated to hosting future events in cooperation with the Agency. 
24. Mr. DIAZ Y PEREZ DUARTE (Mexico) said that the fiftieth anniversary of the Agency was 
marked by the convergence of a number of major issues which were also being addressed in other 
forums: climate change, alternative energy sources and security of energy supply, and the global 
strategy for non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. In the face of 
increasing energy demands and the challenge of reducing carbon dioxide levels, nuclear power was 
re-emerging as a viable alternative for ensuring sustainable development in many developing 
countries, and technological progress held out the promise of making its benefits accessible to all.

However, that brought with it an increased risk of indiscriminate access to and non-peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. The Agency would have to deal with those issues during the coming decades and, in 
doing so, it faced major challenges. 

25. Thus, events in the international arena over the preceding six years had tested the AgencyÂs 
capabilities, particularly in the area of international peace and security. The Director General had led 
the Agency with admirable professionalism during a time of great political turmoil. Strengthening the 
collective security system required decentralization of functions and recourse to specialized bodies. 
Therefore both the AgencyÂs inspection and monitoring capabilities, and its promotion of 
technological development and safeguards needed to be supported. Mexico welcomed the SecretariatÂs 
efforts to optimize the human and financial resources available for all programmes. That strategy 
should be complemented by establishing closer links between the Agency and other United Nations 
organizations. 
26. Another challenge was the increasing number of initiatives which could inadvertently lead to 
duplication of effort, or to the attention of the international community becoming unfocused. Such 
efforts should be coordinated by the appropriate institution. 
27. A third challenge was to ensure that objectives in each of the areas of climate change, energy 
supply and non-proliferation were not pursued at the expense of objectives in the other two areas. 
28. The Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference had met for the first time in 
Vienna in early May 2007. There had been a constructive general debate and interactive dialogue on 
disarmament and non-proliferation. He called on NPT State Parties to meet their commitment to 
achieving universal nuclear disarmament, and on the international community to work towards ending 
forever the culture of armament and the use of nuclear energy for military purposes. 
29. His Government welcomed the progress made in the context of the six-party talks on the DPRK 
nuclear issue, including the shutdown of the nuclear reactors in Yongbyon and the renewed 
cooperation with the Agency. That constituted an important step towards the denuclearization of the 
Korean Peninsula. Nevertheless some matters were still outstanding, such as the submission by the 
DPRK of its inventory of nuclear weapons. He expressed the hope that the forthcoming Inter-Korean 
Summit would yield positive results and encouraged the DPRK to participate in the AgencyÂs work 
again. 
30. Mexico also welcomed the work plan adopted following the extensive negotiations between the 
Director General and the Islamic Republic of Iran and urged Iran to continue cooperating 
unconditionally with the Agency and the international community to dispel doubts concerning the 
nature and scope of its nuclear programme. 
31. His Government was analysing the approaches proposed by the Director General and other 
Member States to assure fuel supplies and strengthen control in order to prevent diversion to illicit 
activities. That matter should be considered within the framework of the Board of Governors and 
General Conference, keeping in view the importance of safeguarding the inalienable right of all States 
to research, develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
32. He endorsed the AgencyÂs activities aimed at improving the safety of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, specifically its work on the safety and security of nuclear material and facilities. 
Mexico was preparing for a ConvEx-3 large-scale international nuclear emergency exercise in 2008 in 
cooperation with the Agency, with the aim of contributing to the planning and the analysis of the 
efficiency of such exercises. 
33. His country attached particular importance to the use of nuclear energy and applications to help 
solve various problems in such fundamental areas as power, human health, agriculture and food, as 

GC(51)/OR.4

well as environmental protection and industry. The technical cooperation programme was one of the 
main instruments for extending such benefits to developing countries in particular. Mexico promoted 
TCDC in Latin America and continued to support activities under ARCAL. It welcomed the AgencyÂs 
support for that programme, especially in connection with the ongoing work on the Regional Strategic 
Profile for 2007Â2013. Mexico supported the AgencyÂs initiative on the establishment of regional 
training centres for nuclear security and was willing to host such a centre so that it could share its 
expertise with other countries in the region. 

34. Following difficult negotiations, the Board had approved the programme and budget for 2008 in 
July. It was important to reflect on the AgencyÂs future and how its great responsibilities should be 
financed. The way in which those responsibilities were discharged and funded should be analysed to 
ensure the financial load was equitably spread. 
35. Mr. FAHMI (Iraq) said that his country was grateful to the Agency for its fine work in 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in assisting Member States, especially developing 
countries, to keep abreast of developments in nuclear science and technology. It was helping to build a 
new Iraq, offering valuable guidance that would set the country back on the path towards 
comprehensive development and enable it to recover its former status. Iraq was turning over a new 
leaf, pursuing policies based on trust and transparency in its technical and technological cooperation 
with the international community on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
36. Iraq benefited greatly from its national and regional technical cooperation projects with the 
Agency, for instance in dismantling the nuclear installations inherited from the countryÂs former 
nuclear programme and in radiation protection. There were several areas in which Iraq continued to 
need the AgencyÂs support: clean-up of destroyed nuclear sites; management of radioactive waste, 
development of an effective waste management strategy and selection of waste burial sites; safe 
transport of contaminated material and acquisition of the necessary equipment; support for joint 
research projects in the area of health, water resources and radiation protection; and more 
opportunities for training and scientific visits for Iraqi personnel. 
37. Iraq was a candidate for membership of the AgencyÂs Board of Governors. His GovernmentÂs 
basic policies in that regard included: promoting peaceful applications of nuclear energy in all fields; 
developing cooperation with the Agency and supporting its programmes; opposing the use of nuclear 
energy for non-peaceful purposes and ensuring compliance with international agreements; and 
adopting a policy of dialogue to resolve all problems arising between Member States regarding issues 
relating to their nuclear programmes. He noted that the Iraqi constitution prohibited trafficking in and 
the manufacture and use of weapons of mass destruction. 
38. The application of comprehensive Agency safeguards in the Middle East region would help 
maintain international peace and security, thereby contributing to non-proliferation efforts. Everyone 
was aware of the importance of establishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, especially 
nuclear weapons, in the Middle East. Iraq consistently worked to achieve that goal in international 
forums and urged all States to accede to international treaties prohibiting the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction, particularly the NPT. Israel should accede to that Treaty and place all its nuclear 
facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards as a prerequisite for building confidence and achieving a 
just and lasting peace in the region. 
39. Mr. AL-JASEM (Kuwait) said that sustainable development and international security called for 
the availability of energy sources that were compatible with global environmental criteria. The 
member States of the Gulf Cooperation Council had announced at their summit in December 2006 the 
adoption of a joint programme aimed at promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in order to 
meet the energy shortage, reduce dependence on imported energy, diversify energy sources and reduce

emissions of greenhouse gases. A number of meetings had been held to date between experts from 
member countries of the Council and representatives of the Agency to prepare a preliminary study of 
energy needs and assess institutional and personnel requirements. He commended the AgencyÂs 
cooperation in that regard. 

40. The 435 operational nuclear reactors throughout the world reflected the growing demand for 
vital nuclear technology and highlighted the AgencyÂs role, which lay not only in the area of nuclear 
energy but also in running diverse humanitarian programmes. It was important to enable it to continue 
to fulfil that role by ensuring continuity of funding for technical cooperation programmes and 
preventing any recurrence of past shortfalls in the TCF. Although Member StatesÂ contributions were 
voluntary, the Government of Kuwait regularly paid its share of the target. 
41. Kuwait was prepared to step up its bilateral cooperation with the Agency in developing the 
nuclear science and technology sector and promoting its contribution to sustainable development. 
42. Stressing the importance of adopting and implementing regulations and guidelines concerning 
the safety and security of radioactive sources and nuclear material, he stressed KuwaitÂs willingness to 
cooperate with the Agency in that area through national or regional projects, and with other 
organizations with shared safety and security interests. While welcoming the fact that a high level of 
safety had been maintained in 2006 and that no events at any power plant had resulted in a release of 
radioactivity that would cause harm to the environment, he urged the Agency to carry out continuous 
verification activities in order to ensure that the necessary caution was observed in Member States 
operating nuclear facilities and that authorities complied with safety regulations. Verification was 
particularly important to prevent nuclear terrorism. In that context, his country noted with growing 
concern the persistence of smuggling and illicit trafficking of nuclear material. The AgencyÂs Nuclear 
Security Plan had to address those challenges, providing for measures to detect cases of trafficking by 
underground nuclear networks, prevent theft and protect nuclear facilities. 
43. Kuwait had signed the amendments to the CPPNM and had signed the International Convention 
for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. It supported the action taken by some States to 
prevent nuclear terrorism, provided that such action was in keeping with the NPT regime and the 
AgencyÂs mandate. 
44. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was the cornerstone of the NPT regime, which was supported 
by the majority of States. He urged all States that had not yet done so to sign a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency and an additional protocol, and to comply with their provisions 
and with the NPT. Any issues arising with respect to a StateÂs nuclear programme should be addressed 
through constructive and transparent negotiations and dialogue. 
45. It was of the utmost importance to ensure that the safeguards regime was applied to all nuclear 
activities in the Middle East region. He noted with regret, however, that Israel persisted in its refusal to 
accede to the NPT and place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards, thereby preventing the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region and undermining regional and international 
security and stability. Kuwait supported the draft resolution submitted by the Arab Group on Israeli 
nuclear capabilities and threat. It called in the strongest terms for the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East that included Israel, while at the same time recognizing 
the right of all States in the region to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
46. His Government welcomed the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
Peninsula, which was a major achievement for the Agency. It also welcomed the agreement reached 
between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Agency on resolving all outstanding issues related to the 
Iranian nuclear programme. A policy of dialogue and negotiation was the best means of attaining the 
desired outcome, which would promote security and stability in the region and the world as a whole.

47. Ms. LACANLALE (Philippines) recalled President EisenhowerÂs impassioned speech at the 
United Nations in 1953 calling for the peaceful use of nuclear energy worldwide and the reduction of 
nuclear arsenals. He had also advocated the establishment of an international atomic energy agency, 
which had led to the AgencyÂs creation in 1957. Fifty years later, the Agency remained strong, having 
steadfastly promoted nuclear energy for development while ensuring nuclear safety and security, 
despite the challenges it had faced. She congratulated the Director General and the Secretariat on their 
achievements. 
48. In 2008, the Philippines would be marking 50 years of IAEA membership. Despite its modest 
nuclear energy programme, her country had gained much from its relationship with the Agency. 
Technical cooperation had been at the centre of that relationship and the Agency had become an 
important partner in achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. The technical 
cooperation programme had helped the Philippines increase agricultural and industrial productivity, 
gain access to clean drinking water and address environmental challenges. She thanked the 
Department of Technical Cooperation, in particular the Division for Asia and the Pacific, and the 
Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications for their valuable support. Thanks to their excellent 
collaboration, the Philippines had achieved a project implementation rate of 84% in 2006. 
49. Agency technical assistance had enabled the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute to upgrade its 
multi-purpose irradiation facility and its non-destructive testing training centre, and to establish its 
national environmental isotope laboratory. Her countryÂs participation in RCA regional projects on 
environment had enabled it to undertake various environmental studies using nuclear techniques. Data 
generated by those studies had provided important support for the implementation of national laws and 
regulations on the environment. 
50. The effectiveness of technical cooperation projects was best illustrated by their impact at grass 
roots level. Throughout the country, the benefits of such projects as those on soil and water 
management, air pollution studies, study of groundwater contamination and use of isotopes to 
characterize groundwater supplies had started to be recognized by local government officials who 
were providing resources to sustain Agency-assisted projects and had become active end-users of 
nuclear technology. 
51. As a founding member of the RCA, the Philippines continued to participate actively in the 
programme, contributing its expertise in the area of health, agriculture and the environment, while 
enhancing its capabilities through training and scientific exchange in industry and energy. The 
Philippines supported the fourth extension of the RCA agreement and looked forward to continuing 
close cooperation with other Member States in the region, with the support of the RCA Secretariat and 
the Regional Office in the Republic of Korea. 
52. The Philippines supported PACT as a priority activity in view of the alarming rise in the 
incidence of cancer worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Its collaboration with PACT 
should enhance cancer training capabilities in the region and it appreciated the generous contributions 
by donor countries and institutions. The AgencyÂs work in that area was a concrete example of Âatoms 
for peaceÂ in action. The draft resolution before the General Conference was intended to define the 
role of PACT and provide enhanced tools for cooperation with all stakeholders. She urged Member 
States to support it. 
53. Her country encouraged the Secretariat to address the long-term funding challenges facing the 
Agency and welcomed the Director GeneralÂs announcement on the 20/20 review. She thanked the 
Secretariat for their efforts to put the issue of sustainable, assured and predictable technical 
cooperation funding before the Board in a timely fashion. Her country was prepared to work with 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September 
2007,

9 


other Member States and the Secretariat to find ways and appropriate mechanisms to address that 
concern. 

54. In June 2007, her Government, recognizing the need for a secure energy supply for sustainable 
development and bearing in mind the effects of global warming, had announced its intention to 
reconsider nuclear power as a means of meeting the countryÂs future energy requirements. It had asked 
the Agency to conduct a review mission to study the possibility of rehabilitating the mothballed 
nuclear power plant or finding suitable sites for a new one. 
55. Since many people in the Philippines remained wary of nuclear power, the Government would 
need more help from the Agency with its awareness-raising activities to address concerns over 
security, safety and nuclear waste. She thanked the Agency for providing speakers at an 
awareness-raising workshop on nuclear power held in June 2007. 
56. The Philippines had accepted the invitation to join the International Radioactive Waste 
Technical Committee (WATEC). It also adhered to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources and its supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive 
Sources, implementation of which had considerably improved the safety and security of use of 
radiation sources in the Philippines and, despite its non-binding nature, the CodeÂs relevant provisions 
had been integrated into national regulations wherever applicable. 
57. The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had participated in the regional project on security of 
radioactive sources funded by Australia and the United States Department of Energy. The Institute had 
formulated an action plan to regain regulatory control over orphan sources, trained a team on orphan 
source methods and received equipment. 
58. Under the Memorandum of Intent between the Governments of the United States and the 
Philippines, monitors had been installed at the port of Manila to detect illicit trafficking in nuclear 
material and radioactive sources, which constituted an important step towards enhancing global and 
national security against nuclear and radiological threats. 
59. The Philippine Government had finalized the countryÂs nuclear security plan, which would soon 
be submitted for approval by the authorities. It was also working on the ratification of the amendments 
to the CPPNM. 
60. Her country had a strong interest in maintaining high standards of safety at nuclear power 
facilities, given the increasing number of nuclear power plants in the region. In addition, ratification of 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management would remain a key priority 
61. The Philippines welcomed the recent positive developments with regard to the DPRK nuclear 
issue, including the verification of the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the DPRKÂs 
announcement at the fourteenth meeting of the Regional ASEAN Forum in August 2007 that it would 
respect its commitment to make a complete declaration of all nuclear programmes and disable all its 
nuclear facilities, and the agreement reached in Beijing in July 2007 in the sixth round of the six-party 
talks. Her Government urged the DPRK to continue its full cooperation with the Agency. 
62. Her country was encouraged by the understandings reached between the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the Agency on a work plan to resolve outstanding verification issues. That should reduce 
tensions and open the way for renewed cooperation. While respecting IranÂs right to the peaceful use 
of nuclear energy under safeguards and in accordance with its NPT obligations, the Philippines urged 
Iran to comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council and Agency resolutions and to 
demonstrate the necessary transparency, going beyond the additional protocol. It also welcomed the 
recent efforts by the European Union, on behalf of the permanent members of the United Nations

Security Council and Germany, to open negotiations with Iran. The issue should be resolved through 
dialogue and consultations. 

63. Although much progress had been made in the use of nuclear technologies to improve peopleÂs 
lives, the same could not be said of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and the international 
non-proliferation regime continued to face major challenges. Greater efforts were needed to strengthen 
the institutional framework of the NPT, including the universal adoption of the Model Additional 
Protocol to strengthen the AgencyÂs verification authority. 
64. Despite the new challenges facing the Agency, it had become a strong partner, helping 
developing countries achieve their development goals. She congratulated the Director General and the 
Secretariat on their commitment and excellent work. 
65. Mr. NGANDAJINA (Angola) said that his country attached great importance to the technical 
cooperation programme through which the Agency helped to create, maintain and strengthen national 
and regional technical capacity for using nuclear technology in a safe, secure and sustainable manner. 
Since those activities depended on sufficient, foreseeable and assured resources being made available 
for the programmeÂs implementation, his country encouraged Member States to pay their contributions 
to the Regular Budget and the TCF. 
66. Angola welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen technical cooperation with Member States. 
In 2006, activities had been mainly related to health, food, agriculture, radiation safety of transport, 
nuclear sciences, physical and chemical applications, water and management of radioactive waste. 
Improvement of living conditions in many developing countries depended on the eradication or 
control of diseases such as cancer, sleeping sickness, HIV/AIDS and malaria, which hindered their 
socio-economic development. His country therefore appreciated the voluntary contributions made to 
PACT in 2006 by certain Member States, the OPEC Fund for International Development and the 
United States National Cancer Institute with a view to strengthening the fight against cancer. It 
supported the plans to set up a joint WHO/IAEA programme on cancer prevention, control, treatment 
and research, and encouraged the Agency to step up cooperation with organizations involved in cancer 
research and control. Angola welcomed the decision to use the Nobel Prize money to fund the needs of 
developing countries for the peaceful application of nuclear energy, in particular in the fields of health 
and food production. 
67. Malaria was a major obstacle to the eradication of poverty in developing countries, especially in 
Africa, and his country called on the Agency to strengthen research on control of malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes. 
68. HIV/AIDS had reached pandemic proportions in Africa, and Angola appreciated the AgencyÂs 
regional project on initiatives in HIV-1 molecular epidemiology and immunology in support of the 
UNAIDS-WHO African AIDS vaccine programme and encouraged it to seek new partnerships with 
national, regional and international institutions. 
69. The tsetse fly and trypanosomosis, another major transboundary problem in Africa, affected 
human health, restricted land use and increased poverty. Angola therefore welcomed the AgencyÂs 
support for PATTEC. 
70. Angola was grateful to the Agency for the support it had received with its CPF, which aimed at 
promoting and developing nuclear science and technology in many areas, from staff training to 
equipment provision. Considerable progress had been made thanks to the efforts on both sides, but he 
appealed for more technical cooperation from the Agency and other Member States to support the 
development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy.

71. In the context of technical cooperation, he drew attention to the progress made in Angola in 
monitoring occupational exposure to ionizing radiation in hospitals. 
72. Five national projects were being implemented in his country as part of the 2007Â2008 cycle 
and another seven projects had been submitted for Agency approval. As a sign of AngolaÂs 
commitment to developing nuclear science and technology, in June 2007 new legislation on atomic 
energy had been passed which would open up new prospects for his country. The next step would be 
to establish an atomic energy regulatory authority. 
73. Angola had met all its financial obligations to the Agency. He thanked the Agency and its 
Director General for their work and expressed the hope that the decisions taken at the General 
Conference would have a positive effect for the organization and, by extension, its Member States. 
74. Mr. GOREA (Romania) observed that, as well as marking the 50th anniversary of the Agency, 
2007 marked 50 years of Romanian nuclear energy development since its first research reactor was 
commissioned in 1957. He expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs activities and accomplishments 
during that time. 
75. Energy security was vital for Romania and, owing to economic growth, rising oil and gas prices 
and energy security concerns, the contribution of nuclear power to the countryÂs energy mix was set to 
increase over the coming few years. The second unit at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant had 
recently started commercial operation and a third and fourth unit were planned to be complete by 
2013Â2014, bringing the nuclear power share to around 35%. Romania considered nuclear energy to 
be a clean, reliable and sustainable energy source which could offer a long-term solution to challenges 
related to energy, the environment, health and water supply. It believed there was a need to expand the 
use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in a safe and secure manner, with a reduced risk of nuclear 
proliferation, a vision shared by the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership which Romania had recently 
joined. 
76. Safety was the most important factor in a nuclear programme and Romania was doing 
everything possible to maintain the highest safety standards by strictly complying with the existing 
international framework. Safety was a national responsibility but had implications beyond national 
boundaries and for the future use of nuclear power, which meant that international cooperation in a 
forum such as the Agency was indispensable. Romania strongly supported the safety standards 
developed and adopted under Agency auspices and encouraged all Member States to adopt them. The 
AgencyÂs international peer review services were an essential part of international cooperation and a 
confidence-building measure. Romania had benefited from an IRRS mission, which had provided 
valuable input to all involved in improving the safety of nuclear installations. 
77. His country believed that the peaceful use of nuclear energy should be based on full compliance 
with the NPT and transparency in nuclear programmes. A universal international non-proliferation 
regime, supported by a strong international safeguards system, was vital. Romania was committed to 
the prevention of proliferation of nuclear technologies that might be misused, it supported the 
universal introduction of the optimum combination of all safeguards measures available to the Agency 
and was pleased to announce the recent introduction of integrated safeguards in Romania. As a 
member of the European Union, Romania had also recently completed internal ratification of the 
trilateral safeguards agreement and related additional protocol between Euratom, EU member States 
and the Agency. 
78. He noted with satisfaction that the international regime to combat nuclear terrorism had been 
greatly improved in recent years. His country was committed to combating nuclear terrorism and to 
reinforcing joint efforts to increase international cooperation to combat that threat, and it had ratified 
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism earlier in 2007. It had 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September 
2007, 
Page 
12 


also become a partner in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, which aimed at 
developing a global network of partners committed to preventing terrorists from acquiring and using a 
nuclear weapon. The amended CPPNM was another valuable instrument which Romania had ratified, 
but he noted with concern that only 11 states had ratified the amendments. 

79. The Agency had an important role to play in the prevention of nuclear terrorism, and its 
activities had mainly been financed from extrabudgetary funds, of which the European Union had 
been the main donor in 2007. Romania had made four annual contributions in the amount of 
US $40 000 and would transfer its contribution for 2007 within a month. 
80. No country was immune to the effects of nuclear or radiological emergencies and incidents and 
his country recognized the need for international coordination and cooperation in response to such 
events. Therefore, it had decided to make a voluntary contribution of Â30 000 to the newly established 
Incident and Emergency Centre to strengthen its reporting and exchange of information capabilities 
and to enhance its overall response capabilities and emergency preparedness activities. 
81. Romania had gained a great deal from participation in technical cooperation activities and 
technical cooperation remained an important part of its work with the Agency. The country was 
assessing its changing role within the technical cooperation programme and trying to define a new 
strategy and new mechanisms for future cooperation. The main task of regional technical cooperation 
in Europe was to promote the sharing of knowledge and best practices and Romania was ready to 
continue providing its experts and training facilities. The TRIGA reactor, which had recently been 
converted from the HEU to LEU, could become a centre of excellence for regional services. 
82. It was generally agreed that financing of technical cooperation activities should be sufficient, 
assured and predictable. Romania shared the opinion that Member States should demonstrate their 
commitment by pledging and paying their share of the TCF targets on time and in full, as Romania 
had done. 
83. To sustain the objectives of RomaniaÂs national strategy for development of the nuclear field, a 
new CPF had been signed during the current session of the General Conference. The strategy 
concentrated in the medium term on certain areas of importance to the country: the extension of the 
capacity of the Pitesti fuel fabrication plant; the construction and commissioning of the industrial 
tritium removal facility at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant; the extension of the interim spent fuel 
dry storage modules; site selection and elaboration of the feasibility study and preliminary safety 
assessment report for the national repository for final disposal of low-level radioactive waste; the 
return to the Russian Federation of spent nuclear fuel from the WWR-S nuclear research reactor and 
the beginning of its decommissioning; and diversification of non-power nuclear applications in 
medicine and the commissioning of regional PET units. 
84. Romania had implemented strategic workforce planning and knowledge management across its 
whole nuclear system, for which human resources constituted a major issue. The average age of the 
workforce was high and it was necessary to avoid loss of experienced staff and generation gaps. With 
the commissioning of Units 3 and 4 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant, needs for qualified 
personnel would double and it was essential to identify core competency requirements and strategies, 
and to make an annual assessment of current technical capacity and attract and retain qualified 
individuals. Great emphasis was laid on gender balance and efforts to attract female candidates in such 
highly specialized, technical areas. Romania supported the AgencyÂs efforts to recruit women 
professionals and had established a point of contact for the recruitment of women within RomaniaÂs 
nuclear agency.

85. Mr. ZNIBER (Morocco) said that the role played by the Agency continued to expand and his 
country supported the Director GeneralÂs appeal for increased financial support for the Agency, which 
should go hand in hand with increased political support. 
86. Expressing disappointment at the lack of success of the 2005 NPT Review Conference and the 
modest progress made so far in the preparations for the 2010 NPT Review Conference, he called on all 
States which had not done so to adhere to the NPT and the AgencyÂs verification regime. 
Universalization of non-proliferation was an ever more urgent issue in the face of the constant threat to 
the regime. Morocco continued to support the AgencyÂs verification activities and strengthening of the 
safeguards system. Support from Member States was crucial if the Agency was to be able to provide 
the necessary assurances and guarantees with regard to non-diversion of nuclear material and facilities. 
He welcomed the increasing number of additional protocols concluded, but every effort should be 
made to encourage those States which had not done so to adhere to the safeguards regime and sign an 
additional protocol. 
87. His country had actively supported General Conference resolution GC(50)/RES/16 on the 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East and lamented the fact that no significant progress 
had been made in implementing it. IsraelÂs continuing refusal to adhere to the non-proliferation regime 
and submit its installations and activities to Agency safeguards was deplorable. Its attitude undermined 
all efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and establish a fair and lasting 
peace. The international community should recognize that the time had come to change the situation 
and to take seriously concerns about the deployment of nuclear weapons in the Middle East. 
Furthermore, the General Conference should contribute to achieving those objectives, which fell 
squarely within its mandate. 
88. No one was immune from the threat of nuclear terrorism and more could always be done to 
guard against it. All States should benefit from the cooperation needed to put in place nuclear security 
infrastructures. His own country was particularly interested in establishing a national nuclear security 
strategy. He commended the Agency for its efforts to provide Member States with the means to ensure 
physical protection of nuclear material and equipment and to combat illicit trafficking. Morocco was 
ready to cooperate fully with the Agency in implementing the Nuclear Security Plan for 2006Â2009 
and, in October 2007, would host a workshop on defining the design basis threat. It had also hosted the 
first meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and had joined that Initiative in the 
belief that it was necessary to adopt a global approach to combating nuclear terrorism. The Initiative 
would gain much by making use of the expertise and knowledge of the Agency. 
89. Morocco was convinced that the future of nuclear energy depended on the range of safety 
measures to which it must be subject. He expressed appreciation for the revised and strengthened 
Safety Fundamentals approved by the Board of Governors in 2007, which formed the basis for the 
AgencyÂs safety standards, presenting a coherent and strategic approach to safety for all nuclear 
activities. His country was working intensively with the relevant Agency services to develop a 
national legislative and regulatory framework to ensure that nuclear energy was used safely and 
peacefully, and to establish a safety culture. 
90. A safety culture should have its roots in knowledge development and human resources training 
and Morocco continued to be a centre of excellence for training in the field of radiation protection and 
nuclear medicine for experts from Africa and other regions. It had become a centre for South-South 
cooperation in radiological and nuclear matters, working particularly with its African partners. In that 
connection, he called for cooperation benefiting Africa to be strengthened in order to respond to the 
regionÂs urgent and growing needs and contribute to its socio-economic development.

91. The Moroccan authorities were particularly interested in establishing a national nuclear strategy, 
and the countryÂs first Triga Mark II research reactor had been inaugurated earlier in 2007. He 
expressed appreciation to the Agency for the support it had given throughout the project, which would 
enable Morocco to increase its ability to use nuclear technologies, particularly in training and research. 
92. His country welcomed the fact that, for the first time, the technical cooperation programme for 
2007Â2008 had been prepared using the PCMF in collaboration with Member StatesÂ national 
authorities. It was important for the Agency to listen to Member States when preparing the technical 
cooperation programme. Morocco continued to support the programme as a beneficial mechanism for 
transferring technology to promote socio-economic development, particularly in developing countries. 
It also supported the emerging approach in the Agency in support of technical cooperation activities 
which could help to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, in particular alleviating poverty and 
fighting cancer. In that connection, PACT was an important initiative. He reaffirmed his countryÂs 
willingness to cooperate fully with the Agency and put at its disposal all the human and material 
resources necessary for its humanitarian programme to be successful. 
93. He expressed support for the AgencyÂs activities on the sterile insect technique, an example of 
cooperation in the application of nuclear techniques for development in the areas of human health and 
nutrition which at the same time had a significant economic impact. In parallel to the work of the 
General Conference, his delegation was organizing a display on the application of nuclear techniques 
in Morocco which demonstrated the importance Morocco attached to Africa and to the need to 
strengthen technical cooperation among African countries. 
94. Recalling that the amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute adopted by the Board in 
1998 had yet to be brought into force, he expressed concern at the report on progress in that regard, 
which was detrimental to the principle of democratization within international organizations. He called 
on all States which had not yet done so to deposit their instruments of acceptance of the amendment to 
Article VI in order to allow its entry into force as soon as possible. 
95. Mr. SMITH (United Kingdom) said that his countryÂs institutions and enterprises had a long and 
intensive history of engagement in the development of nuclear power both at home and overseas. 
However, he was somewhat constrained in what he could say about future developments in nuclear 
energy in the United Kingdom. His Government was currently involved in a major consultation 
exercise with the British public on whether commercial operators should be allowed to construct new 
nuclear power stations in the United Kingdom as part of a diversified mix of energy supply sources. 
The consultation process was not yet complete, and it would thus be premature to speculate on its 
conclusions. The consultation period ran until 10 October and his Government expected to be in a 
position to share its conclusions by the end of the year. 
96. One recent development worth noting had been the decision to bring together the regulation of 
nuclear safety, security and safeguards within one body, the Health and Safety Executive. That should 
prove beneficial for both operators and the regulatory process, and improve the efficiency of 
regulatory management. 
97. His country was keen to see a similar improvement in the efficiency of Agency safeguards 
verification. It welcomed the progress which ISIS had made over the preceding two years. The United 
Kingdom had been a major contributor to that project. 
98. The United Kingdom strongly supported the Director GeneralÂs call for those Member States 
that had not yet done so to bring into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional 
protocol. It was only with the additional protocol that the Agency could provide credible assurances 
regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material or activities. There were significant 
improvements to be gained in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness through the adoption of 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September 
2007, 
Page 
15 


integrated safeguards, but the Agency could only achieve those improvements for States with both a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in force. 

99. His Government had been a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme. The 
danger of nuclear material being obtained by terrorists was one of the major issues facing the 
international community. An acute consciousness of that threat and the need for robust action to 
address it had been behind the United KingdomÂs decision to become and remain a major contributor 
to the voluntary Nuclear Security Fund. The United Kingdom had also provided expertise and 
supported the exchange of information on that important issue. Just ten days previously, it had hosted 
a conference in London to address the problem of nuclear smuggling, and it would also host an IAEA 
conference on illicit nuclear trafficking in Edinburgh from 19 to 22 November. The United Kingdom 
looked forward to continuing to work closely with the Agency in tackling that threat. 
100. The 1986 accident at Chernobyl remained a sombre landmark and a stark lesson in the need for 
the highest possible standards of nuclear safety. The United Kingdom had been a major donor to the 
project to build a new safe confinement at Chernobyl, contributing some Â77 million to date to the 
international funds operated by the EBRD at the site. It remained committed to supporting the 
international programmes at Chernobyl Â if necessary with additional financial support alongside 
Ukraine and other key donors. The project was moving into a new and critical phase where the 
unwavering commitment of all parties would be of the highest importance. 
101. The United Kingdom continued to have strong concerns about the proliferation implications of 
IranÂs nuclear programme. The Governments of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the 
United Kingdom and the United States had reiterated their commitment to seeking a negotiated 
solution with Iran. The far-reaching proposals made by those countries in June 2006 remained on the 
table as a possible basis for such a negotiated solution. Those offers included substantial help in 
developing a modern nuclear power programme. Regrettably, Iran had chosen to ignore those offers 
and remained in non-compliance with the requirements of the Security Council made mandatory in 
resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007). It was time for Iran to comply fully with the 
Security Council and immediately to suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities in 
order to allow negotiations to restart. His country looked forward to the rapid and purposeful 
implementation of the work plan agreed between Iran and the Agency Secretariat to resolve all 
outstanding questions surrounding IranÂs programme. IranÂs willingness to cooperate with the Agency 
seriously and fully over the P1 and P2 centrifuge issues was a key test of whether its agreement to the 
work plan was a genuine commitment or a delaying tactic. The United Kingdom welcomed any 
movement on the outstanding issues, but their resolution would not, by itself, be sufficient to restore 
confidence in IranÂs nuclear intentions. For that to happen, it was also essential that Iran suspend 
enrichment-related and reprocessing activities and implement fully the additional protocol and other 
measures that the Agency had requested. The United Kingdom did not wish to deny Iran any of its 
rights, but Iran first had to prove that it would exercise those rights responsibly. 
102. The shutdown of the Yongbyon facilities in the DPRK and the implementation of the 
monitoring and verification measures by the Agency were encouraging first steps in the resolution of 
the DPRK nuclear issue. His country urged the DPRK to comply fully with United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1718 (2006), and to ensure that all past nuclear activity was declared and that its 
nuclear programme was dismantled in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
103. The United Kingdom attached great importance to the development of mechanisms that would 
provide assurances of nuclear fuel supplies to countries looking to start a nuclear power generation 
programme or develop one further. It therefore welcomed the Director GeneralÂs report on that issue 
contained in document GOV/INF/2007/11. To demonstrate their commitment to taking initiatives in 
that regard forward, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands had 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September 
2007, 
Page 
16 


made a joint declaration setting out their shared thinking on the subject. That declaration had been 
circulated in document INFCIRC/713. Among the options described in the Director GeneralÂs report 
was, in Annex 12, the United KingdomÂs idea for Âenrichment bondsÂ. Such a concept, which could be 
elaborated for implementation comparatively quickly, might be of particular interest to those countries 
that were considering embarking on a nuclear power programme for the first time. The United 
Kingdom recognized the merits of many of the options listed and was eager to see dialogue on them 
intensified, with a view to making rapid progress on translating ideas into action. 

104. Mr. HORVATIC (Croatia) noted that the Agency had been steadily growing in both 
membership and importance over the preceding 50 years. He commended the AgencyÂs commitment 
to the peaceful use of atomic energy and acknowledged its important role in the field of nuclear 
non-proliferation, congratulating both the Director General and the staff on the AgencyÂs major 
contribution to world peace, security and development. 
105. Since becoming a Governor on the AgencyÂs Board one year previously, he had become ever 
more convinced of the AgencyÂs essential role in securing the world against nuclear weapons. The 
Agency had achieved significant successes since the preceding General Conference: negotiating with 
India on safeguards; addressing the issue of the DPRKÂs nuclear programme; and drawing up the work 
plan to resolve outstanding issues with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which Croatia hoped would be 
implemented swiftly and fully. The right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy was guaranteed by the 
NPT to all State Parties and should not be disputed. However, a fully transparent nuclear policy was a 
prerequisite for global security. 
106. Croatia considered the additional protocol crucial for mutual trust within the international 
community. Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with additional protocols were the current 
Agency verification standard and he called upon all Member States to ratify and implement an 
additional protocol. 
107. Only joint efforts and transparent policy would lead to a safer world. His country had been 
among the first Member States to ratify the Model Additional Protocol, the amendment to 
Article VI of the Statute and the amended CPPNM. It was also one of just 32 States in which the 
Secretariat had found no indication of diversion of declared nuclear material and no indication of 
undeclared nuclear material or activities. It had also initiated the procedure for acceptance of the new 
SQP. 
108. As in previous years, Croatia continued to honour fully and on time all its financial obligations 
to the Agency, including its contribution to the TCF. 
109. Croatia had established a strategy and relevant institutional capacities to guard against 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. The strategyÂs main aim was to prevent terrorists 
and non-State actors from acquiring nuclear weapons. Strong international cooperation was the only 
way to reduce that danger and States should cooperate closely within such initiatives as the 
Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. At national 
level, States should continue to take measures to prevent proliferation and the misuse of civil nuclear 
programmes, such as improving controls over the import and export of arms, strengthening border 
controls, reevaluating and improving laws, exchanging information at national and international level 
and improving public awareness of the issue of proliferation. 
110. Since the preceding General Conference, Croatia had hosted a regional awareness seminar on 
combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material and a regional training course on 
radiation detection equipment, both of which had been organized through cooperation between the 
Agency and the Regional Arms Control Verification and Implementation Assistance Centre based in 
Croatia. He invited the Agency to make greater use of CroatiaÂs capacity to run such events. 

GC(51)/OR.4

111. Also, with the assistance of the Agency, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina had hosted two 
training courses for police and customs officers to strengthen institutional capacities to prevent 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. During the courses, forty customs and police 
officers had been educated in the use of portal monitors donated by the Agency. 
112. Another important, but perhaps less visible role of the Agency was that of peaceful nuclear 
cooperation and development, one major aspect of which was the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme. Croatia, as a net recipient country, was grateful for the assistance provided to it. 
113. In February 2007, a delegation from the AgencyÂs Department of Technical Cooperation, 
headed by the Director of the Division for Europe, had visited Croatia. During the visit, two portal 
monitors donated by the Agency were put into operation on the border between Croatia and Slovenia. 
114. Croatia had submitted six national project proposals for the new programme cycle and several 
regional project proposals had been prepared covering various areas, based on the priorities set out in 
the CPF. Croatia fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance regional cooperation. 
115. Mr. WEKESA (Kenya) said that, in taking stock of the AgencyÂs many commendable 
achievements, it was important to consider whether all three pillars of its activities had progressed in 
an equal and balanced manner. 
116. The results would have been better if more progress been made in the area of non-proliferation. 
Recent developments had given cause for concern. His country urged all concerned to comply with 
their obligations and work towards a nuclear-weapon-free world. 
117. On the whole, progress in the area of technical cooperation had been satisfactory. Significant 
advances had been made in socio-economic development through the use of nuclear technology for 
peaceful purposes, notably in the fields of human health, agriculture, potable water and energy. 
118. Non-proliferation efforts, including safeguards and verification, should go hand in hand with 
nuclear disarmament, and efforts to strengthen the AgencyÂs statutory activities should take account of 
the need to maintain a balance between technical cooperation, verification, and safety and security. 
119. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Kenya had grown over time, in support of the 
GovernmentÂs endeavours to develop the national nuclear science and technology infrastructure and 
address the priorities identified in the countryÂs CPF. Kenya was participating in 13 national projects, 
covering human resources development, human health, agriculture, livestock production, radiation 
protection and industrial applications. 
120. His country was taking part in the exhibitions currently being held in the Austria Center to 
showcase the contribution of technical cooperation programmes to poverty alleviation and economic 
growth. One tangible example of the success of the technical cooperation programme in his country 
had been the bread wheat variety developed with the help of nuclear techniques by the Kenya 
Agricultural Research Institute. In the field of molecular genetics, the Kenya Medical Research 
Institute had made significant progress in efforts to overcome resistance to front-line antimalarial and 
anti-tuberculosis drugs. 
121. His country was grateful for the AgencyÂs assistance with the establishment of an SSDL, which 
had been commissioned in June 2007. The laboratory would play an important role in the calibration 
of medical and industrial devices which produced or utilized ionizing radiation. 
122. Kenya recognized the global efforts to prevent nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation and 
had submitted its instrument of acceptance of the amendments to the CPPNM. A comprehensive

safeguards agreement and SQP, and an additional protocol were in the process of being concluded 
following Cabinet approval. 

123. His country had set up security agencies with highly trained staff for the purpose of combating 
crime related to nuclear terrorism. It had also recently hosted regional training courses on the safety 
and security of radioactive material. 
124. With the help of an established infrastructure, Kenya was promoting a radiation safety culture 
for the protection of persons and the environment. The competent authority, the Radiation Protection 
Board, had increased its manpower, equipment and resources to cope with more radiation protection 
activities. 
125. In June 2007, Kenya had taken a verified inventory of its radioactive sources in collaboration 
with the Agency, and a similar exercise was expected to be carried out as part of a RaSSIA mission 
before the end of the year. 
126. His country recognized the importance of safety and security in the context of the transport of 
radioactive sources. KenyaÂs regulatory authority licensed and authorized all movements of radiation 
sources within, and in and out of the country. Systems had been put into place to prevent illicit 
trafficking in radioactive and nuclear material in the East African region. 
127. With regard to radiological emergencies, Kenya was in the process of incorporating expertise 
within the structure of its National Disaster Operations Centre. 
128. In addition, it subscribed to the AgencyÂs safety standards for radioactive waste management 
and steps had been taken to ensure their implementation. His Government had contributed 
$200 000 towards the planning and construction of a central radioactive waste processing facility and 
it would be seeking the AgencyÂs assistance in setting up the facility which it hoped would be 
operational in the near future. 
129. The Kenyan Society for the Promotion of Peaceful Applications of Nuclear Science and 
Technology had been registered and its aim was to promote peaceful applications of nuclear science 
and technology for socio-economic development. It looked forward to enhanced interaction among 
stakeholders and the AgencyÂs technical assistance programme in the field of technology 
development. 
130. The tsetse fly and trypanosomosis posed a threat to lives and livelihoods and hampered 
livestock production. Kenya was one of six Phase 1 countries participating in PATTEC. The facility at 
the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute-Trypanosomiasis Research Centre was boosting the 
production of sterile males for use in the PATTEC programme. 
131. Projects on the expansion of radiotherapy services and improvement of nuclear medicine 
services were a matter of high priority for his Government. In MayÂJune 2007, physicians from the 
Kenyatta National Hospital and the Ministry of Health had held a planning meeting on radiotherapy 
and nuclear medicine with Agency staff in Vienna with a view to enhancing technical cooperation in 
those areas in the context of national plans to promote advanced health care services and the national 
cancer control strategy. His Government had allocated resources equivalent to $707 143 for 2007 and 
2008 to spearhead the expansion of cancer treatment services. 
132. Skills development in the field of nuclear science and technology was crucial. Local universities 
had been working with the Agency to develop curricula in nuclear technology. One area that had been 
explored had been mutation breeding of plants, which played an important role in improving crop 
production. The training courses, fellowships, scientific visits, expert missions and equipment 
provided by the Agency to Kenyan institutions were highly appreciated.

133. His Government welcomed the External AuditorÂs report on the AgencyÂs accounts for 
2006. Kenya was committed to paying its financial contributions and, to date, had honoured all its 
financial obligations to the Agency. It had also pledged its full share to the TCF for 2008. 
134. Mr. ABDRAKHMANOV (Kazakhstan) said that recent events had once again demonstrated the 
complexity of creating an atmosphere of mutual trust. The non-proliferation regime was one of the 
cornerstones of such efforts and the NPT was the core instrument underlying that regime. Successful 
implementation of the NPT was a precondition for further development of international control over 
all types of weapons of mass destruction. It was therefore of paramount importance to have an 
efficient NPT regime and to take measures to strengthen nuclear non-proliferation. First and foremost, 
that meant steadfast adherence to commitments made under the NPT. 
135. On 19 February 2007, Kazakhstan had ratified the protocol additional to its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency, which had entered into force on 9 May. His country was an active 
participant in nearly all anti-nuclear threat initiatives, including the G8 Global Partnership against the 
Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the 
Nuclear Threat Initiative. It also welcomed the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
launched by the United States and the Russian Federation in July 2006 and had signed the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism to demonstrate its firm 
commitment to international security and the international communityÂs collective efforts to combat 
terrorism. The third meeting of the Global Initiative had been held in Astana in June 2007. Kazakhstan 
was also taking measures to strengthen border controls and upgrade its system to combat illicit 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. It fully supported United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1540 (2004) on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
136. His country had joined the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership whose Statement of Principles it 
had signed in September 2007. It endorsed the main principles underlying the Global Partnership and 
its vision for nuclear energy cooperation. Its membership gave renewed impetus to KazakhstanÂs 
national nuclear industry. 
137. KazakhstanÂs export control policy was in full conformity with commonly accepted standards. 
As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, his country took effective measures to meet its 
obligations to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. A system had been set up to combat 
illicit nuclear trafficking which was being improved constantly. The introduction of new restrictions 
on nuclear technology transfer should be examined closely to avoid unjustified barriers to peaceful 
nuclear development. 
138. By giving up the worldÂs fourth largest nuclear arsenal, Kazakhstan had made a historic 
contribution to enhancing non-proliferation and disarmament and had demonstrated its commitment to 
its international obligations. Recognizing the threat posed by highly enriched material, the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources of Kazakhstan had adopted a five-year programme to convert the 
VVR-K research reactor to low-enriched fuel. The decommissioning of the BN-350 fast breeder 
reactor in Aktau was under way. Downblending of HEU from the reactor fuel had been completed at 
the Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk. 
139. Kazakhstan was actively implementing the new edition of the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources. Projects to strengthen control over ionizing radiation sources, 
and on the safe and secure management of strong sources, were being implemented successfully. 
Instruments to introduce a national register of sources of ionizing radiation were being prepared and 
an inventory of radioactive sources was being carried out. The Agency and countries participating in 
those projects had provided valuable support.

140. With Government support, the Nuclear Technologies Park in Kurchatov had been registered and 
had commenced operations. It would lay the foundation for the development of peaceful applications 
of atomic energy, including nuclear power. In 2006, a heavy ion accelerator had been put into service 
in Astana and construction of the materials research tokamak in Kurchatov was under way. The 
Government had also lent its support to the forthcoming construction of a large nuclear medicine 
centre in Almaty. 
141. Kazakhstan was actively engaged in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central 
Asia, as proposed in the Almaty Declaration of 28 February 1997. On 8 September 2006, 
representatives of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan had signed the 
Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. 
142. In 2007, Kazakhstan had signed an intergovernmental agreement with the Russian Federation 
on the establishment of an international uranium enrichment centre in Angarsk. It was convinced that 
such international centres, working under strict Agency control, where the most sensitive stages of the 
nuclear fuel cycle would be implemented, would create a basis for the development of nuclear power 
engineering while maintaining full compliance with non-proliferation principles. 
143. In his statement at the G8 Summit in July 2006, the President of Kazakhstan had underlined that 
global security could only be ensured through complete nuclear disarmament, as the possession of 
such weapons posed a direct threat to humanity. 
144. It was time for all to think about alternative energy sources and global energy security. His 
Government supported the development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy under strict 
international control, in particular by the Agency. Any State that complied with that requirement for 
transparency, having implemented a safeguards agreement and additional protocol with the Agency, 
should have the right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and build nuclear power 
reactors. Ways had to be found to solve recent conflict situations by rebuilding the confidence of the 
international community in the nuclear activities of countries without restricting their right to 
technological development and access to knowledge. The Agency and its Director General, with their 
experience, were in a good position to address such complex issues. 
145. Control over nuclear weapons and nuclear technology should be improved to prevent the 
diversion of fissile material for military purposes. One possibility was to establish a body under the 
auspices of the Agency that would ensure the reliable supply of fuel for nuclear power plants and 
manage safe storage and waste processing. Political, commercial and financial issues would need to be 
resolved prior to the establishment of such an entity. Although the idea might appear unrealistic at 
present, efforts should be made to move in that direction. 
146. Mr. CURIA (Argentina) welcomed the new safeguards agreements and additional protocols that 
had been signed over the preceding year. 
147. Argentina firmly believed in the right of all countries to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy, including the fuel cycle, in compliance with their international obligations. Any attempt to 
alter the delicate balance of rights and obligations set forth in the NPT, calling into question the 
legitimacy of StatesÂ efforts to develop technologies for exclusively peaceful purposes, could 
undermine the widely accepted NPT regime. Any proposal for modification that could be interpreted 
as being unjust and sought to reallocate rights and obligations ran the risk of weakening the 
international non-proliferation regime that Argentina strongly supported. Such would be the case for 
any initiative seeking to curtail State sovereignty and the independent ownership and control of a key 
technological sector, such as the nuclear fuel cycle, thus restricting the potential benefits of those 
activities and technologies to a small number of countries. However, given the current challenges, 
continued efforts needed to be made to find solutions to the problems of proliferation in order to 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September 
2007, 
Page 
21 


ensure that all those in compliance with their obligations under the NPT could reap the benefits of 
nuclear energy. It was against that background that Argentina was carefully observing initiatives 
aimed at multilateralization of the fuel cycle which might entail a fundamental shift in the political, 
technological and legal framework for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 

148. Since the inception of its nuclear activities in 1950, Argentina had been firmly committed to the 
exclusively peaceful uses of nuclear energy and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, as demonstrated 
by the various binding legal instruments to which it was party and its rigorous domestic legislation on 
the transfer of nuclear technology, equipment and material. The most important development in 
ArgentinaÂs nuclear activities over the preceding year had been the GovernmentÂs decision to resume 
nuclear activities in the country, which it had announced in August 2006. In the year following that 
announcement, the authorities had adopted important measures that consolidated that policy and 
initiated steps to implement it without delay. 
149. The resumption of nuclear activities in Argentina was being carried out through a nuclear 
programme for the short and medium term which focused on the large-scale generation of nuclear 
power and nuclear technology applications in the health sector and industry. The aims of the 
programme were as follows: consolidation of the nuclear power option through the completion of the 
Atucha II nuclear power plant, extension of the life of the Embalse nuclear power plant, preliminary 
feasibility studies for the construction of a fourth nuclear power plant which could potentially 
comprise two units, and the construction of a prototype of the CAREM low-power reactor. 
150. Completing the Atucha II nuclear power plant was of special significance for his country, not 
only because it would substantially increase generation of electricity but also because it would 
revitalize the whole scientific, technological and industrial sector related to the nuclear field, creating a 
high demand for highly specialized human resources. To date, work to finish the over 90% complete 
civil engineering work and to complete the assembly of major components had been resumed, and the 
contracts for assembly of the turbine generator had been renegotiated. 
151. Other aims of the programme were to reinforce the mastery of the nuclear fuel cycle achieved in 
the 1980s, including by restoring the technological capacity for design engineering and management 
of fuel element processes for Atucha II, resuming enrichment activities at the Pilcaniyeu plant by 
consolidating the original technology and evaluating the possibility of applying new, innovative 
technologies, reviving uranium mining, and resuming production of heavy water at the Arroyito plant, 
which was to provide 600 tonnes for the initial inventory of Atucha II. 
152. The Argentine Nuclear Regulatory Authority, an independent nuclear monitoring body, was 
taking the necessary steps to license the Atucha II plant, and to ensure nuclear safety in connection 
with the extension of the life of the Embalse and Atucha I nuclear power plants. 
153. The resumption of enrichment activities would not only place Argentina among those countries 
that possessed such technology, but would also enable it to meet the demand for LEU fuel elements 
for its heavy water-moderated power reactors, and to meet the demand for low-enriched fuel for its 
research and production reactors and reactors exported to third countries. In that connection, his 
Government welcomed the inauguration in April 2007 of the OPAL reactor in Australia. 
154. Argentina would continue to participate actively in international efforts to develop newgeneration 
reactors and fuel cycles, in particular the AgencyÂs INPRO project to which it had 
contributed cost-free experts and extrabudgetary contributions. 
155. His country was converting the core of the RA-6 research reactor to low-enriched fuel and 
returning almost all 90% enriched uranium to the State of origin. That process was due to be 
completed in 2007 or early 2008.

156. With regard to applications of nuclear technology, in particular in the health field, a highly 
complex and advanced nuclear diagnostics centre had opened in Buenos Aires in May 2007. Its 
state-of-the-art equipment would make it one of the most advanced centres in South America for 
oncology, cardiology and neurology. The centre would offer health care to the public, carry out 
medical research and train highly qualified nuclear medicine staff. 
157. Argentina remained open to establishing and strengthening cooperation on the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, as demonstrated by its ongoing involvement in technical cooperation and assistance 
both at the multilateral level, through active participation in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme and ARCAL, and at the bilateral level, through its specific cooperation agreements with 
around 30 countries. 
158. His country welcomed the efforts of the Agency and its Member States to strengthen 
international cooperation in nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste management. The 
progress made with regard to fostering a safety culture was particularly noteworthy. He drew special 
attention to the steps taken with respect to information and communication networks for nuclear and 
radiation safety, and to the efforts to strengthen national regulatory infrastructures for the control of 
radioactive sources. 
159. He welcomed the inclusion in the Annual Report of a reference to the activities carried out 
under an extrabudgetary programme in conjunction with the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological 
and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies. His country was honoured to host the headquarters of the Forum 
secretariat in Buenos Aires and would continue to support its activities and operations. 
160. Argentina was conscious of the importance of the AgencyÂs cooperation activities in the field of 
nuclear security and was following them with special interest. However, the Agency should bear in 
mind the different treatment which should be given to nuclear material and non-nuclear radioactive 
material so as to avoid any negative impact on peaceful nuclear activities. 
161. The efforts of the Secretariat and the AgencyÂs Member States with regard to education and 
training in radiation protection and nuclear safety were noteworthy. In line with its traditionally active 
policy in that area, Argentina had continued to make progress towards becoming a regional training 
centre for radiation, nuclear, transport and waste safety. The final report of the AgencyÂs expert 
mission of June 2006 had confirmed that the postgraduate course run by Argentina on safety was 
appropriate for instruction in the proper application of the AgencyÂs standards, and had set out a plan 
of action that his Government had already implemented. A long-term agreement with the Agency 
would facilitate the efficient use of resources for the systematic dissemination in Spanish of the latest 
know-how and experience in radiation, nuclear, transport and waste safety throughout Latin America 
and the Caribbean. His country was confident that such an agreement would soon be signed. 
162. Priority should be given to areas and activities clearly identified in the AgencyÂs Statute. With 
regard to Agency activities relating to the security of radioactive sources, safety and security should be 
addressed in an integrated fashion in order to ensure appropriate control. 
163. The AgencyÂs verification system served to provide the international community with 
assurances of the peaceful nature of nuclear programmes. However, Argentina continued to encourage 
the Secretariat to strive for greater efficiency in the application of safeguards and noted that a 
profound cultural change was needed for the proper design and implementation of integrated 
safeguards. He reaffirmed the importance of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and 
Control of Nuclear Materials, noting that cooperation between ABACC and Agency should continue 
to be consolidated with a view to more effective and efficient application of safeguards under the 
Quadripartite Agreement.

164. Finally, his country would continue to cooperate with the Agency in its important work by 
making available to the Secretariat its experts and training capacity. 
Mr. 
Berdennikov 
(Russian 
Federation) 
took 
the 
Chair. 


165. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) commended the AgencyÂs contribution to the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy and the prominent role it played in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons 
and threats of nuclear terrorism. Non-compliance with the NPT and related safeguards obligations was 
one of the main challenges facing the international community. Her country had always fulfilled its 
obligations under the NPT, its safeguards agreement and additional protocol. The additional protocol 
was an important instrument to strengthen the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of the 
safeguards system and it was regrettable that, ten years after the adoption of the Model Additional 
Protocol, a significant number of States had still to bring it into force. She also strongly urged those 
States that had not yet concluded a safeguards agreement to do so without further delay. 
166. The Czech Republic had always given priority to providing the Agency with sufficient evidence 
of its peaceful use of nuclear material. As of June 2007, it had become one of those countries in which 
the highest level of safeguards Â integrated safeguards Â was being applied. Moreover, under the 
Czech RepublicÂs support programme her country had made financial contributions to the IAEA 
Safeguards Information System Re-engineering Project and hoped to continue to promote such 
assistance in the future. As part of its in-kind assistance, it had helped the Agency test monitoring 
systems at nuclear power plants and used satellite communications for remote monitoring. It had also 
been involved in the development of a new system of Agency safeguards for deep repositories of spent 
nuclear fuel, had helped organize training courses for Agency safeguards inspectors and had provided 
sample analyses for safeguards activities. 
167. Her country remained concerned about the growing threat of nuclear terrorism and thus had 
always supported all efforts to eliminate the risk of misuse of sensitive nuclear material and 
technologies. The Agency was one of the key coordinators in the fight against international nuclear 
terrorism and the Czech Republic, recognizing the need to secure funding for specific measures, had 
regularly contributed to the Nuclear Security Fund since its establishment. Her country had been the 
fourth to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and was 
party to all thirteen international treaties relating to the struggle against international terrorism. It was 
also in the process of ratifying the amendment to the CPPNM and regularly organized regional 
training courses on the physical protection of nuclear material. 
168. The Czech Republic was committed to the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction in general and had recently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 
Under the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, preparations were in progress for the repatriation of 
spent fuel from the research reactor at ReÂ to the Russian Federation. Her country would be willing to 
share its experience and expertise with other countries preparing for similar action. 
169. Her country attached great importance to international regimes in the field of import and export 
controls; it participated actively in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and also chaired the Zangger 
Committee. Steps should be taken to tighten up the conditions for the supply of trigger list and 
dual-use items, and efforts should be made to define minimum standards for nuclear export controls, 
and possibly also harmonized standards for conditions of supply. 
170. The ongoing renaissance of nuclear power highlighted the importance of ensuring reliable 
supplies of nuclear fuel. The proposals concerning multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle 
provided a solid basis for further discussion in which her country would participate.

171. The Czech Republic valued the AgencyÂs ongoing activities relating to radiation protection and 
its major contribution to increasing the safety and security of sources of ionizing radiation. The 
Agency played a crucial role in evaluating and improving radiation surveillance in Member States and 
in harmonizing national practices. Her country voluntarily followed the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources and fully supported the related Guidance on the Import and 
Export of Radioactive Sources. 
172. Her country had taken advantage of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme to further 
its development. A Model Project under which the first PET centre had been established in the 
Czech Republic eight years earlier had been selected for an exhibition to mark the fiftieth anniversary 
of the Agency as an example of one of the most successful national projects implemented in Europe. 
The centre was now one of the largest in Europe and was used as a training centre not only for 
domestic institutions but also for interested parties from other countries. The technical cooperation 
programme was an important and unique platform for the exchange of information and experience and 
should receive adequate and predictable resources. In addition to the regular payment of its 
contributions to the TCF, the Czech Republic had assumed some of the costs associated with the 
implementation of national projects, demonstrating its genuine interest in their implementation. She 
urged other countries to do likewise. To the extent possible, the Czech Republic made every effort to 
compensate for the aid it received and to support the implementation of the programme by providing 
assistance to less developed Member States. Following positive economic developments, it had 
become a net donor. It voluntarily contributed to selected projects in accordance with its foreign policy 
interests and regional priorities; for example, it was continuing to enhance nuclear safety in Ukraine 
and Armenia. Her country also supported Agency activities that went beyond the technical cooperation 
programme; thus, under PACT, over the preceding two years it had financed improvements in cancer 
treatment in countries in need in the region. 
173. The rising demand for the AgencyÂs services was not reflected in a corresponding increase in 
financial resources. The Czech Republic commended the Secretariat on its efforts to seek a balance 
between programme requirements and the limited funds available for their implementation. It 
welcomed the activities to mobilize further resources, including by approaching non-conventional 
donors. 
174. Mr. ERTAY (Turkey) said that the rapidly increasing global demand for electricity, growing 
uncertainty regarding the supply and prices of oil and natural gas, and heightened concerns about 
greenhouse gas emissions had opened up new prospects for the development of nuclear energy on a 
global scale and led to a revival of the debate on the pros and cons of nuclear energy. TurkeyÂs energy 
policy was focused on the security, sustainability and competitiveness of supply, and was designed to 
sustain targeted economic and social growth in the long term. Recent demand projections in Turkey 
for the period up to 2020 predicted an average annual increase in demand of about 8%. There was 
therefore a need to increase energy production and supply significantly and the Turkish Government 
was striving to improve the utilization of domestic resources such as coal, hydroelectric power, 
petroleum and natural gas. However, those resources currently fell short of meeting domestic needs 
and more than half of TurkeyÂs primary energy demand was being met through imports. 
175. Turkey recognized the importance of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology and the 
crucial role the Agency played in that regard. It also recognized that any significant increase in nuclear 
power would only be possible if the international community were able to meet certain challenges, 
including advances in innovative and evolutionary technologies, and address concerns about waste, 
proliferation, safety and security. The Turkish Government had already expressed its intention to 
introduce nuclear energy and preparations were well under way to include nuclear power as a major 
component in its energy supply mix in the medium to long term. TurkeyÂs current priority was the 
reorganization of its nuclear regulatory infrastructure; it would then put the final touches to a

25 


programme that aimed to make the first units of a nuclear power plant operational in the latter part of 
the coming decade. A law was expected to be enacted soon that would provide incentives for the 
private sector. His country would continue to cooperate closely and fully with the Agency in launching 
and operating its prospective programme. 

176. Nuclear weapons proliferation, including potential proliferation to non-State actors, was a 
serious concern for Turkey, which was fully committed to the implementation of the NPT. His country 
would continue to promote issues of key importance for the NPTÂs sustainability in the long term, 
including its universalization, strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system, reinforcement of 
export controls, the early entry into force of the CTBT, and the immediate start of negotiations on and 
early conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty. Turkey was dedicated to full compliance with the 
NPT, including the application of its comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol. 
177. Comprehensive safeguards agreements plus additional protocols were the current verification 
standard and his country was concerned that there were still more than 100 States without additional 
protocols, and even 31 without comprehensive safeguards agreements. Turkey added its voice to the 
persistent calls of the Director General for all the States concerned to sign, ratify and implement 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols without delay. It found it regrettable 
that the 2005 NPT Review Conference had been unable to reach consensus on substantive matters, and 
it would continue to work constructively towards a substantive outcome for the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. He encouraged others to do likewise. 
178. His country looked forward to the peaceful solution of the current non-proliferation issues that 
were of concern to the international community. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula 
remained a regional and global priority and his country welcomed the progress made in 
implementation of the agreement of 13 February 2007. The active cooperation the AgencyÂs team had 
been receiving from the DPRK was particularly welcome. 
179. Turkey also attached great importance to the alleviation, through peaceful means and as soon as 
possible, of the ongoing crisis of confidence between Iran and the international community regarding 
the scope and nature of its past and current nuclear programmes. It was therefore concerned that the 
Agency had once again been unable to verify certain important aspects relevant to the scope and 
nature of that countryÂs nuclear programme in its latest report. It did, however, welcome the fact that 
the Agency had been able to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material and that Iran had 
continued to provide the access and reporting needed to allow Agency verification in that regard. It 
was also encouraged that Iran had provided the Agency with additional information needed to resolve 
a number of long outstanding issues. His country welcomed the work plan that had been agreed, which 
was an important step in the right direction. It looked forward to its full and timely implementation, 
and hoped that it would help to pave the way for the resumption of the negotiation process between 
Iran and all relevant parties. He commended the Director General and his staff for their tireless and 
impartial efforts. A just and durable solution should provide the international community with the 
required level of assurance while at the same time enabling Iran to exercise its rights under the NPT. 
180. His country recognized that a global nuclear, radiation and waste safety culture was a key factor 
for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and that continued efforts were required to ensure that the 
technical and human elements of safety were adequately maintained worldwide. It appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts to develop appropriate strategies for sustainable education and training in those areas, 
including the safety and security of radioactive sources, and welcomed its activities aimed at fostering 
a global nuclear safety regime, in particular the updating of its safety standards. Turkey encouraged 
the Agency to continue its efforts to provide guidance, support and assistance to Member States in 
establishing and maintaining adequate safety standards and infrastructure, particularly those that were 
considering developing nuclear power.

181. Turkey attached great importance to the fight against terrorism. Its Government was committed 
to international efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, including malicious acts involving nuclear and 
radioactive material. His country strongly supported all measures aimed at preventing terrorists from 
acquiring nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological weapons and their means of delivery. It 
supported the objectives and implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 
1540 (2004) and it took the utmost care to prevent illegal trade in nuclear material and technology, 
weapons of mass destruction or any of their components. It had hosted the second meeting of the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism in February 2007 and had also taken part in the 
activities of the Proliferation Security Initiative. 
182. His country attached the utmost importance to the AgencyÂs promotional activities and strongly 
supported its technical cooperation programme, considering the funding of technical cooperation 
activities to be the joint responsibility of all Member States. It therefore encouraged all concerned to 
pay their shares of the TCF in full and on time. 
183. Finally, Turkey upheld the recommendation of the External Auditor to improve interaction with 
United Nations organizations and other institutions and welcomed the progress made in that regard. 
184. Mr. HASTOWO (Indonesia) said that, over the past 50 years, the Agency had played an 
important role in promoting socio-economic development and maintaining world peace and security. 
He expressed appreciation for the technical cooperation provided to his country by the Agency and for 
the visit by the Director General in December 2006. 
185. Given the growing demand for energy, Indonesia could not continue to rely on traditional 
energy sources and had opted for nuclear energy to meet its future energy needs. In that context, he 
thanked the Agency for assisting Indonesia through two technical cooperation projects: one on the 
preparation of regulations, codes, guides and standards; and the other relating to preparations for the 
construction of a nuclear power plant. Intensive bilateral and multilateral cooperation with countries 
with experience in building and operating nuclear power plants was also necessary. Indonesia was at a 
crucial stage of its programme: with the help of a public information campaign and educational 
initiatives, it had to convince the public of the importance of nuclear energy in achieving sustainable 
development. 
186. His country welcomed the agreement on eight projects proposed by Indonesia for 
implementation in 2007Â2008 in the fields of energy, food and agriculture, human health and 
environment. However, it stressed the need for a more balanced distribution of the budget so as to 
reflect the equal importance of the AgencyÂs various statutory activities. 
187. Indonesia welcomed the fact that the TCF targets for 2007Â2008 had been set at $80 million and 
the IPFs for 2009Â2011 at $82 million. It was encouraging that the rate of attainment for the TCF had 
stood at 93% by the end of 2006 and that new resources had reached a record high of $101 million. He 
thanked those countries that had contributed regularly to the TCF in full and on time. For its part, 
Indonesia had consistently paid its pledge of its annual share of the TCF targets and would continue to 
do so in the future. 
188. Resources for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities had to be sufficient, assured and 
predictable. Any efforts to explore proposals for a more sufficient, assured and predictable TCF, as 
requested in resolution GC(50)/RES/12, should strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and should not place any additional financial burden on 
Member States, especially developing countries. In that connection, Indonesia looked forward to the 
outcome of the discussions on various approaches to strengthening the financing of the technical 
cooperation programme, as well as to the forthcoming study on the future programmatic and

budgetary requirements of the Agency announced by the Director General at the July 2007 Board 
meeting. 

189. His country wished to place on record its appreciation for the significant contribution made by 
the Agency through its technical cooperation activities to increasing the capacity of Member States in 
the area of nuclear applications. It was implementing the new approach to improving the CPF and 
expected to sign a CPF for 2007Â2012 by the end of the year. 
190. Indonesia appreciated the AgencyÂs support in the field of radiation-induced mutation to 
produce new plant varieties. High-quality rice mutant varieties had been planted on more than one 
million hectares in the country. 
191. His country also supported the AgencyÂs efforts to combat cancer and, in that connection, it was 
pleased to report that the commissioning of the radiotherapy centre in Kalimantan was expected to be 
completed by the end of the year. 
192. With regard to the preservation and dissemination of nuclear safety knowledge, the Asian 
Nuclear Safety Network had been disseminating nuclear safety knowledge to universities and 
academic bodies in the country. Indonesia had also been actively involved in six topical groups in the 
Network. Funding for nuclear safety activities should be secure, adequate and predictable. However, it 
should not come from the Regular Budget because that would be an additional burden for developing 
Member States. 
193. As one of the members of INPRO, Indonesia supported the projectÂs activities aimed at meeting 
global energy demand and promoting sustainable economic and social development. It welcomed the 
application of the INPRO user methodology in multiple contexts in a number of countries as part of 
the assessment of innovative nuclear systems. It had contributed to the INPRO programme by sending 
cost-free experts in the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear safety. In 2008, it would be participating in a 
collaborative project in the field of advanced HTGR design. 
194. With regard to the security of radioactive sources, his delegation was pleased to announce that a 
Government regulation on the safety of ionizing radiation and security of radioactive sources, based 
on the IAEA Basic Safety Standards, had been enacted in 2007. 
195. Indonesia was committed to implementing fully its integrated safeguards agreement. While it 
supported efforts to promote the universalization of the additional protocol, they should not be at the 
expense of the AgencyÂs work on promoting international cooperation on the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. As a party to the NPT and integrated safeguards, Indonesia fully supported the inalienable 
right of State Parties to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in accordance with Article IV of the NPT. 
Each countryÂs choice in that regard should be respected without undermining its national policies, 
international cooperation agreements and arrangements concerning the peaceful use of nuclear energy, 
or its fuel cycle policies. 
196. The inability to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was a matter of serious 
concern, as was the continuing defiant attitude and policy of one country in the region which refused 
to place its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards or accede to the NPT. Even more 
regrettably, the belligerent policy of that country enjoyed the support of a number of Member States of 
the Agency. The double standard applied by those countries was unacceptable. 
197. Indonesia welcomed the outcome of the latest round of six-party talks on the DPRK nuclear 
issue in February 2007 and the agreement on initial actions for the implementation of the Joint 
Statement of 19 September 2005. The agreement was a step in the right direction in a long and 
complex process aimed at achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful and 
transparent manner. His country was also pleased at the recent positive developments regarding the

28 


implementation of the arrangements agreed between the DPRK and the Agency for monitoring and 
verification of the shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. 

198. With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, his country welcomed the work plan agreed upon by 
Iran and the Agency and commended the Agency on the progress it had made in its efforts to resolve 
the outstanding issues. Timely implementation of the work plan was the key to arriving at a peaceful 
settlement of the issue through diplomacy and negotiation. 
199. Ms. MACMILLAN (New Zealand) said that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were 
key elements of her countryÂs foreign policy. New Zealand would continue to support the AgencyÂs 
key role in preventing the spread of nuclear weapons through the implementation of safeguards under 
the NPT. It had taken an active part in the discussions in May launching the preparatory process for 
the 2010 NPT Review Conference. Delegations had demonstrated a commitment to be constructive, an 
agenda for the review cycle had been agreed and there had been a good exchange of views on issues at 
the heart of the Treaty. The challenge ahead was how best to build on that substantive start to 
strengthen the Treaty and meet the challenges of the current security environment. 
200. One of the AgencyÂs key roles was to provide assurances that nuclear material was not being 
diverted from peaceful uses. To fulfil that mandate, the Director General had to have the necessary 
tools, including the additional protocol. New Zealand continued to believe that the additional protocol 
was the contemporary verification standard and should be a condition of nuclear supply. It urged those 
States that had not yet done so to conclude an additional protocol with the Agency without delay. Her 
country was also supportive of the decision to modify the SQP in order to address weaknesses in the 
current safeguards system and welcomed the AgencyÂs offer to assist small States in the 
implementation of that decision. 
201. The threat of nuclear terrorism and other malicious acts involving nuclear material remained 
real, transnational and multifaceted. New Zealand welcomed the Nuclear Security Report 2007 and 
assured the Agency of its continued support for the Nuclear Security Fund. 
202. In the area of nuclear safety, her country was committed to the principles and objectives of the 
Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the related Guidance on the 
Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
203. New Zealand welcomed the Director GeneralÂs recent report on the application of safeguards in 
the DPRK. It was pleased with the progress that had been made in the six-party talks and the working 
group process. A committed dialogue where all parties worked constructively to achieve a peaceful 
settlement offered the best possibility to ensure the peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the 
issue. Her country welcomed the AgencyÂs return to the DPRK and hoped that the progress made 
would signal the start of efforts by the DPRK to return to full compliance with its international 
obligations. The successful settlement of such a longstanding issue would be a significant 
accomplishment for international peace and security. 
204. Her country shared the international communityÂs concerns over the outstanding questions 
regarding IranÂs nuclear programme. The increased level of engagement in recent weeks between Iran 
and the Agency was encouraging and she expressed the hope that it would result in tangible progress 
in the AgencyÂs efforts to resolve the outstanding issues. Despite those positive developments, IranÂs 
failure to comply with resolutions of the Security Council and the Agency remained a cause of 
concern. She called on Iran to comply with the resolutions, in particular through the suspension of its 
enrichment and reprocessing activities. Iran would need to continue to build confidence about the 
scope and nature of its present and future nuclear programme. The additional protocol was of key 
importance in that regard and New Zealand urged Iran to take steps to ratify that instrument without 
delay.

205. Safety of transport of radioactive material continued to be of considerable significance to New 
Zealand, since shipments occasionally passed its shores. It was important to ensure that the highest 
possible safety and security standards were adhered to, that appropriate information was received in 
advance of any shipments that might take place through the Pacific, that proper emergency response 
systems were in operation, and that an effective liability and compensation mechanism was in place. 
New Zealand was pleased that progress was being made in many of those areas and urged all parties to 
continue to strive for improvements where possible. Her country appreciated the valuable role that 
INLEX had played in examining the application and scope of the AgencyÂs nuclear liability regime 
and welcomed the outreach workshops held to explain the nature and content of the international 
regime. It continued to attach importance to INLEXÂs consideration of possible gaps in the regime and 
ways in which to address any such gaps. Her country also welcomed the continued dialogue between 
coastal and shipping States on those issues, in particular on the exchange of information regarding 
shipments. 
206. As a strong supporter of the NPT, her country had accepted the principle of access to nuclear 
technology for peaceful uses, in particular the many civilian applications that were not related to 
nuclear power generation and could enhance the lives of millions of people worldwide. New Zealand 
had rejected the use of nuclear power for itself, as it did not believe it to be compatible with the 
concept of sustainable development, given the long-term financial and ecological costs associated with 
the disposal of nuclear waste. Her country was also concerned about possible associated proliferation 
risks. Any responsible discussion about nuclear power as an option should be balanced and include 
consideration of the serious risks and costs as well as of any potential benefits. New Zealand was not 
convinced that the Agency should have an increased focus on the provision of expertise and resources 
relating to nuclear power when there were many other more sustainable energy sources that could be 
developed. 
207. It was a challenging time for the nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and it was 
imperative that the international community work together to agree on and coordinate effective 
responses to meet the challenges. The Agency played a vital role in that collective response, working 
with Member States to safeguard and secure nuclear material for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
208. Ms. ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia) said that the AgencyÂs international safeguards system was an 
essential part of the global non-proliferation regime. The current verification standard should be a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement combined with an additional protocol, which would help create 
the necessary confidence for increased international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Her country had been the first to ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism which had entered into force in July 2007 and it supported all reasonable 
measures that would encourage broad adherence to the Convention and implementation of its 
provisions. 
209. Over 50% of electricity in Slovakia was generated by nuclear power plants. The shutdown in 
2006 of Unit 1 of the Bohunice V1 nuclear power plant posed a challenge to the security of energy 
supply. The Government and the energy sector were working to find economically acceptable, reliable 
and environmentally sound sources of electricity to make up the shortfall. In 2007, the countryÂs major 
energy producer had announced plans to complete two nuclear units at the Mochovce site, which 
would make a major contribution to energy security in the long term. However, the security of nuclear 
fuel supplies had to be assured if the growing demand for electricity was to be met and the countryÂs 
economic growth maintained. Her country was ready to discuss all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle 
with the international community.

210. The first constitutive conference of the European Nuclear Forum would take place in Bratislava 
in September 2007 and it was hoped the forum would create a platform for broad discussion of the use 
of nuclear power in Europe. 
211. The AgencyÂs Fundamental Safety Principles were a milestone in the development of unified 
Agency safety standards. Slovakia was ready to contribute actively to the development of subsequent 
Safety Requirements and Safety Guides in the future. She also emphasized the importance of the 
AgencyÂs international peer review services and expert services. Slovakia had invited an OSART team 
to visit the Mochovce plant in 2006, which had provided valuable safety information for both the 
operator and the regulator. The independent Nuclear Regulatory Authority of the Slovak Republic had 
declared that all nuclear installations in Slovakia were safe, reliable and operated in accordance with 
national legislation. However, that had not prompted complacency. Further steps were being taken to 
improve safety at all installations, including a modernization and improvement programme at the 
Bohunice V2 nuclear power plant. 
212. Slovakia had collaborated with the Agency in many national, regional and interregional 
technical cooperation projects. Human resources development, safety of long-term operation of 
nuclear power plants, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, emergency preparedness and nuclear 
medicine were important areas of cooperation and information exchange. Slovakia would also 
continue to provide experts and training facilities and host fellows and visiting scientists sponsored by 
the Agency. The Government had paid its contributions to the TCF in full and on time and had taken 
steps to fulfil its obligations for 2008. 
213. Mr. MSOLLA (United Republic of Tanzania) commended the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme and expressed his countryÂs gratitude for the projects it had benefited from in such areas as 
tsetse eradication, improved cancer care, radiation protection, radiation and waste safety infrastructure, 
enhanced water resources management, and the building of energy planning capabilities for 
sustainable development. There was an urgent need for continued cooperation to catalyse 
socio-economic development and alleviate poverty. 
214. His country also appreciated being included in the PACT pilot project as there was a major 
equipment and expertise deficit in his country in the area of cancer treatment. A number of 
consultative meetings had been held between Tanzanian experts, Agency experts and PACT partners 
to formulate a national cancer control and management programme. Two cobalt units had been 
received and a second cancer treatment centre was planned. He urged the acceleration of the pilot 
project so that it could be extended to other Member States. 
215. The United Republic of Tanzania had recently suffered an energy crisis owing to a drought that 
had had a very adverse impact on its power supply which was largely dependent on hydroelectric 
power. Consequently, it was keenly following the progress of the current renaissance in nuclear 
power. International efforts aimed at assuring nuclear fuel supplies were a positive development. His 
country welcomed the fact that the Agency was implementing the project on sustainable energy 
development in sub-Saharan Africa. If its objectives were achieved, participating countries would be 
empowered to make their own decisions as to whether it was appropriate, and how to integrate nuclear 
power into their energy mixes. He urged continued support in that area. 
216. His country gratefully acknowledged the AgencyÂs support for AFRA, in which it participated. 
It supported the current reorganization in the Agency Secretariat in the interests of efficiently 
supporting AFRA. It also appreciated the funding and support from the Agency and from donor 
Member States and hoped that that support would continue. 
217. He wished to place on record his countryÂs profound appreciation for the assistance that was 
being given to it and to Africa in general in the area of tsetse eradication, which had enabled Tanzania 

GC(51)/OR.4 
18 
September

Page 
31 


to fly-proof its tsetse mass rearing facility at the Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Research Institute. The 
centre had been strengthened and was now able to rear efficiently a number of species of tsetse fly. 
His country was eagerly awaiting further Agency assistance to implement a national workshop on 
grid-based sampling systems which would give it and PATTEC countries a better capability to 
formulate projects. 

218. In connection with his countryÂs efforts to improve dairy farming by artificial insemination, it 
was grateful to the Agency for enabling its national artificial insemination centre in Arusha to acquire 
a brand new liquid nitrogen plant capable of producing up to ten litres an hour. 
219. In the area of industrial applications of nuclear technology, Tanzania had received valuable 
technical assistance with the aim of strengthening NDT infrastructure and capacity. Consolidation of 
the capacity gained in human resources development, leading to international accreditation, and 
strengthening of institutional quality management systems would contribute to the poverty reduction 
programme. It was expected that his country would be developing a national programme for the 
qualification and certification of personnel in that area. There was also a need to build capacity for the 
use of nuclear techniques for quality control, troubleshooting and optimization of industrial processes. 
220. The United Republic of Tanzania appreciated the efforts being made by the international 
community to meet the challenges of nuclear weapons proliferation and the global threat of nuclear 
terrorism, and it called on all Member States to stand together, through the United Nations and the 
Agency, in meeting those challenges. However, it was also important not to lose focus on poverty 
reduction efforts in developing countries or marginalize technical cooperation activities. His country 
would do its best to meet its nuclear non-proliferation obligations in a non-discriminatory way. In that 
connection, strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the additional protocol were vital to 
efforts to reinforce the NPT. 
221. Mr. RISTORI (European Commission) said that, in the year 2007, two significant anniversaries 
were being commemorated: the fiftieth anniversary of the Agency and the fiftieth anniversary of the 
signing of the Euratom Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community. Over those fifty 
years, the importance of the role of nuclear energy in different countries had been proven, together 
with the value of work to ensure the safety and security of nuclear energy, and non-proliferation. The 
importance of cooperation between the Agency and Euratom would be emphasized in a joint political 
statement that was in the process of being prepared and should be signed in the coming months. 
222. In March 2007, the European Council had considered issues relating to energy, environment and 
climate change, and had emphasized the link between those policy areas, noting that some 80% of 
greenhouse gas emissions resulted from energy production and consumption. The key objective was to 
construct an economy in Europe that was low in emissions. Although each Member State had the right 
to choose its own energy mix, nuclear energy Â with its low carbon emissions Â could have a role to 
play. 
223. Europe possessed some of the most advanced reactors and enrichment and reprocessing 
technologies. It hoped to develop the most advanced legal framework for nuclear power, and the 
Commission had, with the full support of the European Council, created a European high-level group 
on nuclear safety and waste management. A European nuclear forum had been established with a view 
to promoting frank discussion of the benefits and risks of nuclear power. The first meeting of the 
forum would be held in Bratislava in November. 
224. Nuclear safety remained one of the major concerns within the Euratom Community. The 
European Commission fully supported all Agency initiatives promoting a global nuclear safety regime 
and continued to encourage the Member States of the European Union to ensure the highest safety 
levels in nuclear installations. Following the enlargements of the European Union, agreement had been

reached on the early closure of less reliable plants in Bulgaria, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic. In 
exchange, the countries concerned had received significant financial assistance for safe dismantling, 
waste management and the energy and human resources sectors. 

225. In the area of radiation protection, the new Euratom directive on the supervision and control of 
shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel had entered into force in December 2006. The 
Commission was also continuing with the revision of the Euratom basic safety standards and intended 
to incorporate all directives relating to radiation protection in a single piece of legislation. 
226. Nuclear safeguards were of the greatest importance to provide credible assurances of the 
non-diversion of nuclear material. The European Commission strongly supported the AgencyÂs efforts 
to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the safeguards system, and had entered 
into a dialogue with the Agency in that regard at the highest level. 
227. The issue of non-proliferation was assuming ever greater importance as more and more 
countries recognized the need to resort to nuclear energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while 
achieving economic growth. There was an obligation to assist those countries in their pursuit of 
low-carbon sources of energy while maintaining the highest levels of non-proliferation, safety and 
security. The European Commission looked forward to the development of multilateral approaches to 
the fuel cycle. The Commission would ensure that the provisions and obligations of the Euratom 
Treaty were respected by its Member States and that market competition was maintained within the 
territory of the European Community. It would contribute in a constructive manner to the debate on 
multilateral supply mechanisms and would work with the international community to establish a 
global partnership enabling countries to benefit from civil nuclear power.

Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(continued) 
(GC(51)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
EGLAJS 
(Latvia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
ongoing 
professional 
work 
to 
advance 
the 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
promote 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
foster 
disarmament 
and 
prevent 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
best 
way 
to 
maintain 
peace 
and 
stability 
was 
through 
a 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
international 
security, 
including 
the 
strengthening 
and 
full 
implementation 
of 
key 
international 
treaties 
for 
non-proliferation, 
arms 
control 
and 
disarmament. 
2. 
In 
1957 
only 
a 
limited 
number 
of 
countries 
had 
been 
able 
to 
enjoy 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
consisted 
of 
a 
relatively 
modest 
collection 
of 
projects. 
For 
example, 
in 
1960 
the 
Board 
had 
approved 
only 
28 
projects 
in 
16 
Member 
States. 
Now 
the 
programme 
covered 
over 
1000 
projects 
in 
over 
50 
fields 
of 
activity 
in 
115 
Member 
States. 
Both 
resources 
for 
and 
delivery 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
increased 
significantly 
in 
2006, 
with 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
reaching 
a 
record 
level. 
The 
rate 
of 
attainment 
had 
reached 
its 
highest 
level 
ever, 
exceeding 
93% 
by 
the 
end 
of 
the 
year. 
That 
demonstrated 
not 
only 
the 
increased 
commitment 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target, 
but 
also 
their 
interest 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
trust 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
professional 
work. 
3. 
In 
Latvia, 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
project 
to 
establish 
a 
multipurpose 
cyclotron 
centre. 
The 
Government, 
having 
approved 
the 
concept 
document, 
had 
decided 
that 
the 
project 
would 
be 
implemented 
through 
a 
public-private 
partnership. 
Latvia, 
which 
had 
gained 
a 
lot 
from 
its 
participation 
in 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
felt 
that 
the 
sharing 
of 
knowledge 
and 
experience 
provided 
great 
opportunities 
for 
all 
countries. 
4. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
international 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
Latvia 
strongly 
supported 
strengthening 
its 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2006, 
31 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
not 
yet 
fulfilled 
their 
obligation 
to 
bring 
into 
force 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
which 
meant 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
perform 
any 
verification 
measures 
in 
those 
countries. 
Latvia 
regretted 
such 
a 
situation 
and 
called 
upon 
those 
countries 
to 
bring 
their 
agreements 
into 
force. 
A 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
should 
be 
the 
verification 
standard, 
heightening 
common 
security 
and 
making 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
easier. 
5. 
The 
Agency 
had 
provided 
assistance 
to 
a 
number 
of 
Member 
States, 
including 
Latvia, 
with 
the 
repatriation 
of 
HEU 
fuel. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
help 
nuclear 
fuel 
from 
the 
former 
research 
centre 
in 
Salaspils 
had 
been 
safely 
returned 
to 
its 
country 
of 
origin, 
the 
Russian 
Federation. 
6. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
first 
CRP 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
technical 
measures 
to 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material 
had 
been 
an 
important 
milestone. 
Also, 
he 
noted 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
European 
Council 
of 
the 
third 
Joint 
Action 
in 
support 
of 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
7. 
As 
regards 
nuclear 
power, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
2006 
there 
had 
been 
435 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
operation 
worldwide, 
representing 
approximately 
370 
GW(e) 
of 
generating 
capacity 
and 
supplying 
about 
16% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
electricity. 
International 
energy 
demands 
were 
continuing 
to 
increase

rapidly, 
with 
the 
latest 
projections 
estimating 
that, 
at 
current 
consumption 
levels, 
global 
energy 
consumption 
would 
increase 
by 
53% 
by 
the 
year 
2030, 
with 
approximately 
70% 
of 
that 
growth 
coming 
from 
developing 
countries. 
With 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
announcing 
plans 
to 
build 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
full 
compliance 
with 
all 
nuclear 
safety 
standards, 
including 
those 
relating 
to 
transport 
and 
waste 
management, 
and 
to 
enhance 
emergency 
preparedness. 
Latvia 
therefore 
welcomed 
Agency 
assistance 
in 
those 
areas 
and 
urged 
it 
to 
step 
up 
its 
assistance 
in 
drafting 
relevant 
national 
standards 
and 
strengthening 
regulatory 
authorities. 
The 
publication 
of 
the 
Fundamental 
Safety 
Principles 
(Safety 
Fundamentals 
No. 
SF-1) 
had 
marked 
an 
important 
step 
forward 
and, 
in 
addition, 
the 
provision 
of 
safety 
review 
services 
and 
training 
were 
very 
helpful. 


8. 
Latvia 
underlined 
that 
greater 
attention 
should 
be 
paid 
to 
more 
systematic 
dissemination 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
enabling 
future 
generations 
to 
pursue 
R&D 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
its 
applications. 
Areas 
of 
importance 
in 
that 
regard 
included 
food 
security 
and 
human 
health, 
especially 
epidemic 
control, 
cancer 
management 
and 
improved 
child 
health. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
support 
the 
World 
Nuclear 
University 
summer 
institute, 
which 
could 
serve 
as 
a 
forum 
for 
nuclear 
leaders 
to 
share 
their 
expertise. 
Latvia 
had 
benefited 
from 
an 
Agency 
knowledge 
management 
audit 
mission 
and 
would 
use 
its 
findings, 
one 
of 
which 
was 
that 
adequate 
development 
of 
human 
resources 
was 
an 
essential 
aspect 
of 
technological 
progress, 
to 
make 
improvements. 
9. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
new 
website 
providing 
health 
professionals 
with 
information 
on 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients, 
which 
was 
yet 
another 
example 
of 
its 
successful 
and 
efficient 
work. 
Similarly, 
the 
new 
IAEA 
International 
Law 
Series 
would 
provide 
Member 
States 
with 
much 
needed 
help. 
10. 
Latvia 
was 
concerned 
about 
overlap 
in 
the 
various 
databases 
being 
developed 
within 
the 
Agency 
and 
urged 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
try 
to 
avoid 
the 
situation 
where 
Member 
States 
were 
being 
asked 
to 
submit 
essentially 
the 
same 
information 
several 
times. 
11. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
review 
its 
achievements 
and 
to 
take 
an 
objective 
look 
at 
how 
its 
action 
might 
be 
improved 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
world 
under 
circumstances 
that 
were 
very 
different 
in 
political 
and 
economic 
terms 
from 
those 
prevailing 
in 
the 
1950s. 
The 
Agency 
held 
a 
special 
position 
in 
the 
multilateral 
system 
since 
its 
mandate 
combined 
a 
security 
dimension 
and 
an 
economic 
development 
dimension. 
Egypt 
aspired 
to 
develop 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
its 
role 
in 
promoting 
security 
and 
stability 
as 
well 
as 
sustainable 
development 
in 
line 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
the 
NPT 
and 
diverse 
United 
Nations 
resolutions. 
Such 
cooperation 
included 
the 
training 
of 
Egyptian 
experts, 
experts 
from 
other 
Arab 
countries 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
and 
experts 
from 
African 
countries 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
AFRA. 
12. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
global 
trend 
towards 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
electricity 
generation 
because 
of 
the 
enormous 
contribution 
that 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
play 
in 
providing 
energy 
for 
development, 
especially 
in 
developing 
countries. 
Nuclear 
energy 
would 
also 
offset 
shortages 
in 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
reduce 
greenhouse 
gases 
that 
contributed 
to 
global 
warming. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
energy 
assessment 
services 
ensured 
that 
countriesÂ 
nuclear 
energy 
programmes 
were 
placed 
on 
a 
sound 
scientific 
basis. 
The 
SecretariatÂs 
advice 
and 
publications 
on 
best 
practices 
in 
using 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
electricity 
generation 
were 
very 
welcome, 
since 
existing 
data 
indicated 
that 
the 
application 
of 
such 
technology 
was 
limited 
in 
regions 
such 
as 
Africa 
and 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Egypt 
itself 
had 
just 
embarked 
on 
an 
important 
stage 
in 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
preparation 
of 
feasibility, 
safety 
and 
legislative 
studies 
relating 
to 
the 
nuclear 
option 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
13. 
Turning 
to 
other 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
food 
security, 
human 
health, 
especially 
child 
health 
and 
the

fight 
against 
cancer, 
and 
regional 
water 
resource 
management. 
Egypt 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
with 
UNEP 
and 
UNDP 
on 
a 
special 
project 
involving 
Chad, 
Egypt, 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
and 
Sudan 
for 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Nubian 
aquifer. 
It 
was 
also 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
cooperation 
with 
Egypt 
and 
five 
other 
Nile 
Basin 
countries 
on 
a 
joint 
water 
management 
project. 


14. 
With 
regard 
to 
nuclear 
safety, 
the 
plans 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
countries 
to 
build 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
for 
electricity 
generation 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
an 
equivalent 
increase 
in 
compliance 
with 
nuclear 
safety 
standards 
and 
criteria 
for 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
the 
safe 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste, 
as 
well 
as 
enhanced 
incident 
and 
emergency 
preparedness. 
He 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
assistance 
to 
regulatory 
authorities 
in 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre. 
15. 
As 
a 
coastal 
State 
and 
in 
view 
of 
the 
heavy 
traffic 
on 
the 
Suez 
Canal, 
Egypt 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
and 
called 
on 
all 
States, 
especially 
shipping 
countries, 
to 
comply 
with 
transport 
regulations 
and 
guidelines, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
relevant 
international 
treaties 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
liability 
legislation. 
16. 
The 
consistently 
good 
safety 
record 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
should 
not 
lead 
to 
any 
relaxation 
of 
efforts 
in 
that 
area 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
give 
increased 
attention 
to 
human 
resources 
development 
and 
the 
training 
of 
staff 
employed 
in 
research 
reactors, 
since 
most 
accidents 
were 
due 
to 
inadequate 
training. 
17. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
assess 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
waste 
from 
ageing 
reactors 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
that 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
neighbouring 
States. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
periodic 
nuclear 
safety 
reports 
should 
address 
that 
issue 
and 
appropriate 
measures 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
threat. 
18. 
Turning 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
a 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
increase 
in 
the 
average 
rate 
of 
attainment 
to 
93%, 
the 
increase 
in 
NPCs 
to 
74%, 
the 
increase 
of 
some 
10% 
in 
new 
financial 
resources 
and 
the 
increase 
in 
in-kind 
contributions. 
He 
noted 
that 
health 
projects 
continued 
to 
account 
for 
the 
bulk 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
funds, 
followed 
by 
nuclear 
science, 
and 
food 
and 
agriculture. 
He 
reiterated 
the 
need 
for 
a 
special 
effort 
to 
increase 
such 
funds 
so 
that 
they 
kept 
pace 
with 
the 
growing 
requirements 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
with 
the 
continual 
increase 
in 
funds 
allocated 
to 
other 
Agency 
activities. 
The 
discrepancy 
in 
the 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
safeguards, 
despite 
their 
equal 
standing 
as 
two 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
three 
pillars, 
was 
highly 
questionable, 
especially 
since 
developing 
countries 
were 
required 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
funding 
of 
their 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
19. 
Egypt 
was 
concerned 
about 
the 
continued 
imbalance 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
could 
not 
be 
applied 
to 
States 
that 
had 
not 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
that 
no 
new 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
monitor 
the 
five 
nuclear-weapon 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
nuclear 
disarmament 
obligations 
under 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Treaty. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
publish 
a 
Safeguards 
Statement 
that 
was 
objective 
and 
balanced 
and 
that 
reflected 
the 
true 
global 
situation 
by 
referring 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inability 
of 
reach 
any 
conclusions 
regarding 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
installations 
to 
which 
no 
safeguards 
were 
applied 
in 
the 
three 
States 
that 
applied 
partial 
INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
five 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
applied 
voluntary 
offer 
agreements. 
20. 
Referring 
to 
the 
continued 
calls 
for 
the 
universalization 
of 
additional 
protocols, 
he 
emphasized 
that 
such 
protocols 
were 
a 
voluntary 
tool 
and 
no 
attempt 
should 
be 
made 
to 
universalize 
them 
until 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
were 
universalized. 
The 
conclusion 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol 
was 
a 
sovereign 
decision 
to 
be 
made 
by 
States 
in 
the 
light 
of 
their 
interests 
and 
commitments.

21. 
With 
regard 
to 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
look 
seriously 
at 
all 
political, 
legal 
and 
economic 
aspects 
of 
such 
initiatives 
before 
submitting 
them 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Any 
such 
initiative 
should 
take 
into 
account 
all 
StatesÂ 
rights 
to 
develop 
their 
nuclear 
capabilities 
independently 
provided 
that 
they 
complied 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
undertook 
to 
apply 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
The 
countries 
that 
developed 
the 
initiatives 
should 
avoid 
attaching 
conditions 
to 
them 
that 
violated 
the 
NPT. 
It 
was 
also 
important 
to 
address 
commercial 
and 
economic 
impediments 
stemming 
from 
the 
cost 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
so 
that 
any 
such 
initiative 
resulted 
in 
a 
balanced 
mechanism 
and 
did 
not 
become 
yet 
another 
means 
of 
discriminating 
among 
Member 
States. 
There 
should 
also 
be 
sufficient 
safeguards 
to 
ensure 
that 
assistance 
in 
obtaining 
nuclear 
fuel 
was 
not 
provided 
to 
States 
that 
were 
not 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT. 
22. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
diminishing 
role 
in 
supporting 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
one 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Medium-Term 
Strategy 
for 
2006-2011 
was 
to 
contribute 
as 
appropriate 
to 
effective 
verification 
of 
nuclear 
arms 
control 
and 
reduction 
agreements, 
was 
discouraging. 
He 
urged 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
Member 
States 
to 
take 
serious 
steps 
to 
meet 
that 
objective, 
which 
was 
based 
on 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
Statute. 
23. 
Fifteen 
years 
had 
passed 
since 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
a 
resolution 
calling 
on 
all 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
apply 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
Israel 
had 
taken 
no 
steps 
to 
comply 
with 
that 
provision 
and 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
had 
failed 
to 
react 
to 
its 
non-compliance, 
although 
Egypt 
and 
all 
other 
States 
in 
the 
region 
were 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
applied 
safeguards. 
That 
anomaly 
threatened 
to 
undermine 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
conferred 
a 
measure 
of 
legitimacy 
on 
the 
launching 
of 
an 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region, 
which 
was 
absolutely 
unacceptable. 
The 
Conference 
should 
therefore 
address 
the 
nuclear 
threat 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
by 
adopting 
the 
draft 
resolutions 
submitted 
under 
the 
relevant 
agenda 
items. 
Egypt 
was 
sponsoring 
the 
traditional 
draft 
resolution 
that 
the 
Conference 
had 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
until 
the 
preceding 
session, 
when 
the 
consensus 
had 
been 
broken 
for 
reasons 
that 
were 
not 
objective 
since 
they 
sought 
to 
link 
the 
draft 
resolution 
to 
legitimate 
Arab 
efforts 
to 
adopt 
a 
resolution 
concerning 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat. 
At 
the 
current 
session 
Egypt 
had 
included 
consensus 
language 
in 
the 
text 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
taken 
from 
the 
resolution 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly 
at 
its 
sixty-first 
session 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
return 
to 
the 
previous 
consensus 
on 
the 
item 
and 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
cooperate 
in 
establishing 
an 
NWFZ. 
Peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
without 
a 
strong 
international 
commitment 
to 
establish 
a 
new 
security 
regime 
based 
on 
equilibrium 
and 
mutual 
security 
safeguards, 
including 
first 
and 
foremost 
the 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Adoption 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
by 
consensus 
would 
attest 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
commitment 
to 
its 
declared 
principles 
and 
positions 
regarding 
the 
achievement 
of 
peace, 
stability 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
24. 
Mr. 
MOVSISSYAN 
(Armenia) 
said 
that 
the 
increased 
interest 
in 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
option 
could 
be 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
existing 
fragile 
balance 
of 
international 
security, 
so 
more 
importance 
should 
be 
given 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
safeguards 
through 
international 
agreements 
and 
national 
legislation. 
For 
its 
part, 
Armenia 
was 
strengthening 
its 
domestic 
legislation 
and 
making 
sincere 
efforts 
to 
comply 
with 
its 
international 
commitments, 
including 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Like 
other 
countries, 
Armenia 
had 
its 
own 
strategic 
energy 
development 
plan, 
one 
of 
whose 
key 
elements 
was 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
countryÂs 
leadership 
had 
taken 
the 
political 
decision 
to 
build 
a 
new 
1000 
MW 
unit, 
which 
would 
be 
of 
regional 
importance. 
25. 
Armenia 
had 
been 
producing 
nuclear 
energy 
since 
1976 
and 
had 
spent 
more 
than 
$80 
million 
on 
safety 
improvements 
since 
1995. 
Although 
a 
plan 
was 
already 
under 
way 
to 
decommission 
its 
power 
station 
in 
2016, 
the 
Government 
intended 
to 
spend 
at 
least 
another 
$40 
million 
in 
upgrading 
its 
technical 
and 
operational 
safety 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
recommendations 
of 
TECDOC-640. 
The 
power 
stationÂs 
seismic 
stability 
had 
been 
reappraised 
with 
the 
help 
of 
international 
experts 
and 
found 

GC(51)/OR.5

to 
be 
up 
to 
standard. 
In 
selecting 
the 
model 
for 
the 
new 
1000 
MW 
unit, 
consideration 
was 
being 
given 
to 
safety, 
seismic 
stability, 
and 
economic 
and 
financial 
factors. 
A 
protocol 
had 
been 
signed 
in 
2007 
between 
the 
Government 
of 
Armenia 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federal 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency 
(Rosatom) 
under 
which 
the 
Russian 
side 
would 
carry 
out 
surveys 
on 
Armenian 
territory. 


26. 
In 
2005, 
his 
Government 
had 
taken 
a 
decision 
to 
expand 
the 
countryÂs 
dry 
spent 
fuel 
storage 
facility, 
and 
a 
further 
24 
modules 
would 
be 
built 
by 
2050. 
A 
Government 
decree 
of 
2006 
regulated 
the 
detection, 
storage 
and 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials 
and 
the 
procedure 
for 
issuing 
licences 
for 
their 
use. 
27. 
There 
had 
been 
significant 
improvements 
in 
the 
Armenian 
system 
of 
safety 
controls 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
legislation 
and 
improving 
the 
qualifications 
of 
personnel 
and 
renewing 
equipment. 
On 
15 
March 
2007, 
the 
Armenian 
National 
Regulatory 
Agency 
had 
signed 
an 
agreement 
with 
the 
United 
States 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Commission 
on 
the 
exchange 
of 
technical 
information 
and 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
matters. 
That 
agreement 
provided 
for 
collaboration 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
expert 
assistance, 
staff 
training, 
emergency 
training, 
and 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
28. 
Finally, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
Secretariat 
for 
the 
various 
meetings 
it 
had 
organized 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
of 
ArmeniaÂs 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
and 
for 
the 
series 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
from 
which 
his 
country 
had 
benefited. 
He 
also 
expressed 
thanks 
to 
donor 
countries 
and 
partners 
for 
their 
continued 
help, 
and 
gave 
an 
assurance 
that 
Armenia 
intended 
to 
fulfil 
all 
the 
international 
commitments 
it 
had 
undertaken 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
29. 
Mr. 
KAKODKAR 
(India) 
said 
that, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary, 
it 
was 
gratifying 
to 
recognize 
the 
unique 
place 
that 
the 
Agency 
held 
within 
the 
United 
Nations 
System. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
current 
prestige, 
credibility 
and 
authority 
were 
due 
to 
the 
consistent 
good 
work 
of 
its 
Secretariat, 
under 
the 
wise 
leadership 
of 
the 
Director 
General, 
especially 
over 
the 
preceding 
critical 
decade. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
the 
preceding 
fifty 
years 
had 
contributed 
towards 
rekindled 
hopes 
for 
the 
peaceful 
atom 
in 
coming 
years. 
30. 
The 
world 
was 
on 
the 
threshold 
of 
a 
paradigm 
shift. 
There 
was 
greater 
awareness 
than 
ever 
of 
the 
serious 
consequences 
to 
humanity 
arising 
from 
the 
threat 
of 
global 
warming. 
That 
situation 
had 
been 
caused 
by 
the 
unmindful 
and 
unsustainable 
use 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
by 
a 
small 
fraction 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
population 
in 
industrially 
advanced 
societies. 
More 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
population 
was 
now 
on 
a 
rapid 
economic 
development 
path. 
Enormous 
energy 
resources 
would 
be 
required 
to 
bridge 
the 
deficit 
between 
emerging 
demand 
and 
current 
supply, 
which 
was 
very 
low 
in 
the 
developing 
world. 
Meeting 
the 
development 
aspirations 
of 
those 
large 
populations 
would 
raise 
serious 
energy 
sustainability 
issues 
and, 
inevitably, 
fuel 
prices 
would 
escalate, 
affecting 
everyone. 
Nuclear 
energy 
had 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
that 
context. 
It 
offered 
a 
powerful 
energy 
potential 
and, 
because 
of 
its 
non-emission 
of 
greenhouse 
gases, 
was 
now 
appealing 
to 
those 
who 
had 
previously 
opposed 
it. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
nuclear 
energy 
induced 
a 
fear 
of 
the 
unknown. 
That 
was 
a 
natural 
reaction 
experienced 
by 
humankind 
whenever 
a 
paradigm 
shift 
took 
place, 
for 
example 
when 
advancing 
from 
horse-drawn 
carriages 
to 
locomotives 
and 
automobiles. 
However, 
humankind 
always 
overcame 
its 
fear 
and 
learned 
to 
access 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
new 
technology. 
Nuclear 
energy, 
however, 
registered 
on 
a 
different 
scale. 
Society 
had 
to 
evolve 
so 
that 
it 
could 
benefit 
from 
it 
as 
an 
energy 
source 
without 
risking 
its 
misuse. 
31. 
With 
a 
growing 
population 
of 
over 
1 
billion, 
a 
$1 
trillion 
economy 
and 
GNP 
growth 
of 
over 
8%, 
India 
required 
an 
enormous 
and 
reliable 
energy 
supply. 
Its 
estimated 
need 
was 
around 
7000 
TWÂ·h 
electricity 
annually, 
with 
additional 
primary 
energy 
needed 
to 
replace 
the 
use 
of 
fossil 
fuels. 
Ensuring 
such 
a 
large 
energy 
supply 
was 
a 
major 
challenge, 
and 
India 
was 
fully 
conscious 
of 
the 
associated 
environmental 
impact. 
At 
the 
G8 
summit 
in 
Heiligendamm 
earlier 
that 
year, 
IndiaÂs 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
pointed 
out 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions 
were 
among 
the 
lowest 
per 
capita 
and, 
as 

GC(51)/OR.5 
19 
September 
2007, 
Page 
6 


they 
constituted 
only 
4% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
emissions, 
any 
action 
taken 
to 
reduce 
them 
would 
have 
a 
marginal 
effect. 
He 
had 
said 
that 
India 
recognized 
its 
responsibilities 
as 
a 
developing 
country 
and 
intended 
to 
engage 
constructively 
with 
the 
international 
community 
to 
add 
its 
weight 
to 
global 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
the 
environment. 
He 
had 
expressed 
IndiaÂs 
determination 
that 
its 
per 
capita 
greenhouse 
emissions 
should 
not 
exceed 
those 
of 
developed 
countries, 
even 
though 
it 
was 
pursuing 
policies 
of 
development 
and 
economic 
growth. 
He 
had 
also 
underlined 
the 
need 
to 
work 
together 
to 
find 
pragmatic 
solutions 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
humankind. 


32. 
Construction 
was 
well 
under 
way 
for 
six 
more 
reactors 
in 
India: 
three 
PHWRs, 
two 
LWRs 
and 
a 
500 
MW(e) 
prototype 
fast 
breeder 
reactor. 
Fuel 
loading 
would 
begin 
at 
two 
of 
those 
reactors 
later 
that 
year. 
Once 
the 
construction 
of 
those 
six 
reactors 
was 
complete, 
there 
would 
be 
23 
reactors 
in 
operation 
with 
an 
installed 
capacity 
of 
7280 
MW(e). 
Progress 
was 
being 
made 
in 
the 
detailed 
design 
and 
engineering 
of 
the 
indigenous 
700 
MW(e) 
PHWR 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
set 
time 
schedule. 
The 
Government 
had 
approved 
in 
principle 
the 
construction 
of 
four 
700 
MW(e) 
PHWRs 
at 
two 
sites 
and 
four 
1000 
MW(e) 
LWRs 
at 
a 
further 
two 
sites 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
had 
also 
approved 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
uranium 
mine 
and 
mill 
at 
Tummalapalle. 
33. 
To 
accelerate 
the 
growth 
of 
fast 
reactors 
in 
the 
country, 
metallic 
fuel 
with 
high 
breeding 
capabilities 
was 
being 
developed 
as 
a 
priority 
with 
a 
view 
to 
its 
use 
around 
the 
year 
2020. 
However 
the 
four 
fast 
reactors 
which 
were 
planned 
to 
be 
commissioned 
by 
2020, 
after 
the 
prototype 
fast 
breeder 
reactor, 
would 
continue 
to 
use 
oxide 
fuel. 
Refinements 
would 
be 
incorporated 
into 
the 
design 
and 
construction 
of 
those 
reactors 
based 
on 
experience 
with 
the 
prototype 
fast 
breeder 
reactor. 
The 
objective 
was 
a 
substantial 
decrease 
in 
the 
energy 
cost 
per 
unit 
compared 
with 
the 
prototype 
fast 
breeder 
reactor. 
Improving 
fuel 
burnup 
from 
100 
to 
200 
GWÂ·d/t 
would 
also 
help 
significantly 
in 
reducing 
fuel 
cycle 
costs. 
34. 
India 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
international 
civil 
nuclear 
cooperation, 
which 
it 
expected 
to 
be 
sustainable, 
free 
from 
interruptions 
and 
consistent 
with 
the 
countryÂs 
closed 
fuel 
cycle 
policy. 
To 
increase 
significantly 
IndiaÂs 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
capacity 
in 
the 
short 
term 
through 
imports, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
indigenous 
programme, 
a 
site 
selection 
committee 
had 
evaluated 
coastal 
sites 
in 
the 
country 
where 
reactors 
could 
be 
set 
up 
in 
convoy 
mode. 
Another 
initiative 
involved 
the 
possibility 
of 
exporting 
reactors 
and 
services. 
India 
was 
the 
only 
country 
to 
have 
the 
technology, 
design 
and 
infrastructure 
required 
for 
small 
PHWRs 
with 
a 
unit 
capacity 
of 
220 
MW(e). 
That 
offered 
great 
export 
potential, 
particularly 
to 
countries 
with 
small 
grids 
hoping 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power 
with 
relatively 
modest 
investments 
and 
infrastructure. 
Given 
its 
large 
manufacturing 
base 
and 
relatively 
low 
manufacturing 
costs, 
there 
was 
also 
potential 
for 
India 
to 
become 
a 
centre 
for 
the 
manufacture 
of 
equipment 
and 
components 
for 
the 
global 
nuclear 
industry. 
35. 
India 
had 
been 
interacting 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
as 
partners 
in 
development. 
India, 
one 
of 
the 
founder 
members 
and 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
INPRO, 
had 
noted 
with 
great 
satisfaction 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
that 
important 
Agency 
activity. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
step 
under 
Phase-II 
of 
INPRO 
to 
initiate 
several 
collaborative 
projects, 
which 
could 
help 
in 
the 
search 
for 
cost-effective 
solutions 
for 
the 
global 
deployment 
of 
next-generation 
advanced 
nuclear 
energy 
systems. 
INPRO 
had 
immense 
potential 
to 
improve 
the 
global 
availability 
of 
safe 
and 
economical 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
meet 
future 
demands, 
but 
needed 
full 
budgetary 
support 
to 
realize 
that 
potential. 
36. 
The 
global 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
seemed 
both 
necessary 
and 
likely, 
but 
it 
rested 
on 
a 
very 
fragile 
foundation. 
Firm 
partnerships 
needed 
to 
be 
built 
on 
an 
objective, 
reliable 
and 
predictable 
basis, 
with 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
trust. 
There 
was 
also 
a 
need 
to 
recycle 
fuel 
in 
order 
to 
maximize 
energy 
availability. 
The 
entire 
international 
community 
was 
justifiably 
concerned 
about 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
safety, 
the 
environment 
and 
proliferation 
arising 
from 
the 
irresponsible 
behaviour 
of 
State 
and 
non-State 
actors. 
Of 
even 
greater 
concern 
was 
the 
vastly 
increased 
risk 
to 
future 
generations

caused 
by 
the 
radioactive 
decay 
of 
disposed 
spent 
fuel 
containing 
plutonium. 
Risks 
and 
challenges 
did 
exist, 
but 
they 
were 
within 
the 
professional 
competence 
of 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
community. 
The 
answer 
could 
lie 
in 
a 
judicious 
combination 
of 
technological 
and 
institutional 
control, 
with 
every 
responsible 
partner 
being 
a 
part 
of 
the 
solution, 
rather 
than 
being 
seen 
as 
a 
problem. 


37. 
Mr. 
LE 
DINH 
Tien 
(Vietnam) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
a 
vital 
resource 
for 
the 
development 
of 
national 
capabilities 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
Vietnam 
had 
always 
worked 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
implement 
the 
programme 
in 
the 
most 
effective 
manner. 
In 
the 
2006Â2007 
cycle, 
Vietnam 
had 
been 
carrying 
out 
18 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
including 
4 
which 
were 
new 
and 
2 
which 
had 
been 
extended 
to 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle. 
A 
national 
programme 
for 
cancer 
therapy 
had 
been 
formulated 
and 
approved 
for 
active 
and 
effective 
participation 
in 
the 
PACT. 
His 
delegation 
expressed 
its 
appreciation 
to 
India 
for 
providing 
Vietnam 
with 
a 
Bhabhatron 
II 
teletherapy 
unit 
under 
PACT. 
Vietnam 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
68 
regional 
and 
interregional 
projects. 
Cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Vietnam 
had 
been 
fruitful 
and 
cost-effective 
in 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
human 
resources, 
the 
enhancement 
of 
national 
technical 
infrastructures 
for 
nuclear 
applications, 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas, 
such 
as 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
rice 
mutant 
varieties, 
food 
preservation, 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine, 
the 
production 
of 
radiopharmaceuticals, 
groundwater 
management, 
oil 
and 
gas 
prospecting 
and 
exploitation, 
the 
formulation 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
legislation 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
country. 
38. 
Vietnam 
had 
made 
remarkable 
progress 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Important 
regulatory 
documents 
had 
been 
issued 
on 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
the 
recovery 
and 
handling 
of 
orphan 
sources, 
and 
guidance 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
decree 
on 
administrative 
sanctions 
in 
connection 
with 
radiation 
safety 
and 
control. 
Draft 
regulations 
on 
export 
and 
import 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
were 
scheduled 
to 
be 
issued 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2007 
in 
keeping 
with 
VietnamÂs 
commitment 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
The 
implementing 
capability 
of 
the 
Vietnamese 
nuclear 
regulatory 
body 
had 
been 
substantially 
enhanced 
over 
the 
past 
year 
thanks 
to 
more 
experienced 
staff, 
training 
courses, 
funding 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
advanced 
technical 
equipment. 
39. 
On 
23 
July 
2007, 
his 
Government 
had 
approved 
a 
master 
plan 
for 
a 
strategy 
on 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
until 
2020. 
Under 
the 
plan, 
5 
groups 
of 
issues 
with 
23 
specific 
projects 
had 
been 
identified 
for 
implementation 
with 
a 
view 
to 
promoting, 
enlarging 
and 
developing 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
various 
social 
and 
economic 
sectors 
in 
a 
safe, 
secure 
and 
cost-effective 
manner 
in 
support 
of 
sustainable 
development 
in 
the 
country. 
They 
included 
the 
expansion 
of 
radiation 
and 
radioisotope 
applications 
in 
health 
care, 
agriculture, 
industry, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
40. 
The 
final 
draft 
of 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
legislation 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
submitted 
to 
the 
standing 
committee 
of 
the 
National 
Assembly 
for 
consideration 
and 
was 
scheduled 
to 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
National 
Assembly 
for 
adoption 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2008. 
41. 
In 
August 
of 
2007 
Vietnam 
had 
signed 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
was 
actively 
preparing 
the 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
ratification. 
That 
testified 
to 
its 
policy 
of 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only. 
His 
Government 
was 
studying 
other 
nuclear 
related 
international 
conventions 
and 
treaties 
with 
a 
view 
to 
future 
accession 
once 
the 
requisite 
conditions 
had 
been 
met. 
42. 
Vietnam 
had 
also 
cooperated 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
in 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
Da 
Lat 
nuclear 
research 
reactor 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU 
fuel.

43. 
His 
delegation 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
visit 
to 
Vietnam 
in 
December 
2006 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
and 
enhancing 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
44. 
Vietnam 
had 
fulfilled 
its 
obligations 
and 
commitments 
to 
the 
Agency, 
including 
the 
provision 
of 
the 
requisite 
resources 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
the 
payment 
of 
its 
NPCs 
for 
the 
2006-2007 
cycle, 
its 
assessed 
contribution 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
its 
pledged 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007. 
It 
had 
also 
worked 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
host 
8 
IAEA/RCA 
workshops 
and 
training 
courses. 
45. 
Expressing 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
gratitude 
for 
the 
close 
cooperation 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
extended 
to 
Vietnam 
over 
the 
past 
few 
years, 
he 
said 
it 
would 
like 
to 
continue 
receiving 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency, 
other 
concerned 
international 
organizations 
and 
all 
Member 
States, 
in 
particular 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
country. 
He 
reaffirmed 
VietnamÂs 
full 
support 
for 
Agency 
activities 
aimed 
at 
promoting 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
for 
a 
world 
of 
peace, 
stability, 
cooperation 
and 
development. 
46. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary 
was 
an 
appropriate 
occasion 
to 
acknowledge 
the 
important 
role 
that 
it 
had 
played 
for 
half 
a 
century 
in 
promoting 
peace 
and 
development. 
47. 
Cuba 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries 
and 
north-south 
cooperation 
and 
was 
participating 
actively 
in 
ARCAL. 
The 
action 
plan 
to 
create 
a 
strategic 
alliance 
between 
ARCAL 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
successful, 
its 
first 
achievement 
being 
the 
elaboration 
of 
a 
strategic 
regional 
framework 
for 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
which 
had 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
the 
regional 
project 
concepts 
for 
the 
2009Â2011 
triennium. 
Cuba 
was 
also 
participating 
actively 
in 
a 
number 
of 
CRPs. 
48. 
Regrettably, 
in 
clear 
contravention 
of 
the 
principles 
governing 
multilateralism 
and 
international 
relations, 
the 
illegal 
blockade 
that 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
had 
imposed 
on 
Cuba 
for 
over 
forty 
years 
affected 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
with 
her 
country. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
that 
destructive 
policy 
had 
meant 
that 
North 
American 
companies 
had 
refused 
to 
sell 
to 
the 
Agency 
equipment 
destined 
for 
Cuba 
and 
visas 
had 
been 
denied 
for 
Cuban 
specialists 
to 
participate 
in 
Agency 
meetings 
held 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Cuba 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
seek 
alternatives 
to 
overcome 
those 
problems. 
Article 
III.C 
of 
the 
Statute 
stipulated 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
not 
make 
assistance 
to 
members 
subject 
to 
any 
political, 
economic, 
military, 
or 
other 
conditions 
incompatible 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Statute. 
Thus, 
Cuba 
rejected 
the 
political 
and 
manipulative 
use 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
and, 
in 
that 
connection, 
denounced 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1737 
imposing 
sanctions 
on 
Iran. 
49. 
Cuba 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
2006 
related 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
safety 
and 
was 
grateful 
for 
its 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
infrastructures 
to 
deal 
with 
radiological 
emergencies. 
Cuba 
would 
continue 
to 
contribute 
towards 
that 
objective 
by, 
amongst 
other 
things, 
providing 
experts. 
For 
17 
years, 
Cuba 
had 
been 
implementing 
a 
health 
programme 
to 
look 
after 
children 
from 
the 
areas 
affected 
by 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident. 
Under 
that 
programme, 
23 
000 
patients 
had 
been 
treated, 
principally 
from 
Ukraine, 
Russia 
and 
Belarus. 
The 
Cuban 
specialists 
involved 
had 
accumulated 
vast 
experience 
in 
treating 
such 
patients, 
which 
Cuba 
would 
continue 
sharing 
with 
other 
countries. 
50. 
Cuba 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
seek 
viable 
and 
sustainable 
energy 
alternatives, 
in 
particular 
those 
directed 
at 
creating 
capabilities 
and 
maintaining 
nuclear 
knowledge 
for 
sustainable 
energy 
development. 
As 
regards 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
promote 
analysis 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
assurance, 
she 
underlined 
that 
all 
proposals 
in 
that 
regard 
should 
be 
considered, 
that 
the 
analysis 
should 
be 
transparent 
and 
that 
decisions 
should 
be 
by 
consensus. 
Cuba 
rejected 
any 
attempt 
to 
use 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
as 
a 
means 
of 
discriminatory 
political 
or 
economic 
coercion 
or 
as 
a 
monopolistic

mechanism 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
a 
few. 
Cuba 
objected 
strongly 
to 
the 
use 
of 
that 
resource 
as 
a 
condition 
to 
impose 
new 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
on 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
Rather, 
it 
was 
up 
to 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
to 
eliminate, 
in 
a 
complete, 
unconditional 
and 
verifiable 
manner, 
their 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
That 
was 
a 
necessity 
that 
could 
not 
be 
delayed 
and 
the 
only 
way 
to 
ensure 
non-proliferation. 
The 
Cuban 
GovernmentÂs 
position 
on 
disarmament 
was 
reflected 
in 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
14th 
NAM 
Summit 
Conference 
held 
in 
Havana 
in 
September 
2006. 


51. 
Cuba 
supported 
the 
declaration 
of 
the 
NAM 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
on 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue, 
which 
emphasized 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
As 
a 
State 
that 
favoured 
peace 
and 
negotiation 
in 
resolving 
all 
international 
affairs, 
Cuba 
was 
convinced 
that 
the 
only 
way 
to 
find 
a 
solution 
to 
that 
issue 
was 
through 
unconditional 
dialogue 
based 
on 
equality 
and 
mutual 
respect. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Cuba 
supported 
the 
agreement 
reached 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
issues. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
sole 
competent 
authority 
to 
verify 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
obligations 
and 
Cuba 
opposed 
any 
undue 
attempt 
to 
apply 
pressure 
or 
interfere 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
especially 
in 
its 
verification 
process, 
that 
could 
jeopardize 
its 
efficiency 
and 
credibility. 
The 
matter 
should 
never 
have 
been 
referred 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
should 
be 
returned 
to 
its 
proper 
arena. 
Cuba 
strongly 
supported 
the 
steps 
taken 
by 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
promote 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
Iran 
issue. 
52. 
On 
another 
matter, 
Cuba 
welcomed 
the 
agreements 
reached 
for 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
essential 
role 
in 
their 
implementation 
was 
recognized 
by 
all. 
53. 
Cuba 
supported 
the 
prompt 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
For 
that 
to 
be 
achieved, 
Israel 
had 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay, 
submit 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
to 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
implement 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Furthermore, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
should 
stop 
its 
transfer 
to 
Israel 
of 
nuclear 
equipment, 
information, 
material, 
facilities, 
resources 
and 
devices, 
and 
its 
assistance 
to 
that 
country 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
That 
was 
imperative 
following 
the 
declarations 
of 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
of 
12 
December 
2006. 
54. 
The 
world 
was 
unstable, 
mainly 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
certain 
StatesÂ 
policies. 
Those 
policies 
led 
to, 
inter 
alia, 
environmental 
degradation, 
global 
warming, 
increased 
economic 
and 
social 
underdevelopment 
and 
a 
growing 
gap 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
on 
the 
macroeconomic 
level. 
Sadly, 
with 
the 
vertical 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
arsenals 
and 
the 
application 
of 
new 
and 
irresponsible 
belligerent 
policies, 
that 
scenario 
was 
worsening 
and 
must 
not 
continue. 
The 
survival 
of 
humankind 
was 
at 
stake. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
for 
reflection 
and 
to 
make 
a 
real 
commitment 
to 
development, 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
world 
peace. 
55. 
Mr. 
RUSHITI 
(The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
concluded 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material 
and 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
Those 
crucial 
instruments 
were 
milestones 
in 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
facilities 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
He 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
ratify 
those 
instruments 
without 
delay. 
Efforts 
to 
secure 
negotiated 
peaceful 
solutions 
to 
pressing 
problems 
should 
also 
be 
pursued 
further. 
56. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
give 
priority 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
assistance 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
national 
projects, 
particularly 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Division 
for 
Europe 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation. 
Thanks 
to 
those 
joint 
efforts, 
95% 
of 
the 
current 
project 
cycle 
had 
been 
completed.

57. 
Continuing 
efforts 
had 
been 
made 
to 
strengthen 
the 
capacities 
of 
the 
Macedonian 
Radiation 
Safety 
Directorate. 
The 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs 
had 
provided 
valuable 
assistance 
in 
amending 
national 
legislation 
and 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
had 
helped 
build 
the 
technical 
capacities 
of 
that 
regulatory 
authority. 
58. 
The 
proposals 
submitted 
for 
the 
2009Â2011 
project 
cycle 
were 
based 
on 
an 
evaluation 
conducted 
jointly 
with 
the 
Agency. 
The 
projects 
were 
in 
full 
compliance 
with 
his 
countryÂs 
CPF 
and 
focused 
on 
health, 
the 
environment, 
capacity 
building 
and 
knowledge 
management. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
new 
simplified 
planning 
process 
using 
the 
PCMF 
had 
proved 
useful 
in 
that 
regard. 
59. 
The 
medical 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
were 
crucial 
to 
improving 
human 
health. 
His 
Government 
had 
therefore 
decided 
to 
proceed 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
positron 
emission 
tomography 
(PET) 
centre 
and 
had 
allocated 
the 
necessary 
resources. 
It 
nevertheless 
relied 
on 
the 
Agency 
for 
expertise 
and 
training. 
60. 
Notwithstanding 
budgetary 
restraints, 
his 
Government 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
and 
intended 
to 
meet 
its 
NPC 
obligations, 
thus 
proving 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
The 
General 
Conference 
was 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
to 
reaffirm 
the 
countryÂs 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
regional 
cooperation. 
Macedonian 
institutions 
were 
ready 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
regional 
projects 
for 
the 
new 
project 
cycle. 
A 
growing 
number 
of 
foreigners 
were 
participating 
in 
training 
programmes 
run 
by 
Macedonian 
institutions, 
which, 
based 
on 
the 
results 
achieved 
by 
their 
projects, 
had 
been 
declared 
centres 
of 
excellence. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
engage 
actively 
in 
efforts 
to 
promote 
coordinated 
and 
effective 
regional 
cooperation. 
61. 
Ms. 
TCHUINTE 
(Cameroon) 
underlined 
her 
countryÂs 
support 
for 
general 
and 
complete 
disarmament, 
including 
the 
elimination 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
had 
signed 
the 
relevant 
international 
instruments 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
African 
NWFZ 
under 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
Cameroon 
also 
supported 
the 
revision 
to 
the 
SQPs. 
Cameroon 
endorsed 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
efforts 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
use 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
or 
radiological 
dispersion 
devices. 
However, 
it 
should 
always 
be 
borne 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
removal 
of 
insecurity 
could 
not 
be 
effective 
in 
a 
world 
where 
there 
were 
widening 
gaps 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
countries 
and 
between 
cultures 
and 
civilizations. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
non-proliferation 
should 
not 
be 
used 
by 
nuclear 
powers 
as 
an 
excuse 
for 
not 
fulfilling 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT, 
or 
for 
depriving 
States 
which 
had 
renounced 
the 
nuclear 
military 
option 
of 
their 
legitimate 
right 
under 
the 
NPT 
to 
enjoy 
free 
access 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
efforts 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament 
should 
not 
overshadow 
any 
aspect 
of 
proliferation, 
whether 
horizontal 
or 
vertical, 
or 
lead 
to 
the 
one 
being 
regarded 
as 
more 
dangerous 
than 
the 
other. 
CameroonÂs 
hope 
was 
for 
non-discriminatory 
application 
of 
the 
three 
basic 
principles 
of 
the 
NPT, 
namely 
disarmament, 
verification 
and 
free 
access 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications. 
62. 
Cameroon 
expressed 
its 
appreciation 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
increasing 
assistance 
in 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
and 
reiterated 
its 
commitment 
to 
participate 
fully 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
assistance 
given 
to 
Cameroon 
through 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
in 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
areas, 
including 
human 
health, 
water 
resource 
management, 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
and 
radiation 
protection, 
had 
enabled 
her 
country 
to 
develop 
its 
technical 
capacities 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
Cameroon 
appealed 
to 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
increased 
support 
to 
AFRA, 
which 
over 
the 
years 
had 
become 
the 
main 
engine 
for 
the 
development 
for 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
in 
Africa. 
63. 
Cameroon 
was 
following 
with 
interest 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
relation 
to 
energy 
planning, 
HIV/AIDS, 
drug 
resistance 
in 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis,

protection 
and

knowledge 
management 
and 
intended 
to 
collaborate 
to 
the 
extent 
possible. 
The 
fact 
that 
its 
national 
radiation 
protection 
agency 
was 
now 
operational 
had 
brought 
a 
new 
dimension 
to 
CameroonÂs 
scientific 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
her 
country 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
an 
active 
part 
in 
helping 
it 
to 
achieve 
its 
objective 
of 
establishing 
a 
competent 
and 
effective 
national 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure. 


64. 
The 
Agency 
was 
having 
to 
face 
new 
challenges 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
increasing 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
by 
the 
need 
to 
ensure 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Cameroon 
was 
certain 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
overcome 
all 
the 
difficulties 
it 
confronted, 
and 
would 
be 
victorious 
in 
its 
pursuit 
of 
its 
peaceful 
mission 
for 
the 
good 
of 
humankind. 
65. 
Ms. 
DAMIBA 
(Burkina 
Faso) 
said 
that 
the 
51st 
General 
Conference 
was 
taking 
place 
in 
a 
context 
of 
growing 
insecurity 
around 
the 
world 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
threat 
of 
terrorism. 
Today 
more 
than 
ever, 
the 
Agency 
must 
take 
that 
new 
challenge 
into 
account 
in 
its 
strategies, 
and 
it 
must 
be 
able 
to 
rely 
on 
the 
support 
of 
all 
its 
Member 
States 
in 
that 
regard. 
66. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
continue 
to 
work 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
its 
cornerstone, 
the 
NPT. 
All 
States 
must 
comply 
strictly 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
that 
Treaty 
and 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
The 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
held 
in 
New 
York, 
which 
had 
not 
resulted 
in 
a 
consensus 
document, 
and 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
held 
in 
Vienna 
in 
April/May 
2007 
had 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
NPT 
for 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
67. 
Africa 
was 
a 
model 
in 
that 
regard, 
since 
almost 
all 
African 
States 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
Africa 
could 
count 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
help 
it 
preserve 
that 
achievement 
and 
use 
its 
resources 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development. 
68. 
Burkina 
Faso 
supported 
international 
initiatives 
in 
favour 
of 
universalizing 
safeguards. 
It 
reaffirmed 
its 
full 
commitment 
to 
the 
Agency 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
called 
on 
those 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
it. 
69. 
Her 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
cancer 
in 
the 
context 
of 
PACT. 
Capacity 
building 
and 
training 
would 
be 
useful 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
strengthening 
their 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
cancer 
prevention 
and 
treatment. 
Efforts 
should 
be 
pursued 
to 
establish 
partnerships 
and 
mobilize 
the 
necessary 
resources 
in 
that 
regard. 
70. 
Burkina 
Faso 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
to 
help 
developing 
countries 
meet 
their 
growing 
energy 
needs, 
giving 
priority 
to 
projects 
that 
promoted 
capacity 
building. 
Nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation 
should 
some 
day 
become 
accessible 
to 
all 
countries 
and, 
in 
that 
connection, 
the 
idea 
of 
setting 
up 
a 
fuel 
bank 
to 
multilateralize 
supply 
should 
be 
given 
closer 
consideration. 
71. 
Since 
joining 
the 
Agency, 
Burkina 
Faso 
had 
benefited 
from 
a 
number 
of 
regional 
projects 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
food 
and 
the 
environment. 
Together 
with 
Tanzania, 
it 
had 
been 
chosen 
to 
apply 
the 
SIT 
technique 
for 
mosquito 
control. 
It 
was 
already 
taking 
part 
in 
a 
SIT 
pilot 
project 
with 
Mali 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
combat 
trypanosomosis, 
a 
major 
constraint 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
affected 
countries. 
The 
project 
had 
recently 
been 
expanded 
through 
its 
inclusion 
in 
PATTEC 
and 
was 
being 
conducted 
in 
six 
countries 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
African 
Union 
with 
funding 
from 
the 
African 
Development 
Fund. 
Burkina 
Faso 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
the 
subregion 
by 
providing 
facilities 
for 
raising 
sterile 
insects 
and 
for 
training 
staff. 
72. 
Her 
GovernmentÂs 
priorities 
for 
the 
period 
2007Â2011 
included: 
improving 
the 
health 
of 
the 
population 
with 
the 
help 
of 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy; 
ensuring 
radiological 
safety 
and 
security; 
providing 
access 
to 
drinking 
water; 
managing 
air 
quality; 
promoting 
capacity 
building; 
and 
boosting 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
production.

73. 
On 
26 
April 
2005, 
legislation 
had 
been 
introduced 
in 
Burkina 
Faso 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
protection 
against 
ionizing 
radiation. 
On 
11 
July 
2007, 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers 
had 
adopted 
a 
decree 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
radiological 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
authority. 
74. 
Her 
delegation 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
rate 
of 
attainment 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
2006 
had 
reached 
a 
record 
93%. 
For 
its 
part, 
Burkina 
Faso 
would 
pay 
the 
sum 
of 
$1 
600 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2008. 
75. 
In 
conclusion, 
she 
said 
that 
her 
Government 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
gender 
mainstreaming 
in 
the 
Secretariat, 
where 
the 
percentage 
of 
women 
had 
risen 
to 
28%, 
but 
further 
efforts 
were 
still 
needed. 
Mr. 
Mohamad 
(Malaysia), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


76. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic), 
having 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
achievements 
over 
the 
past 
fifty 
years 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
development 
and 
prosperity 
of 
humanity 
and 
in 
the 
service 
of 
world 
peace 
and 
security, 
said 
his 
country 
had 
benefited 
from 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
in 
the 
forty 
years 
that 
it 
had 
been 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
acquired 
significant 
capabilities 
in 
a 
number 
of 
fields. 
77. 
It 
was 
unfortunate 
that 
the 
first 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
which 
had 
taken 
place 
earlier 
in 
the 
year, 
had 
failed 
to 
agree 
on 
a 
final 
document. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
NPT, 
he 
underlined 
not 
only 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fundamental 
verification 
role 
under 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
regime, 
but 
also 
the 
unconditional 
right 
of 
all 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
acquire 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
the 
equipment 
needed 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
uses. 
78. 
He 
recalled 
that, 
in 
a 
break 
with 
tradition, 
debate 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
to 
the 
50th 
General 
Conference 
under 
the 
agenda 
item 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
had 
been 
adjourned. 
The 
Arab 
States 
were 
determined 
to 
remove 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
Israel, 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
possess 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
also 
nuclear 
facilities 
not 
subject 
to 
international 
control. 
Israel 
should 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
all 
the 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
and 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
The 
failure 
to 
implement 
successive 
United 
Nations 
and 
Agency 
resolutions 
had 
increased 
Arab 
frustration 
and 
increased 
the 
likelihood 
of 
an 
arms 
race. 
More 
than 
ten 
years 
previously, 
the 
Arab 
League 
had 
formed 
a 
committee 
whose 
goal 
was 
to 
prepare 
a 
draft 
treaty 
establishing 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
it 
had 
hoped 
that 
those 
States 
bearing 
special 
responsibility 
for 
world 
security 
and 
stability 
would 
contribute. 
The 
Arab 
States 
called 
on 
all 
States 
of 
the 
world 
to 
implement 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
resolutions 
and 
reject 
double 
standards. 
The 
acceptance 
Â 
support 
even 
Â 
by 
some 
States 
of 
IsraelÂs 
refusal 
to 
implement 
such 
resolutions 
defied 
logic 
and 
political 
wisdom. 
The 
Syrian 
delegation 
appealed 
to 
the 
Conference 
to 
treat 
the 
tense 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
with 
the 
utmost 
concern 
and 
to 
give 
the 
agenda 
item 
the 
attention 
it 
deserved. 
79. 
Syria, 
given 
its 
strong 
desire 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
about 
IsraelÂs 
intransigent 
position, 
which 
prevented 
achievement 
of 
that 
objective 
and 
also 
damaged 
the 
credibility 
and 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Creating 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
as 
called 
for 
in 
United 
Nations 
resolutions, 
required 
that 
Israel 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
eliminate 
its 
stockpiles 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
also 
called 
on 
Israel 
urgently 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Eager 
to 
rid 
the 
region 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
including 
nuclear 
weapons, 
Syria 
had 
with 
the 
help 
of 
others 
submitted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
in 
December 
2003 
to 
that 
end. 
Some 
States, 
however, 
had 
stopped 
that 
initiative, 
protecting 
Israel 
and 
supporting 
it 
in 
developing 
its 
nuclear 
arsenal. 
That 
resolution 
was 
still 
on 
the 
table 
and 
its 
adoption 
and 
implementation 
by 
all 
States 
of 
the 
region 
without 
exception 
were 
sought 
as 
soon 
as 
possible.

80. 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
he 
announced 
that, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2007, 
the 
Agency 
had 
opened 
a 
cooperation 
centre 
with 
the 
Syrian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
for 
work 
on 
naturally 
occurring 
radioactive 
materials 
(NORMs), 
the 
ninth 
such 
centre 
worldwide. 
That 
centre 
not 
only 
strengthened 
cooperation 
between 
the 
two 
organizations 
but 
also 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
many 
years 
of 
technical 
assistance 
received 
by 
Syria 
from 
the 
Agency 
had 
borne 
fruit 
for 
the 
region. 
81. 
Also, 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
2007, 
Damascus 
had 
hosted 
the 
second 
meeting 
of 
the 
ARASIA 
council 
of 
representatives, 
attended 
by 
senior 
Agency 
officials. 
His 
delegation 
expressed 
gratitude 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
under 
that 
agreement. 
82. 
He 
commended 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
its 
good 
management 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
and 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
use 
of 
the 
automated 
PCMF 
system. 
Experience 
gained 
of 
that 
system 
in 
the 
current 
cycle 
had 
shown 
the 
need 
for 
its 
further 
development. 
Before 
moving 
into 
the 
second 
phase, 
which 
involved 
project 
implementation 
and 
reporting, 
the 
Agency 
should 
obtain 
feedback 
from 
the 
main 
operators 
of 
the 
system 
in 
beneficiary 
States 
with 
a 
view 
to 
facilitating 
data 
input 
and 
retrieval. 
83. 
The 
TCF 
had 
shown 
the 
highest 
rate 
of 
attainment 
ever 
the 
previous 
year. 
That 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
maintain, 
considering 
the 
increasing 
number 
of 
Member 
States, 
especially 
from 
the 
least 
developed 
countries. 
Syria 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
view 
that 
making 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
mandatory 
rather 
than 
voluntary 
would 
make 
technical 
cooperation 
funds 
more 
assured 
and 
predictable, 
and 
also 
felt 
that 
consideration 
should 
be 
given 
to 
their 
inclusion 
under 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
84. 
The 
Syrian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
contributed 
to 
Agency 
activities 
during 
the 
preceding 
year 
by 
hosting 
5 
regional 
training 
courses 
on 
such 
topics 
as 
geology, 
quality 
assurance 
and 
nuclear 
equipment, 
by 
providing 
training 
to 
19 
scientific 
staff 
from 
a 
number 
of 
States 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
by 
hosting 
4 
scientific 
visits. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Commission 
had 
provided 
experts 
for 
training 
and 
other 
services. 
85. 
The 
masters 
course 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
organized 
by 
the 
University 
of 
Damascus 
had 
been 
a 
full 
success 
in 
its 
first 
year. 
So 
far, 
221 
students 
had 
been 
trained 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
protection 
in 
Damascus. 
He 
expressed 
gratitude 
to 
the 
Agency, 
especially 
the 
Director 
of 
the 
Division 
for 
Asia 
and 
the 
Pacific 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
for 
efforts 
made 
in 
that 
regard. 
86. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
health, 
Damascus 
had, 
based 
on 
a 
request 
from 
the 
Syrian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission, 
received 
a 
delegation 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
WHO 
to 
prepare 
a 
programme 
of 
work 
for 
cancer 
control. 
The 
delegation 
had 
met 
high-level 
officials 
at 
the 
relevant 
ministries. 
The 
report 
on 
planning 
cancer 
control 
had 
been 
submitted 
and 
contained 
important 
recommendations. 
WHOÂs 
contribution 
to 
the 
drafting 
process 
had 
strengthened 
the 
principle 
of 
partnership 
in 
development. 
87. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
wished 
the 
Agency 
continued 
success 
in 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
its 
work 
and 
stressed 
that 
they 
should 
be 
accorded 
equal 
footing. 
88. 
Mr. 
TZOTCHEV 
(Bulgaria) 
said 
the 
Agency 
was 
a 
focal 
point 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
had 
a 
global 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
terrorism. 
It 
was 
therefore 
essential 
to 
strengthen 
further 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
he 
commended 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
to 
that 
end. 
He 
reiterated 
BulgariaÂs 
strong 
commitment 
to 
a 
universal 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
should 
become 
the 
verification 
standard 
for 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT, 
and 
he 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
their 
own 
additional 
protocol.

Bulgaria 
would 
play 
its 
part 
in 
the 
preparations 
for 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
due 
to 
be 
held 
in 
2010. 


89. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
decision 
to 
shut 
down 
and 
seal 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
to 
invite 
Agency 
personnel 
to 
conduct 
all 
necessary 
monitoring 
and 
verification. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
continued 
dialogue 
and 
expressed 
his 
support 
for 
the 
political 
will 
of 
the 
six 
parties 
(China, 
DPRK, 
Japan, 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
United 
States 
of 
America) 
to 
achieve 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
90. 
Greater 
international 
cooperation 
was 
needed 
to 
counter 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
material. 
Bulgaria 
supported 
all 
national 
and 
international 
initiatives 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
along 
with 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material, 
would 
further 
strengthen 
international 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
material. 
Bulgaria 
had 
already 
ratified 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
latter 
Convention 
and 
had 
declared 
its 
political 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
adopted 
in 
2003. 
91. 
Bulgaria 
likewise 
supported 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
launched 
in 
2006 
by 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
He 
called 
for 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
measures 
under 
that 
Initiative, 
which 
aimed 
to 
prevent 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear 
weapons, 
control 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
make 
nuclear 
energy 
use 
safer 
throughout 
the 
world. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
that 
Initiative, 
Bulgaria 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
to 
return 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
from 
the 
Bulgarian 
research 
reactor 
to 
the 
country 
of 
origin. 
92. 
Bulgaria 
had 
accumulated 
considerable 
experience 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
plants 
and 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Nuclear 
power 
had 
accounted 
for 
over 
40% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
mix 
over 
the 
previous 
decade, 
and 
was 
in 
line 
with 
the 
European 
energy 
policy 
of 
supplying 
electricity 
at 
an 
acceptable 
price 
and 
slowing 
down 
climate 
change. 
The 
countryÂs 
national 
energy 
policy, 
dating 
from 
2002, 
provided 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
at 
its 
current 
level 
by 
extending 
the 
operating 
lifetime 
of 
existing 
facilities 
and 
building 
new 
ones. 
93. 
Units 
5 
and 
6 
of 
the 
Kozloduy 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
were 
being 
modernized 
in 
line 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations, 
and 
work 
should 
be 
completed 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2007. 
An 
Agency 
expert 
mission 
was 
due 
to 
visit 
the 
site 
in 
2008. 
The 
new 
Belene 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
notified 
to 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
accordance 
with 
Article 
41 
of 
Euratom. 
The 
site 
had 
been 
approved 
by 
the 
Bulgarian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agency 
and 
permission 
for 
the 
design 
had 
been 
obtained. 
In 
April 
2007, 
the 
WWER-100/B-466 
reactor 
installation 
to 
be 
constructed 
at 
the 
Belene 
site 
had 
received 
a 
European 
Utility 
Requirements 
certificate 
proving 
that 
it 
met 
the 
technical 
requirements 
set 
by 
European 
companies 
operating 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
94. 
BulgariaÂs 
strategy 
for 
the 
management 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
formulated 
national 
objectives 
and 
priorities 
related 
to 
the 
safe 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste, 
including 
an 
action 
plan 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
national 
repository 
for 
the 
disposal 
of 
low 
level 
and 
intermediate 
level 
radioactive 
waste. 
Permission 
to 
select 
a 
site 
for 
the 
repository 
had 
been 
granted 
in 
2006. 
95. 
Bulgaria 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that, 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
showed, 
no 
nuclear 
worker 
or 
member 
of 
the 
public 
had 
received 
a 
significant 
radiation 
dose 
and 
no 
events 
leading 
to 
an 
environmentally 
harmful 
release 
of 
radiation 
had 
occurred 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
in 
the 
year 
under 
review. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
harmonize 
safety 
standards 
and 
strengthen 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
had 
made 
a 
substantial 
contribution 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes.

Bulgaria 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
pursue 
its 
approach 
of 
building, 
strengthening 
and 
maintaining 
national 
and 
regional 
capacities 
for 
the 
safe, 
secure 
and 
sustainable 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 


96. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
functioning 
well 
and 
should 
be 
expanded 
to 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
an 
even 
larger 
number 
of 
Member 
States. 
In 
the 
European 
region, 
where 
expectations 
of 
nuclear 
power 
programmes 
were 
rising, 
national 
and 
regional 
cooperation 
were 
a 
key 
factor. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
assistance 
received 
by 
Bulgaria 
in 
2006 
from 
the 
Agency 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
completion 
of 
important 
national 
projects 
in 
nuclear 
safety, 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
medicine 
would 
form 
an 
important 
element 
of 
future 
cooperation. 
97. 
His 
delegation 
supported 
the 
proposed 
budget 
for 
2008, 
which 
maintained 
an 
appropriate 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
priority 
activities 
and 
would 
ensure 
that 
programmes 
could 
be 
implemented. 
Bulgaria 
had 
met 
all 
its 
financial 
obligations 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
2007 
Regular 
Budget. 
Also, 
it 
had 
paid 
its 
pledged 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007 
and 
its 
voluntary 
contribution 
for 
2008 
would 
be 
$15 
200. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
ensure 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
funds 
were 
spent 
primarily 
in 
those 
developing 
countries 
which 
had 
themselves 
contributed 
to 
the 
TCF. 
He 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
Regular 
Budget 
contributions 
and 
their 
pledged 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
98. 
Mr. 
BAHRAN 
(Yemen) 
welcomed 
Bahrain, 
Burundi, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Congo, 
Nepal 
and 
Cape 
Verde 
as 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
99. 
Yemen 
was 
a 
staunch 
supporter 
of 
all 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety, 
and 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
especially 
for 
electricity 
generation 
and 
seawater 
desalination, 
while 
complying 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
100. 
Referring 
to 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
he 
called 
for 
vigorous 
action 
to 
address 
the 
causes 
of 
political 
instability 
and 
war 
and 
to 
promote 
international 
understanding 
through 
negotiations. 
A 
prerequisite 
for 
any 
progress 
in 
that 
direction 
was 
the 
elimination 
of 
the 
nuclear 
threat 
through 
an 
earnest 
endeavour 
to 
ensure 
general 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
placement 
of 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
every 
country 
without 
exception 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
In 
that 
context, 
Yemen 
appealed 
to 
the 
international 
community 
to 
discharge 
its 
responsibility 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
Israeli 
nuclear 
facilities 
were 
made 
subject 
to 
international 
law 
by 
demanding 
that 
Israel 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
sign 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
101. 
Yemen 
was 
cooperating 
with 
the 
international 
private 
sector 
in 
developing 
electricity 
generation 
through 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
Arab 
States 
pursuant 
to 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
last 
Arab 
summit 
and 
of 
the 
Gulf 
Cooperation 
Council. 
The 
move 
was 
part 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
creative 
diversification 
of 
its 
energy 
sources 
so 
that 
they 
included 
a 
mix 
of 
natural 
gas 
and 
nuclear 
and 
renewable 
energy. 
The 
new 
system 
involved 
independent 
power 
producers 
and 
was 
being 
developed 
on 
a 
build-own-operate 
(BOO) 
basis. 
Talks 
between 
the 
Yemeni 
Ministry 
of 
Electricity 
and 
Energy 
and 
the 
international 
private 
sector 
would 
shortly 
culminate 
in 
the 
signing 
of 
an 
agreement 
in 
principle 
on 
participation. 
Feasibility 
studies 
and 
site 
selection 
were 
also 
proceeding 
apace. 
The 
relevant 
Government 
Commission 
had 
recently 
selected 
three 
sites 
and 
climatic, 
geophysical 
and 
other 
studies 
were 
under 
way. 
Yemen 
hoped 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
prove 
to 
be 
a 
safe 
and 
economically 
competitive 
means 
of 
generating 
electricity 
and 
of 
desalinating 
sufficient 
quantities 
of 
water 
to 
meet 
the 
countryÂs 
acute 
water 
shortage. 
102. 
YemenÂs 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety 
infrastructure 
was 
also 
undergoing 
rapid 
development 
on 
four 
levels: 
legislation; 
management 
and 
regulation; 
training 
of 
human 
resources; 
and 
development 
of 
technology, 
laboratories 
and 
equipment. 
For 
instance, 
Yemen 
had 
drafted 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
bill 
in 

GC(51)/OR.5

cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
submitted 
it 
to 
the 
Council 
of 
Ministers. 
It 
was 
the 
first 
comprehensive 
nuclear 
energy 
legislation 
in 
the 
Arabic 
language. 
Moreover, 
the 
most 
important 
new 
project 
that 
Yemen 
had 
submitted 
under 
the 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
concerned 
the 
modernization 
of 
its 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety 
infrastructure. 


103. 
He 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
combating 
cancer, 
a 
disease 
that 
claimed 
millions 
of 
lives, 
especially 
in 
the 
least 
developed 
countries, 
through 
its 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
radiotherapy 
centres. 
Yemen 
warmly 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
services 
it 
was 
receiving 
under 
the 
PACT 
programme. 
The 
Agency 
had 
played 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
National 
Oncology 
Centre 
in 
the 
capital 
Sanaa 
and 
was 
assisting 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
another 
centre 
in 
the 
city 
of 
Aden. 
104. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
substantial 
progress 
made 
under 
ARASIA 
in 
developing 
technical 
projects 
with 
Agency 
support 
to 
address 
the 
joint 
concerns 
of 
ARASIA 
member 
States. 
105. 
Lastly, 
he 
expressed 
deep 
gratitude 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
staff 
for 
their 
valuable 
assistance 
to 
Yemen 
through 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
vital 
areas 
such 
as 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resource 
management. 
106. 
Ms. 
MELIN 
(Sweden) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
proliferation 
presented 
serious 
challenges. 
The 
detonation 
of 
a 
nuclear 
device 
in 
the 
DPRK 
in 
October 
2006 
had 
been 
condemned 
by 
the 
Security 
Council. 
Confidence 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
still 
had 
to 
be 
restored 
and 
the 
Security 
CouncilÂs 
obligations 
remained 
unfulfilled. 
107. 
Only 
effective 
multilateralism 
could 
deal 
with 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
counter 
the 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
illegal 
diversion 
and 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials. 
The 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Physical 
Protection 
of 
Nuclear 
Material, 
alongside 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
verification 
and 
national 
implementation 
of 
international 
instruments, 
were 
very 
important. 
108. 
Sweden 
had 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
which, 
as 
had 
been 
emphasized 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
with 
reference 
to 
the 
case 
of 
Iran, 
would 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
assurances 
not 
only 
regarding 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
but 
also 
regarding 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
109. 
Functioning 
multilateral 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
would 
contribute 
to 
achieving 
non-proliferation 
goals. 
At 
the 
previous 
yearÂs 
General 
Conference 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
options 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
assurance 
had 
been 
presented 
and 
in 
June 
2007 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
issued 
a 
further 
report 
on 
such 
options. 
Sweden 
considered 
that 
the 
time 
had 
come 
to 
move 
from 
making 
proposals 
to 
selecting 
the 
most 
suitable 
options. 
The 
process 
was 
a 
complex 
one 
which 
would 
require 
time, 
so 
it 
was 
imperative 
that 
an 
incremental 
approach 
be 
begun 
immediately. 
110. 
Sweden 
believed 
that 
the 
ideas 
presented 
in 
an 
article 
by 
former 
United 
States 
Secretaries 
of 
State 
Henry 
Kissinger 
and 
George 
Shultz, 
together 
with 
former 
Secretary 
of 
Defence 
William 
Perry 
and 
former 
Senator 
Sam 
Nunn, 
whereby 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
nuclear 
States 
should 
turn 
the 
goal 
of 
a 
world 
without 
nuclear 
weapons 
into 
a 
joint 
enterprise, 
along 
with 
the 
proposals 
in 
a 
2006 
report 
by 
the 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
Commission, 
chaired 
by 
Dr. 
Hans 
Blix, 
could 
constitute 
a 
platform 
for 
renewed 
progress. 
111. 
SwedenÂs 
remaining 
ten 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
were 
undergoing 
extensive 
modernization 
in 
order 
to 
be 
fit 
for 
operation 
for 
at 
least 
a 
further 
forty 
years. 
Power 
plant 
owners 
had 
also 
applied 
to 
uprate 
the 
power 
levels 
of 
eight 
reactors, 
which 
would 
add 
almost 
1300 
MW(e) 
to 
SwedenÂs 
current 
nuclear 
power 
production 
capacity. 
Recognizing 
that 
many 
older 
reactors 
across 
the 
world 
were 
being

similarly 
prepared, 
Sweden 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
assessing 
such 
reactors 
against 
modern 
safety 
standards 
and 
welcomed 
any 
Agency 
initiative 
to 
share 
experience 
gained 
from 
such 
programmes. 


112. 
Events 
over 
the 
previous 
year 
had 
demonstrated 
to 
the 
Swedish 
nuclear 
power 
industry 
and 
regulatory 
bodies 
the 
importance 
of 
safety 
management 
and 
a 
safety 
culture, 
particularly 
under 
conditions 
of 
pressure 
to 
complete 
upgrade 
and 
uprate 
programmes 
within 
a 
limited 
time 
period. 
The 
event 
at 
Forsmark 
in 
2006, 
when 
parts 
of 
the 
emergency 
power 
systems 
had 
failed, 
had 
prompted 
the 
Swedish 
nuclear 
regulators 
to 
initiate 
extensive 
feedback 
efforts 
on 
such 
issues 
in 
international 
forums. 
Sweden 
had 
requested 
the 
Agency 
to 
conduct 
OSART 
missions 
at 
the 
Forsmark 
site, 
as 
well 
as 
at 
Ringhals 
and 
Oskarshamn, 
to 
obtain 
an 
international 
assessment 
of 
their 
safety 
condition. 
113. 
Installations 
serving 
the 
back 
end 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
in 
Sweden 
currently 
included 
a 
final 
repository 
for 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste 
and 
an 
interim 
storage 
plant 
for 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel, 
which 
was 
to 
be 
encapsulated 
into 
copper 
canisters 
before 
being 
placed 
in 
a 
final 
repository. 
In 
November 
2006 
the 
Swedish 
nuclear 
power 
industry 
had 
applied 
for 
an 
encapsulation 
plant 
to 
be 
integrated 
with 
the 
existing 
interim 
storage 
facility 
and 
an 
application 
for 
the 
licensing 
of 
the 
final 
repository 
was 
expected 
in 
late 
2009. 
The 
two 
applications 
would 
be 
reviewed 
in 
parallel, 
with 
the 
conclusion 
based 
on 
an 
integrated 
appraisal 
of 
both. 
Their 
evaluation 
would 
include 
safeguards 
considerations, 
for 
which 
a 
common 
international 
approach 
would 
be 
very 
useful. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Sweden 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
results 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
working 
group 
on 
safeguards 
of 
geological 
repositories. 
114. 
The 
recently 
initiated 
review 
of 
the 
BSS 
was 
of 
great 
importance 
and 
was 
expected 
to 
result 
in 
improvement 
of 
current 
standards 
for 
protection 
of 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
The 
work 
could 
take 
full 
account 
of 
the 
recently 
adopted 
recommendations 
of 
the 
ICRP, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
new 
Fundamental 
Safety 
Principles 
(Safety 
Standards 
Series 
No. 
SF-1). 
Such 
efforts 
offered 
the 
opportunity 
to 
create 
a 
coherent 
system 
for 
protection 
of 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment 
from 
the 
harmful 
effects 
of 
radiation 
in 
which 
terminology, 
protective 
ambitions, 
constraints 
and 
reference 
values, 
as 
well 
as 
environmental 
considerations 
could 
be 
harmonized. 
115. 
In 
recent 
years, 
many 
countries 
had 
indicated 
an 
interest 
in 
embarking 
on 
a 
new, 
or 
expanding 
an 
existing, 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
Sweden 
stressed 
that 
such 
a 
programme 
was 
a 
major 
undertaking 
requiring 
a 
century-long 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
safety 
and 
to 
radiation 
protection. 
Sweden 
viewed 
adherence 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
as 
important 
confirmations 
of 
such 
a 
commitment. 
116. 
Sweden 
emphasized 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
advise 
Member 
States 
on 
what 
was 
required 
to 
deal 
adequately 
with 
all 
the 
issues 
connected 
with 
safe 
operation 
and 
decommissioning 
of 
nuclear 
reactor 
facilities 
and 
also 
to 
provide 
any 
necessary 
assistance. 
Sweden 
welcomed 
recent 
initiatives 
to 
that 
effect 
and 
called 
on 
Member 
States 
to 
ensure 
that 
reactors 
were 
constructed 
and 
operated 
only 
where 
the 
right 
conditions 
prevailed. 
117. 
Sweden 
had 
been 
working 
externally 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
by 
investing 
six 
million 
euros 
per 
year 
in 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
to 
improve 
reactor 
safety, 
non-proliferation 
measures 
and 
waste 
management 
in 
States 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union. 
Hitherto 
such 
programmes 
had 
been 
implemented 
mainly 
in 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
Ukraine, 
but 
further 
programmes 
were 
planned 
for 
Armenia 
and 
Georgia 
later 
in 
2007. 
118. 
Sweden 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
had 
consistently 
contributed 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
agreed 
target 
figure 
for 
the 
TCF. 
The 
year 
2007 
was 
no 
exception 
and 
Sweden 
had 
already 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
Fund.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(continued) 
(GC(51)/5) 
1. Mr. ALOBIDI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) warmly thanked the Agency for its support in recent 
years under the technical cooperation programme, especially in the areas of health, groundwater 
resource management and energy planning. 
2. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had hosted the eighteenth AFRA Technical Working Group 
Meeting from 22 to 26 April 2007, attended by national coordinators of AFRA projects and 
representatives of the Agency who had discussed a human resources development strategy in the area 
of nuclear science and technology to promote sustainable development in Africa in accordance with 
identified priorities and the drafting of a plan of action in support of AFRA programmes. 
3. The Libyan Renewable Energies and Water Desalination Research Center had organized a 
training course in cooperation with the Agency from 1 to 5 April 2007 on the use of radioisotope 
techniques to detect leaks in oil pipelines and heat exchangers. The course had been attended by 
participants from AFRA member countries, experts from Poland and South Africa and local trainees 
from the oil sector. 
4. His country intended to proceed with its plans to use nuclear energy for electricity generation 
and water desalination. A number of companies from the United States of America, Canada, France, 
the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and Argentina had been invited to present their nuclear 
technology and the Agency would be asked for technical and legal support in due course. 
5. In view of the importance it attached to nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste 
management, his country had established a fully independent National Nuclear and Radiation Safety 
Authority. It monitored and assessed compliance with Agency standards and participated in most 
Agency projects aimed at strengthening the countryÂs capacity to build a strong radiation protection 
infrastructure in all sectors using ionizing radiation. 
6. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya also took part in nuclear security activities such as training 
courses, workshops and meetings. It was a party to the CPPNM and had signed the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. His country had hosted a workshop 
under the AgencyÂs auspices and in cooperation with the Renewable Energies and Water Desalination 
Research Center on the physical protection of research reactors from 16 November to 7 December 
2006 for trainees from Arab countries with research reactors. Experts from the Sandia National 
Laboratories in the United States had participated in the workshop. 
7. He noted that, according to the Director GeneralÂs report to the Board of Governors contained in 
document GOV/2007/48, the Islamic Republic of Iran was cooperating with the Agency on 
inspections and had provided the requisite reports on declared nuclear material and facilities. He 
further noted that the Agency was still unable to verify certain aspects relevant to the scope and nature 
of IranÂs nuclear programme. While recognizing the importance of such cooperation and of seeking 
greater transparency so that the Agency possessed all relevant facts regarding the programme, he 
stressed the basic right of all States without exception to develop research, production and use of 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes provided that they complied with their obligations under the 
NPT. The Islamic Republic of Iran was thus also entitled to produce nuclear energy and radioisotopes 
for peaceful purposes.

8. Some countries, however, were dissatisfied with the agreement of a work plan between the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and the Agency and were still bent on imposing additional Security Council 
sanctions. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya viewed the agreement as a step in the right direction and urged 
the countries that were calling for more sanctions to refrain from adopting a Security Council 
resolution, to give diplomacy a chance and to have confidence in the Agency and its Director General, 
especially since the agreement set a short time limit for Iran to comply with its international 
obligations. He reminded those who were alluding to the possible use of force against Iran on the 
pretext that it was covertly pursuing a nuclear programme for non-peaceful purposes of the 
consequences of the ongoing war in Iraq, which had been waged on the basis of erroneous information 
that contradicted the findings of the Agency and its inspectors. 
9. His country was deeply concerned about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East, since the Israelis had developed their military nuclear capabilities and had amassed a 
huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, triggering an arms race in the region and hence threatening regional 
and international peace and security. Libya had supported all General Assembly resolutions since 
1974 that urged every State in the region to take practical steps to establish a NWFZ in the Middle 
East, to comply with the NPT and to refrain from developing, producing, testing or storing nuclear 
weapons and from permitting the stationing of nuclear weapons on their territories. It therefore 
emphasized the need to rid the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction and of ensuring that 
nuclear installations were subject to international verification in accordance with the NPT. It called for 
the implementation of relevant General Assembly resolutions, Security Council resolution 487 (1981) 
and the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice which urged all parties to take 
steps to establish a NWFZ in the Middle East. He wondered why the Western States did not call on the 
Israelis to accede to the NPT if they genuinely wanted security and peace in the Middle East. 
10. While commending the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the representation of nationals from 
developing countries in its staff, he noted that no tangible progress had been made to date and called 
for more equitable representation of developing countries, including his own, in senior posts, since 
they possessed the necessary expertise. 
11. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya considered that it was more urgent than ever to ensure compliance 
with the provisions of the NPT and to enhance the effectiveness of the safeguards regime by working 
for the universality of both. He called on all nuclear-weapon States to draw up a programme for the 
elimination of their nuclear arsenals and to cease all forms of development of such weapons, thereby 
setting an example for other States of compliance with their NPT obligations. 
12. Mr. GAISENAK (Belarus) said that since its founding the Agency had become the leading 
international organization responsible for promoting the safe use of nuclear energy and ensuring 
compliance with international non-proliferation obligations. Belarus expressed its full support for the 
AgencyÂs efforts towards the goal of ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ. 
13. Belarus valued highly the professionalism and competence with which the Secretariat 
approached technical cooperation projects and believed that future projects should continue to be 
guided by such professionalism focused on definite results. No political subtexts or outside influences 
should be permitted to affect technical cooperation. 
14. The coordinated efforts of Member States and the Secretariat had led to a positive trend in the 
financial technical cooperation implementation indicators. The Secretariat and Member States would 
have to continue to work actively in the future to ensure the TCF had sufficient financial resources. 
For its part, Belarus had paid its voluntary contributions to the Fund in full and on time for many years 
and intended to do so also in 2008.

15. Belarus considered technical cooperation to be an essential instrument for the transfer and 
introduction of technology and experience in the nuclear field. In the case of Belarus, which had 
suffered the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, technical cooperation had been particularly 
important in creating the right socio-economic and medical conditions for rehabilitation of the affected 
regions and ensuring their stable development. The Agency had, over many years, successfully carried 
out projects to minimize the effects of the disaster. Currently, a project was in progress whose main 
goal was to improve living conditions in the affected regions by means of agricultural technologies 
capable of reducing the occurrence of radioactive elements in food products. It would contribute to the 
economic growth of those regions and improvement of the ecological situation. The significance of 
such projects could not be overstated. 
16. In that context, he drew attention to resolution GC(50)/RES/12, which requested Âthe 
Secretariat to continue, within the framework of the Technical Cooperation Programme, to work 
actively to render assistance to the most affected countries in mitigating the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster and establishing prerequisites for the sustainable development of the affected 
areasÂ. Belarus expressed the hope that the Agency would continue its active role in that regard. 
17. Nuclear power accounted for around 16% of global energy production and had a growing role in 
meeting humankindÂs energy needs in an ecologically safe and economically viable way. A growing 
number of Member States had announced their intention to establish national nuclear power 
programmes. Belarus was among those States interested in dialogue with the Agency regarding a 
possible national nuclear power programme and was in the process of reviewing various options for 
the future development of its energy sector so as to ensure stable economic growth of the country. 
Belarus actively supported the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States in establishing nuclear power 
programmes, and he emphasized that particular attention should be paid to safety and security issues. 
18. In the framework of the development of nuclear power, new approaches to the nuclear fuel 
cycle which would guarantee the supply of nuclear fuel were of particular interest. Belarus was 
convinced that the relevant initiatives should be studied without undue haste and with full and 
transparent participation by all interested parties. It fell to Member States to draw up a fair, 
multilateral system for an assured supply of nuclear fuel to all users of nuclear power. 
19. Belarus was a committed and consistent supporter of the strengthening of the international 
nuclear non-proliferation regime and strictly fulfilled its obligations under the NPT. It was also aware 
of the complexity of the issues related to implementation of the NPT, as had been recently confirmed 
at the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
20. Belarus intended to collaborate further with the Agency to strengthen that regime and expressed 
its support for the professional work of the Agency in the application of safeguards in Member States. 
Belarus was concerned by the trend for the Agency to concentrate its efforts on the application of 
safeguards. Such a one-sided approach to fulfilling its statutory functions would cause irreparable 
harm to the AgencyÂs authority as the leading international organization in the nuclear field. 
21. Significant work had been conducted over the past year in the field of nuclear and radiation 
safety and security. In particular, efforts had been made to universalize and implement such 
international agreements in the field as the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention and 
the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. There had been collaborative 
work between national infrastructures and international experts to ensure radiation protection and the 
safety of nuclear facilities, research reactors, radioactive waste management and transport. Belarus 
supported the AgencyÂs efforts to establish a global regime of nuclear and radiation safety and 
considered its own work at the national level to be an integral part of those efforts.

22. Belarus noted the constructive role of the Agency in working with Member States to ensure the 
safety of facilities which presented a cross-border radiation risk and believed such work should 
continue. A successful example had been the AgencyÂs mission in 2005 to evaluate the safety of the 
planned radioactive waste storage facility at the Ignalina nuclear power plant. Implementation of the 
conclusions of that mission would ensure improved safety in the interest of all concerned Member 
States. 
23. Belarus was particularly concerned by illegal trafficking in nuclear and radioactive materials 
across State borders and was participating in the relevant Agency database. In 2006, Belarus and the 
Agency had organized a national seminar on response to such trafficking incidents and, at the start of 
September 2007, Belarus had established regional training courses on the same subject. They greatly 
enhanced the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat illegal trafficking. Belarus 
expected to be involved in further cooperation with the Agency in that sphere. 
24. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that, at a time of growing concern regarding nuclear proliferation and 
increased demand for nuclear power as a non-polluting source of energy, the Agency had an important 
role to play in making nuclear power safe, reliable and resistant to proliferation. In recent years, the 
non-proliferation regime had been undermined by serious violations of international obligations by a 
few States. The Agency, as the sole legitimate nuclear fact-finder, had the indispensable task of 
verifying compliance with those obligations by virtue of its ability to detect diversion, to submit full 
and timely reports and to facilitate efforts by the international community to handle such concerns 
effectively. Lamentably, some instances of gross and consistent non-compliance, mostly in the Middle 
East region, had not been initially detected by the Agency and had not yet been checked by proper 
enforcement of corrective measures. 
25. Although the gravity of the situation had been recognized in successive Board of Governors and 
Security Council resolutions, the desired outcome of those resolutions had not yet been achieved. 
Current developments, if left unchecked, would undermine regional and global security and posed a 
grave existential challenge to Israel. His country could not remain oblivious to intensive efforts by 
some parties in the region to develop weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, while 
the same parties denied the legitimacy of IsraelÂs sovereign existence and called for its destruction. 
26. Israel remained hopeful, however, that the international community would summon the 
collective will to take all appropriate measures to address the challenges satisfactorily. He called on all 
parties concerned to assist the Agency in exercising its mandate with appropriate guidance from the 
Security Council. It was important to take part in efforts inspired by the Security Council to condemn 
such reckless behaviour and to avert serious threats to international security and stability. 
27. Israel was aware of the need for a clean and sustainable power supply and took the view that 
countries which behaved responsibly should not be denied access to nuclear power. However, 
sensitive nuclear technology should not be transferred without taking into account certain parameters 
and the credentials of the recipient. In that context, he congratulated Presidents Bush and Putin on 
their joint declaration in which they encouraged States to use nuclear technology and adopt a viable 
alternative to sensitive fuel cycle technologies. 
28. Israel had enacted new legislation in line with the Wassenaar Arrangement, completing its 
efforts to harmonize its export control policy with best practices set by the various supplier regimes. It 
submitted regular reports on its implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004). 
29. Israel had taken steps to ratify the amended CPPNM and the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. It was also implementing the Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research 
Reactors. His country was stepping up security at its international border crossings, in cooperation

with the United States Department of Energy, in order to prevent illicit trafficking of nuclear and 
radiological materials and was installing the first set of megaport portals at Haifa. Israel also actively 
supported and participated in the work of the CTBTO and had joined the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism. 

30. Israel participated as an observer in the AgencyÂs INPRO and was considering the possibility of 
taking part in some proposed projects. The Ministry of National Infrastructure was conducting a 
preliminary feasibility study in cooperation with the Israel Atomic Energy Commission on the 
building of nuclear power reactors on the premise that such reactors would be subject to international 
safeguards. 
31. Some States were again pressing for action at the current session, under agenda item 22, on the 
so-called ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilities and threatÂ, an item that had been removed from the agenda in 
1993 and never acted upon since. None of the proliferation developments in recent years had involved 
Israel, but they all challenged his countryÂs security. They demonstrated the alarming attitude of some 
States in the region to their international commitments. The sponsors of the agenda item were 
motivated by cynical political considerations that were unrelated to the AgencyÂs mandate and that 
were also evident in efforts to challenge IsraelÂs credentials. Such conduct cast serious doubt on the 
sponsorsÂ willingness to make any real progress towards cooperative security in the Middle East and 
he called on Member States to reject their proposals outright. 
32. Israel had been advocating global and complete disarmament long before the introduction of the 
agenda item calling for the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. It remained committed to a 
vision of the Middle East as a zone free of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic 
missiles. Yet the establishment of such a zone called for a fundamental transformation of the regional 
political and strategic environment through the gradual building of mutual trust and reconciliation, 
followed by more modest arms control measures. So far such a transformation had eluded the Middle 
East. Israel had joined in the consensus on resolutions under the relevant item at previous sessions 
despite grave reservations about its modalities. Unfortunately, certain States had insisted at the 
previous session on introducing amendments to the text that had not been negotiated. He urged all 
parties involved to adhere to the tradition of consensus. Israel would only support the item if its 
contents were mutually agreed upon and no action was taken on agenda item 22. 
33. In recent years, Israel had worked closely with the Agency under the technical cooperation 
programme to extend the benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear energy in the areas of health, 
agriculture, environment and industry to its own citizens and to its neighbours. The benefits of projects 
aimed at controlling the tephritid fruit flies were particularly noteworthy. 
34. The Israel Atomic Energy Commission had pledged a substantial donation to the AgencyÂs 
Department of Nuclear Safety and Security of personal detection and search units for a recipient State 
in need. It had also increased its annual contribution to the Department of Technical Cooperation and 
had created a mechanism to update its contribution regularly. 
35. Mr. BERNHARD (Denmark) said that the world depended and would continue to depend on the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system and the NPT as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime. 
The Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to the Agency and its Director General for their efforts to 
prevent nuclear energy from being used for military purposes and to ensure that it was used for 
peaceful purposes in the safest possible way. Yet some States that had signed comprehensive 
safeguards agreements had nonetheless developed secret nuclear programmes. All States should 
therefore recognize that the current Agency verification standard consisted of both a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol.

36. The United Nations Security Council also had a key responsibility for non-proliferation. To 
maintain their credibility, both the Security Council and the Agency had to react promptly and 
consistently when States breached their safeguards commitments or sought to break out of the NPT 
regime. Denmark supported increased Security Council involvement in the area of non-proliferation 
both in general and in specific cases such as those of the DPRK and Iran. The adoption of Security 
Council resolution 1540 (2004) had been an important step in that direction. Denmark had also 
supported the adoption of resolutions 1695 (2006) and 1718 (2006) concerning the DPRK and 
resolutions 1696 (2006) and 1737 (2006) concerning IranÂs nuclear programme. 
37. With regard to the DPRK, he welcomed the intensified dialogue among the participants in the 
six-party talks. The shutdown of the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, which was being monitored by 
Agency inspectors, was an important first step towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
The Agency should be provided with the necessary funds to continue its verification efforts. 
38. Security Council resolution 1747 (2007), which had been adopted by consensus, stated that 
further appropriate measures would be taken if Iran failed to suspend enrichment and heavy water 
related activities. He urged Iran to take the suspension steps required by the Board of Governors and 
the Security Council in order to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear 
programme. The door for negotiations remained open and the generous offer presented by the 
European Union High Representative in June 2006 on behalf of China, France, Germany, the Russian 
Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America remained on the table. 
39. The threat posed by proliferation to non-State actors such as terrorists had presented a new 
challenge in recent years. Denmark was committed to ensuring that sufficient resources were available 
under the Nuclear Security Fund to address that threat. While responsibility for nuclear security lay 
with individual States, joint action was necessary to strengthen non-proliferation, nuclear verification 
and export controls. Denmark had contributed from the outset to the Proliferation Security Initiative 
by playing a leading role on containerized shipments in the maritime domain and facilitating outreach 
to industry. It had also recently joined the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 
40. Denmark believed that nuclear power was not a sustainable form of energy and that it should 
not be included in energy planning. Hence, while respecting othersÂ choice and noting the AgencyÂs 
mandate as stipulated in its Statute, Denmark was not in favour of a promotional role for the Agency 
in that regard. 
41. The step from mastering sensitive civilian technology to building a nuclear weapon was 
becoming smaller, raising proliferation concerns regarding the technology for the most sensitive parts 
of the nuclear cycle, such as uranium enrichment. Denmark would therefore consider supporting a 
multilateral proliferation-safe mechanism that would provide an assured nuclear fuel supply for States 
that had opted for nuclear power. 
Mr. 
GOTTWALD 
(Germany), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


42. Mr. ARÃVALO YÃPES (Colombia) reiterated that the commitment to disarmament and 
non-proliferation informed ColombiaÂs foreign policy-making. It had participated actively in all 
initiatives that promoted that dual goal. Addressing those issues multilaterally, with full respect for the 
rights and obligations of States and with the participation of the international community, was crucial 
to global peace and security. 
43. Colombia had always supported international legal instruments and organizations. It was firmly 
committed to the NPT and to the Tlatelolco Treaty, a pioneering instrument establishing the worldÂs 
first NWFZ. Colombia observed its safeguards agreement with the Agency and supported multilateral 

GC(51)/OR.6 
19 
September 
2007, 
Page 
7 


initiatives to counter the threat posed by nuclear proliferation, including by terrorists, and by the very 
existence of nuclear weapons. 

44. As part of its policy to support the peaceful use of nuclear energy and as a contribution to the 
AgencyÂs verification task and international security, Colombia had signed an additional protocol to its 
safeguards agreement in 2005 and was in the process of ratifying it. 
45. The NPT and the global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation system were facing serious 
challenges. In the first half of 2007, the first preparatory meeting for the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference had taken place. He stressed the need to participate in that process in a constructive spirit 
so that progress could be made. The NPTÂs main objective, namely international peace and security, 
could only be achieved by implementing all three of its pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and the 
right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. As a State Party to the Treaty, Colombia believed 
that the membership of the Ânuclear clubÂ must not increase and that efforts must be made to prevent 
not only horizontal but also vertical proliferation. The disarmament and non-proliferation system 
needed the support and agreement of all States in order to be effective. Colombia urged that renewed 
efforts be made to strengthen the NPT through the honouring of commitments undertaken and 
adherence by the whole international community. Also, the establishment of more NWFZs should be 
given the highest priority. 
46. For the Agency to fulfil its statutory objectives, a balance should be maintained among its three 
pillars, namely verification, technical cooperation and nuclear safety, particularly in view of the major 
challenges faced by developing countries. Nuclear technology development over the past fifty years 
had shown the great potential of nuclear applications for sustainable development. In the health field, 
Colombia emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs programme for cancer treatment, PACT. Since 
the Agency played a key role in the transfer of nuclear knowledge and technologies for peaceful 
purposes, efforts should be made to mobilize resources to enable it to strengthen that function. 
47. Given the importance of technical cooperation, it was paradoxical that the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme lacked assured, predictable and sufficient resources. Work should continue to 
ensure the resources necessary to strengthen the AgencyÂs technical cooperation function and its 
contribution to sustainable development. 
48. Colombia had benefited from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation in many areas important for 
social and economic growth and was also a contributor to the TCF. Colombia paid its NPCs and had 
worked with the Agency on a cost sharing basis. Ongoing national technical cooperation projects 
included one to determine optimal techniques in support of humanitarian demining activities, to which 
his country assigned great importance. 
49. At the regional level, Colombia had recently had the honour of presiding over the Board of 
Representatives of ARCAL, an organization which had contributed greatly to cooperation among 
developing countries during its 23 years of existence. Much progress had been made, particularly in 
developing a strategic regional profile, which would be of great assistance in planning future regional 
technical cooperation projects. Other ARCAL achievements during 2007 included the establishment of 
the ARCAL-Spain partnership and the approval of its work programme, which would consolidate the 
traditionally strong relations between Spain and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. 
50. The establishment of the ARCAL prize, awarded annually to an individual or institution which 
had contributed to the promotion of regional collaboration in the field of the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy, represented another significant step forward. The first ARCAL prize had been awarded to the 
nuclear institutions of the countries of the Andean Group in recognition of their efforts towards the 
peaceful development of nuclear energy.

51. Ensuring the safety and security of radioactive sources was fundamental. To that end, it was 
important to strengthen means of international cooperation so as to minimize the possible risks arising 
from the use of radioactive sources, as well as from illicit trafficking in radioactive material and its 
potential use for terrorist purposes. 
52. In 2007, Colombia had hosted an Agency review mission on control of public exposures and 
waste safety appraisal programme. The Agency had continued to support the process of regulatory 
harmonization and development, in line with the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources and its supplementary Guidance. Colombia was working actively to put the 
recommendations contained in those documents into practice and reiterated its support for the 
AgencyÂs efforts in that field. 
53. As a coastal State, Colombia attached special importance to the safe maritime transport of 
radioactive material and to strengthening the relevant legislative framework. Given the AgencyÂs 
competence in the area of transport safety, it should continue promoting dialogue and consultation 
among coastal and shipping States. It would be useful to have in place a pertinent legal instrument 
with broad accession by coastal and shipping States. With Agency support, progress had been made in 
the development of safety legislation, which should be made applicable to transport safety. 
54. The threat of proliferation, terrorism and illicit trafficking required a joint effort at all levels. 
The collective security system must be based on full respect for StatesÂ rights and take account of the 
needs of developing countries. Allied with a firm commitment to disarmament that would help build a 
future devoid of nuclear threat where the aspirations for development shared by the majority of the 
worldÂs countries could become reality. 
55. Mr. COGAN (Ireland) said that his country had long held the conviction that effective 
multilateralism was the best way to ensure international peace and security. For a small country like 
Ireland, the multilateral regime of disarmament and non-proliferation treaties provided the best 
guarantee of peace and security and it was therefore committed to upholding and strengthening such 
instruments and the institutions that oversaw their implementation. 
56. The NPT was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit 
of nuclear disarmament. Ireland was particularly attached to the Treaty because it had originated in a 
Ânon-disseminationÂ initiative taken in 1958 by the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank 
Aiken. Disarmament and non-proliferation were mutually reinforcing processes that should be pursued 
with equal vigour. At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, States Party to the NPT had agreed to 
thirteen practical steps for progressive implementation of Article VI of the Treaty. The 
nuclear-weapon States had given an unequivocal undertaking to eliminate their nuclear arsenals and a 
framework had been agreed for the purpose. Following the disappointment of the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference, it was vital to ensure that the 2010 review cycle achieved a successful outcome in respect 
of all aspects of the Treaty and contributed to achieving its universality. While progress had been 
made at the first meeting in the cycle, it was important to remain focused on the fundamental goal of 
eliminating all nuclear weapons. 
57. Ireland called on States that had not yet implemented a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol to do so without delay, since they constituted the only acceptable 
verification standard for ensuring the international communityÂs full confidence in the peaceful 
purposes of nuclear programmes. 
58. When the CTBT had been opened for signature in 1996, there had been great expectations of a 
new dawn in the pursuit of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Regrettably, eleven years later the 
international community was still awaiting the TreatyÂs entry into force. The need for a comprehensive 
ban on nuclear tests was greater than ever following the nuclear test by the DPRK less than a year

previously. He urged the DPRK to fully implement Security Council resolution 1718 (2006) and to 
implement its comprehensive safeguards agreement under the NPT. At the same time, he welcomed 
the DPRKÂs return to the six-party talks and strongly supported the AgencyÂs monitoring and 
verification measures at its nuclear facilities. The shutdown of the Yongbyon facility was a significant 
first step towards the dismantling of the DPRKÂs nuclear weapons programme. 

59. Ireland appreciated the AgencyÂs professional and impartial verification work in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. It hoped that the recently agreed work plan would resolve outstanding issues relating 
to IranÂs nuclear programme and reaffirmed its support for efforts to find a negotiated long-term 
solution. Nevertheless, Ireland remained concerned about IranÂs intentions and was disappointed at its 
failure to comply fully with Security Council resolutions 1696 (2006), 1737 (2006) and 1747 (2007) 
and with the resolutions adopted by the Board of Governors. It called on Iran to comply fully with 
their provisions, to suspend all enrichment related and reprocessing activities and to cooperate fully in 
an open and transparent manner with the Agency. 
60. Ireland did not consider that the use of nuclear energy for the generation of electric power 
provided a safe, sustainable and environmentally acceptable option. Unresolved problems associated 
with nuclear energy included the safety and security of nuclear installations, the transport of nuclear 
materials, the disposal of radioactive waste, the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, contamination of 
the marine and terrestrial environment, and the risk of accidents and proliferation. Ireland 
acknowledged, however, that its views were not shared by many other countries and that each country 
had the sovereign right to decide on its own energy mix. 
61. Similarly, Ireland did not share the belief that nuclear energy could help to solve the problem of 
global warming. The ongoing debate on the subject sought to downplay the environmental, waste, 
proliferation, nuclear liability and safety issues. Ireland had therefore hosted a meeting of like-minded 
ministers of the environment in Dublin in March 2007 in order to provide a counterweight to that 
debate by highlighting the issues that remained an integral part of the nuclear energy option after more 
than fifty years. It looked forward to participating in a follow-up meeting in Vienna in late September 
2007. 
62. In spite of its decision not to develop nuclear power, Ireland derived considerable benefit from 
its membership of the Agency. It appreciated the AgencyÂs pioneering work in such areas as 
agriculture, food, human health, as well as its vital role in promoting nuclear safety and security 
through safeguards and verification. A recent example of that role was the AgencyÂs dispatch of a 
team of experts in response to a request by the Japanese authorities following the earthquake that had 
affected the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant. 
63. General Conference resolution GC(46)/RES/9.D, adopted in 2002, concerning the Early 
Notification and the Assistance Conventions encouraged Member States to contribute to international 
efforts to develop a coherent and sustainable joint programme for a more efficient international 
response to nuclear emergencies. A meeting of competent authorities convened by the Agency in 
2003 had agreed to establish a National Competent AuthoritiesÂ Co-ordinating Group to develop an 
international action plan to strengthen the international emergency response system. Ireland had 
contributed $30 000 to the fund for the implementation of the action plan and encouraged other 
Member States to contribute also. 
64. Coastal States such as Ireland considered that, given the risks posed by shipments of nuclear 
materials, they should be informed of shipments that passed near their coasts, even if they were 
outside their territorial waters. They could then assess the risks and take appropriate emergency 
response measures. Ireland was seeking to strengthen the ongoing dialogue among coastal and 
shipping States with a view to improving communications between the governments concerned.

65. The use of the shared marine environment to discharge radioactive waste from reprocessing 
operations was neither acceptable nor sustainable. Moreover, the cost of reprocessing spent fuel was 
significantly higher than that of direct disposal. While States were free to decide whether or not to 
engage in reprocessing, such practical concerns should first be addressed. IrelandÂs concerns were not 
founded on abstract ideological policy but were informed by its negative safety and environmental 
experience. 
66. Ireland urged Member States to contribute to the Nuclear Security Fund, to which it had so far 
made voluntary contributions of approximately Â240 000. The question of funding of the Nuclear 
Security Plan for 2006Â2009 should be addressed in the context of the strategic review of Agency 
resources. 
67. Ireland also attached great importance to the TCF as a means of upgrading safety in beneficiary 
States and supported applications of non-power related nuclear technology. It had paid its full share of 
the TCF target for both 2006 and 2007. 
68. Mr. BEKOE (Ghana) said that his country acknowledged and appreciated the AgencyÂs role in 
the transfer of nuclear technologies to African Member States to address problems in the areas of 
health, agriculture, industry, environment and energy. Ghana attached great importance to technical 
cooperation as a mechanism for promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and its contribution to 
economic and social development. Ghana, which was utilizing nuclear energy in a number of fields to 
promote development, was grateful for the AgencyÂs support of regional and national projects. Ghana 
was making every effort to secure funding to expand and upgrade its infrastructure and intended to put 
in place a comprehensive cancer therapy programme. Also, Ghana welcomed the Agency initiative to 
develop isotope techniques for use in water resource management, which would find wide application 
in Africa given its water availability problems. 
69. To meet its target of achieving middle income status by 2015, Ghana was making efforts to 
assess and harness all available energy sources, including nuclear power. Ghana would soon be 
requesting Agency assistance in installing the necessary regulatory, legal and physical infrastructure to 
implement a nuclear power programme and in support of human resource development. Ghana had 
recently signed a statement of principles at a ministerial meeting of the Global Nuclear Energy 
Partnership which, it was hoped, would provide assistance in developing safety and security 
infrastructure. 
70. Human resource development and nuclear knowledge management were crucial for the safe and 
effective operation of nuclear facilities and Ghana had established a postgraduate school for nuclear 
sciences at the University of Ghana. The school, now in its second year, had 90 postgraduate students 
and offered 8 accredited programmes. Ghana recognized the major role the Agency had played in 
establishing the school. 
71. Ghana was in the process of establishing a national accelerator facility to strengthen its 
institutional capacities. His Government had already released funds to refurbish a building to house 
the facility and was securing funds towards cost-sharing of the project. Ghana would welcome 
financial assistance to implement the project and thanked the Agency for organizing a recent 
Technical Meeting on enhancing nuclear science education and training using accelerators in Accra. 
72. GhanaÂs efforts, with Agency assistance, to develop non-destructive testing methods were 
yielding positive results. He thanked the Agency for initiating the regional project on radioisotope and 
radiotracer applications and was of the view that nuclear technology could only be successfully 
applied in Africa if Member States strove to achieve sustainability of national nuclear institutions. 
Ghana welcomed Agency support for AFRA regional projects to build human capacities and establish 
quality management projects in collaboration with such regional partners as NEPAD and the 

GC(51)/OR.6

September 
2007,

11 


International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). The development of nuclear legislation 
and the establishment and expansion of radiation protection infrastructure were also important. 

73. Ghana commended the AgencyÂs efforts in supporting the creation of tsetse-free zones in Africa 
using the SIT. Ghana, a participant in PATTEC, was involved in the mass rearing of flies and 
welcomed the AgencyÂs commitment to using the SIT to suppress and eradicate anopheles mosquitoes 
in the fight against malaria. 
74. Ghana had finally taken the decision to establish a nuclear regulatory body, the Ghana Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority (GNRA), which was to be independent from the Ghana Atomic Energy 
Commission. 
75. Aware of the paramount importance of nuclear security, his country would intensify its efforts 
to implement the INSSP. An IPPAS mission had recently assessed the physical protection of GhanaÂs 
major nuclear facilities and every effort would be made to implement its recommendations. Ghana 
appreciated the role played by the AgencyÂs Office of Nuclear Security and reiterated its commitment 
to the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme. It intended to work closely with the Agency to host 
national and regional training courses in that field. 
76. Ghana adhered strictly to the NPT and already had an additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement in force. It welcomed the recent understanding reached with respect to the DPRKÂs nuclear 
activities and urged all concerned parties to continue negotiations aimed at a peaceful outcome. Ghana 
shared the serious concern of many other States regarding the slow progress towards nuclear 
disarmament, one of the central objectives of the NPT. 
77. In conclusion, he reaffirmed GhanaÂs support for Agency safeguards, safety and security and 
technology transfer activities and urged all Member States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes 
in conformity with their obligations under the NPT. 
78. Ms. GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE (Canada) stressed the importance of the Agency, which Canada 
had always strongly and actively supported throughout its history. The AgencyÂs three pillars had each 
made significant contributions towards the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Canada looked forward 
to a future of increased nuclear cooperation, increased use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
a universally-accepted enhanced safeguards and verification system. 
79. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the AgencyÂs 
role in verifying compliance was as unique as it was essential. Its safeguards system had been 
strengthened so that the Secretariat could draw broader safeguards conclusions, leading to increased 
confidence in the peaceful nature of StatesÂ nuclear programmes. Canada called on all States which 
had not joined the NPT to do so and on all States party to the NPT to accept the enhanced verification 
standard by entering into a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol with the 
Agency. 
80. Her country was following with interest recent developments which could lead to new 
safeguards agreements between India and the Agency. It welcomed closer collaboration which would 
increase the number of safeguarded facilities in India. 
81. Canada applauded the AgencyÂs efforts to resolve outstanding issues related to the Islamic 
Republic of IranÂs nuclear programme. Iran still had considerable work to do to achieve compliance 
with its obligations and resolve issues stemming from its history of concealment. Canada regarded the 
work plan between the Agency and Iran as a step in the right direction, but noted with grave concern 
from the Director GeneralÂs latest report that Iran had not suspended enrichment related activities. 
Canada urged Iran to comply with relevant Security Council resolutions by suspending all such 
activities and implementing its additional protocol. Only then would it be possible to verify IranÂs 

GC(51)/OR.6

12 


claims that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful. Canada would be closely monitoring the 
work planÂs progress to ensure that Iran followed through on its commitment to cooperate with the 
Agency. It was aware that further Security Council action might be necessary. 

82. Canada was deeply concerned by the DPRKÂs nuclear activities, including the nuclear explosive 
test conducted in October 2006, which was inconsistent with the DPRKÂs international commitments. 
Canada supported a peaceful solution to the issue through the six-party talks and welcomed the 
13 February 2007 agreement and consequent actions, including the shutdown of nuclear facilities at 
Yongbyon and the return of Agency personnel to the DPRK. Canada called on all parties to complete 
the implementation of that agreement and encouraged the DPRK to take further steps, including 
declaring all its nuclear programmes, disabling all existing nuclear facilities and recommitting itself to 
the NPT and Agency safeguards. As the DPRK moved towards meeting its commitments, Canada was 
reviewing the scope and nature of its engagement with the DPRK. 
83. The safeguards system had to be evolutionary in order to respond to new challenges and 
continue to provide the basis for credible safeguards conclusions. Therefore Canada attached great 
importance to a system that utilized a State level, rather than a facility level, perspective and featured 
transparency in process and non-discrimination in implementation. During the previous year, a State 
level safeguards approach had been introduced in Canada and was being implemented on a 
sector-by-sector basis. Full implementation of that approach would enable greater optimization and 
efficiency in a country which had historically received a significant proportion of the AgencyÂs 
inspection effort. 
84. The threat of nuclear terrorism required a concerted international response. Canada had 
contributed $8 million to the Nuclear Security Fund, as part of its commitment to the G8 Global 
Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, which made it the 
second largest donor State to the Fund. Canada looked forward to continuing to work with the Agency 
on nuclear security activities in Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union and continued 
to believe that the AgencyÂs nuclear security activities were an integral part of efforts to strengthen 
nuclear security and prevent, detect and respond to acts of nuclear terrorism. Encouraging other 
Member States to contribute to such efforts and to the Nuclear Security Fund, she said Canada would 
like to see more such activities funded by the Regular Budget. 
85. Canada believed that international standards, particularly Agency safety standards, should play 
a central role in ensuring consistent safety approaches and common safety goals. The Canadian 
Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) was represented on the AgencyÂs Commission on Safety 
Standards and its subcommittees and was continuing to use international standards and all available 
experience to regulate nuclear activities in Canada. 
86. Her country recognized the importance of sharing regulatory experience and good practices and 
was to host, with the support of the Agency, the CANDU Senior RegulatorsÂ Meeting in November 
2007 bringing together all countries operating such nuclear power plants. 
87. Looking back over its recent chairmanship of the 3rd Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety, Canada was proud of the achievements made. It was looking 
forward to the 4th Review Meeting in April 2008 as an opportunity to advance the ConventionÂs 
objectives. 
88. Nuclear energy formed an important part of CanadaÂs energy supply. Over the previous year, 
three applications for new reactors had been submitted to the CNSC and progress was being made 
with reactor refurbishments. Canada had a great deal to offer the international community in that 
sphere and would continue to share its capabilities as a responsible nuclear supplier country. As 
regards national developments in the nuclear industry, Canada looked forward to continued Agency

support for PHWR technology. The future looked bright as a new nuclear era was dawning and in that 
context Canada was pleased that it would host the 2008 summer institute of the World Nuclear 
University. 

89. Canada valued INPRO, which had generated considerable international interest. The project 
focused on innovative nuclear power and brought together technology developers and users, as a 
complement to the Generation IV International Forum. Canadian researchers were continuing their 
work on supercritical water reactors, which were seen as a natural future development of the CANDU 
reactor. 
90. Canada was a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and commended 
the SecretariatÂs efforts aimed at improved prioritizing and at answering more efficiently and 
effectively the needs of donors and recipients. Expressing appreciation for the excellent Technical 
Cooperation Report for 2006, she called on all States to submit their voluntary contributions to the 
TCF on time and, to the extent possible, in full. 
91. Ms. KAUPPI (Finland) said that the NPT remained the cornerstone of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and the Agency a key actor in it. Finland was in favour of universalization of 
the NPT, strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system, strengthening export controls, early entry 
into force of the CTBT and the immediate start of negotiations on an FMCT. 
92. Having welcomed the AgencyÂs report on assurance of supply of nuclear fuel, she said that 
access to nuclear fuel for peaceful use should be ensured. Finland noted that market neutrality was a 
fundamental criterion for any future nuclear fuel cycle mechanism. The various initiatives in the form 
of multilateral nuclear approaches that had been proposed, and also to extend multinational 
cooperation on the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, warranted further study. 
93. Finland strongly supported the strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system to reinforce the 
AgencyÂs capability and authority to provide assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear 
material. A comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol represented the 
current verification standard and Finland urged all States that had not yet done so to conclude and 
bring into force additional protocols. Finland had brought its additional protocol into force in 2004 and 
was about to begin the implementation of integrated safeguards, the aim of which was to improve 
efficiency and enhance cost-effectiveness. 
94. The upturn in worldwide interest in nuclear power, and the corresponding need to control and 
guarantee nuclear safety and security, posed a growing challenge for the Agency and the international 
community. Member States, on the one hand, should ensure that the Agency had sufficient financial 
resources to fulfil its mandate and the Agency, on the other, would have to continue its efforts to 
organize itself and its work efficiently and prioritize its use of resources. In that context, Finland noted 
the 20/20 study initiated by the Director General. 
95. There had been welcome progress in the field of nuclear security with the entry into force of the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in July 2007. Also, Finland 
called upon all States to complete early ratification of the amendment to the CPPNM, which would 
strengthen the global nuclear security regime. Her country had provided support in kind to the 
AgencyÂs activities in the fight against nuclear terrorism and was pleased to announce a further 
voluntary contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund. 
96. A high level of nuclear safety, including effective and sustainable infrastructures controlling the 
use of nuclear energy, was an indispensable prerequisite for the use of nuclear energy. The AgencyÂs 
work to support countries in developing nuclear safety and safety culture was very important. In 
particular, Finland appreciated, and had actively contributed to, the work of the Agency in setting up

14 


modern safety standards. Finland, which was party to all the international safety conventions, called 
upon all countries to accede to those conventions and comply with the related obligations. 

97. Finland, recognizing the importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, had 
always paid its share of the TCF target in full and on time and called upon all Member States to do the 
same. 
98. Nuclear energy had played a role in Finnish electricity production since the early 1980s and 
now accounted for one quarter of its production. There were four nuclear power plant units in 
operation in Finland with a fifth under construction. Environmental impact studies were under way 
regarding the possible construction of a sixth unit, but no decisions would be made until those studies 
were complete. 
99. Construction of the third-generation 1600 MW Olkiluoto 3 reactor was two years behind 
schedule. That delay indicated the difficulty of constructing a new nuclear power plant after many 
years of worldwide cessation. There was a general shortage of manufacturing capacity and experience 
in producing safety related equipment that met quality requirements. Increased size and stringent 
safety requirements posed new challenges in terms of design, construction and manufacturing making 
verification of safety and quality a demanding task for the power company and national authorities. 
100. Nuclear power production helped to meet the Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gas emission target. 
However, in its energy strategy Finland stressed the importance of a diversified energy mix and had 
set clear objectives for increasing the share of renewable energy sources. 
101. The use of nuclear power required a robust and reliable solution to final disposal of high level 
and long-lived nuclear waste. All the nuclear waste generated in Finland would be handled, stored and 
permanently disposed of in Finland following parliamentary ratification in 2001 of the construction of 
a final repository. The underground facility, in which it was planned to store spent nuclear fuel at a 
depth of 520 metres, was scheduled to be operational in 2020. In establishing the safeguards system 
for the future repository site there had been active cooperation between the Agency and Finland which 
included the sharing of information and experience and technical visits to the site. 
102. Mr. WIN (Myanmar) said that his country had eight national projects under the technical 
cooperation programme for 2007-2008. The Ministries of Health, Education, Livestock and Fisheries, 
Agriculture and Irrigation, and Science and Technology were cooperating with the Agency on the 
projects. The assistance his country had received in the form of equipment, experts and training had 
contributed to national development in many areas, including health, agriculture, food, livestock 
breeding and industry. A total allocation of $1.3 million had been recommended for Myanmar under 
the 2007Â2008 programme. The largest share of assistance had been allocated to radiation medicine 
and health (26%), followed by applications of isotopes and radiation in food and agriculture (20%), 
radiation safety and nuclear security (17%), and general atomic energy development (14%). The 
AgencyÂs continued support in that regard was greatly appreciated. 
103. A gradual increase in the application of nuclear techniques in medical diagnosis and industry as 
well as in academic research on peaceful nuclear technology was expected in Myanmar. An adequate 
radiation protection and radiation safety infrastructure had therefore become necessary and he thanked 
the Agency for its assistance through the national project on radiation protection and technical 
cooperation projects on establishing radiation protection infrastructure. He urged the General 
Conference to take further steps to promote technical assistance programmes, giving priority to 
projects for less developed Member States. 
104. Expressing support for the Nuclear Security Plan, he said that adequate nuclear security 
arrangements, including the physical protection of nuclear materials and associated nuclear facilities, 

GC(51)/OR.6 
19 
September 
2007, 
Page 
15 


the safety and security of radioactive sources, transport safety and security, and accounting for and 
control of nuclear material were prerequisites for the prevention of global nuclear terrorism and 
criminal acts. He called for the implementation of nuclear safeguards agreements by all Member 
States and welcomed the fact that the number of States that had not yet brought their comprehensive 
safeguards agreements into force had declined to 31 at the end of 2006. 

105. Myanmar had signed the NPT in 1992, a safeguards agreement in 1995 and the CTBT in 
1996. It had signed the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone at the fifth ASEAN 
summit in Bangkok in 1995. Myanmar believed that such zones were an effective means of preventing 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and of contributing to nuclear disarmament. 
106. The 1987 Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) for Asia and the Pacific, which was the 
AgencyÂs first regional agreement, had been extended for the fourth time for a further five years. 
Myanmar benefited from its membership and appreciated the AgencyÂs cooperative efforts under the 
RCA programme. 
107. Mr. PETRIC (Slovenia) said that a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an 
additional protocol was the current Agency verification standard and encouraged all States to bring 
into force such a standard. 
108. Slovenia welcomed the entry into force in July 2007 of the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, of which it had been among the first signatories. The 
Agency had assessed the threat of nuclear terrorism to be real, transnational and multifaceted. 
Effective measures had to be taken to minimize that threat. Resources were required to implement 
such activities and the AgencyÂs efforts were mainly financed by the Nuclear Security Fund, to which 
Slovenia was a donor. 
109. As a State party to the CPPNM, Slovenia had been involved in its revision and had begun the 
internal process of ratifying the amendments to it adopted in July 2005. 
110. Slovenia saw it as its role to assist the Agency in fulfilling the technical cooperation pillar of its 
mandate. It hosted Agency courses and accepted more than a dozen fellows from developing countries 
each year. Also, Slovenian experts were involved in the project to assist Serbia in decommissioning its 
nuclear sites. Slovenia had pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2008 and had decided to make a 
voluntary contribution to finance PACT. 
111. Slovenia, which recognized the AgencyÂs effort to upgrade its Incident and Emergency Centre, 
had made a financial contribution towards modernization of it in 2006. He stressed the need to 
establish sustainable emergency infrastructures, in relation to which Slovenia supported the 
implementation of the Response Assistance Network (RANET). 
112. Like many other countries, Slovenia was facing a growing demand for energy and was 
considering nuclear power as an option to meet that demand. The development of new and safer power 
plant designs would make that option more viable and so Slovenia was awaiting with interest the 
results of the multinational design evaluation programme, launched in 2006, to review the design of 
the European pressurized reactor. The programme could save a great deal of effort in licensing a 
particular design, which would be greatly appreciated by regulators with small nuclear programmes. 
113. Nuclear power plants were relatively inexpensive to operate, which made life extension 
attractive. SloveniaÂs sole nuclear power plant at KrÂko was in the third quarter of its design lifetime 
and its power generation had been significantly upgraded twice. An efficient programme to control 
equipment ageing and to ensure long term operational reliability had been developed at the plant, and 
many modifications had been made to upgrade nuclear safety.

114. Slovenia had prepared its fourth national report on nuclear safety, which was to be reviewed by 
the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 2007. Along with the Joint Convention, 
the Nuclear Safety Convention contributed greatly to the enhancement of nuclear safety and the safe 
management of radioactive waste. The peer review process provided a strong incentive to improve and 
harmonize nuclear safety. 
115. Slovenia planned to authorize a repository site for low and intermediate level radioactive waste 
in 2009 and to begin its operation in 2012. He noted that the issue of spent fuel management would be 
one of the parameters influencing the future of nuclear energy. Solutions to permanent disposal were 
developing slowly. Slovenia did not consider it reasonable that each country operating a nuclear power 
plant should construct its own spent fuel repository. More initiative and support was needed to develop 
regional approaches whereby one repository would be available to several countries. 
116. Slovenia had joined the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership in September 2007 and shared its 
vision of the need to expand nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in a safe and secure manner. 
117. Mr. KARIMOV (Azerbaijan) said that events over the preceding year had highlighted the 
difficulties in creating a climate of mutual trust in the world, based on strict application of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. Effective implementation of the NPT, along with additional measures to 
ensure nuclear security, were key to countering the new threats to international stability. Like other 
countries confronted with acts of aggression and separatism, Azerbaijan had to find answers to 
existing security challenges linked with terrorist threats and the illegal proliferation of nuclear and 
radioactive materials. 
118. Azerbaijan supported the efforts of the Agency and Member States to prevent acts of nuclear 
terrorism and was in favour of strengthening the physical protection regime for nuclear sites. It was 
concerned that it was untenable for the Agency or the national regulatory bodies to carry out their 
non-proliferation functions in a significant part of the territory of Azerbaijan which was occupied by 
neighbouring Armenia and separatists from Nagorno-Karabakh. That situation could lead to radical 
and extremist groups coming into possession of nuclear materials. Azerbaijan appreciated the 
AgencyÂs work to strengthen the nuclear security regime and called on the Agency to impose stricter 
controls on nuclear sites located in States which carried out a policy of aggression and occupation 
against their neighbours. 
119. Azerbaijan supported Security Council resolution 1540 on the non-proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction, which aimed to strengthen international cooperation in the struggle against such 
illegal trafficking. It noted the AgencyÂs role in countering threats to peace and stability and believed 
that the Agency and the international community should take decisive measures against any attempts 
to use temporarily occupied territory for illegal activities and the transit of sensitive materials, 
technologies or equipment. 
120. As part of its reform process, Azerbaijan was optimizing the work of its regulatory bodies 
responsible for radiation safety and control over work with sources of ionizing radiation. The 
responsible body in Azerbaijan was the Ministry for Emergency Situations, which had been created in 
2006. Cooperation between it and the Agency would promote the strengthening of the national 
radiation safety infrastructure and the creation of a reliable and effective accounting and control 
system for radioactive and nuclear materials. 
121. Recent technical cooperation between Azerbaijan and the Agency through national and regional 
projects had helped improve the legislative and regulatory framework for radiation safety and had 
significantly improved the technical equipment of all the State bodies responsible for ensuring the safe 
management of radioactive materials. 

GC(51)/OR.6

122. One of the most important achievements of technical cooperation with the Agency in 
Azerbaijan had been the preservation and expansion of nuclear knowledge, which was the 
fundamental basis for nuclear safety, for the further development of safe nuclear technologies and for 
improving nuclear education. Azerbaijan greatly valued the Agency initiative to develop a strategic 
approach to nuclear safety education and training. 
123. Technical cooperation activities in Azerbaijan had led to the successful implementation of 
projects to set up a modern long term storage facility for highly radioactive sources and also a cancer 
therapy centre which met the highest international standards. A nuclear medicine laboratory had been 
set up at the national oncology centre and the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources now had a 
laboratory for radionuclide monitoring. Such projects were considered by Azerbaijan to be major 
contributions to the countryÂs safety and development. 
124. Azerbaijan intended to promote the development of innovative nuclear technologies. Thus, 
projects to broaden the use of radioisotopic methods in health, industry and agriculture, to establish a 
research reactor and to develop and introduce nanotechnology would be given high priority in its 
cooperation with the Agency. He noted that Azerbaijan devoted significant budgetary resources to 
technical cooperation projects and that it duly met its financial obligations to the AgencyÂs Regular 
Budget and the TCF. 
125. In conclusion, he reiterated AzerbaijanÂs wholehearted support for the AgencyÂs role in the 
peaceful use of atomic energy and ensuring global peace and stability. 
126. Mr. SANZ OLIVA (Spain) congratulated the Director General and the Secretariat for following 
the spirit of the Nobel Prize CommitteeÂs declaration by setting up the IAEA Nobel Cancer and 
Nutrition Fund at the start of 2006. 
127. The challenges facing the AgencyÂs safeguards system had attracted increased international 
attention, particularly in recent years. His Government, as a promoter of active multilateralism, 
supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to clarify the outstanding questions related to IranÂs past 
nuclear programme and considered the work programme agreed with the Iranian authorities to be a 
step in the right direction. In that regard, he pointed to the need for Iran to meet its international 
obligations and the continued validity of the European UnionÂs offer of assistance. 
128. Spain believed that the most effective method that the Agency and the international community 
could and should adopt to respond to the threat posed to international security by nuclear proliferation, 
was to ensure the rapid and universal implementation of the additional protocol, which was essential to 
strengthen the safeguards system and to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. It was therefore a 
cause for concern that, ten years after adoption of the Model Additional Protocol, more than 100 States 
had still not brought their respective additional protocols into force, and a significant number of 
countries carrying out relevant nuclear activities had not yet signed one. 
129. Spain considered it crucial to strengthen cooperation and coordination between Euratom and the 
Agency at all levels. In that regard, the high level coordination meeting between those two institutions 
held on 18 January 2007 had been a very positive step that would undoubtedly contribute to achieving 
the necessary conditions for the application of integrated safeguards in the European Union as quickly 
as possible. However, several technical and procedural questions remained as regards the respective 
roles of both institutions. Spain highlighted the positive results achieved under the pilot programme 
agreed by its national authorities, the Agency and Euratom for the implementation of a new regime of 
short notice random safeguards inspections at the Juzbado nuclear fuel element fabrication plant in 
Salamanca. The programmeÂs success, largely owing to the excellent coordination among the 
institutions and the operatorÂs willingness to collaborate, offered high hopes for early implementation

September 
2007, 
Page 
18 


of the new regime. The experience acquired would certainly be beneficial in setting up similar regimes 
at other facilities of that type in the European Union. 

130. SpainÂs willingness to cooperate with the Department of Safeguards was demonstrated by its 
contribution of Â400 000 in support of nuclear verification R&D projects. That commitment also 
extended to activities undertaken by the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security to improve the 
security of nuclear material and facilities and highly radioactive sources. 
131. A priority for the Spanish Government was the development of an integrated national system to 
ensure the security of its nuclear industry and all activities involving nuclear material, as well as to 
prevent and disclose illicit trafficking and improper use of nuclear and radioactive material. To that 
end, the national system, which was coordinated and implemented by national institutions and law 
enforcement bodies, was subject to constant self-evaluation and self-improvement. The support given 
by the Agency to its Member States through Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plans was of great 
importance. Spain offered the support, experience and collaboration of all its relevant institutions to 
combat nuclear terrorism and the illicit use of radioactive material. Spain was committed to combating 
nuclear and radiological threats, as shown by its entry into the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism. It had contributed Â200 000 to the Nuclear Security Fund in 2006 and a further Â355 000 in 
2007 to improve the AgencyÂs capabilities in that field. Spain supported the resolution before the 
General Conference submitted by the Governments of France and Germany on measures to protect 
against nuclear terrorism. 
132. In 2005, the amendment to the CPPNM had been adopted by consensus at a diplomatic 
conference. Spain hoped that the States party to the Convention would ratify that amendment so that it 
could enter into force as early as possible. For its part, Spain was close to concluding its ratification 
procedure. It offered the Secretariat assistance in reviewing and updating document INFCIRC/225 on 
the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities with the objective of incorporating 
changes resulting from the amendment. Spain supported the SecretariatÂs initiatives to develop 
information systems to help combat nuclear terrorism and illicit trafficking, integrating databases 
already existing in the Agency and complementing other international initiatives. 
133. As regards the possible existence of uncontrolled radioactive sources, his Government was 
aware that, although Spain had regulatory systems for controlling the use and possession of 
radioactive sources, it could not rule out occasional sources outside those systems. Therefore, with the 
assistance of the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council, it had launched a campaign, under the responsibility 
of ENRESA (National Company for Radioactive Waste), for the recovery of orphan radioactive 
sources. That initiative provided continuity to other effective measures already implemented in Spain. 
134. Spain welcomed the entry into force of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts 
of Nuclear Terrorism and the BoardÂs decision to authorize the Director General to implement the 
functions assigned to the Agency under that Convention. 
135. Spain supported all the AgencyÂs nuclear safety and radiation protection activities, in particular 
those aimed at consolidating and strengthening national regulatory bodies. The Secretariat should 
increase its efforts to set up assistance programmes to ensure that all countries had a regulatory body 
in accordance with Agency standards. 
136. The growing use of radiodiagnostic techniques and radiopharmaceuticals, as well as the 
substantial progress in radiotherapy to combat various types of cancer, brought with it an increasing 
challenge to ensure the radiation safety of patients and workers. As a member of the Ibero-American 
Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, Spain was collaborating with Latin 
American countries to strengthen the capabilities of regulatory authorities. However, controls over the 
use of radioactive material for medical and industrial applications were still in need of improvement. 

GC(51)/OR.6

September 
2007,

19 


The Agency should increase its support for associations such as the Ibero-American Forum so that the 
countries involved could benefit from the lessons learned by other countries with more experience. 

137. Spain supported collaboration among countries of the Mediterranean region to improve 
radiation protection and radioactive waste management. Greater cooperation among countries with 
developed regulatory capabilities in those fields and countries just embarking on an activity involving 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy would be beneficial. 
138. Spain had been preparing for its IRRS mission in January 2008 and was grateful to Agency staff 
for their help in that regard. Such missions were the best tool available to the international community 
for the review, verification and improvement of national regulatory capabilities. The success of the 
IRRS missions meant that there was a need to expand resources to meet all the requests and to 
improve verification tools, learning from the experience gained by completed missions. SpainÂs 
Nuclear Safety Council had suggested that the Agency organize a follow-up workshop at the end of 
2008 or beginning of 2009 to sum up the experience acquired from the missions carried out in 
2007 and 2008. 
139. With many countries building their first nuclear power plants, support for the creation of 
competent and rigorous regulatory bodies and systems should be a priority for the Agency. OSART 
missions were a useful Agency tool for reviewing the safety of a nuclear facility. The lessons learned 
from such missions could be put to better use by organizing a system for sharing the knowledge 
accrued. The Spanish authorities attached great importance to promoting a safety culture at nuclear 
facilities. The Secretariat should continue its efforts to strengthen activities aimed at understanding 
and dealing with problems caused by a lack of safety culture and to facilitate the development of 
methods ensuring that nuclear facility management paid due attention to safety culture. 
140. Spain attached great importance to the development and application of INES, which its Nuclear 
Safety Council had been using since 1990. Since 2002, the Council had been expanding the 
application of INES to cover radiological and transport events. The classification of events through 
INES provided countries with a homogeneous risk evaluation that could be understood by the public. 
Spain supported the Agency in its task to develop and promote a single scale for use by Member 
States, enabling better harmonization in categorizing nuclear and radiological events. 
141. While the ICRP had finished its revision of its publication No. 60 setting forth 
recommendations on radiological protection, the Agency had begun the process of revising its BSS, a 
process in which Spain was participating actively. Aware of the importance of the AgencyÂs standards 
and with a view to increasing the dissemination of such texts, the Nuclear Safety Council was 
financing their translation into Spanish. Spain encouraged other countries to follow its initiative so as 
to enable all countries to have access to the AgencyÂs standards in their own language. 
142. As regards the AgencyÂs activities in technological innovation, Spain was particularly interested 
in the analysis of various multilateral approaches to front-and back-end nuclear fuel cycle activities. 
Attention must always be paid to the various strategic implications of those approaches, avoiding any 
kind of discriminatory positions among Member States and the risk of nuclear proliferation. Spain 
welcomed the fact that more countries had joined INPRO in 2006, bringing the total number of 
members to 28, and was pleased to see how much relevance the project had gained since its inception. 
143. Spain paid its full share of the TCF target. Also, it had contributed extrabudgetary funds for 
footnote-a/ projects in Latin America in the fields of human health, nutrition and groundwater 
management, and had made an extrabudgetary contribution of Â67 000 to PACT. Moreover, SpainÂs 
Nuclear Safety Council had supported the Agency with an extrabudgetary contribution of Â300 000 in 
2006, and a similar contribution was planned for 2007, to fund a project supported by the 
Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, which would allow 

GC(51)/OR.6

20 


progress in the development of nuclear and radiation safety in Ibero-America by establishing, inter 
alia, an Ibero-American network for radiological safety knowledge management. In 2006, the Nuclear 
Safety Council also had made an extrabudgetary contribution for projects in Latin America related to 
radiation protection, health and to the control of radioactive sources, and also in Morocco for the 
establishment of a national regulatory body. Spain had assisted by providing experts for missions, 
offering training courses, subsidizing fellowships and receiving fellows and scientific visits at Spanish 
institutions and companies, mainly at CIEMAT (Research Centre for Energy, Environment and 
Technology). Spain was prepared to strengthen its cooperation activities under ARCAL by means of 
the active participation of CIEMAT and with a financial contribution of approximately Â130 000 for 
various projects. In October 2006, his Government had approved SpainÂs association with ARCAL, 
designating CIEMAT as the executive body and in April 2007, the President of the Board of ARCAL 
Representatives had visited CIEMAT for a ceremony to celebrate that association, with substantial 
representation from the Agency. 

144. ENRESA had continued its active participation in technical cooperation, especially with 
Ibero-America, supporting the planning and potential implementation of projects related to waste 
management. 
145. Spain took note of the improvements made to management of the technical cooperation 
programme in order to optimize the resources available and of the fact that, in 2006, Latin America 
had received a fairer share of the funds distributed among the four geographical regions. 
146. Nuclear power continued to play an important role in Spain. The country had 8 nuclear power 
units in operation at 6 sites with an installed power of 7 716 MW, which represented 9.3% of the total 
installed power for electricity generation. In 2006, the gross electricity generation from nuclear power 
had been 60 126 GWÂ·h, which was 19.8% of the total electricity generated nationally. The Ministry of 
Industry, Tourism and Trade was carrying out a study of SpainÂs energy needs by the year 2030, in 
which it intended to perform an objective and rigorous analysis of the role of all the primary energy 
sources with a view to ensuring a long term, high quality, environmentally friendly energy supply at a 
reasonable price. 
147. A round table had been held in Spain in 2006 to discuss the future development of nuclear 
power. One outcome had been recognition of the need to embark on a national debate on how to 
establish a sustainable network of primary energy sources for the long term which had wide political 
and social support. The resulting decisions would affect the well-being and quality of life of Spaniards 
in the future. 
Mr. 
HIGUERAS 
RAMOS 
(Peru), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


148. Mr. ZOGRAFOS (Greece) said that his country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to promote 
nuclear safety and security and was party to all the relevant conventions. Although individual Member 
States bore responsibility for the safe operation of their nuclear facilities, the Agency played the lead 
role in establishing safety norms and standards. Experts from the Greek Atomic Energy Commission 
participated in Agency activities, including the preparation of standards and technical documents and 
the organization of missions and training courses. Greece followed Agency and European Union 
guidelines on the security and safety of radioactive sources. 
149. Decommissioning and the safe termination of nuclear activities were of great importance to 
Greece, which had organized, in conjunction with the Agency, the OECD/NEA and the European 
Commission, an international conference on the subject in December 2006 with participants from 
more than 50 countries and 6 organizations.

150. Greece valued the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme and made financial and in-kind 
contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund. The publication of guidance covering border monitoring 
equipment, nuclear forensics support and radioactive material monitoring was of great importance in 
assisting Member States in curbing terrorist activities. Greece supported the AgencyÂs nuclear security 
and verification activities within the framework of implementation of the relevant European Union 
strategy and had organized seminars on security issues together with the Agency. 
151. Greece participated in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking information system, relevant United 
Nations committees, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism and had signed the CPPNM. Also, Greece had ratified the International Convention for the 
Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism adopted by the General Assembly and would support any 
effort to assist the implementation of the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Plan. 
152. On safeguards matters, he noted that in recent years the AgencyÂs safeguards system had 
encountered more limitations and certain States had used the negotiation of Subsidiary Arrangements 
and Facility Attachments as an opportunity to present the Agency with further restrictions by invoking 
national legislation or political considerations. 
153. In the light of the agreement reached on 13 February 2007 in the framework of the six-party 
talks, Greece hoped that the DPRK would take steps towards prompt and verifiable denuclearization 
of the Korean Peninsula in conformity with international security standards, including disarmament 
and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. 
154. Greece appreciated the Director GeneralÂs efforts to achieve full cooperation and transparency 
regarding the Islamic Republic of IranÂs nuclear programme and reaffirmed its support for a negotiated 
long term solution of the issue. IranÂs authorities should be encouraged to answer all outstanding 
questions without further delay. The Director GeneralÂs recent report, contained in document 
GOV/2008/48 indicated that, although certain positive steps had been made by Iran, further progress 
was needed in implementing the Security Council resolutions on the suspension of enrichment 
activities and on the AgencyÂs request that Iran reconsider application of Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary 
Arrangements, General Part. Greece considered the work plan agreed between the Agency and Iran to 
be a positive step towards creating confidence in IranÂs peaceful nuclear intentions. It therefore hoped 
that Iran would demonstrate good faith and full transparency, paving the way for the suspension of all 
enrichment related and reprocessing activities and adoption of its additional protocol. The opportunity 
for a peaceful settlement of the issue should not be missed. 
155. It was unfortunate that, fifty years after the foundation of the Agency, no substantive progress 
had been made in non-proliferation and disarmament. Today, the threat of nuclear terrorism and 
regional conflicts still hung over the future of the world like the sword of Damocles. The 
non-proliferation regime had to be strengthened and that could be achieved only through global 
implementation of Agency safeguards with additional protocols in force. National and multilateral 
export controls relied on Agency safeguards to verify that exported items were not diverted. The 
efficacy and effectiveness of safeguards helped to create confidence and promote trade and 
cooperation. Export controls alone without strict safeguards would not help to maintain peace and 
security. 
156. The Director General had proposed an initiative to achieve multilateral control of sensitive 
nuclear technologies which focused on the issues of assurance of supply and non-proliferation. The 
Director General had stated that it was time to limit the production of new material through 
reprocessing and enrichment, by agreeing to restrict such operations to facilities under multinational 
control. Greece supported the principle of establishing a mechanism for the assured supply of nuclear 
fuel.

157. For many years, Greece had been a beneficiary of Agency technical cooperation. Specialized 
laboratories had been set up and scientists had been able to complete their education and gain 
experience abroad. Now Greece was also a donor and was returning the AgencyÂs investment by 
supporting its activities, organizing training courses, providing experts and hosting scientists from 
different regions of the world. The needs of other countries now had priority over those of Greece. 
158. Greece intended to maintain and enhance its regional scientific contacts and cooperation on 
subjects such as radiation protection, environmental radioactivity control, illicit trafficking and nuclear 
safety and security. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission had been recognised as an Agency 
regional training centre and a number of seminars and training courses had been planned for the year 
ahead. Technical cooperation programmes should be well-designed and implemented through a 
network of partnerships. An important element in their planning and execution was the Âone-houseÂ 
principle. 
159. Greece was confident that the AgencyÂs strenuous efforts to achieve peace through diplomacy, 
on the one hand, and technological and economic development, on the other, would bear fruit. 
160. Mr. KODAH (Jordan) expressed appreciation of the AgencyÂs contribution to the 
socio-economic well-being of Member States through the promotion of diverse peaceful uses of 
nuclear science and technology, the provision of training opportunities for national personnel and its 
assistance in the development of infrastructure for radiation protection and the safety and security of 
radioactive sources. 
161. Many countries, including Jordan, were facing a serious crisis due to their inability to meet 
increasing energy needs at a time of soaring energy prices. The shortage of potable water was an 
equally pressing issue, compounded by declining rainfall and diminishing water quality. He urged the 
Agency to redouble its efforts to assist the countries concerned in surmounting their problems. Jordan, 
for instance, urgently needed help from the Agency and donor countries in harnessing nuclear energy 
for electricity generation and water desalination. It had taken steps, in cooperation with the Agency, to 
include nuclear energy among the countryÂs range of options for electricity generation. Moreover, 
Jordan had recently enacted Law No. 42 of 2007 concerning the development of peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, pursuant to which an independent Atomic Energy Commission had been established. 
Its main functions were to promote the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology and the building of 
nuclear power reactors. In addition, a company for the exploitation of natural uranium ore and the 
extraction of uranium from phosphates had been established. 
162. Jordan had received assistance under the technical cooperation programme for national projects 
and had participated in regional and interregional projects in a number of areas such as agriculture, 
medicine, pharmaceuticals, industry, radiation protection and monitoring, nuclear legislation, safety 
and security, training, improving national capabilities and the acquisition of materials and equipment. 
Thanking the Agency for its support, he mentioned in particular the interregional synchrotron project. 
Jordan was currently engaged, with the AgencyÂs assistance, in training human resources in the 
physics of synchrotron radiation processes and applications. 
163. Jordan had enacted Law No. 43 of 2007 concerning radiation protection and nuclear safety and 
security pursuant to which an Authority for the Organization of Radiation and Nuclear Activities had 
been established. The Authority, which was linked to the Prime MinisterÂs office, was responsible for 
organizing and overseeing the use of nuclear energy and ionizing radiation. It would complete the 
drafting of safety and security regulations and guidelines for radioactive sources based on the 
AgencyÂs recommendations. Jordan would also develop its national register of radioactive sources in 
accordance with the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources.

164. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system was the cornerstone of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, which was supported by the majority of States. JordanÂs position on 
weapons of mass destruction was based on its awareness of the threat they constituted to world peace 
and security and its support for the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. Jordan was a party to the NPT and had signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol with the Agency and faithfully complied with its obligations under those 
instruments. He urged States that had not yet signed additional protocols to do so forthwith. Moreover, 
the Jordanian Government called on Israel to accede to the NPT and to comply with all its provisions. 
165. Mr. GRIMA (Malta) said that new threats and challenges to international peace and security, 
including illicit trafficking in nuclear material and non-compliance with Agency safeguards, had 
emerged since the creation of the Agency fifty years before and the international community had to 
respond with existing and, when appropriate, new tools. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the 
international non-proliferation regime and Malta called on those States not yet party to it to join it as 
non-nuclear-weapon States as soon as possible. 
166. Those challenges also required the strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with an additional protocol were the current 
verification standard and Malta urged those States that had not done so to adopt both without delay. 
167. Malta was pleased to note the progress being made on the DPRK issue through the six-party 
talks and welcomed Agency verification of the shutdown of the nuclear installations at Yongbyon. 
Also, Malta appreciated the AgencyÂs continuing efforts to resolve issues related to the Islamic 
Republic of IranÂs nuclear programme through the work plan and its implementation would help build 
the confidence called for by the international community. 
168. Malta appreciated the AgencyÂs work to support Member States in developing and 
implementing measures to suppress nuclear terrorism. Its recent publication of new guidelines and 
recommendations on the security of radioactive material during transport complemented existing 
transport safety guidance. Full implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 was an essential 
part of the effort to prevent terrorists from acquiring nuclear and other radioactive material. Malta had 
been one of the first States to sign the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear 
Terrorism, which had entered into force in July 2007, and viewed the CPPNM and its amendment as 
important parts of the nuclear security architecture. 
169. Nuclear safety was of increasing importance at both the national and international level as the 
demand for nuclear power rose. Malta therefore welcomed the AgencyÂs activities to assist States in 
matters of nuclear safety, and intended to play an active role in the international effort to ensure the 
highest safety standards. It was currently in the process of acceding to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety. 
170. The exercise of the inalienable right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes 
brought with it a responsibility to meet the highest standards of safety and security. Malta supported 
the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and urged all countries to 
implement both it and the associated Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
171. Malta stressed the importance of States upgrading their national regulatory authorities and 
radiation protection infrastructure. Malta viewed positively the development of a global nuclear and 
radiation safety network for exchanging experience and best practice and would support the 
establishment of a similar network for the Mediterranean region. In that context, Malta welcomed the 
recent establishment of the draft Safety Requirements on the safety of fuel cycle facilities as an 
Agency safety standard.

172. With regard to the safety of marine transport of radioactive material, Malta stressed the 
importance of better communication between States shipping radioactive material and coastal States. 
The latter should be kept fully informed of shipments of nuclear material in their vicinity. 
173. Malta appreciated the contribution made by the Agency to promoting scientific and 
technological capabilities throughout the world through its technical cooperation projects. In 
particular, it applauded PACT and had pledged MaltaÂs surplus from the 2004 Regular Budget to fund 
that programme. Malta benefited from national and regional technical cooperation projects in a 
number of fields and participated in Agency training courses and international conferences. 
174. Malta reiterated its support for the AgencyÂs indispensable role in efforts to build a stronger 
international framework for peace and security in accordance with its Statute. 
175. Mr. NEZAM (Afghanistan) said that his country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to promote 
peace and security. Universal compliance with all international non-proliferation instruments, 
especially in the nuclear sphere, was of fundamental importance and Afghanistan supported all 
initiatives aimed at limiting nuclear proliferation, such as the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle 
East. Afghanistan had been one of the first States to ratify the NPT and to conclude a safeguards 
agreement. It had also ratified the CTBT in 2003 and signed an additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency in 2005. 
176. Afghanistan condemned all activities related to nuclear terrorism and supported measures taken, 
whether through international conventions or Agency and United Nations resolutions, to fight it. As a 
State in an extremely unstable and troubled region, Afghanistan was at the forefront of efforts to 
combat terrorism, but was concerned by its lack of resources and equipment. It requested that suitable 
detection and protection equipment be made available to strengthen its capacity to address the problem 
of illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials at its borders. 
177. Afghanistan supported and appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, which 
contributed to strengthening national capacities based on national needs and priorities. He highlighted 
in particular the use of nuclear applications in the field of human health, above all against cancer. 
Greater attention should be given to assisting the least developed countries in closing the gap in terms 
of nuclear knowledge and the benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Afghanistan was 
grateful to the Agency for the regional and subregional training courses which had allowed it to 
acquire the expertise to integrate nuclear techniques into its development programme. 
178. The degree of cooperation between the Agency and Afghanistan had been satisfactory and his 
delegation hoped it would be further developed in the future. Afghanistan had defined its nuclear 
technology priorities in the fields of health, agriculture, education, water resources and food. It was 
pleased that the technical cooperation requests it had submitted had been approved and ten national 
projects had been implemented in the period 2007Â2008. Successful results had been achieved through 
the training, technology transfer and expert assistance provided under the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme. 
179. Afghanistan would attempt to consolidate that cooperation with the Agency in the coming years 
and hoped that the new project concepts submitted to the Agency for the period 2009Â2011 would be 
well received. He regretted the delay in their submission, which was a direct result of the exceptional 
situation in which the country found itself. 
180. His Government, aware of the need for an adequate infrastructure for radiation protection and 
waste safety, was in the process of drawing up relevant legislation with Agency assistance. In addition, 
Afghanistan had just set up a high commission for atomic energy and was hoping for support from the 
Agency to enable it to function effectively. In November 2007, Afghan experts were due to come to 

GC(51)/OR.6

25 


Vienna for discussions with Agency legal experts with a view to strengthening the national legal 
framework so that peaceful applications of nuclear techniques could be developed in a secure manner. 

181. In conclusion, he noted that Afghanistan, despite its financial difficulties, had managed to 
honour its financial obligations on time for the past three years. 
182. Mr. BAZOBERRY (Bolivia) said that since its creation in 1957 the Agency had become the 
principal intergovernmental forum for activities relating to nuclear science and technology and their 
applications. Its technical cooperation activities were growing apace. The exchange of scientific and 
technical information, and the promotion of theoretical and practical knowledge about the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy, provided the means for countries to pursue their nuclear power programmes 
safely and effectively. 
183. Over the fifty years of its existence, the Agency had fulfilled its twin mandates of preventing the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and promoting the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The 
Director General had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the 
dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The Peace Prize signified recognition 
of the AgencyÂs work to prevent the use of nuclear energy for military purposes. As President of the 
General Conference in 2005, he had himself travelled to Oslo for the award ceremony. At the 
ceremony, the Director General had spoken of the AgencyÂs role in tackling poverty as well as in 
combating proliferation. 
184. His delegation attached special importance to the AgencyÂs work in promoting nuclear science 
and technology for sustainable development, which contributed to the achievement of the United 
Nations Millennium Development Goals and to the struggle against poverty, hunger and disease. It 
also helped to improve the management of natural resources, combat environmental degradation and 
climate change, and secure environmental sustainability. In that connection, he emphasized the value 
of the AgencyÂs work on the use of isotope and nuclear techniques to develop and manage water 
resources, and to measure the impact of climate change on water supplies. Bolivia supported its efforts 
to enhance cooperation with national and international organizations in identifying strategies to 
alleviate shortages of drinking water. 
185. To protect its tropical and rainforest resources and its biodiversity, Bolivia had adopted a 
five-year plan for their sustainable use, endeavouring to strike a balance between conservation and 
economic development. In the drive to produce more energy, due account must be taken of both direct 
and indirect impacts on the environment, especially in areas of fragile ecological equilibrium, like the 
Amazon Basin. 
186. His delegation attached great importance to the nuclear applications relevant to the prevention, 
diagnosis and treatment of disease, and especially to regional activities in the framework of the 
AgencyÂs PACT. The PACT pilot programmes established in six Member States would serve as the 
foundation for expanding the programme to other developing countries. Newly-diagnosed cancer cases 
were expected to rise by 2020 to 16.5 million a year, of which 70% would be in developing countries 
because of the lack of early detection. He therefore urged the international community to step up its 
donations to the PACT programme. Bolivia, with one of the highest rates of cervical cancer in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, was grateful to Deputy Director General Cetto for her support for a cancer 
treatment programme in Bolivia. In the framework of ARCAL, a regional strategy for 2007Â2013 
had been developed by the Department of Technical Cooperation to promote the use of nuclear 
energy in accordance with the needs and priorities of the region. In addition, Bolivia acknowledged 
the constant support of SpainÂs CIEMAT. 
187. Mr. LEGWAILA (Botswana) said that, at a time when the world was facing challenges posed 
by natural calamities, diseases, security threats and economic downturns, it was encouraging to note 

GC(51)/OR.6 
19 
September 
2007, 
Page 
26 


that the AgencyÂs programmes on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy were increasingly recognized as 
viable and sustainable solutions to those problems. 

188. Botswana was committed to developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy in conformity with 
the NPT. Efforts by any one nation or group to divert atomic energy for military uses must be 
discouraged at all cost. In conformity with its obligations as a Member State of the Agency, Botswana 
had concluded an NPT safeguards agreement and additional protocol in 2006, had finalized the 
relevant legislative instruments and had established a radiation protection board and inspectorate. 
189. The AgencyÂs safeguards regime was crucial to implementation of the NPT and must be 
strengthened. He trusted that the forthcoming regional technical meeting on additional protocol 
implementation in Africa to be held in Gaborone, Botswana, in October 2007 would encourage 
Member States to conclude and implement outstanding instruments as soon as possible. 
190. He expressed his countryÂs gratitude for the invaluable expert advice, equipment and training 
provided by the Agency and thanked the Director General and Agency staff for facilitating the 
implementation of a range of technical cooperation projects in his country. 
191. Botswana also participated in AFRA. The immense benefits of AFRA projects were being felt 
in areas such as agriculture, health, water resources and food and nutrition. His country had to rely on 
outside support for the acquisition, adoption, adaptation and use of appropriate nuclear technologies to 
promote economic development, thus contributing to poverty reduction and the attainment of the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
192. The HIV/AIDS pandemic continued to put tremendous pressure on BotswanaÂs health care 
system. Efforts were therefore under way, with Agency support, to research food and nutrition 
intervention techniques using stable isotopes. The research was expected to yield crucial information 
on the effectiveness of feeding programmes and, subsequently, the management of HIV/AIDS. 
193. Botswana had identified several potential areas of cooperation with the Agency during the 
2009Â2011 project cycle, namely: agricultural uses of nuclear science and technology, including SIT; 
induced mutations and nutrient uptake; improvement of livestock productivity using assisted 
reproductive techniques; and improved diagnosis of animal diseases. In the health sector, plans were 
under way to set up a high dose rate brachytherapy unit for cancer treatment. Botswana also planned to 
set up a national INIS centre and a telecentre for information and communication technology based 
training and learning under the AFRA programme. 
194. Mr. ENKHBAT (Mongolia) said that his country strongly supported the AgencyÂs efforts to 
strengthen the global safeguards system. Mongolia fulfilled its commitments under its additional 
protocol and was making every effort to keep its territory free from nuclear weapons. He emphasized 
the importance of the spread of NWFZs and was confident that MongoliaÂs bilateral cooperation with 
the Agency would play an important role in international recognition of MongoliaÂs 
nuclear-weapon-free status. 
195. As a developing country, Mongolia was facing many challenges. Technical cooperation projects 
had been a valuable support and a vital bridge between it and the Agency. In 2006 a number of 
projects had been successfully implemented in such areas as agriculture, health, environment, human 
resource development, geology and mining. A project to improve quality assurance in radiotherapy 
services had proved a sound investment in the countryÂs health sector. Also, Mongolia was actively 
involved in the work of the RCA and commended its activities. For the past decade Mongolia had 
participated actively in and benefited from regional and international projects to improve radiation 
safety and security infrastructure.

196. Mongolia had recently been paying special attention to uranium exploration and mining. 
Uranium deposits were included on a 2006 national list of mining deposits of strategic importance and 
his Government had begun to formulate a national policy on the issue. It was clear that uranium 
exploration and further consideration of the construction of a nuclear power plant, based on modern 
nuclear technology and with high safety and security standards, could be of great benefit to sustainable 
development. Mongolia looked forward to cooperating with the Agency and using its technical 
expertise in developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also hoped that developed countries 
with advanced nuclear energy technology would provide advice and support. 
197. Mongolia was a country covering a vast territory, with long borders and a small population. As 
a result, border security presented a serious challenge at a time of increased concern regarding 
transnational crime, including trafficking in nuclear related materials. MongoliaÂs efforts to respond to 
such threats had been hampered by a shortage of trained personnel and appropriate equipment. In 
response to MongoliaÂs appeal under Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, the United States of America had offered to fund a project to strengthen 
its export and import controls and to enhance the technical capability of border control agencies to 
detect nuclear and other radioactive material. Mongolia appreciated the offer and hoped that the 
project would soon be realized.

(GC(51)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
AAS 
(Norway) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
just 
completed 
a 
two-year 
term 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
It 
had 
remained 
committed 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
supporting 
the 
Agency 
in 
addressing 
compliance 
matters, 
strengthening 
its 
capacities 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety 
and 
serving 
as 
a 
development 
partner, 
and 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency. 
2. 
More 
than 
ever 
before, 
the 
international 
community 
needed 
a 
strong 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
resolve 
outstanding 
proliferation 
concerns, 
to 
help 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
did 
not 
suffer 
amid 
an 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
to 
put 
nuclear 
applications 
to 
the 
service 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
3. 
Norway, 
which 
continued 
to 
view 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
had 
been 
heartened 
by 
the 
recent 
renewal 
of 
interest 
in 
the 
long-term 
aim 
of 
achieving 
a 
world 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
His 
country 
was 
not 
being 
naive; 
it 
realized 
that 
the 
path 
would 
be 
long 
and 
arduous. 
However, 
it 
welcomed 
the 
stronger 
emphasis 
now 
being 
placed 
on 
the 
urgency 
of 
a 
fresh 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
broader 
non-proliferation 
efforts. 
4. 
The 
Seven-Nation 
Initiative 
on 
Nuclear 
Disarmament 
and 
Non-Proliferation 
had 
assembled 
a 
diverse 
network 
of 
governments 
that 
were 
seeking, 
pragmatically 
and 
cooperatively, 
to 
promote 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Norway 
hoped 
that 
the 
Seven-Nation 
Initiative 
would 
help 
to 
build 
consensus 
on 
a 
wide-ranging 
agenda 
ahead 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
5. 
The 
global 
disarmament 
agenda 
was 
contentious, 
but 
its 
outlines 
were 
clear: 
strengthening, 
and 
moving 
beyond, 
the 
moratoria 
on 
nuclear 
testing 
and 
the 
production 
of 
fissile 
materials; 
deeper 
and 
irreversible 
cuts 
in 
nuclear 
arsenals; 
the 
creation 
and 
strengthening 
of 
NWFZs; 
and 
genuine 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
security 
policies. 
What 
had 
been 
lacking 
so 
far 
was 
general 
agreement 
that 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
both 
served 
the 
cause 
of 
reducing 
nuclear 
dangers. 
For 
good 
reason, 
the 
NPT 
was 
not 
an 
Ã  
la 
carte 
menu. 
Both 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
must 
be 
considered 
the 
responsibility 
of 
all 
States 
if 
the 
NPT-based 
regime 
was 
to 
be 
sustained 
over 
the 
long 
term 
Â 
and 
the 
Agency 
must 
remain 
a 
key 
partner 
in 
upholding 
and 
strengthening 
that 
regime. 
6. 
Safeguards 
were 
of 
enormous 
importance 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
confidence 
in 
which 
would 
depend 
on 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
adapting 
them 
to 
the 
challenges 
of 
the 
twenty-first 
century. 
Consequently, 
Norway 
believed 
that 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
along 
with 
an 
additional 
protocol 
should 
constitute 
the 
verification 
standard. 
The 
Agency 
could 
conclude 
that 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
a 
given 
country 
were 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only 
if 
there 
was 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
force 
for 
that 
country. 
The 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
had 
been 
adopted 
more 
than 
ten 
years 
previously, 
but 
nearly 
100 
countries 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Norway 
would 
like 
to 
see 
them 
concluding 
one 
without 
delay. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
consider 
all 
means 
of 
increasing 
safeguards 
efficiency, 
including 
integrated 
safeguards, 
but 
effectiveness 
should 
not 
be 
sacrificed 
for 
efficiency. 
The 
full 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols 
was 
essential.

7. 
The 
Secretariat 
had 
made 
a 
number 
of 
proposals 
for 
strengthening 
safeguards 
which 
Norway 
hoped 
would 
be 
accepted 
by 
Member 
States 
in 
due 
course. 
It 
was 
clear 
to 
his 
country 
that 
the 
Agency 
needed 
better 
access 
to 
data, 
an 
improved 
laboratory 
network 
and 
a 
greater 
ability 
to 
carry 
out 
independent 
analyses. 
8. 
The 
demand 
for 
energy 
and 
the 
desire 
for 
energy 
security 
were 
increasing, 
as 
was 
the 
concern 
about 
climate 
change, 
and 
the 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
was 
now 
perhaps 
greater 
than 
at 
any 
time 
since 
the 
dawn 
of 
the 
nuclear 
age. 
However, 
an 
increasing 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
meant 
greater 
challenges 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
might 
prove 
to 
be 
a 
way 
of 
reconciling 
energy 
needs 
with 
non-proliferation 
concerns. 
Also, 
the 
willingness 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
make 
surplus 
nuclear 
weapons 
material 
available 
for 
civilian 
use 
demonstrated 
how 
the 
promotion 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
complement 
nuclear 
disarmament 
efforts. 
9. 
Without 
fresh 
initiatives 
and 
a 
readiness 
to 
enter 
into 
difficult 
compromises, 
there 
was 
a 
risk 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
founder, 
as 
it 
had 
three 
decades 
previously. 
The 
Secretariat 
and 
Member 
States 
needed 
to 
address 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
issue 
with 
greater 
urgency 
and 
to 
consider 
not 
only 
the 
question 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
mechanisms 
but 
also 
ways 
of 
inducing 
countries 
to 
use 
such 
mechanisms. 
10. 
The 
understandings 
between 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
modalities 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
outstanding 
issues 
with 
regard 
to 
IranÂs 
past 
nuclear 
activities 
represented 
a 
positive 
step. 
It 
would 
have 
been 
preferable 
if 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
plan 
had 
provided 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
issues 
in 
parallel 
rather 
than 
in 
sequence, 
but 
that 
work 
plan 
was 
the 
first 
one 
to 
provide 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
all 
outstanding 
issues 
within 
an 
agreed 
time 
frame. 
Now 
it 
was 
crucial 
that 
Iran 
implement 
the 
work 
plan 
in 
a 
serious 
manner 
and 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
urgency. 
11. 
Resolving 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
would 
be 
a 
major 
step 
towards 
a 
negotiated 
political 
solution, 
but 
Iran 
needed 
also 
to 
build 
confidence 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
its 
present 
nuclear 
activities. 
Among 
other 
things, 
it 
should 
ratify 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency, 
as 
it 
had 
been 
called 
on 
to 
do 
by 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
In 
two 
unanimously 
adopted 
resolutions, 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
suspend 
sensitive 
activities 
such 
as 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
heavy 
water 
reactor 
at 
Arak. 
Regrettably, 
Iran 
had 
not 
suspended 
those 
activities. 
Norway 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
seize 
the 
opportunity 
now 
presented 
to 
it 
in 
order 
that 
a 
negotiated 
political 
solution 
might 
be 
achieved. 
12. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
DPRK, 
Norway 
welcomed 
the 
diplomatic 
breakthrough 
that 
had 
been 
achieved 
and 
was 
greatly 
encouraged 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Agency 
inspectors 
had 
in 
July 
verified 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
The 
prospect 
of 
a 
denuclearized 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
once 
again 
a 
reality. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
now 
move 
towards 
full 
dismantlement 
of 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
under 
Agency 
supervision, 
return 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
announce 
its 
intention 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
NPT. 
That 
would 
open 
up 
new 
opportunities 
for 
international 
cooperation. 
13. 
Following 
the 
attacks 
of 
11 
September 
2001, 
it 
had 
become 
incumbent 
on 
all 
States 
to 
cooperate 
in 
combating 
international 
terrorism, 
and 
preventing 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
had 
rightly 
become 
a 
top 
global 
priority. 
There 
was 
a 
need 
for 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
connection 
with 
many 
of 
them. 
First 
and 
foremost, 
however, 
States 
had 
to 
enact 
and 
enforce 
relevant 
domestic 
legislation. 
14. 
The 
Secretariat 
was 
to 
be 
applauded 
for 
its 
efforts 
in 
helping 
States 
through, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
implementation 
of 
Integrated 
Nuclear 
Security 
Support 
Plans.

15. 
Norway, 
which 
would 
participate 
in 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
had 
provided 
the 
United 
Nations 
Secretariat 
with 
funding 
for 
regional 
workshops 
held 
to 
promote 
the 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
Also, 
it 
had 
led 
efforts 
to 
minimize 
the 
use 
of 
HEU 
in 
the 
civilian 
sector. 
16. 
In 
Norway, 
a 
start 
had 
been 
made 
on 
the 
process 
that 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
ratification 
by 
his 
country 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
adopted 
in 
July 
2005. 
17. 
Recently, 
it 
had 
been 
argued 
that 
the 
impact 
of 
radiological 
weapons 
could 
be 
more 
serious 
than 
previously 
estimated. 
That 
should 
induce 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
do 
more 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
fissile 
and 
radioactive 
materials, 
including 
giving 
full 
support 
to 
the 
relevant 
Agency 
programmes. 
18. 
The 
likely 
expansion 
of 
the 
nuclear 
power 
sector 
made 
nuclear 
safety 
even 
more 
important 
than 
in 
the 
past, 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
efforts 
to 
build 
an 
integrated 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regime. 
The 
challenges 
involved 
called 
for 
the 
allocation 
of 
adequate 
resources 
to 
nuclear 
safety. 
Firstly, 
States 
should 
implement 
the 
relevant 
conventions 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct. 
Secondly, 
instruments 
such 
as 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
should 
be 
refined. 
Thirdly, 
States 
should 
ensure 
the 
highest 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
in 
the 
transportation 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials. 
Fourthly, 
as 
incidents 
and 
accidents 
occurred 
despite 
all 
preventive 
efforts, 
every 
State 
should 
be 
prepared 
for 
emergencies. 
19. 
There 
was 
also 
a 
need 
for 
an 
evolving 
international 
regime 
in 
the 
area 
of 
emergency 
preparedness, 
and 
Member 
States 
should 
ensure 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre 
was 
equipped 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
functions 
and 
that 
further 
progress 
was 
made 
in 
implementation 
of 
the 
International 
Action 
Plan 
for 
Strengthening 
the 
International 
Preparedness 
and 
Response 
System 
for 
Nuclear 
and 
Radiological 
Emergencies. 
Norway, 
which 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
drafting 
of 
a 
code 
of 
conduct 
in 
the 
area 
of 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response, 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
work 
being 
done 
in 
that 
area. 
20. 
Also, 
Member 
States 
should 
work 
with 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
the 
development 
of 
an 
international 
framework 
for 
protection 
of 
the 
environment 
from 
the 
harmful 
effects 
of 
ionizing 
radiation. 
21. 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
means 
of 
ensuring 
that 
Member 
States 
could 
fully 
implement 
important 
standards 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
the 
Agency 
was 
also 
a 
major 
development 
partner, 
facilitating 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
water 
management, 
health 
and 
other 
key 
sectors 
and 
making 
a 
genuine 
contribution 
to 
achievement 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
Norway 
would 
like 
to 
see 
the 
Agency 
continuing 
to 
take 
part 
in 
development 
related 
activities 
within 
the 
United 
Nations 
framework 
and 
nurturing 
partnerships 
with 
civil 
society 
through 
initiatives 
such 
as 
the 
Scientific 
Forum. 
22. 
The 
Agency 
had 
served 
the 
international 
community 
well 
during 
the 
past 
50 
years, 
but 
the 
nuclear 
challenges 
of 
the 
next 
half-century 
might 
be 
more 
daunting 
than 
anything 
experienced 
so 
far. 
In 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
view, 
those 
challenges 
Â 
from 
managing 
a 
global 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
preventing 
nuclear 
terrorism 
Â 
called 
for 
sustained 
international 
cooperation 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
highly 
professional 
and 
efficient 
Agency. 
Norway 
pledged 
itself 
to 
the 
attainment 
of 
that 
goal. 
23. 
Mr. 
DE 
VISSER 
(Netherlands) 
said 
that 
the 
NPT 
remained 
the 
essential 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
work 
together 
to 
ensure 
that 
treaties 
on 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
were 
not 
eroded 
from 
within. 
Times 
were 
challenging 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
existing 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
were 
under 
pressure. 
The 
prospects 
for 
developing 
new 
international 
law 
to 
limit 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
seemed 

GC(51)/OR.7

limited, 
yet 
international 
tensions 
related 
to 
non-proliferation 
were 
rising, 
including 
difficulties 
with 
particular 
countries 
and 
growing 
worries 
about 
possible 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


24. 
The 
Netherlands 
hoped 
that 
further 
progress 
could 
be 
made 
with 
respect 
to 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-
off 
treaty, 
the 
CTBT, 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
were 
legitimately 
claiming 
their 
inalienable 
rights 
under 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
choosing 
the 
nuclear 
path. 
The 
Netherlands 
wished 
to 
support 
such 
countries 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
respect, 
and 
had 
therefore 
actively 
participated 
in 
and 
contributed 
to 
the 
discussions 
on 
multilateral 
nuclear 
approaches. 
As 
a 
host 
to 
a 
Urenco 
uranium 
enrichment 
plant, 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
experience 
in 
being 
bound 
by 
a 
multilateral 
treaty 
and 
stood 
ready 
to 
contribute 
further 
to 
discussions 
promoted 
by 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
development 
of 
guarantee 
schemes 
and 
the 
multilateralization 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
activities. 
25. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
strongly 
committed 
to 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
was 
very 
disappointed 
that 
it 
had 
not 
yet 
come 
about. 
Ratifiers 
and 
States 
signatories 
would 
have 
to 
do 
their 
utmost 
to 
keep 
the 
CTBTO 
alive, 
to 
provide 
it 
with 
tangible 
support, 
and 
to 
allow 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
international 
verification 
network. 
26. 
The 
Netherlands 
favoured 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system 
and 
advocated 
its 
universal 
adoption 
and 
implementation. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
now 
constituted 
the 
verification 
standard, 
and 
the 
Netherlands 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
conclude 
them. 
The 
strengthening 
of 
safeguards 
was 
one 
thing, 
but 
the 
system 
lost 
credibility 
if 
non-compliance 
was 
not 
countered. 
To 
guarantee 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspection 
regime, 
the 
Netherlands 
favoured 
a 
strong 
policy 
against 
non-compliance, 
if 
necessary 
referring 
issues 
of 
determined 
non-compliance 
to 
the 
Security 
Council. 
27. 
The 
Netherlands 
fully 
supported 
integrated 
safeguards 
and 
in 
2006 
had 
hosted 
a 
trilateral 
meeting 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
to 
try 
to 
develop 
modalities 
for 
short 
notice 
and 
unannounced 
inspections. 
The 
Netherlands 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
soon 
reach 
an 
understanding 
with 
Euratom 
in 
that 
respect. 
28. 
Safeguards 
went 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
was 
pivotal 
to 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
proliferation 
and 
improve 
nuclear 
security 
and 
should 
be 
supported 
by 
all 
Member 
States, 
not 
just 
by 
a 
few 
donor 
countries. 
The 
Netherlands 
called 
on 
Member 
States 
to 
give 
tangible 
and 
unconditional 
support 
to 
that 
Fund. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
that 
conditionality 
could 
seriously 
hamper 
the 
implementation 
of 
programmes 
and 
projects. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
been 
willing 
to 
donate 
generously 
and 
without 
conditions 
for 
several 
years, 
and 
was 
certainly 
willing 
to 
consider 
similar 
contributions 
in 
the 
future. 
29. 
Measures 
to 
improve 
nuclear 
security 
were 
important, 
but 
would 
be 
more 
effective 
if 
complemented 
by 
adequate 
nuclear 
safety 
measures. 
The 
Netherlands 
strongly 
supported 
the 
various 
nuclear 
safety 
mechanisms 
and 
had 
joined 
the 
relevant 
conventions 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct. 
In 
that 
context, 
it 
was 
satisfying 
to 
see 
that 
the 
number 
of 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
and 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
had 
grown. 
30. 
There 
was 
general 
agreement 
that 
in 
the 
near 
future 
shortages 
of 
experienced 
nuclear 
safety 
staff 
would 
make 
it 
difficult 
to 
meet 
safety 
requirements. 
Commending 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
excellent 
results 
obtained 
in 
2006 
by 
the 
IRRS, 
he 
announced 
that 
the 
Netherlands 
was 
considering 
requesting 
an 
IRRS 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
Before 
the 
end 
of 
2007 
a 
new 
IPPAS 
mission, 
addressing 
all 
his 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
installations, 
would 
take 
place. 
He 
noted 
that 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
recently 
hosted 
two 
courses 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
follow-up 
courses 
were 
being 
prepared.

June 
2007, 
an 
international 
meeting 
of 
the 
network 
of 
regulators 
of 
countries 
with 
small 
nuclear 
programmes 
had 
also 
been 
hosted 
in 
the 
Netherlands. 


31. 
The 
Agency 
could 
only 
carry 
out 
all 
of 
its 
tasks 
if 
it 
had 
adequate 
financial 
resources. 
The 
Netherlands 
strongly 
supported 
a 
balanced 
budget 
which 
enabled 
it 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
essential 
tasks. 
The 
Agency 
was 
being 
called 
upon 
to 
address 
a 
rapidly 
increasing 
number 
of 
complicated 
and 
multifaceted 
issues, 
and 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
noted 
with 
concern 
that 
some 
essential 
tasks 
had 
been 
postponed 
due 
to 
lack 
of 
adequate 
resources. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
consult 
more 
actively 
with 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
budget 
drafting 
process 
in 
2008 
in 
order 
to 
reach 
timely 
consensus 
on 
the 
budget 
proposal 
for 
2009. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Netherlands 
hoped 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
would 
present 
a 
transparent 
budget 
proposal 
for 
2009 
with 
clear 
priorities 
and 
unambiguous 
savings, 
so 
that 
there 
would 
be 
fewer 
essential 
activities 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
financed 
on 
an 
extrabudgetary 
basis. 
32. 
The 
Netherlands 
expressed 
strong 
support 
for 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
bring 
about 
reforms 
in 
its 
administrative 
structures, 
as 
well 
as 
improving 
its 
project 
management, 
but 
felt 
that 
more 
could 
be 
done. 
Possibly 
with 
other 
Member 
States 
and 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Secretariat, 
the 
Netherlands 
was 
giving 
serious 
consideration 
to 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
request 
for 
financial 
assistance 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
make 
the 
Agency 
more 
efficient 
and 
effective. 
33. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
had 
already 
pledged 
its 
full 
target 
share 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2008. 
It 
hoped 
that 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
already 
done 
so 
would 
pledge 
their 
share 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
Adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
were 
a 
prerequisite, 
and 
the 
Netherlands 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
report 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
possible 
options 
to 
make 
technical 
cooperation 
resources 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
optimistic 
about 
the 
advances 
the 
Agency 
was 
making 
in 
streamlining 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
commended 
it 
on 
the 
improvements 
it 
had 
achieved 
in 
the 
implementation 
rate 
for 
2006. 
The 
Netherlands 
hoped 
that 
further 
improvements 
would 
be 
reflected 
in 
a 
yet 
higher 
rate 
of 
implementation 
for 
2007. 
34. 
On 
the 
national 
energy 
front, 
the 
Netherlands 
was 
extending 
operation 
of 
the 
Borssele 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
by 
20 
years 
up 
to 
2033. 
Also, 
its 
energy 
policy 
aimed 
to 
provide 
the 
country 
with 
one 
of 
the 
most 
sustainable 
supply 
systems 
in 
Europe 
by 
2020 
and 
ensure 
a 
substantial 
reduction 
of 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
35. 
The 
Netherlands 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
strengthening 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
in 
guaranteeing 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
in 
advancing 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
all. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
in 
executing 
that 
vital 
role 
wherever 
it 
could. 
36. 
Mr. 
NIEUWENHUYS 
(Belgium) 
said 
that 
about 
55% 
of 
BelgiumÂs 
electricity 
was 
currently 
generated 
by 
nuclear 
energy. 
Legislation 
had 
been 
passed, 
however, 
requiring 
the 
shutdown 
of 
all 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
after 
they 
had 
been 
in 
service 
for 
40 
years 
and 
the 
last 
reactors 
would 
be 
shut 
down 
in 
2025. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
growing 
debate 
about 
how 
the 
shortfall 
in 
electricity 
production 
would 
be 
made 
up, 
the 
Energy 
Minister 
had 
asked 
a 
special 
commission 
to 
examine 
BelgiumÂs 
future 
energy 
policy. 
The 
commission 
had 
sent 
its 
report 
to 
the 
Belgian 
authorities, 
which 
would 
draw 
their 
conclusions 
and 
duly 
inform 
the 
Agency. 
37. 
There 
was 
nonetheless 
still 
a 
need 
for 
both 
State 
and 
private 
nuclear 
research 
and 
development, 
not 
only 
to 
maintain 
and 
improve 
the 
existing 
nuclear 
systems 
but 
also 
to 
develop 
new 
ones. 
Since 
the 
debate 
on 
the 
future 
of 
its 
nuclear 
industry 
was 
not 
closed 
for 
good, 
Belgium 
was 
continuing 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
new 
nuclear 
systems, 
in 
particular 
the 
fourth 
generation 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles. 
It 
had 
joined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
activities 
and 
BelgiumÂs 
nuclear 
research 
centre 
at 
Mol 
would 
contribute 
to 
joint 
projects 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
that 
project.

38. 
National 
efforts 
focused 
on 
developing 
MYRRHA, 
an 
accelerator-driven 
subcritical 
reactor 
which 
it 
was 
hoped 
to 
turn 
into 
an 
international 
project. 
To 
that 
end, 
BelgiumÂs 
nuclear 
research 
centre 
had 
presented 
MYRRHA 
to 
specialists 
from 
all 
countries 
during 
the 
General 
Conference. 
39. 
Several 
Belgian 
organizations 
were 
working 
in 
the 
fusion 
field, 
in 
particular 
on 
the 
construction 
of 
ITER 
and 
were 
involved 
in 
the 
so-called 
broader 
approach, 
the 
agreement 
between 
Euratom 
and 
Japan 
to 
complement 
ITER. 
40. 
Belgium 
was 
interested 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
on 
possible 
new 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
ends, 
in 
particular 
the 
options 
for 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply. 
Belgium 
welcomed 
the 
report 
published 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
June 
2007 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
hoped 
that 
future 
discussions 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
development 
of 
a 
programme 
addressing 
all 
the 
key 
issues. 
41. 
The 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
was 
a 
top 
priority 
for 
Belgium. 
The 
findings 
of 
the 
OSART 
mission 
that 
had 
visited 
the 
Tihange 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
May 
2007 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Belgian 
authorities 
were 
encouraging 
and 
the 
priority 
given 
to 
safety 
and 
continuing 
improvements 
at 
all 
Belgian 
plants 
had 
been 
acknowledged. 
Officials 
at 
Tihange 
were 
preparing 
and 
implementing 
action 
plans 
in 
response 
to 
the 
expertsÂ 
observations. 
42. 
In 
the 
sphere 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
the 
national 
system 
for 
protecting 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
materials 
was 
largely 
based 
upon 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
INFCIRC/225/Rev.4. 
43. 
The 
serious 
proliferation 
related 
matters 
concerning 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
which 
were 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly 
and 
the 
Security 
Council, 
continued 
to 
pose 
threats 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
international 
community 
was 
determined 
to 
find 
a 
diplomatic 
solution 
in 
the 
appropriate 
multilateral 
arenas 
and 
Belgium 
was 
confident 
that 
such 
a 
solution 
could 
be 
found. 
44. 
Belgium 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
positive 
developments 
regarding 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
Belgium, 
which 
had 
always 
called 
for 
a 
swift 
return 
of 
Agency 
inspectors, 
considered 
they 
had 
a 
very 
important 
part 
to 
play 
in 
the 
complete 
and 
irreversible 
dismantling 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
plant. 
It 
was 
clear 
that 
was 
a 
complex 
operation 
that 
would 
need 
funding. 
It 
was 
in 
everyoneÂs 
interest 
that 
the 
investment 
be 
made 
as 
it 
would 
ultimately 
benefit 
peace 
and 
security 
on 
a 
denuclearized 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
45. 
Belgium 
had 
always 
favoured 
an 
effective 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
the 
Iran 
issue. 
Verification 
in 
Iran 
was 
a 
major 
challenge 
for 
the 
Agency 
since 
that 
country 
had 
not 
always 
ensured 
the 
necessary 
transparency 
with 
regard 
to 
some 
of 
its 
nuclear 
activities. 
To 
restore 
confidence, 
Iran 
must 
comply 
with 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
It 
should 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
so 
that 
the 
latter 
could 
conclude 
that 
there 
were 
no 
undeclared 
nuclear 
materials 
or 
activities 
and 
confirm 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
All 
efforts 
to 
restore 
confidence 
and 
resolve 
outstanding 
issues 
were 
welcome, 
including 
the 
work 
plan 
that 
had 
recently 
been 
agreed 
upon 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Belgium 
hoped 
that 
the 
plan 
would 
bring 
positive 
results. 
In 
its 
resolutions, 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
specified 
the 
measures 
that 
would 
enable 
international 
confidence 
to 
be 
restored. 
Iran 
should 
comply 
fully 
and 
swiftly 
with 
those 
resolutions 
so 
that 
the 
negotiations 
could 
be 
resumed. 
46. 
Mr. 
MOHAMAD 
(Malaysia) 
observed 
that 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
almost 
coincided 
with 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
independence 
of 
Malaysia. 
Also, 
it 
was 
35 
years 
since 
Malaysia, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
a 
number 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
had 
established 
its 
first 
nuclear 
research 
centre, 
now 
the 
Malaysian 
Nuclear 
Agency. 
Coincidentally, 
2007 
also 
marked 
the 
25th 
anniversary 
of 
that 
centreÂs 
first 
major 
facility, 
a 
1 
MW(th) 
research 
reactor.

47. 
He 
emphasized 
his 
delegationÂs 
strong 
support 
for 
and 
confidence 
in 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
preventing 
the 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
military 
purposes 
and 
in 
ensuring 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
used 
in 
the 
safest 
possible 
way. 
The 
Agency 
should 
not 
be 
subject 
to 
undue 
pressure 
and 
interference 
in 
undertaking 
its 
mandates. 
48. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
two 
key 
roles, 
as 
an 
international 
development 
agency 
for 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
as 
the 
sole 
international 
nuclear 
safeguards 
verification 
agency, 
should 
be 
preserved 
and 
honoured. 
It 
was 
in 
the 
global 
interest 
that 
the 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy 
development 
aspirations 
of 
developing 
Member 
States 
not 
be 
unduly 
construed 
as 
contributing 
to 
an 
increasing 
global 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
nor 
did 
they 
merit 
undue 
scrutiny 
beyond 
what 
was 
called 
for 
under 
existing 
Agency 
rules 
and 
procedures. 
Such 
a 
move 
would 
undermine 
not 
only 
the 
integrity 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
but 
also 
the 
balance 
among 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Agency, 
which 
was 
the 
fundamental 
bargain 
underlying 
the 
NPT. 
There 
should 
be 
no 
attempt 
to 
undermine 
the 
legitimate, 
fundamental 
and 
inalienable 
rights 
of 
developing 
States 
Party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
have 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
49. 
Malaysia 
welcomed 
the 
Agency 
initiative 
to 
establish, 
in 
October 
2006, 
the 
Nuclear 
Power 
Support 
Group 
to 
support 
Member 
States 
considering 
introducing 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
dynamics 
of 
nuclear 
power 
policy 
varied 
from 
country 
to 
country 
needed 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration 
in 
planning 
and 
executing 
the 
GroupÂs 
activities 
in 
order 
for 
it 
to 
remain 
relevant. 
The 
Agency 
should 
base 
its 
support 
activities 
on 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
and 
accurate 
assessment 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
especially 
developing 
Member 
States, 
in 
order 
to 
optimize 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
relevance 
of 
its 
programmes 
and 
the 
utilization 
of 
its 
limited 
resources. 
Nuclear 
non-proliferation 
was 
a 
major 
concern, 
but 
the 
incorporation 
of 
proliferation-resistant 
features 
in 
future 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
should 
not 
impose 
additional 
costs 
to 
Member 
States. 
50. 
Malaysia 
was 
interested 
in 
the 
development 
of 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
an 
area 
that 
was 
attracting 
broader 
international 
support. 
His 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
assurance 
that 
the 
proposed 
creation 
of 
an 
actual 
or 
virtual 
reserve 
fuel 
bank 
of 
last 
resort, 
under 
Agency 
auspices, 
would 
operate 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
apolitical 
and 
non-discriminatory 
non-proliferation 
criteria. 
Malaysia 
reiterated 
that 
any 
such 
approach 
should 
not 
adversely 
affect 
the 
fundamental 
inalienable 
right 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
by 
means 
of 
the 
imposition 
of 
a 
mandatory 
permanent 
suspension 
of 
such 
a 
right 
as 
a 
precondition 
for 
participation 
or 
in 
any 
other 
way. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
a 
temporary 
voluntary 
waiver 
of 
such 
a 
right 
as 
a 
precondition 
Â 
if 
it 
were 
effective 
only 
for 
the 
duration 
of 
the 
multilateral 
arrangement, 
subject 
to 
a 
continued 
assurance 
of 
supply 
of 
the 
relevant 
fuel 
cycle 
services 
and 
material 
and 
accompanied 
by 
appropriate 
guarantees, 
including 
guaranteed 
financial 
and 
other 
relevant 
compensation 
for 
failure 
of 
supply 
Â 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
larger 
objective 
of 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
51. 
Malaysia 
placed 
a 
high 
priority 
on 
combating 
terrorism 
and 
had 
established, 
in 
November 
2002, 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
Regional 
Centre 
for 
Counter-Terrorism 
(SEARCCT), 
which 
focused 
on 
training, 
capacity-building 
and 
public 
awareness 
programmes. 
Malaysia 
would 
also 
be 
establishing 
a 
national 
nuclear 
security 
training 
centre. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
Agency 
initiative 
to 
establish 
regional 
nuclear 
security 
training 
centres 
and 
announced 
its 
readiness 
to 
host 
such 
a 
centre, 
which 
would 
complement 
MalaysiaÂs 
existing 
centres 
and 
the 
networks 
it 
had 
developed 
within 
the 
region 
and 
beyond. 
52. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
combating 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radiological 
and 
nuclear 
material, 
Malaysia 
had 
developed 
a 
national 
environmental 
and 
radiological 
sources 
portal 
monitoring 
system, 
which 
was 
being 
installed 
at 
all 
points 
of 
entry 
to 
and 
exit 
from 
the 
country. 
It 
had 
adopted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 

GC(51)/OR.7 
20 
September 
2007, 
Page

Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors. 


53. 
His 
delegation 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
management 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
relevant 
projects 
in 
Malaysia 
and 
the 
Asia 
Pacific 
region 
as 
a 
whole. 
It 
was 
important 
for 
all 
Member 
States, 
and 
particularly 
the 
NPT 
Member 
States, 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
financial 
resources 
available 
to 
the 
TCF 
were 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable. 
All 
principal 
sources 
of 
funding 
should 
be 
explored 
to 
ensure 
an 
appropriate 
mix 
and 
guarantee 
of 
future 
financing 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
ensuring 
that 
the 
TCF 
remained 
the 
main 
vehicle 
for 
mobilizing 
technical 
cooperation. 
Any 
unpredictability 
in 
its 
funding 
would 
weaken 
one 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
one 
half 
of 
the 
NPT 
bargain. 
Malaysia 
had 
consistently 
honoured 
its 
commitments 
by 
contributing 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Malaysia 
welcomed 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
study 
to 
determine 
the 
resources 
needed 
to 
fund 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
until 
the 
year 
2020. 
54. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
training, 
Malaysia 
planned 
to 
upgrade, 
with 
effect 
from 
June 
2008, 
the 
postgraduate 
education 
course 
on 
radiation 
protection 
which 
it 
had 
been 
hosting. 
It 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
continuing 
support 
for 
the 
course. 
Also, 
it 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recognition 
of 
the 
Malaysian 
Nuclear 
Agency 
as 
an 
Agency 
collaborating 
centre 
for 
radiation 
processing 
of 
natural 
polymers. 
55. 
Turning 
to 
nuclear 
verification, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
readiness 
to 
resume, 
as 
the 
security 
situation 
permitted, 
its 
mandate 
to 
provide 
assurance 
that 
all 
nuclear 
material 
in 
Iraq 
was 
accounted 
for 
and 
that 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
that 
State 
were 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
56. 
As 
regards 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
Malaysia, 
in 
line 
with 
other 
ASEAN 
countries, 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
action 
in 
shutting 
down 
the 
nuclear 
facility 
at 
Yongbyon, 
which 
had 
been 
verified 
by 
Agency 
inspectors. 
Malaysia 
also 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
announcement 
that 
it 
would 
implement 
its 
commitments 
to 
make 
a 
complete 
declaration 
of 
all 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
to 
disable 
all 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Malaysia 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
they 
had 
achieved. 
They 
should 
serve 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
region 
and 
help 
address 
the 
DPRKÂs 
important 
humanitarian 
needs. 
57. 
Regarding 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
Malaysia 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
Iran 
had 
provided 
further 
information 
and 
access 
to 
resolve 
long 
outstanding 
issues, 
such 
as 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
past 
plutonium 
experiments. 
Further, 
Malaysia 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
a 
work 
plan 
to 
resolve 
all 
outstanding 
verification 
issues. 
58. 
Malaysia 
remained 
convinced 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
would 
enhance 
global 
and 
regional 
peace 
and 
security, 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
contribute 
towards 
achieving 
the 
objective 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Such 
an 
NWFZ 
should 
be 
established 
promptly 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
paragraph 
14 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
687 
(1991), 
as 
well 
as 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
Having 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
NWFZ 
under 
the 
Bangkok 
Treaty, 
Malaysia 
viewed 
each 
NWFZ 
as 
a 
critical 
piece 
of 
a 
global 
jigsaw 
puzzle 
that 
would 
eventually 
form 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
world. 
59. 
Mr. 
KAHUURE 
(Namibia), 
welcoming 
the 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency, 
said 
that 
the 
growing 
membership 
was 
testimony 
to 
the 
increasing 
relevance 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
security 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
60. 
In 
the 
past 
year, 
nuclear 
technology 
had 
continued 
to 
contribute 
substantially 
to 
his 
countryÂs 
development 
efforts, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
human 
health, 
hydrology 
and 
radiation

safety, 
and 
thus 
to 
attaining 
some 
of 
the 
national 
objectives 
as 
defined 
in 
NamibiaÂs 
Vision 
2030. 
Nuclear 
technology 
was 
expected 
to 
play 
an 
increasingly 
prominent 
role 
in 
the 
attainment 
of 
national 
development 
goals 
and 
international 
obligations 
would 
remain 
a 
priority. 


61. 
The 
2007 
review 
of 
bilateral 
cooperation 
under 
NamibiaÂs 
CPF 
came 
at 
an 
opportune 
time 
to 
coordinate 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
national 
needs. 
Nuclear 
technology 
had 
many 
beneficial 
applications 
and 
could 
contribute 
immensely 
to 
NamibiaÂs 
development. 
It 
was 
thus 
crucial 
that 
all 
sectors 
recognized 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
sustainable 
development. 
62. 
All 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate 
should 
be 
upheld 
in 
equal 
measure. 
That 
approach 
demonstrated 
the 
intrinsic 
worth 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
as 
a 
viable 
alternative 
and 
complementary 
tool 
for 
national 
socio-economic 
development. 
It 
would 
also 
enhance 
the 
positive, 
as 
opposed 
to 
the 
traditional 
negative, 
perception 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
worldwide. 
63. 
Namibia 
sought 
Agency 
cooperation 
and 
support 
with 
regard 
to 
several 
issues 
identified 
in 
its 
third 
national 
development 
plan, 
which 
aimed 
at 
providing 
universal 
access 
to 
health 
services 
in 
order 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
for 
all 
citizens. 
Namibia 
needed 
to 
address 
health 
issues 
related 
to 
diseases, 
the 
environment 
and 
social 
factors. 
Communicable 
diseases, 
especially 
HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis 
and 
malaria 
remained 
a 
major 
concern, 
with 
more 
that 
1000 
deaths 
per 
100 
000 
population 
each 
year. 
The 
leading 
non-communicable 
causes 
of 
mortality 
included 
cancer, 
cardiovascular 
diseases 
and 
respiratory 
diseases. 
Although 
the 
budget 
of 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Social 
Services 
accounted 
for 
11% 
of 
public 
spending, 
it 
was 
insufficient 
to 
ensure 
adequate 
finances, 
infrastructure, 
materials, 
equipment 
and 
medicines 
to 
tackle 
those 
diseases. 
In 
recognition 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
addressing 
public 
health 
concerns, 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health 
and 
Social 
Services 
had 
committed 
resources 
and 
engaged 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
developing 
programmes 
that 
could 
improve 
the 
delivery 
of 
high-quality 
public 
health 
services. 
In 
that 
context, 
the 
Agency 
had 
assisted 
Namibia 
in 
establishing 
nuclear 
medicine 
services 
and 
radiation 
therapy 
programmes. 
That 
assistance 
should 
be 
expanded 
further 
to 
include 
collaboration 
in 
the 
area 
of 
molecular 
biology 
techniques 
for 
controlling 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis. 
Efforts 
should 
also 
be 
made 
to 
improve 
the 
understanding 
of 
the 
link 
between 
the 
management 
of 
HIV/AIDS 
and 
nutrition. 
64. 
Food 
security, 
access 
to 
basic 
commodities 
for 
all 
citizens 
and 
participation 
in 
the 
global 
marketplace 
were 
crucial 
to 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
in 
Namibia. 
In 
that 
connection, 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
agricultural 
and 
water 
sectors 
was 
particularly 
relevant. 
Namibia 
aimed 
at 
maintaining 
its 
current 
meat 
and 
livestock 
export 
capacity, 
while 
increasing 
access 
to 
export 
markets 
for 
all 
farmers 
north 
of 
the 
veterinary 
cordon 
fence. 
In 
so 
doing, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
to 
build 
capacities 
for 
managing 
livestock 
diseases 
in 
the 
northern 
communal 
areas. 
65. 
The 
Agency 
had 
made 
a 
positive 
contribution 
to 
NamibiaÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
soil, 
water 
and 
nutrient 
management 
technologies 
with 
a 
view 
to 
increasing 
crop 
production. 
Also, 
the 
country 
was 
seeking 
to 
diversify 
and 
develop 
drought 
tolerant 
crops 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
food 
security. 
66. 
Nuclear 
technology 
was 
invaluable 
for 
water 
resource 
management. 
Agency 
support 
in 
that 
area 
had 
complemented 
national 
efforts. 
Agency 
efforts 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
to 
become 
self-reliant 
in 
the 
field 
of 
isotope 
hydrology, 
including 
the 
recently 
published 
Atlas 
of 
Isotope 
Hydrology 
for 
Africa, 
were 
commendable. 
67. 
One 
of 
the 
national 
priorities 
was 
to 
transform 
Namibia 
into 
an 
industrialized 
nation 
with 
sustainable 
economic 
growth, 
a 
high 
standard 
of 
living 
and 
access 
to 
vital 
services, 
including 
electricity 
supply. 
The 
challenge 
was 
to 
ensure 
the 
establishment 
and 
maintenance 
of 
an 
adequate 
and 
efficient 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
energy 
both 
for 
private 
consumption 
and 
to 
support 
industrial 
development. 
At 
present, 
Namibia 
depended 
heavily 
on 
foreign 
energy 
supplies. 
Owing 
to 
increased 

GC(51)/OR.7

10 


demand 
locally 
and 
in 
neighbouring 
countries, 
the 
security 
of 
supply 
could 
not 
be 
guaranteed. 
Various 
options 
for 
power 
generation 
were 
therefore 
being 
considered, 
including 
nuclear 
energy. 


68. 
Given 
that 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
was 
part 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate, 
Namibia 
sought 
core 
engineering, 
technological 
and 
management 
support 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
In 
this 
connection, 
his 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recently 
published 
Milestones 
in 
the 
Development 
of 
a 
National 
Infrastructure 
for 
Nuclear 
Power 
Guide. 
69. 
Although 
the 
exploitation 
of 
NamibiaÂs 
natural 
resources 
Â 
including 
its 
substantial 
uranium 
deposits 
Â 
for 
the 
socio-economic 
benefit 
of 
the 
country 
was 
being 
encouraged, 
Namibia 
recognized 
the 
ecological 
and 
health 
implications 
of 
such 
activities. 
His 
Government 
therefore 
sought 
the 
expert 
advice 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
create 
a 
policy 
and 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
the 
responsible 
exploitation 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
natural 
resources. 
Namibia 
was 
pleased 
to 
host 
the 
forthcoming 
Technical 
Meeting 
on 
uranium 
exploration, 
mining, 
processing, 
mine 
and 
mill 
remediation 
and 
environmental 
issues, 
which 
was 
a 
welcome 
development 
that 
promoted 
regional 
integration. 
70. 
Namibia 
was 
committed 
to 
its 
responsibility 
for 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radiation 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
at 
the 
national 
and 
international 
levels. 
It 
had 
worked 
tirelessly 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
relevant 
regulatory 
body, 
which 
would 
be 
established 
shortly, 
to 
help 
Namibia 
meet 
its 
national 
and 
international 
obligations. 
71. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
his 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
agreements 
reached 
between 
the 
heads 
of 
delegations 
at 
the 
sixth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
held 
in 
July 
2007. 
His 
delegation 
further 
appreciated 
the 
verification 
by 
the 
Agency 
of 
the 
closure 
of 
five 
installations 
at 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
the 
ongoing 
ad 
hoc 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
activities 
being 
carried 
out 
with 
the 
active 
participation 
of 
the 
DPRK. 
Namibia 
supported 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
through 
diplomacy 
and 
dialogue 
and 
viewed 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
sole 
competent 
international 
authority 
for 
nuclear 
verification. 
72. 
On 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue, 
his 
delegation 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
proposal 
for 
a 
double 
timeout, 
which 
provided 
for 
the 
suspension 
by 
Iran 
of 
its 
nuclear 
enrichment 
activities 
and 
the 
suspension 
of 
sanctions 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
renewed 
dialogue. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
continued 
professional 
and 
impartial 
efforts 
to 
resolve 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
concerning 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
were 
commendable 
and 
any 
undue 
pressure 
or 
interference 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
that 
could 
jeopardize 
its 
efficiency 
and 
credibility 
must 
be 
rejected. 
73. 
Namibia 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
called 
on 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
take 
urgent 
and 
practical 
steps 
towards 
that 
goal, 
which 
had 
first 
been 
proposed 
by 
Iran 
in 
1974. 
74. 
Ms. 
MYKOLAYCHUK 
(Ukraine), 
having 
recalled 
that 
her 
country 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
founding 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
voluntarily 
renounced 
what 
had 
been 
the 
worldÂs 
third 
largest 
nuclear 
arsenal, 
said 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
fundamental 
for 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
UkraineÂs 
economy. 
Nuclear 
energy 
currently 
accounted 
for 
some 
50% 
of 
the 
energy 
balance 
in 
Ukraine, 
and 
that 
share 
would 
continue 
to 
grow 
provided 
that 
there 
were 
sufficient 
national 
uranium 
resources. 
75. 
Ukraine 
appreciated 
the 
Agency's 
efforts 
concerning 
the 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
new, 
safe 
reactors 
and 
supported 
activities 
under 
the 
INPRO 
and 
ITER 
projects, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
The 
standards 
and 
recommendations 
developed 
by 
the 
Agency 
provided 
the 
basis 
for 
relevant 
national 
regulations. 
Ukraine 
believed 
in 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
a

safe 
and 
secure 
manner 
with 
a 
reduced 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
Â 
a 
vision 
shared 
by 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership, 
which 
her 
country 
had 
recently 
joined. 


76. 
Ukraine 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
studying 
how 
energy 
demand 
was 
to 
be 
met. 
In 
that 
context, 
it 
welcomed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
on 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
non-discriminatory 
mechanism 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
since 
guaranteed 
fuel 
supply 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency 
would 
significantly 
improve 
the 
energy 
independence 
of 
Member 
Stats, 
particularly 
the 
developing 
countries. 
77. 
Ukraine, 
which 
had 
suffered 
the 
worldÂs 
largest 
nuclear 
accident, 
paid 
particular 
attention 
to 
complying 
with 
effective 
safety 
standards. 
In 
general, 
safety 
performance 
indicators 
at 
Ukrainian 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
met 
relevant 
national 
and 
international 
requirements, 
as 
confirmed 
by 
OSART 
missions. 
Nevertheless, 
Ukraine 
was 
continuing 
to 
upgrade 
its 
approaches 
to 
nuclear 
power 
safety. 
The 
1995 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
in 
the 
field 
of 
energy 
between 
Ukraine 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
provided 
for 
specific 
measures 
in 
that 
regard. 
Also, 
legislation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
use 
was 
being 
updated 
and 
the 
relevant 
institutional 
capabilities 
of 
the 
national 
regulatory 
authority 
were 
being 
strengthened. 
78. 
Ukraine 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
nuclear 
security 
remained 
among 
the 
AgencyÂs 
top 
priorities. 
The 
IPPAS 
missions 
helped 
raise 
the 
physical 
security 
of 
operating 
nuclear 
units 
and 
were 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
for 
updating 
applicable 
norms, 
including 
the 
development 
of 
comprehensive 
plans 
to 
support 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
results 
of 
relevant 
international 
projects 
in 
Ukraine, 
including 
cooperation 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security, 
were 
valuable 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
UkraineÂs 
integrated 
nuclear 
security 
plan. 
79. 
Ukraine 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
the 
prevention 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
the 
safe 
storage 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials. 
It 
supported 
the 
illicit 
trafficking 
database, 
which 
it 
had 
joined 
in 
1997, 
and 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
engage 
more 
actively 
in 
the 
exchange 
of 
information 
through 
that 
database. 
Ukraine 
was 
undertaking 
a 
range 
of 
activities 
aimed 
at 
bringing 
the 
storage 
of 
radioactive 
materials 
into 
line 
with 
the 
basic 
principles 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
The 
State 
system 
of 
registration, 
accounting 
and 
control 
was 
functioning 
well, 
a 
State 
register 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
and 
a 
State 
programme 
for 
the 
safe 
storage 
of 
high-level 
spent 
radioactive 
sources 
had 
been 
adopted. 
In 
addition, 
legislative 
amendments 
aimed 
at 
the 
enforcement 
of 
export 
and 
import 
control, 
and 
strengthened 
security 
requirements 
for 
sources 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
had 
been 
introduced. 
Ukraine 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
cooperate 
actively, 
including 
at 
the 
bilateral 
level, 
to 
ensure 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
There 
should 
be 
a 
proper 
exchange 
of 
information 
between 
neighbouring 
countries 
regarding 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
the 
export 
and 
import 
of 
sources, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
80. 
Her 
delegation 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
including 
the 
creation 
of 
nuclear 
databases 
and 
information 
systems, 
and 
the 
contribution 
the 
AgencyÂs 
research 
activities 
made 
to 
the 
social 
and 
economic 
development 
of 
Member 
States. 
Also, 
Ukraine 
welcomed 
the 
Agency's 
role 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
PACT, 
especially 
its 
increasing 
cooperation 
with 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF 
in 
that 
regard. 
81. 
The 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
demonstrated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
readiness 
to 
respond 
to 
Member 
StatesÂ 
needs 
in 
an 
adequate 
and 
urgent 
manner. 
She 
highlighted 
in 
particular 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
undertaken 
for 
Europe 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
safety, 
human 
health, 
nuclear 
science 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
82. 
Mitigation 
of 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
disaster 
and 
conversion 
of 
the 
Shelter 
into 
an 
environmentally 
safe 
structure 
remained 
priorities 
for 
Ukraine, 
with

resources 
from

budget 
still 
being 
allocated 
to 
that 
end. 
Contracts 
had 
just 
been 
signed 
for 
the 
New 
Safe 
Confinement 
as 
well 
as 
an 
interim 
spent 
fuel 
storage 
facility 
and 
Ukraine 
was 
grateful 
to 
all 
the 
donors 
involved. 
Her 
country 
hoped 
that 
implementation 
of 
those 
contracts 
would 
help 
to 
overcome 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident 
and 
called 
upon 
the 
Agency 
and 
all 
concerned 
to 
continue 
supporting 
that 
process. 


83. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
area 
of 
non-proliferation 
had 
grown 
steadily. 
The 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
important 
tool 
to 
ensure 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
Together 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
constituted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
standard, 
and 
Ukraine 
encouraged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign, 
ratify 
and 
implement 
those 
instruments 
without 
delay. 
Promoting 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
must 
be 
seen 
as 
a 
priority 
task 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Ukraine 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
assistance 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
additional 
protocol. 
UkraineÂs 
revised 
declaration 
under 
the 
additional 
protocol 
was 
currently 
under 
review 
by 
Agency 
experts. 
84. 
Ukraine 
shared 
the 
concerns 
about 
new 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
recognized 
the 
need 
for 
broader 
cooperation 
in 
that 
area. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
development 
of 
effective 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
terrorists 
acquiring 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
weapons 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
initiatives 
concerning 
the 
suppression 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
other 
related 
international 
and 
regional 
programmes. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
in 
July 
2007 
of 
the 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
85. 
The 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
remained 
a 
major 
political 
problem 
and 
a 
grave 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
community. 
Thus, 
Ukraine 
attached 
high 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
pledged 
its 
support 
for 
the 
Agency 
in 
undertaking 
its 
demanding 
work. 
Â 
Report 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
86. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
that 
the 
theme 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
for 
2007 
had 
been 
ÂGlobal 
Challenges 
and 
the 
Development 
of 
Atomic 
Energy: 
The 
Next 
25 
YearsÂ. 
He 
invited 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum, 
Mr. 
Evans, 
to 
present 
the 
report. 
87. 
Mr. 
EVANS 
(Chair 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum) 
presented 
the 
report, 
which 
is 
reproduced 
in 
the 
Annex. 
88. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
thanked 
Mr. 
Evans 
for 
his 
most 
interesting 
report 
on 
the 
work 
and 
outcome 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum, 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
its 
excellent 
preparation 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum. 
89. 
Mr. 
AAS 
(Norway) 
congratulated 
Mr. 
Evans 
on 
his 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
and 
welcomed 
its 
recommendations 
regarding 
the 
future 
role 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Scientific 
Forum 
was 
an 
excellent 
tool 
to 
promote 
the 
AgencyÂs 
partnership 
with 
civil 
society; 
other 
opportunities 
to 
exchange 
views 
with 
civil 
society 
and 
academia 
should 
also 
be 
explored 
between 
sessions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
The 
Forum 
had 
addressed 
most 
of 
the 
major 
issues 
of 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Member 
States 
and 
had 
highlighted 
the 
major 
challenges 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
suggestions 
set 
forth 
by 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
would 
be 
duly 
considered 
by 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Director 
General. 
It 
was 
particularly 
important 
to 
address 
the 
balance 
between 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
peaceful 
uses, 
which 
was 
key 
in 
ensuring 
the 
positive 
outcome 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference.

Mr. 
SCHULTE 
(United 
States 
of 
America), 
referring 
to 
the 
point 
made 
in 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
that 
disarmament 
efforts 
were 
conspicuously 
absent 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States, 
said 
that 
such 
a 
perception 
was 
a 
myth 
promoted 
in 
Vienna. 
The 
United 
States 
Secretary 
of 
Energy 
had, 
in 
his 
statement 
to 
the 
General 
Conference, 
noted 
that 
the 
United 
States 
and 
Russia 
had 
together 
committed 
to 
remove 
or 
eliminate 
roughly 
870 
metric 
tons 
of 
HEU 
from 
defence 
use, 
and 
68 
metric 
tons 
of 
weapons-grade 
plutonium. 
That 
was 
enough 
material 
to 
make 
more 
than 
42 
000 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
United 
States 
continued 
to 
draw 
down 
its 
nuclear 
weapon 
stocks; 
by 
2012, 
the 
United 
States 
nuclear 
stockpile 
would 
be 
half 
of 
the 
2001 
level 
Â-the 
lowest 
level 
since 
President 
Eisenhower 
had 
been 
in 
office. 
It 
had 
also 
nearly 
doubled 
the 
rate 
at 
which 
retired 
nuclear 
weapons 
were 
dismantled, 
and 
the 
United 
States 
was 
to 
remove 
an 
additional 
9 
metric 
tons 
of 
weapons-grade 
plutonium 
from 
its 
defence 
stocks. 
That 
material, 
which 
was 
sufficient 
for 
well 
over 
1000 
weapons, 
was 
to 
be 
processed 
for 
use 
as 
fuel 
in 
United 
States 
commercial 
nuclear 
reactors 
so 
that 
it 
could 
never 
again 
be 
used 
in 
weapons. 
Such 
action 
was 
indicative 
of 
Âatoms 
for 
peaceÂ. 
91. 
Although 
impressed 
by 
the 
calibre 
of 
the 
discussion 
during 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
and 
by 
the 
calibre 
of 
the 
participants, 
he 
was 
concerned 
that 
the 
content 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
had 
had 
more 
to 
do 
with 
political 
science 
than 
nuclear 
science. 
The 
Agency 
was 
a 
technical 
agency 
with 
a 
technical 
mandate 
only 
under 
the 
NPT.

Election 
of 
members 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
(GC(51)/6 
and 
26) 


92. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
that 
in 
1989 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
approved 
a 
procedure 
whereby, 
when 
there 
was 
agreement 
regarding 
the 
candidate 
or 
candidates 
from 
a 
particular 
area, 
no 
secret 
ballot 
would 
be 
held; 
balloting 
would 
take 
place 
only 
for 
those 
areas 
where 
no 
candidate 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon. 
That 
procedure 
considerably 
facilitated 
the 
rational 
use 
of 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
time. 
Accordingly, 
he 
proposed 
that 
Rule 
79 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
which 
provided 
that 
elections 
to 
the 
Board 
should 
be 
by 
secret 
ballot, 
be 
suspended 
in 
respect 
of 
those 
areas 
for 
which 
there 
was 
agreement. 
93. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
94. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
he 
was 
happy 
to 
report 
that 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
in 
all 
area 
groups 
on 
their 
candidates 
for 
the 
vacancies 
to 
be 
filled. 
He 
expressed 
his 
sincere 
appreciation 
to 
all 
groups 
for 
their 
efforts 
to 
reach 
agreement, 
which 
had 
expedited 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
work. 
95. 
Drawing 
attention 
to 
document 
GC(51)/6, 
containing 
a 
list 
of 
the 
Agency 
Member 
States 
designated 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
Board 
from 
the 
end 
of 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
current 
session 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fifty-second 
(2008) 
regular 
session, 
he 
recalled 
that, 
under 
Rule 
83 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
he 
had 
to 
inform 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
elective 
places 
on 
the 
Board 
that 
had 
to 
be 
filled. 
To 
that 
end, 
document 
GC(51)/26 
had 
been 
prepared; 
it 
indicated 
that 
the 
Conference 
had 
to 
elect 
eleven 
members 
of 
the 
Board

Appointment 
of 
the 
External 
Auditor 
(GC(51)/18) 


121. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
tenure 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
current 
External 
Auditor 
would 
end 
with 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
audit 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
the 
financial 
year 
2007. 
It 
would 
therefore 
be 
necessary 
to 
appoint 
an 
External 
Auditor 
to 
audit 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
2008 
and 
2009. 
122. 
At

Â 
Restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
(GC(51)/INF/8, 
9 
and 
10) 


124. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
had 
before 
it 
three 
requests 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
from 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova, 
Georgia 
and 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
contained 
in 
documents 
GC(51)/INF/8, 
9 
and 
10, 
respectively. 
125. 
It 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
right 
to 
vote 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova, 
Georgia 
and 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
be 
restored 
during 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
Conference 
and 
until 
the 
end 
of 
their 
respective 
payment 
plans, 
on 
the 
understanding 
that 
those 
States 
continued 
to 
meet 
the 
requirements 
of 
their 
payment 
plans 
and 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
would 
report 
annually 
on 
the 
status 
of 
those 
payment 
plans. 
126. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
accepted 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
General 
Committee. 
127. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
25. 
Examination 
of 
delegatesÂ 
credentials 
(GC(51)/31) 


128. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
met 
earlier 
in 
the 
day 
to 
examine 
the 
credentials 
of 
all 
delegates, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
Rule 
28 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
Since 
that 
meeting 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
received 
credentials 
in 
due 
form 
for 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
Luxembourg, 
Pakistan, 
Spain 
and 
the 
United 
Arab 
Emirates. 
After 
discussion, 
the 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Conference 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
7 
of 
its 
report 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/31, 
with 
the 
reservations 
and 
positions 
expressed 
in 
the 
report. 
129. 
Ms. 
KHALIL 
(Egypt) 
said 
acceptance 
by 
Egypt 
of 
the 
report 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
did 
not 
imply 
recognition 
of 
the 
occupation 
by 
Israel 
of 
any 
of 
the 
occupied 
Arab 
territories, 
including 
the 
Golan 
Heights 
and 
the 
Shebaa 
Farms. 
130. 
Mr. 
BAIEDINEJAD 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
had 
reservations 
regarding 
the 
credentials 
of 
the 
Israeli 
delegation. 
IranÂs 
acceptance 
of 
the 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
report 
in 
no 
way 
implied 
its 
acceptance 
of 
that 
regime. 
131. 
Mr. 
KODAH 
(Jordan) 
said 
that 
JordanÂs 
acceptance 
of 
the 
credentials 
submitted 
by 
the 
Israeli 
delegation 
should 
on 
no 
account 
be 
understood 
as 
covering 
any 
occupied 
Arab 
territories, 
in 
particular 
the 
Golan 
Heights 
and 
Jerusalem, 
but 
only 
the 
area 
within 
the 
borders 
as 
at 
4 
June 
1967. 
132. 
Mr. 
ZARKA 
(Israel) 
recalled 
that 
his 
delegation 
had 
already 
responded 
in 
writing 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
reservations 
of 
certain 
Arab 
delegations 
(document 
GC(51)/30). 
Referring 
to 
the 
comment 
of 
the 
Iranian 
delegate, 
he 
said 
that 
Israel 
was 
a 
State, 
not 
a 
regime. 
133. 
Mr. 
KABALAN 
(Lebanon), 
endorsing 
the 
views 
expressed 
by 
Egypt 
and 
Jordan, 
said 
acceptance 
of 
the 
credentials 
of 
the 
Israeli 
delegation 
did 
not 
imply 
acceptance 
of 
its 
borders 
or 
of 
its 
regime.

The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the

Conference 
was

to 
adopt 
the 
draft

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(resumed) 
(GC(51)/5) 
136. 
Mr. 
TÃTH 
(Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty 
Organization) 
said 
that 
the 
CommissionÂs 
activities 
were 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
a 
global 
verification 
regime 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
ban 
on 
all 
nuclear 
test 
explosions, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
promotion 
of 
signatures 
and 
ratifications 
for 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
137. 
Earlier 
in 
the 
week, 
the 
fifth 
Conference 
on 
Facilitating 
the 
Entry 
into 
Force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
Vienna, 
attended 
by 
representatives 
of 
the 
more 
than 
100 
States 
that 
had 
ratified 
and 
signed 
the 
Treaty. 
The 
Conference 
had 
adopted 
a 
final 
declaration 
by 
consensus 
calling 
on 
those 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Treaty 
without 
delay. 
Particular 
emphasis 
had 
been 
placed 
on 
those 
10 
States 
listed 
in 
Annex 
2 
to 
the 
Treaty 
whose 
ratification 
was 
required 
for 
it 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
The 
Conference 
and 
its 
final 
declaration 
were 
further 
proof 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
commitment 
to 
establishing 
a 
universal 
and 
internationally 
and 
effectively 
verifiable 
CTBT 
as 
a 
major 
instrument 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
It 
had 
now 
been 
signed 
by 
177 
States 
and 
ratified 
by 
140. 
138. 
The 
nuclear 
weapon 
test 
of 
9 
October 
2006 
claimed 
by 
the 
DPRK 
had 
undoubtedly 
been 
the 
most 
defining 
event 
for 
the 
Commission 
in 
recent 
years. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
test 
of 
the 
Organization 
and 
of 
its 
nascent 
verification 
regime, 
its 
technical 
capabilities 
and 
procedures. 
Although 
the 
yield 
of 
the 
explosion 
had 
been 
low, 
the 
event 
had 
been 
well 
recorded 
by 
the 
CTBT 
monitoring 
system. 
A 
total 
of 
22 
seismic 
stations 
globally 
had 
recorded 
and 
located 
the 
event 
with 
the 
precision 
required 
for 
a 
possible 
on-site 
inspection 
after 
the 
TreatyÂs 
entry 
into 
force. 
A 
radionuclide 
station 
in 
Canada, 
over 
7500 
kms 
away, 
had 
also 
provided 
important 
noble 
gas 
data. 
The 
monitoring 
system 
had 
functioned 
in 
a 
holistic 
and 
synergistic 
way 
enabling 
the 
Preparatory 
Commission 
to 
prove 
the 
value 
of 
the 
significant 
investment 
that 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
previous 
decade. 
139. 
The 
event 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
although 
deeply 
regrettable, 
had 
served 
to 
validate 
the 
CTBT 
verification 
system 
and 
had 
refocused 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
international 
community 
on 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
It 
had 
also 
clearly 
underscored 
how 
much 
the 
international 
community 
supported 
the 
CTBT 
as 
a 
key 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
instrument. 
140. 
Since 
October 
2006, 
the 
Preparatory 
Commission 
had 
not 
remained 
idle. 
Nearly 
80% 
of 
the 
337 
facilities 
of 
the 
International 
Monitoring 
System 
(IMS) 
had 
been 
installed. 
To 
date, 
211 
IMS 
stations 
met 
the 
CommissionÂs 
stringent 
technical 
requirements, 
and 
the 
network 
of 
hydroacoustic 
stations 
was 
virtually 
complete. 
141. 
Since 
March 
2007, 
a 
new 
state-of-the-art 
operations 
centre 
was 
tracking 
the 
movement 
of 
verification 
data. 
Essential 
improvements 
had 
been 
made 
in 
processing 
methods 
and 
software 
concerning 
all 
four 
verification 
technologies. 
Particularly 
significant 
achievements 
had 
been 
made 
with 
respect 
to 
data 
analysis 
of 
radionuclide 
particulates 
and 
noble 
gases, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
atmospheric 
transport 
modelling. 
The 
new 
global 
communication 
infrastructure 
had 
been 
approved 
for 
installation 
with 
the 
first 
monitoring 
station 
already 
linked 
to 
it.

142. 
There 
were 
also 
important 
challenges 
to 
be 
met 
in 
the 
future. 
Many 
of 
the 
stations 
still 
to 
be 
installed 
were 
the 
most 
difficult 
ones, 
posing 
considerable 
technical, 
financial 
and 
political 
challenges. 
Further 
improvements 
in 
processing 
methods 
and 
software 
were 
required 
to 
meet 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
data 
availability 
and 
timeliness, 
and 
station 
operations 
must 
be 
kept 
cost-efficient. 
Another 
challenging 
key 
event 
for 
the 
Commission 
would 
be 
the 
first 
ever 
integrated 
on-site 
inspection 
field 
exercise, 
due 
to 
take 
place 
in 
the 
autumn 
of 
2008. 
It 
would 
constitute 
another 
step 
towards 
operational 
readiness. 
143. 
The 
CTBT 
generated 
data 
and 
products 
in 
a 
truly 
multilateral 
fashion, 
with 
89 
countries 
hosting 
the 
facilities 
of 
the 
monitoring 
system. 
All 
countries, 
irrespective 
of 
their 
size 
or 
contribution, 
were 
entitled 
to 
receive 
all 
data 
and 
products 
in 
near 
real 
time. 
The 
TreatyÂs 
verification 
system 
was 
thus 
an 
example 
of 
transparent 
verification. 
He 
had 
been 
particularly 
pleased 
about 
the 
robust 
increase 
of 
interest 
in 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
system, 
especially 
by 
less 
developed 
countries, 
and 
noted 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
20% 
increase 
in 
users 
in 
national 
institutions 
in 
the 
previous 
two 
years. 
The 
system 
also 
provided 
a 
variety 
of 
potential 
and 
important 
civil 
and 
scientific 
applications, 
most 
notably 
the 
contribution 
to 
tsunami 
warning 
organizations. 
The 
system 
was 
the 
provider 
of 
the 
fastest 
seismic 
and 
acoustic 
data 
and 
enhanced 
the 
ability 
of 
tsunami 
warning 
centres 
to 
issue 
timely 
and 
reliable 
tsunami 
alerts. 
144. 
Nuclear 
energy 
production 
and 
nuclear 
capacity 
were 
projected 
to 
increase 
significantly 
in 
the 
future, 
with 
increasing 
numbers 
of 
States 
attempting 
to 
master 
different 
segments 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
There 
might 
come 
a 
time 
when 
the 
decision 
between 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
or 
weapons 
purposes 
would 
be 
decided 
more 
on 
political 
and 
legal 
grounds 
rather 
than 
by 
technology. 
A 
nuclear 
test 
provided 
the 
final 
and 
irreversible 
proof 
as 
to 
the 
intentions 
of 
a 
State. 
The 
CTBT 
therefore 
provided 
the 
last 
and 
clearly 
visible 
barrier 
between 
the 
peaceful 
legitimate 
use 
and 
the 
misuse 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
A 
CTBT 
in 
force 
was 
a 
logical 
and 
necessary 
element 
of 
a 
multilateral, 
credible 
and 
effective 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
system. 
The 
meeting 
rose 
at 
12.50 
p.m.

Report 
to 
the 
51st 
Regular 
Session 
of 
the 
IAEA 
General 
Conference 
from 
the 
10th 
Scientific 
Forum 


20 
September 
2007 


Forum 
Chair: 
Honorable 
Gareth 
Evans 
President, 
International 
Crisis 
Group 
Former 
Minister 
for 
Energy 
and 
Foreign 
Minister 
of 
Australia 


Mr. 
President, 


This 
yearÂs 
Scientific 
Forum, 
with 
250 
specialist 
participants 
meeting 
in 
the 
margins 
of 
this 
General 
Conference 
in 
this 
50th 
Anniversary 
year 
of 
the 
IAEA, 
was 
given 
the 
daunting 
task 
of 
exploring 
and 
reporting 
back 
to 
you 
on 
how 
the 
worldÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
future 
might 
unfold 
over 
the 
next 
25 
years, 
and 
how 
in 
this 
context 
the 
Agency 
might 
best 
advance 
its 
mission 
of 
ensuring 
the 
peaceful, 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
that 
energy 
source. 


As 
the 
Forum 
Chair, 
I 
was 
given 
the 
even 
more 
daunting 
task 
(thankfully 
with 
much 
helpful 
input 
from 
the 
very 
professional 
scientific 
staff 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
session 
moderators) 
of 
distilling 
for 
you, 
in 
terms 
that 
you 
will 
find 
both 
interesting 
and 
of 
some 
practical 
utility, 
the 
content 
of 
25 
excellent 
presentations, 
spread 
over 
two 
full 
days, 
and 
involving 
four 
major 
sessions 
on, 
respectively, 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
meeting 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
needs; 
new 
roles 
for 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
food, 
agriculture 
and 
health; 
meeting 
the 
challenge 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
nuclear 
infrastructure; 
and 


Â 
most 
challenging 
of 
all 
Â 
holding 
the 
line 
against 
weapons 
breakout 
through 
effective 
safeguards 
and 
verification. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
Director-GeneralÂs 
comment 
in 
opening 
this 
Conference 
that 
Âthe 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
is 
not 
so 
much 
to 
predict 
the 
future 
as 
to 
plan 
and 
prepare 
for 
itÂ, 
the 
focus 
of 
my 
report 
will 
be 
a 
little 
selective. 
Although 
this 
necessarily 
means 
giving 
less 
than 
deserved 
attention 
to 
a 
number 
of 
contributions 
that 
were 
rich 
and 
thought 
provoking 
Â 
including, 
e.g., 
on 
the 
future 
of 
fusion 
research 
-I 
want 
to 
put 
the 
emphasis 
on 
those 
conclusions 
and 
recommendations 
emerging 
from 
the 
Forum 
discussion 
that 
have 
direct 
relevance 
for 
the 
role 
of 
the 
IAEA 
rather 
than 
the 
world 
at 
large. 
What 
does 
the 
Agency 
need 
to 
be 
doing, 
or 
planning, 
that 
it 
is 
not 
doing 
at 
the 
moment? 
And 
of 
what 
it 
is 
doing, 
what 
does 
it 
need 
to 
do 
more, 
better 
or 
differently? 


To 
the 
extent 
that 
we 
came 
up 
with 
answers 
to 
these 
questions, 
they 
grew 
out 
of 
a 
number 
of 
what 
seemed 
to 
be 
commonly 
accepted 
starting 
points: 


o 
First, 
the 
overall 
world 
demand 
for 
energy 
is 
going 
to 
grow 
dramatically 
over 
the 
next 
25 
years, 
probably 
by 
around 
50 
per 
cent 
or 
even 
more, 
with 
two-thirds 
of 
that 
increase 
occurring 
in 
developing 
countries. 
o 
Second, 
pressure 
is 
going 
to 
grow 
for 
a 
very 
substantial 
part 
of 
that 
demand 
to 
be 
met 
by 
non-fossil 
fuels, 
and 
in 
particular 
by 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
is 
just 
not 
sustainable 
for 
80 
per 
cent 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
supply 
to 
come 
from 
fossil 
fuels, 
as 
is 
the 
case 
at 
the 
moment: 
rising 
oil 
prices, 
energy 
security 
concerns 
due 
to 
the 
geographic 
concentration 
of 
oil 
and 
gas 
reserves 
in 
the 
Gulf 
States 
and 
Russia, 
and 
of 
course 
global 
warming 
environmental 
concerns 
will 
all 
see 
to 
that. 
o 
Third, 
there 
will 
be 
continuing 
strong 
demand 
to 
apply 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
the 
worldÂs 
needs, 
and 
in 
particular 
developing 
countriesÂ 
needs, 
in 
health, 
food, 
agriculture 
and 
industry. 
An 
important 
part 
of 
this 
story 
is 
not 
just 
the 
need 
for 
more 
readily 
available 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
its 
application 
to 
human 
and 
animal 
health, 
to 
agricultural 
crop

development 
and 
preservation, 
and 
to 
industrial 
uses: 
it 
is 
also 
the 
potential 
need 
in 
the 
longer 
term 
for 
massive 
additional 
amounts 
of 
energy 
for 
desalination 
plants 
to 
meet 
ever 
growing 
water 
shortages. 


o 
Fourth, 
while 
there 
is 
thus 
a 
major 
opportunity 
for 
the 
rapid 
further 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
there 
is 
still 
a 
high 
level 
of 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
what 
extent 
that 
opportunity 
will 
actually 
be 
taken 
up 
over 
the 
next 
quarter 
century, 
for 
three 
main 
reasons: 
the 
huge 
capital 
cost 
of 
most 
nuclear 
infrastructure 
(which 
is 
a 
significant 
disincentive 
to 
developing 
countries, 
not 
least 
with 
the 
current 
World 
Bank 
policy 
of 
not 
investing 
in 
nuclear 
power); 
the 
acute 
shortage 
of 
trained 
human 
resources 
and 
the 
associated 
lack 
of 
regulatory 
and 
technical 
infrastructure 
(particularly 
again 
in 
many 
developing 
countries); 
and 
the 
political 
difficulty 
of 
making 
rapid 
advances 
given 
continuing 
public 
concern 
about 
safety, 
security 
and 
proliferation. 
o 
Fifth, 
the 
pressure 
for 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
is 
not 
going 
to 
go 
away. 
It 
remains 
something 
of 
a 
miracle 
that 
the 
prediction 
widely 
made 
in 
the 
1960s 
that 
there 
would 
by 
now 
be 
at 
least 
20-30 
nuclear 
weapon 
States 
has 
not 
been 
realized, 
and 
it 
cannot 
be 
assumed 
that 
this 
miracle 
can 
be 
sustained 
Â 
particularly 
when 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
States 
remain 
so 
conspicuously 
indifferent 
to 
their 
own 
obligation 
under 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
NPT 
to 
take 
serious 
continuing 
steps 
toward 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Against 
this 
background, 
a 
variety 
of 
enhanced 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
new 
roles 
for 
the 
IAEA 
were 
identified 
in 
the 
presentations 
and 
subsequent 
exchanges. 
They 
can 
be 
grouped 
under 
four 
headings: 


Making 
Nuclear 
Energy 
More 
Affordable 
and 
Deliverable 


o 
The 
Agency 
has 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
assisting 
its 
Member 
States, 
and 
particularly 
developing 
countries, 
in 
energy 
planning. 
As 
more 
States 
contemplate 
nuclear 
power, 
with 
all 
the 
immensely 
complex 
infrastructure 
that 
requires 
Â 
in 
terms 
of 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
capability, 
educated 
and 
trained 
manpower, 
a 
stable 
electrical 
grid, 
access 
to 
financial 
and 
industrial 
resources, 
and 
development 
of 
an 
appropriate 
safety 
culture 
Â 
that 
role 
can 
only 
increase, 
and 
more 
resources 
should 
be 
allocated 
accordingly. 
o 
The 
Agency 
may 
have 
a 
useful 
role, 
with 
constructive 
third-party 
analysis 
of 
planning 
options, 
in 
assisting 
States 
in 
particular 
regions 
to 
collaborate 
in 
building 
and 
operating 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant: 
some 
of 
the 
more 
technologically 
developed 
(and 
in 
some 
cases 
oil-
poor) 
countries 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
South 
East 
Asia 
were 
mentioned 
as 
ones 
possibly 
interested 
in 
such 
an 
exercise. 
o 
Financing 
the 
huge 
upfront 
capital 
cost 
of 
major 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
is 
a 
major 
burden 
for 
developing 
countries. 
While 
not 
having, 
or 
needing 
to 
have, 
any 
direct 
financing 
role, 
the 
Agency 
can 
play 
a 
useful 
technical 
support 
role 
in 
compiling 
information, 
assembling 
experts, 
working 
with 
international 
financial 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
World 
Bank, 
and 
generally 
helping 
to 
communicate 
opportunities 
and 
options 
to 
interested 
Member 
States. 
o 
The 
IAEA, 
together 
with 
established 
nuclear 
power 
countries, 
should 
continue 
to 
assist 
States 
in 
meeting 
the 
immense 
challenge 
of 
building 
the 
human 
resources 
needed 
to 
support 
nuclear 
power 
operations. 
Expanding 
the 
capacity 
of 
colleges, 
universities 
and 
nuclear 
research 
institutes 
for 
intensive 
training 
of 
nuclear 
specialists, 
assisting 
countries 
to 
send 
personnel 
abroad 
for 
training, 
and 
providing 
continuous 
education 
and 
on-the-job 
training 
activities 
within 
nuclear 
industry 
are 
all 
areas 
in 
which 
the 
Agency 
can 
play 
an 
enhanced 
role. 
o 
On 
issues 
related 
to 
research 
and 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
technology, 
there 
was 
a 
general 
view 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
give 
policy 
support 
to 
efforts 
to 
close 
the 
fuel 
cycle 
to 
the 
extent 
that 
this 
can 
be 
done 
in 
ways 
that 
enhance 
the 
sustainability 
of 
nuclear

energy 
systems, 
decrease 
the 
amount 
of 
waste 
requiring 
management, 
and 
help 
to 
reduce 
rather 
than 
increase 
proliferation 
risks. 


Making 
Nuclear 
Technology 
More 
Readily 
Available 


o 
The 
IAEA 
should 
continue 
and 
if 
possible 
increase 
its 
activities 
on 
the 
transfer 
of 
technologies, 
training, 
capacity 
building 
and 
the 
more 
efficient 
use 
of 
nuclear 
and 
nuclear-related 
technologies 
in 
human 
health 
and 
agriculture, 
including 
normative 
support 
(e.g. 
guidelines) 
to 
national 
counterparts 
and 
other 
organisations 
(e.g. 
OIE, 
the 
World 
Organization 
for 
Animal 
Health). 
o 
The 
IAEA 
should 
build 
on 
its 
existing 
outstanding 
collaboration 
with 
the 
FAO, 
and 
increase 
it 
with 
other 
international 
organisations 
such 
as 
the 
WHO, 
OIE, 
and 
UNIDO. 
Since 
sustainable 
agricultural 
development 
will 
only 
be 
achieved 
if 
market 
driven 
and 
profitable, 
it 
is 
also 
important 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
broaden 
its 
collaborative 
network 
to 
more 
actively 
include 
the 
private 
sector. 
o 
The 
Agency 
should 
use 
specific 
nuclear 
technologies 
and 
molecular 
biology 
knowledge 
to 
develop 
better 
diagnostic 
agents 
and 
tools 
-including 
the 
use 
of 
non-invasive 
stable 
isotopes 
for 
tracing 
-to 
prevent 
and 
control 
diseases 
and 
pests 
of 
importance 
in 
plants, 
animals 
and 
humans. 
o 
Given 
the 
need 
for 
cancer 
to 
assume 
a 
higher 
priority 
on 
the 
global 
health 
agenda, 
and 
the 
role 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Programme 
on 
Action 
for 
Cancer 
Therapy 
(PACT) 
in 
this 
area, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
and 
strengthen 
PACT 
and 
its 
ability 
to 
help 
its 
Member 
States 
raise 
funds, 
and 
plan 
and 
build 
national 
cancer 
control 
programmes 
with 
national 
guidelines 
adapted 
to 
local 
needs. 
o 
Given 
that 
the 
role 
of 
radiotherapy 
will 
still 
be 
essential 
in 
cancer 
care 
over 
the 
next 
25 
years, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
assist 
its 
Member 
States 
in 
upgrading 
radiotherapy 
centers 
and 
training 
professionals. 
In 
this 
area, 
as 
in 
others, 
it 
should 
explore 
the 
potential 
of 
information 
technology 
for 
distance 
learning. 
Responding 
to 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
Concerns 


o 
The 
IAEA 
has 
a 
critical 
policy 
leadership 
role 
to 
play 
in 
building, 
for 
a 
future 
generation 
of 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
a 
robust 
safety 
and 
security 
global 
regime 
and 
the 
associated 
infrastructure 
that 
can 
guarantee 
long 
term 
attention 
to 
safety 
and 
security. 
Such 
a 
regime 
needs 
to 
be 
based 
on 
sharing 
state 
of 
the 
art 
scientific 
and 
technical 
knowledge, 
and 
operational 
information 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
nuclear 
facility 
decommissioning, 
waste 
management, 
and 
the 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
The 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
the 
focal 
point 
for 
this 
global 
regime 
by 
maintaining 
and 
perfecting 
its 
safety 
standards, 
encouraging 
compliance 
and 
helping 
to 
foster 
strong 
national 
regulatory 
structures. 
o 
The 
IAEA 
also 
needs 
to 
be 
concerned 
with 
the 
current 
fleet 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
some 
of 
which 
fall 
behind 
in 
safety 
performance 
either 
due 
to 
limited 
resources 
for 
upgrades, 
lack 
of 
awareness 
of 
the 
deficiencies, 
or 
simply 
because 
of 
complacency 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
proper 
safety 
culture. 
The 
chains 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
are 
no 
stronger 
than 
their 
weakest 
links 
and 
those 
who 
are 
lagging 
behind 
need 
to 
be 
given 
priority 
attention 
and 
help. 
o 
The 
new 
generation 
of 
reactors 
that 
will 
be 
designed 
and 
constructed 
in 
the 
next 
25 
years 
will 
operate 
along 
with 
many 
of 
the 
current 
438 
operating 
reactors 
worldwide. 
The 
regulation 
of 
safety 
and 
security 
should 
not 
shy 
away 
from 
forcing 
shutdown 
of 
old 
(or 
indeed 
new) 
reactors 
in 
cases 
where 
this 
is 
ever 
considered 
necessary. 
It 
will 
be 
necessary

to 
keep 
under 
continuous 
review 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and, 
as 
appropriate, 
upgrade 
safety 
culture, 
plant 
hardware, 
procedures 
and 
emergency 
preparedness 
plans. 


o 
In 
this 
regard, 
the 
Agency 
should 
also 
plan 
to 
increase 
the 
frequency 
and 
scope 
of 
its 
international 
peer 
review 
missions 
of 
regulatory 
bodies 
and 
the 
safety 
performance 
of 
power 
plant 
and 
other 
nuclear 
facilities. 
o 
Since 
technically 
sound 
and 
publicly 
acceptable 
waste 
management 
practices 
are 
essential 
the 
IAEAÂs 
work 
and 
assistance 
in 
this 
area 
will 
also 
continue 
to 
be 
indispensable, 
as 
will 
the 
construction 
and 
putting 
into 
operation 
by 
States 
of 
waste 
disposal 
facilities, 
in 
particular 
for 
spent 
fuel 
and 
high 
level 
waste. 
o 
In 
the 
area 
of 
sealed 
radioactive 
sources, 
the 
IAEA 
could 
help 
States 
with: 
the 
proper 
identification 
of 
sources 
through 
the 
establishment 
in 
all 
countries 
of 
accurate 
up 
to 
date 
national 
records; 
the 
regaining 
of 
control 
over 
orphan 
sources; 
and, 
importantly, 
the 
development 
of 
associated 
security 
measures. 
o 
Given 
that 
even 
with 
a 
stringent 
global 
safety 
regime 
there 
will 
be 
incidents 
and 
accidents, 
emergency 
preparedness 
plans 
will 
need 
to 
address 
such 
eventualities. 
The 
IAEA 
should 
enhance 
its 
role 
in 
coordinating 
international 
radiological 
and 
nuclear 
emergency 
planning, 
preparedness 
and 
response, 
helping 
States 
to 
prepare 
for 
and 
respond 
to 
emergencies 
through 
setting 
standards, 
developing 
binding 
international 
conventions, 
organising 
international 
peer 
reviews 
and 
further 
developing 
an 
international 
system 
of 
emergency 
preparedness. 
Responding 
to 
Nuclear 
Weapons 
Proliferation 
Concerns 


o 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system 
does 
not 
exist 
in 
a 
vacuum. 
It 
is 
inextricably 
connected 
to, 
and 
is 
an 
indispensable 
component 
of, 
the 
wider 
arms 
control 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
are 
two 
sides 
of 
the 
same 
coin. 
Therefore, 
the 
sustainable 
strengthening 
of 
nuclear 
verification 
must 
be 
accompanied 
by 
sustained 
cuts 
in 
nuclear 
arsenals 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
further 
steps 
towards 
a 
nuclear 
weapon-free 
world. 
o 
Given 
that 
public 
confidence 
in 
effective 
nuclear 
verification 
is 
likely 
to 
be 
a 
precondition 
for 
the 
significantly 
expanded 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
it 
is 
important 
that 
the 
IAEA 
continues 
to 
fulfil 
its 
verification 
responsibilities 
credibly 
by 
perfecting 
its 
safeguards 
system 
and 
applying 
it 
in 
an 
impartial 
and 
objective 
manner. 
o 
IAEA 
verification 
will 
only 
be 
able 
to 
provide 
credible, 
impartial 
information 
to 
decision 
makers 
that 
would 
not 
otherwise 
be 
available, 
if 
its 
inspectors 
are 
provided 
adequate 
authority, 
are 
aided 
by 
all 
available 
information, 
backed 
by 
an 
effective 
compliance 
mechanism, 
and 
supported 
by 
international 
consensus. 
o 
States 
with 
relevant 
non-proliferation 
undertakings 
should 
support 
the 
IAEAÂs 
work 
in 
this 
regard 
by 
bringing 
into 
force 
the 
safeguards 
agreements 
they 
have 
committed 
to 
and 
conclude 
Additional 
Protocols 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
the 
IAEA 
with 
the 
required 
legal 
authority 
for 
its 
verification 
work. 
Only 
then 
will 
the 
IAEA 
have 
the 
basic 
tools 
it 
needs 
to 
draw 
safeguards 
conclusions 
about 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
o 
In 
some 
cases, 
e.g. 
where 
there 
has 
been 
a 
pattern 
of 
less 
than 
cooperative 
past 
behaviour, 
there 
may 
well 
be 
a 
need 
to 
seek 
investigative 
authority 
going 
beyond 
the 
Additional 
Protocol.

o 
Lessons 
must 
also 
be 
drawn 
from 
the 
discovery 
of 
covert 
nuclear 
supply 
networks, 
and 
relevant 
information 
furnished 
to 
the 
IAEA 
to 
assist 
the 
Agency 
in 
drawing 
its 
safeguards 
conclusions. 
Supply-side 
controls 
offer 
some 
promise 
of 
raising 
the 
costs 
and 
risks 
of 
would-be 
illicit 
suppliers, 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
explore 
ways 
to 
build 
agreement 
on 
controls 
of 
this 
nature 
which 
would 
not 
unnecessarily 
hinder 
the 
development 
of 
peaceful 
uses. 
o 
The 
expansion 
of 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
will 
only 
be 
possible 
if 
the 
proliferation 
risk 
created 
by 
the 
further 
spread 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology 
such 
as 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
is 
minimized. 
The 
Agency 
needs 
to 
continue 
its 
work 
in 
trying 
to 
build 
consensus 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
international 
fuel 
bank 
or 
the 
development 
of 
other 
acceptable 
international 
arrangements 
aimed 
at 
guaranteeing 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
and 
avoiding 
the 
need 
for 
the 
development 
at 
the 
national 
level 
of 
full 
fuel 
cycle 
capability 
with 
the 
inherent 
proliferation 
risks 
that 
poses. 
Mr. 
President, 


Throughout 
the 
deliberations 
of 
the 
Scientific 
Forum 
there 
was 
a 
strong 
sense 
that 
the 
matters 
we 
were 
discussing 
were 
at 
the 
cutting 
edge 
of 
the 
international 
public 
policy 
debate 
Â 
with 
widespread 
current 
concerns 
about 
energy 
security, 
about 
the 
environmental 
impact 
of 
fossil 
fuels 
and 
renewed 
fears 
about 
a 
new 
surge 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
making 
the 
whole 
constellation 
of 
issues 
about 
both 
the 
peaceful 
and 
non-peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
more 
alive 
and 
important 
than 
they 
have 
been 
for 
many 
years. 
There 
was 
a 
recurring 
hope 
evident 
in 
the 
presentations 
that 
policymakers 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
think 
hard 
about 
whether 
present 
policies 
and 
institutional 
structures 
and 
resources 
were 
really 
up 
to 
the 
multiple 
challenges 
the 
international 
community 
was 
now 
facing. 


I 
discerned 
throughout 
our 
deliberations 
a 
great 
respect 
for 
the 
role 
and 
competence 
of 
the 
IAEA 
right 
across 
the 
range 
of 
its 
mandate, 
and 
great 
confidence 
in 
the 
organisationÂs 
leadership. 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
the 
Agency, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
will 
justify 
that 
confidence 
by 
looking 
carefully 
at 
our 
conclusions 
and 
recommendations, 
and 
continue 
to 
work 
hard 
Â 
in 
an 
international 
environment 
that 
is 
becoming 
ever 
more 
challenging 
Â 
to 
maintain 
a 
reputation 
for 
professionalism 
and 
independence 
that 
is 
second 
to 
none 
in 
the 
family 
of 
international 
institutions.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(continued) 
(GC(51)/5) 
1. 
Mr. 
VALLIM 
GUERREIRO 
(Brazil) 
said 
that 
international 
cooperation 
in 
all 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
extremely 
important 
and 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
unique. 
2. 
It 
was 
essential 
that 
an 
adequate 
balance 
be 
struck 
between 
the 
main 
pillars 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
commitments 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field: 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
peaceful 
uses. 
Those 
commitments 
were 
central 
to 
the 
bargain 
enshrined 
in 
the 
NPT 
and 
should 
be 
implemented 
with 
perseverance 
and 
tenacity. 
Brazil, 
together 
with 
other 
partners, 
had 
shown 
an 
unflinching 
dedication 
to 
the 
objective 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
world. 
Proliferation 
was 
only 
an 
extremely 
serious 
international 
concern 
as 
long 
as 
there 
were 
still 
nuclear 
weapons 
to 
proliferate. 
Non-proliferation 
would 
remain 
elusive 
while 
those 
weapons 
continued 
to 
exist. 
It 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
concern 
that 
the 
advances 
made 
in 
refining 
and 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
not 
been 
matched 
by 
a 
corresponding 
serious 
effort 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
3. 
The 
51st 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
coincided 
with 
the 
Conference 
on 
Facilitating 
the 
Entry 
into 
Force 
of 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty. 
Ten 
years 
after 
that 
Treaty 
had 
been 
opened 
for 
signature, 
the 
prohibition 
of 
nuclear 
tests 
was 
still 
not 
a 
legal 
obligation. 
What 
was 
even 
more 
distressing 
was 
that 
there 
was 
no 
prospect 
of 
the 
Treaty 
entering 
into 
force. 
Indeed, 
in 
some 
quarters 
there 
was 
open 
opposition 
to 
the 
idea 
that 
nuclear 
tests 
should 
be 
forgone 
once 
and 
for 
all 
and 
an 
insistence 
that, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
national 
security, 
that 
option 
should 
remain 
open. 
Some 
urged 
the 
view 
that 
a 
unilateral, 
voluntary 
and 
non-binding 
assurance 
of 
a 
moratorium 
was 
sufficient. 
That 
was 
not 
the 
case, 
in 
the 
same 
way 
as 
unilateral, 
voluntary 
and 
non-binding 
assurances 
by 
non-nuclear-
weapon 
States 
about 
their 
peaceful 
nuclear 
intentions 
had 
rightly 
never 
been 
considered 
enough 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
CTBT 
was 
the 
only 
treaty 
that 
would 
provide 
for 
a 
multilaterally 
agreed, 
universal 
verification 
system 
that 
could 
help 
stem 
the 
process 
of 
sophistication 
of 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
It 
would 
impose 
no 
new 
obligations 
on 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT. 
4. 
The 
same 
applied 
to 
a 
future 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
For 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
the 
verification 
for 
such 
a 
treaty 
was 
already 
in 
place. 
Their 
existing 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
under 
the 
NPT 
provided 
the 
necessary 
assurance 
that 
they 
would 
not 
produce 
nuclear 
material 
for 
purposes 
other 
than 
those 
permitted 
by 
the 
NPT. 
For 
nuclear-weapon 
States, 
however, 
the 
verification 
of 
such 
a 
treaty 
would 
entail 
the 
establishment 
of 
additional 
inspection 
measures. 
The 
insistence 
on 
excluding 
from 
a 
future 
mandate 
of 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
any 
obligation 
to 
negotiate 
a 
verification 
mechanism 
came 
therefore 
as 
no 
surprise. 
While 
Brazil 
had 
agreed 
to 
commencing 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty 
without 
the 
explicit 
obligation 
to 
put 
in 
place 
a 
verification 
system, 
it 
would 
uphold 
the 
need 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
receive 
adequate 
assurances 
that 
the 
commitments 
made 
would 
be 
honoured. 
5. 
Whereas 
there 
were 
no 
internationally 
agreed 
and 
verifiable 
measures 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
there 
was 
an 
ever 
growing 
emphasis 
on 
increasingly 
intrusive 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
by 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States, 
as 
well 
as 
attempts 
to 
restrict 
the 
exercise 
of 
their 
inalienable 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
as 
though 
there 
existed 
in 
the 
NPT 
a 
legal 
hierarchy 
between 
different 
peaceful 
nuclear 
uses. 
The 
importance 
States 
attached 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
was 
decreasing 
by 
comparison 
with 
during 
the 
Cold 
War 
period, 
as 
if 
the 
demise 
of 
the 
geopolitical 
and 
ideological 
confrontation 
had 
given 
rise 
to 
complacency 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Nothing

could 
justify 
the 
existence 
of 
some 
30 
000 
nuclear 
warheads, 
and 
yet 
the 
world 
was 
witnessing 
a 
proliferation 
of 
security 
doctrines 
whose 
practical 
effect 
was 
to 
extend 
the 
relevance 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
well 
into 
the 
foreseeable 
future. 
Against 
that 
background, 
it 
was 
hardly 
reasonable 
to 
expect 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
accept 
such 
imbalance 
and 
blatant 
discrimination 
forever. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
free 
the 
world 
of 
the 
scourge 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
ensure 
non-proliferation. 


6. 
The 
intrinsic 
merits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
were 
being 
recognized 
and 
nuclear 
power 
had 
established 
itself 
as 
an 
economically 
competitive 
and 
environmentally 
sound 
alternative 
to 
meet 
the 
growing 
demand 
for 
electricity. 
That 
development 
could 
be 
ascribed 
to 
a 
number 
of 
factors: 
the 
growth 
of 
the 
world 
economy, 
the 
increasing 
awareness 
of 
the 
man-made 
causes 
of 
global 
warming, 
and 
the 
enhancement 
of 
safety 
standards 
and 
safety 
culture 
worldwide. 
Brazil 
had 
its 
own 
contribution 
to 
make 
to 
that 
nuclear 
renaissance. 
7. 
The 
Brazilian 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
complete 
the 
1300 
MW 
Angra-3 
nuclear 
power 
reactor 
between 
2012 
and 
2014. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
decided 
that 
between 
four 
and 
eight 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
each 
with 
an 
estimated 
output 
of 
1000 
MW, 
would 
be 
operational 
by 
2030. 
Moreover, 
the 
science 
and 
technology 
section 
of 
the 
Programme 
for 
Accelerated 
Growth, 
which 
had 
already 
been 
approved 
by 
Congress, 
provided 
for 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
pilot 
plant 
for 
the 
production 
of 
uranium 
hexafluoride 
in 
Aramar, 
SÃ£o 
Paolo, 
and 
for 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
uranium 
enrichment 
plant 
in 
Resende, 
Rio 
de 
Janeiro. 
Brazil 
also 
planned 
to 
increase 
production 
of 
radioisotopes 
to 
meet 
domestic 
demand. 
8. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
applications, 
his 
country 
supported 
the 
efforts 
to 
increase 
cooperation 
with 
the 
WHO 
in 
developing 
a 
joint 
programme 
of 
cancer 
prevention, 
control, 
treatment 
and 
research. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
on 
the 
development 
of 
innovative 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
contribute 
to 
meeting 
growing 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
21st 
century. 
Brazil 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources, 
an 
example 
of 
which 
was 
the 
IAEA-supported 
Guarani 
aquifer 
project 
undertaken 
by 
Argentina, 
Paraguay, 
Uruguay 
and 
Brazil. 
9. 
His 
country 
shared 
the 
view 
that 
the 
prospect 
of 
non-State 
actors 
acquiring, 
accessing 
or 
using 
radioactive 
material 
was 
too 
daunting 
to 
contemplate. 
His 
Government 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
relevant 
legal 
instruments 
in 
the 
security 
field 
and 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
putting 
in 
place 
of 
measures 
to 
ensure 
the 
nuclear 
security 
of 
both 
the 
Pan 
American 
and 
Para 
Pan 
American 
Games. 
It 
was 
ready 
to 
share 
its 
acquired 
experience 
of 
nuclear 
security 
arrangements 
for 
major 
public 
events. 
10. 
On 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
twentieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
GoiÃ¢nia 
accident, 
from 
3 
to 
5 
October 
2007 
Brazil 
would 
be 
holding 
an 
international 
workshop 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
remediation 
strategies 
and 
long-term 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
after 
accidental 
radioactive 
releases 
to 
the 
environment. 
11. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
were 
of 
paramount 
importance 
and 
served 
to 
fulfil 
the 
organizationÂs 
statutory 
objective 
of 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
the 
mandate 
deriving 
from 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Brazil 
participated 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
both 
as 
a 
donor 
and 
a 
recipient. 
It 
was 
one 
of 
the 
ten 
countries 
offering 
the 
greatest 
number 
of 
placements 
for 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors 
and 
was 
among 
the 
ten 
greatest 
beneficiaries 
of 
fellowships 
under 
the 
programme. 
Experience 
in 
the 
country 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
knowledge 
shared 
was 
first 
adapted 
to 
the 
specific 
conditions 
of 
one 
developing 
country 
so 
it 
could 
later 
be 
used 
more 
efficiently 
by 
other 
developing 
countries. 
Brazil 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
ARCAL 
which 
helped 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
reap 
concrete 
benefits 
from 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
was 
a 
good 
example 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries.

12. 
Brazil 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
achieved 
in 
the 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
ABACC 
under 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement. 
Guidelines 
had 
been 
established 
for 
joint 
safeguards 
activities 
at 
several 
nuclear 
facilities, 
and 
procedures 
for 
unannounced 
inspections 
and 
common 
use 
of 
safeguards 
equipment. 
That 
cooperation 
should 
be 
pursued 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
duplication 
of 
effort 
and 
ensure 
the 
cost-effectiveness 
of 
safeguards 
activities. 
13. 
Mr. 
SHANNON 
(Australia), 
congratulating 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
its 
founding, 
recalled 
that 
Australia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
small 
number 
of 
States 
that 
had 
drafted 
the 
Statute 
and 
was 
proud 
to 
have 
contributed 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
mission 
over 
its 
first 
half 
century. 
14. 
The 
year 
2007 
also 
marked 
the 
tenth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Australia 
had 
been 
very 
active 
in 
developing 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
and 
had 
been 
the 
first 
State 
to 
bring 
an 
additional 
protocol 
into 
force 
in 
December 
1997. 
That 
instrument 
was 
critical 
in 
enabling 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
assurances 
about 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
Australia 
encouraged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol 
as 
part 
of 
the 
contemporary 
safeguards 
standard. 
It 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
countries 
to 
assist 
States 
in 
the 
Asia 
and 
Pacific 
region 
with 
the 
application 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
15. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
encourage 
States 
not 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
join 
the 
Treaty 
as 
non-
nuclear-weapon 
States. 
The 
NPT 
had 
come 
under 
serious 
challenge 
in 
recent 
years, 
particularly 
from 
States 
that 
had 
pursued 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities. 
The 
risk 
had 
also 
been 
demonstrated 
of 
a 
State 
gaining 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
while 
an 
NPT 
member, 
then 
announcing 
its 
withdrawal 
in 
order 
to 
pursue 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes. 
Such 
challenges 
underlined 
the 
need 
to 
work 
together 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Treaty 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
16. 
IranÂs 
continuing 
defiance 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
and 
Agency 
Board 
resolutions, 
and 
its 
long 
history 
of 
clandestine 
nuclear 
activity 
and 
safeguards 
non-compliance, 
gave 
rise 
to 
legitimate 
international 
concerns 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Australia 
welcomed 
IranÂs 
stated 
willingness 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
address 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
and 
hoped 
that 
that 
shift 
in 
approach 
constituted 
a 
strategic 
decision 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
resolving 
those 
matters 
and 
implementing 
safeguards. 
However, 
resolution 
of 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
was 
not 
sufficient 
to 
restore 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
would 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
build 
confidence 
regarding 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
by 
implementing 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
meeting 
all 
its 
obligations 
under 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
Until 
it 
did 
so, 
there 
remained 
a 
basis 
for 
further 
Security 
Council 
action. 
Australia 
urged 
Iran 
to 
take 
the 
steps 
required 
to 
build 
confidence 
in 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
consider 
carefully 
the 
far-reaching 
political 
and 
economic 
benefits 
that 
would 
result 
from 
such 
cooperation. 
17. 
Australia 
had 
joined 
the 
international 
community 
in 
condemning 
the 
nuclear 
explosive 
test 
by 
the 
DPRK 
in 
October 
2006. 
However, 
it 
had 
been 
encouraged 
by 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
2007 
towards 
resolving 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
of 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
the 
ongoing 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
arrangement 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
Those 
developments 
were 
important 
steps 
towards 
implementation 
of 
the 
six-party 
agreement 
of 
13 
February 
2007 
and 
the 
goal 
of 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
Australia 
encouraged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
continue 
its 
cooperation 
and 
encouraged 
all 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
to 
maintain 
a 
positive 
momentum 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
full 
and 
prompt 
implementation 
of 
their 
commitments. 
18. 
His 
country 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
international 
standards 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
voluntary 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
its 
supplementary 
guidance. 
It 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
activities, 
including 
through 
financial 
contributions 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
The

Organisation 
had 
worked 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
controls 
over 
vulnerable 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
South-East 
Asia 
and 
the 
Pacific. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
participation 
in 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
Seminar 
on 
Combating 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
held 
in 
Sydney 
in 
May 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
had 
been 
welcome. 


19. 
International 
exchange 
of 
knowledge 
helped 
build 
effective 
and 
efficient 
regulatory 
systems, 
which 
were 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
sustaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety. 
Australia 
had 
been 
pleased 
to 
host 
an 
IRRS 
mission 
in 
June 
and 
July 
2007; 
it 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
report 
and 
stood 
ready 
to 
share 
the 
knowledge 
gained. 
20. 
Australia 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
International 
Steering 
Committee 
on 
Denial 
of 
Shipments 
of 
Radioactive 
Material 
and 
appreciated 
the 
further 
refinement 
of 
the 
action 
plan 
agreed 
upon 
in 
the 
second 
meeting 
in 
June 
2007. 
It 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
implementation 
of 
the 
plan 
to 
ensure 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
all 
radioactive 
material, 
including 
fuel 
cycle 
material, 
radiopharmaceuticals 
and 
radioactive 
sources. 
21. 
His 
country 
made 
a 
strong 
contribution 
to 
advancing 
peaceful 
nuclear 
applications. 
In 
April, 
the 
Australian 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
opened 
AustraliaÂs 
new 
research 
reactor, 
OPAL, 
which 
would 
be 
one 
of 
the 
top 
reactors 
in 
the 
world 
for 
scientific 
research. 
It 
was 
honoured 
that 
the 
Australian 
Nuclear 
Science 
and 
Technology 
Organisation 
had 
been 
designated 
an 
IAEA 
collaborating 
centre 
for 
neutron 
scattering 
applications 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
hosting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
International 
Conference 
on 
Research 
Reactors 
in 
Sydney 
in 
November, 
which 
would 
be 
followed 
by 
a 
regional 
meeting 
to 
share 
experience 
gained 
in 
planning 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
AustraliaÂs 
HIFAR 
research 
reactor. 
22. 
His 
country 
made 
substantial 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
had 
always 
paid 
its 
share 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
It 
was 
also 
engaged 
in 
a 
range 
of 
bilateral 
and 
regional 
nuclear 
cooperation 
activities. 
Australia 
was 
currently 
chairing 
the 
RCA 
and 
had 
recently 
provided 
extrabudgetary 
funding 
for 
three 
RCA 
projects 
aimed 
at 
improving 
regional 
radiological 
safety 
capabilities. 
It 
had 
also 
made 
very 
significant 
in-kind 
contributions 
through 
the 
transfer 
of 
Australian 
advanced 
technologies 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
human 
and 
physical 
resources 
to 
assist 
in 
enhancing 
technical 
capabilities 
and 
capacity 
in 
participating 
RCA 
States. 
23. 
There 
was 
increased 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
worldwide 
owing 
to 
the 
rising 
demand 
for 
energy, 
concerns 
about 
energy 
security 
and 
recognition 
of 
its 
potential 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
challenge 
of 
climate 
change. 
Australia 
was 
committed 
to 
efficient 
and 
diversified 
energy 
supplies, 
including 
zero 
and 
low 
greenhouse 
gas 
emission 
sources, 
and 
to 
ensuring 
that 
energy 
remained 
reliable, 
affordable 
and 
secure. 
It 
saw 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
an 
important 
component 
in 
that 
mix. 
As 
the 
country 
with 
the 
worldÂs 
largest 
uranium 
reserves, 
Australia 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
develop 
its 
uranium 
industry 
in 
a 
sustainable 
manner. 
Although 
it 
did 
not 
currently 
have 
a 
nuclear 
power 
industry, 
the 
Australian 
Government 
had 
announced 
in 
April 
a 
new 
strategy 
to 
prepare 
for 
the 
possible 
expansion 
of 
AustraliaÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
industry, 
including 
the 
harmonization 
of 
existing 
uranium 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
legislation 
and 
consideration 
of 
new 
regulation 
needed 
for 
the 
future. 
24. 
Australia 
had 
recently 
joined 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership, 
which 
deserved 
broad 
support 
since 
its 
goal 
of 
enabling 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
expansion 
of 
civilian 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
while 
minimizing 
proliferation 
risks, 
was 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
all 
countries. 
His 
Government 
had 
also 
made 
a 
firm 
commitment 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
Generation 
IV 
advanced 
nuclear 
reactor 
programme 
and 
was 
pursuing 
membership 
of 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
25. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
his 
country 
had 
ratified 
a 
bilateral 
safeguards 
treaty 
with 
China 
and 
had 
signed 
a 
new 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
Russia. 
Those 
countriesÂ 
plans 
for 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
industries 
over 
the 
coming 
decades 
would 
have 
clear 
environmental 
benefits. 
His 
Government 
had 
also 
recently 
announced 
its 
decision, 
in 
principle, 
to 
allow 
the 
export 
of 
uranium 
to 
India 
subject

to 
several 
strict 
conditions, 
including 
IndiaÂs 
conclusion 
of 
safeguards 
agreements 
both 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
with 
Australia, 
its 
conclusion 
of 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
a 
consensus 
decision 
by 
the 
NSG 
on 
an 
exception 
to 
its 
guidelines. 


26. 
Mr. 
ZAMBEZI 
(Zambia) 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
Member 
States. 
The 
programme 
on 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients 
provided 
a 
unique 
opportunity 
for 
the 
safe 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
in 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
disease. 
Countries 
like 
Zambia 
would 
greatly 
benefit 
from 
such 
programmes, 
especially 
since 
its 
newly 
established 
cancer 
treatment 
facilities 
were 
now 
operational. 
27. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
work 
in 
all 
regions 
of 
the 
world 
deserved 
support 
and 
should 
remain 
comprehensive 
and 
non-selective. 
28. 
Noting 
that 
the 
Conference 
on 
Facilitating 
the 
Entry 
into 
Force 
of 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-
Test-Ban 
Treaty 
was 
being 
held 
that 
very 
week, 
he 
called 
on 
the 
44 
States 
listed 
in 
Annex 
2 
of 
the 
CTBT 
to 
ratify 
the 
treaty 
to 
allow 
its 
entry 
into 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
29. 
Zambia 
had 
taken 
measures 
to 
address 
radiation 
protection 
issues, 
including 
further 
strengthening 
of 
its 
regulatory 
framework. 
That 
measure 
had 
been 
critical, 
especially 
given 
the 
increased 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
the 
health 
field. 
Regulations 
were 
being 
developed 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
anticipated 
uranium 
recovery 
from 
copper 
mining. 
In 
addition, 
the 
countryÂs 
radiation 
protection 
authority, 
which 
had 
formerly 
been 
attached 
to 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health, 
had 
been 
converted 
into 
an 
independent 
and 
autonomous 
entity. 
30. 
Zambia 
continued 
to 
build 
on 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
infrastructure 
and 
human 
resources 
development 
through 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Developments 
since 
the 
preceding 
General 
Conference 
included 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
Cancer 
Diseases 
Hospital, 
which 
had 
been 
officially 
inaugurated 
on 
19 
July 
2007 
and 
was 
slowly 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
cancer 
patients 
who 
were 
sent 
abroad 
for 
treatment. 
31. 
His 
country 
supported 
technical 
cooperation 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
AFRA, 
which 
continued 
to 
bring 
on 
board 
specialized 
teams 
of 
experts 
that 
helped 
address 
the 
problems 
of 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
region 
using 
local 
capacities. 
Since 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
Zambia 
had 
received 
further 
AFRA 
missions 
and 
local 
scientific 
and 
technical 
staff 
had 
participated 
in 
training 
courses, 
seminars, 
coordination 
meetings 
and 
programmes. 
He 
appealed 
to 
cooperating 
partners 
to 
maintain 
their 
financial 
support 
for 
AFRA 
to 
facilitate 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
various 
projects 
designed 
for 
the 
2008Â2009 
cycle. 
32. 
His 
Government 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
2008. 
33. 
Mr. 
SCHALLER 
(Switzerland) 
said 
that, 
for 
the 
preceding 
50 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
worked 
diligently 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
service 
of 
sustainable 
development 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
agriculture, 
health, 
seawater 
desalination 
and 
energy 
generation. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
verification 
component 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
had 
acquired 
an 
increasingly 
political 
dimension. 
Since 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
developments 
in 
the 
non-
proliferation 
field 
had 
figured 
significantly 
in 
diplomatic 
agendas. 
34. 
The 
first 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
held 
in 
May 
2007 
in 
Vienna, 
had 
reproduced 
the 
deadlock 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
the 
report 
it 
had 
adopted 
had 
been 
purely 
procedural 
in 
nature. 
The 
substantive 
debate 
had 
highlighted 
the 
rift 
between 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
sought 
to 
emphasize 
non-proliferation, 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
wished 
to 
focus 
on 
disarmament 
and 
other 
States 
that 
were 
worried 
about 
being 
excluded 
from 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technologies. 
That 
situation 
did 
not 
bode 
well 
for 
the 
second 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
which 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Geneva 
in 
May 
2008.

35. 
The 
United 
States-India 
nuclear 
cooperation 
deal 
called 
into 
question 
the 
current 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
system 
and 
jarred 
with 
several 
recent 
proposals 
aimed 
at 
restricting 
access 
to 
sensitive 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
technologies. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
IAEA 
report 
of 
13 
June 
2007 
entitled 
Possible 
New 
Framework 
for 
the 
Utilization 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy: 
Options 
for 
Assurance 
of 
Supply 
of 
Nuclear 
Fuel 
(GOV/INF/2007/11). 
36. 
Regional 
issues 
had 
also 
attracted 
attention 
and 
the 
developments 
were 
generally 
encouraging. 
37. 
Having 
read 
the 
latest 
report 
on 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
issued 
in 
August 
2007 
(GOV/2007/48), 
his 
country 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Iran 
on 
a 
work 
plan 
to 
resolve 
outstanding 
issues. 
While 
that 
plan 
might 
not 
resolve 
all 
aspects 
of 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
dossier, 
its 
rapid 
implementation 
should 
help 
restore 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Diplomacy 
remained 
the 
best 
way 
to 
resolve 
the 
problem, 
and 
he 
called 
on 
the 
parties 
concerned 
to 
return 
to 
the 
negotiating 
table 
without 
delay 
to 
prevent 
escalation 
which 
would 
have 
consequences 
for 
all 
countries. 
38. 
The 
developments 
in 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
nuclear 
issue 
were 
very 
encouraging. 
The 
most 
significant 
recent 
events 
had 
been 
the 
agreement 
of 
13 
February 
2007 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
six-
party 
talks, 
followed 
by 
the 
return 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facilities. 
At 
the 
negotiations 
held 
in 
early 
September 
in 
Geneva, 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
a 
timeline 
for 
dismantling 
of 
all 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programmes. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
those 
developments, 
he 
called 
on 
all 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
to 
work 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
consensus 
that 
would 
facilitate 
the 
swift 
and 
complete 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
39. 
His 
country 
was 
satisfied 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Accounts 
for 
2006 
and 
supported 
the 
recommendations 
made 
by 
the 
External 
Auditor. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
External 
AuditorÂs 
willingness 
to 
continue 
in 
office 
for 
the 
period 
2008Â2009. 
40. 
At 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
his 
country 
had 
requested 
that 
efforts 
be 
made 
to 
cover 
all 
expenses 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
that, 
after 
the 
exceptions 
made 
in 
preceding 
years, 
notably 
in 
2003 
for 
security 
at 
the 
VIC, 
increases 
in 
both 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
budget 
be 
limited 
to 
compensating 
for 
inflation. 
However, 
the 
proposed 
budget 
for 
2008 
took 
no 
account 
of 
such 
considerations. 
41. 
While 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
rekindle 
the 
discussions 
in 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
which 
had 
resulted 
finally 
in 
an 
unsatisfactory 
consensus, 
he 
reiterated 
his 
countryÂs 
request 
that 
all 
planned 
investments 
be 
integrated 
into 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
Though 
his 
country 
had 
welcomed 
the 
idea 
of 
preparing 
a 
separate 
document 
on 
high-priority 
future 
investments, 
the 
allocation 
of 
funds 
for 
such 
purposes 
should 
be 
subject 
to 
rigorous 
planning 
and 
an 
indication 
should 
be 
given 
of 
the 
funding 
method 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
transparent 
and 
predictable 
budgeting. 
Recourse 
to 
exceptional 
measures, 
such 
as 
the 
use 
of 
the 
cash 
surplus 
or 
extrabudgetary 
contributions, 
should 
be 
limited, 
since 
they 
undermined 
Member 
StatesÂ 
interest 
in 
participating 
actively 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Agency. 
42. 
Recently 
his 
country 
had 
been 
astonished 
by 
the 
impact 
of 
the 
dollar/euro 
exchange 
rate 
used 
by 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
assessed 
contribution. 
The 
Agency 
should 
conduct 
a 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
of 
the 
impact 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
applying 
that 
particular 
exchange 
rate. 
43. 
Several 
of 
the 
comments 
made 
during 
the 
budget 
discussions 
in 
spring 
2007 
could 
be 
taken 
on 
board 
without 
waiting 
for 
the 
introduction 
of 
IPSAS. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
proposal 
to 
establish 
a 
high-level 
working 
group 
to 
examine 
the 
issue 
of 
funding 
in 
the 
medium 
and 
long 
term. 
44. 
Switzerland 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities 
and 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
technical 
cooperation, 
in 
particular 
PACT. 
His 
country 
viewed 
its 
commitment 
to 
technical 

GC(51)/OR.8

September 
2007, 
Page 
7 


cooperation 
as 
a 
duty 
that 
it 
intended 
to 
fulfil 
faithfully. 
It 
was 
also 
committed 
to 
maintaining 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
key 
functions, 
namely 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
verification 
activities. 


45. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
Safeguards 
Implementation 
Report 
for 
2006 
and, 
in 
particular, 
the 
conclusions 
drawn 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
153 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
with 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
in 
force. 
He 
also 
commended 
the 
improved 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
urged 
the 
31 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
concluded 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
do 
so 
promptly. 
46. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
Safeguards 
Statement 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
report, 
though 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
desire 
to 
produce 
a 
report 
in 
specialist 
language 
was 
understandable, 
for 
communication 
purposes 
it 
was 
important 
to 
highlight 
those 
States 
whose 
conduct 
was 
exemplary, 
namely 
the 
32 
States 
mentioned 
in 
paragraph 
1(a). 
Given 
those 
StatesÂ 
commitment 
to 
safeguards 
and 
the 
conclusions 
drawn 
by 
the 
Secretariat, 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
able 
to 
state 
that 
it 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activities. 
The 
information 
contained 
in 
the 
Safeguards 
Statement 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
taken 
up 
by 
the 
media 
and 
it 
was 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
Agency 
to 
convey 
a 
message 
that 
could 
be 
understood 
by 
a 
non-specialist 
audience. 
47. 
The 
22nd 
IAEA 
Fusion 
Energy 
Conference 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Geneva 
in 
2008, 
50 
years 
after 
the 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
Conference 
that 
had 
laid 
the 
foundation 
for 
international 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
fusion 
energy. 
His 
country 
would 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Conference 
and 
the 
commemoration 
of 
that 
historic 
event 
would 
be 
crowned 
with 
success. 
48. 
Mr. 
HIGUERAS 
RAMOS 
(Peru) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
founding 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
world 
peace 
and 
security, 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
had 
contributed 
actively 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives, 
namely 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
regulation 
of 
its 
safe 
use 
and 
the 
application 
of 
verification, 
safeguards 
and 
physical 
protection 
measures. 
The 
international 
community 
now 
relied 
on 
the 
Agency 
both 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
to 
counter 
the 
new 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
49. 
Peru 
firmly 
supported 
all 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
complete 
disarmament 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear, 
chemical 
and 
biological 
weapons 
and 
their 
delivery 
systems. 
It 
had 
unswervingly 
supported 
measures 
to 
achieve 
disarmament, 
prevent 
proliferation, 
promote 
peaceful 
solutions 
to 
conflicts 
and 
improve 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
build 
confidence 
among 
members 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
50. 
Disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
were 
a 
priority 
issue 
on 
the 
international 
agenda, 
but 
there 
was 
an 
imbalance 
between 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
through 
new 
initiatives, 
such 
as 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
and 
the 
failure 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
disarm. 
51. 
Despite 
significant 
changes 
in 
the 
configuration 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime, 
the 
efforts 
of 
certain 
State 
and 
non-State 
actors 
to 
obtain 
access 
to 
nuclear 
weapons 
constituted 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
52. 
Peru 
welcomed 
all 
decisions 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
it 
supported 
its 
initiatives 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
by 
State 
and 
non-State 
actors, 
and 
it 
supported 
the 
application 
of 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
international 
instruments 
in 
force 
such 
as 
the 
NPT 
and 
international 
disarmament 
agreements. 
53. 
The 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
was 
crucial 
to 
achieving 
the 
final 
objective 
of 
general 
and 
complete 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Although 
Peru 
recognized 
the 
right 
of 
every 
State 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
that 
right 
was 
conditional 
upon 
strict 
compliance 
with 
commitments 
to 
non-proliferation 
and

application 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
based 
on 
the 
NPT, 
an 
important 
instrument 
to 
which 
those 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
accede. 


54. 
All 
regions 
should 
likewise 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
and 
conclude 
an 
agreement 
modelled 
on 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty. 
55. 
The 
best 
guarantee 
of 
stability 
and 
peace 
was 
an 
international 
regime 
based 
on 
multilateralism 
and 
the 
consolidation 
of 
clear 
and 
predictable 
legal 
rules 
which 
allowed 
for 
firm, 
effective 
and 
legitimate 
action. 
The 
international 
situation 
showed 
that 
there 
was 
an 
urgent 
need 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
by 
expanding 
its 
verification 
and 
monitoring 
capacities 
and 
its 
other 
responsibilities. 
56. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
at 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
resolving 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
The 
Agency 
had 
verified 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
was 
continuing 
to 
apply 
the 
ad 
hoc 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
arrangement 
with 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
DPRK. 
57. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
to 
promote 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
should 
be 
strengthened. 
New 
challenges 
and 
realities 
necessitated 
a 
review 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
role 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
waste, 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
the 
verification 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones. 
58. 
Peru 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
1999 
and 
had 
been 
applying 
integrated 
safeguards 
since 
2006. 
59. 
The 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
had 
continued 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
number 
of 
programmes, 
projects 
and 
activities 
aimed 
at 
giving 
added 
value 
to 
the 
production 
of 
goods 
and 
services, 
where 
nuclear 
technology 
offered 
comparative 
advantages. 
As 
in 
the 
past, 
Peru 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
the 
country 
and 
it 
had 
worked 
to 
enhance 
the 
safety 
and 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
material, 
providing 
regional 
courses 
on 
the 
subject 
and 
undertaking 
initiatives 
to 
improve 
security-related 
activities. 
Those 
measures 
had 
received 
vital 
support 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
from 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy. 
60. 
With 
Agency 
assistance, 
the 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
and 
a 
number 
of 
other 
national 
institutions 
had 
successfully 
initiated 
cooperation 
projects 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
countryÂs 
human 
resources, 
increasing 
water 
resources 
through 
the 
rational 
use 
of 
coastal 
aquifers 
in 
MÃ¡ncora, 
boosting 
the 
production 
of 
grains 
and 
meat 
through 
the 
genetic 
improvement 
of 
quinua 
and 
kiwicha 
and 
reducing 
the 
mortality 
of 
South 
American 
camelids, 
especially 
alpacas. 
New 
projects 
initiated 
with 
Agency 
cooperation 
covered 
such 
areas 
as 
the 
application 
of 
genomics 
to 
increase 
wool 
production 
in 
alpacas 
and 
improve 
the 
neonatal 
health 
of 
South 
American 
camelids, 
genetic 
improvement 
of 
quinua 
and 
kiwicha, 
introduction 
of 
mutant 
varieties 
of 
barley 
adapted 
to 
climatic 
conditions 
in 
the 
Andes 
5000 
m 
above 
sea 
level, 
management 
of 
the 
MÃ¡ncora 
aquifer 
to 
prevent 
seawater 
intrusion, 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
support 
for 
nuclear 
technology. 
61. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
interest 
in 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
valued 
the 
contribution 
the 
Agency 
made 
to 
national 
objectives 
through 
the 
supply 
of 
equipment, 
materials 
and 
inputs. 
Technology 
and 
knowledge 
transferred 
to 
Peru 
by 
Agency 
experts 
enabled 
the 
country 
to 
train 
its 
technical 
specialists 
locally. 
It 
was 
continuing 
to 
organize 
advanced 
courses 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
biotechnology, 
materials 
science, 
medicine, 
nuclear 
instrumentation 
and 
other 
subjects. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
a 
number 
of 
training 
events 
had 
been 
held 
with 
Agency 
support 
on 
such 
topics 
as 
early 
diagnosis 
of 
Helicobacter 
pylori 
infection 
using 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
installations. 
Peru 
was 
prepared 
to 
host 
similar 
events. 
Contacts 
had 
also 
been 
established 
with 
Agency 
authorities, 
major 
research 
centres 
in 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
with 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
holding 
a 
Latin 
American 
symposium 
in 
2008 
in 
Lima 
on 
optimization 
of 
the 
use 
of 
research 
reactors.

62. 
The 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
cooperation 
received 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Secretariat. 
63. 
In 
keeping 
with 
its 
commitment 
to 
strengthening 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
Peru 
had 
hosted 
a 
regional 
seminar 
in 
Lima 
in 
November 
2006 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean. 
64. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
work 
of 
INLEX 
and, 
in 
December 
2006, 
it 
had 
hosted 
a 
regional 
workshop 
on 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage 
to 
promote 
adherence 
to 
a 
nuclear 
liability 
regime 
and 
to 
discuss 
difficulties, 
concerns 
and 
problems 
that 
States 
in 
the 
region 
might 
encounter 
with 
the 
regime. 
65. 
It 
also 
fully 
supported 
ARCAL 
which 
helped 
establish 
cooperation 
links 
that 
had 
already 
begun 
to 
bear 
fruit 
at 
regional 
level. 
On 
18 
September, 
the 
five 
Andean 
nuclear 
institutions 
that 
had 
been 
at 
the 
origin 
of 
ARCAL, 
among 
them 
the 
Peruvian 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Institute, 
had 
been 
awarded 
the 
2007 
ARCAL 
Prize. 
Mr. 
Hamze 
(Lebanon), 
President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


66. 
Mr. 
SKOKNIC 
(Chile) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
and 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
achievements 
over 
the 
preceding 
year 
had 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
had 
been 
a 
well-deserved 
and 
justified 
recognition 
of 
the 
organizationÂs 
contribution 
to 
world 
peace. 
The 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation, 
safeguards 
application, 
technical 
cooperation, 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
development 
and 
well-being 
of 
all 
Member 
States. 
67. 
Global 
peace 
and 
security 
were 
best 
achieved 
through 
the 
application 
of 
international 
law. 
The 
most 
practical 
and 
consistent 
way 
of 
contributing 
to 
that 
objective 
was 
by 
ratifying 
the 
relevant 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
in 
particular 
those 
pertaining 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Chile 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
peace 
and 
respect 
for 
international 
law, 
as 
was 
demonstrated 
by 
its 
signature 
and 
ratification 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
which 
had 
made 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
the 
first 
densely 
populated 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
world. 
Chile 
had 
also 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
conference 
on 
facilitating 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
that 
Treaty 
which 
was 
being 
held 
that 
week 
would 
prompt 
the 
ten 
countries 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
ratify 
the 
Treaty 
to 
take 
the 
political 
decision 
the 
international 
community 
expected, 
allowing 
it 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
a 
party 
to 
other 
international 
instruments 
pertaining 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
safety, 
emergency 
assistance, 
civil 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage 
and 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
68. 
Strengthening 
the 
safeguards 
system 
was 
crucial 
and 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
sign 
and 
ratify 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
Chile 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
had 
assiduously 
complied 
with 
its 
obligations, 
submitting 
all 
relevant 
declarations. 
The 
annual 
safeguards 
inspection 
visit 
to 
the 
facilities 
of 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
involved 
verification 
work 
pursuant 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
with 
satisfactory 
results. 
69. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
attempted 
to 
reconstruct 
the 
history 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
to 
determine 
its 
current 
scope 
in 
order 
to 
dispel 
any 
doubt 
as 
to 
its 
peaceful 
nature. 
In 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
his 
country 
had 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
cooperate 
in 
a 
full 
and 
transparent 
manner 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
submit 
all 
the 
required 
information, 
in 
line 
with 
to 
the 
various 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
and 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council. 
Chile 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
that 
area 
and 
welcomed 
the 
work 
plan 
that 
had 
been 
agreed 
with 
Iran. 
It 
hoped 
that 
that 
country 
would 
cooperate 
fully 
in 
its 
implementation. 
That 
was 
a 
first 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
which 
should 
be 
followed 
by 
others 
that 
would 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
confirm 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
would 
lead 
to 
the 
application 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 

GC(51)/OR.8

10 


measures 
demanded 
by 
the 
relevant 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
Chile 
trusted 
that 
a 
spirit 
of 
dialogue 
and 
cooperation 
would 
prevail 
and 
that 
the 
issue 
could 
finally 
be 
resolved. 


70. 
The 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
had 
resulted 
in 
considerable 
progress 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
DPRK. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
further 
progress 
would 
be 
made, 
leading 
to 
the 
complete 
abandonment 
by 
the 
DPRK 
of 
its 
military 
nuclear 
programme. 
71. 
His 
country 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
safety 
of 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
had 
insisted 
that 
the 
subject 
should 
remain 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
agenda. 
The 
dialogue 
between 
representatives 
of 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States 
that 
had 
been 
taking 
place 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
proved 
very 
useful 
and 
should 
continue. 
72. 
Chile 
had 
made 
progress 
in 
developing 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
and 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
within 
its 
available 
resources. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
had 
helped 
the 
country 
move 
on 
from 
the 
establishment 
of 
infrastructure 
and 
human 
resources 
to 
addressing 
issues 
of 
major 
economic 
and 
social 
impact. 
The 
countryÂs 
current 
aim 
was 
to 
focus 
on 
strengthening 
and 
improving 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
security, 
with 
the 
involvement 
of 
the 
two 
regulatory 
bodies 
established 
by 
national 
legislation, 
namely 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
and 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Health. 
73. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
SIT, 
Chile 
shared 
the 
concerns 
of 
other 
Member 
States 
regarding 
the 
difficulty 
of 
acquiring 
and 
shipping 
high-activity 
sources 
such 
as 
the 
gamma 
irradiators 
used 
to 
irradiate 
pupae 
to 
combat 
fruit 
flies, 
a 
technique 
which 
had 
proved 
highly 
successful 
in 
Chile 
which 
had 
been 
free 
of 
fruit 
flies 
since 
1995 
and 
had 
been 
able 
to 
assist 
other 
States 
with 
similar 
problems. 
74. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
build 
Member 
StatesÂ 
local 
tecnetium-99m 
production 
capacity 
were 
commendable, 
given 
its 
importance 
as 
the 
most 
frequently 
used 
radioisotope 
in 
nuclear 
medicine. 
Chile 
was 
participating 
in 
an 
IAEA 
coordinated 
research 
project 
on 
the 
development 
of 
techniques 
for 
small-scale 
local 
molybdenum-99 
production, 
to 
which 
the 
Argonne 
National 
Laboratory 
in 
the 
United 
States 
was 
making 
a 
valuable 
contribution, 
and 
it 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
produce 
its 
own 
molybdenum-99 
before 
long 
for 
use 
in 
diagnostic 
examinations. 
75. 
The 
Regional 
Strategic 
Profile 
for 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
had 
been 
elaborated 
and 
aimed 
at 
consolidating 
the 
Strategic 
Alliance 
between 
ARCAL 
and 
the 
Agency 
through 
ongoing 
consultations 
to 
optimize 
cooperation. 
76. 
Chile 
had 
joined 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Radiological 
and 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agencies 
with 
a 
view 
to 
exchanging 
experience 
with 
other 
regulators 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
and 
incorporate 
best 
practices. 
Efforts 
to 
strengthen 
regulatory 
processes 
included 
stricter 
application 
of 
legislation, 
more, 
and 
more 
frequent 
inspections, 
and 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
courses 
on 
protection 
of 
workers 
exposed 
to 
radiation. 
77. 
Although 
some 
Latin 
American 
countries 
allocated 
limited 
resources 
for 
R&D 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field, 
others 
had 
costly 
facilities 
like 
nuclear 
research 
reactors, 
some 
of 
which 
were 
underutilized. 
His 
country 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
shared 
use 
of 
reactors 
by 
establishing 
networks 
and 
facilitating 
contacts 
between 
universities 
and 
institutions 
in 
developed 
countries 
and 
reactor 
operators 
in 
Latin 
America. 
It 
hoped 
that 
a 
future 
mission 
to 
Chile 
would 
help 
identify 
opportunities 
for 
such 
cooperative 
arrangements. 
78. 
His 
country 
had 
followed 
closely 
the 
AgencyÂs 
pilot 
programme 
in 
South 
Africa 
to 
develop 
mobile 
hot 
cells 
for 
conditioning 
spent 
high-activity 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
it 
hoped 
that 
a 
similar 
initiative 
would 
be 
launched 
in 
Latin 
America 
shortly.

79. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative, 
Chile 
was 
considering 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
RECH-2 
reactor 
to 
low-enriched 
fuel. 
In 
May 
2006, 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
RECH-1 
reactor 
had 
been 
completed 
and, 
based 
on 
that 
experience, 
it 
should 
be 
possible 
to 
convert 
the 
RECH-2 
more 
swiftly. 
80. 
Public 
opinion 
in 
Chile 
continued 
to 
be 
influenced 
by 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
radiological 
accident 
in 
2005. 
The 
country 
was 
ready 
to 
make 
every 
effort 
avoid 
further 
accidents. 
While 
the 
probability 
of 
accidents 
was 
low, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
be 
prepared 
for 
radiological 
emergencies. 
Thus, 
a 
second 
IAEA-supported 
course 
on 
medical 
response 
to 
radiological 
emergencies 
would 
be 
held 
shortly 
and 
it 
was 
hoped 
that 
the 
number 
of 
participants 
would 
be 
greater 
than 
for 
the 
first 
course. 
81. 
The 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
submitted 
a 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
for 
2009Â2011 
on 
upgrading 
of 
the 
radioisotope 
production 
laboratory 
at 
the 
La 
Reina 
Nuclear 
Centre, 
incorporating 
advanced 
occupational 
radiation 
protection 
concepts 
and 
good 
production 
practices. 
Furthermore, 
with 
its 
own 
resources 
and 
an 
investment 
of 
around 
US 
$300 
000 
it 
was 
embarking 
on 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
cyclotron 
production 
laboratories 
to 
bring 
them 
in 
line 
with 
international 
standards. 
82. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
long-standing 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
Chile 
had 
enabled 
it 
to 
achieve 
a 
high 
level 
of 
development 
in 
cancer 
diagnosis 
and 
therapy. 
It 
was 
now 
in 
a 
position 
to 
contribute 
experts 
and 
train 
doctors 
in 
public 
and 
private 
radiotherapy 
facilities 
in 
the 
use 
of 
teletherapy 
and 
brachytherapy 
and 
various 
nuclear 
medicine 
techniques, 
including 
PET 
and 
PET/CT. 
83. 
The 
challenge 
of 
growing 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
21st 
century 
was 
widely 
recognized. 
The 
problems 
arising 
from 
population 
growth, 
rising 
energy 
and 
electricity 
consumption, 
volatility 
of 
fossil 
fuel 
prices, 
concerns 
over 
assurance 
of 
supply 
and 
growing 
global 
environmental 
concerns 
were 
difficult 
to 
resolve. 
Against 
that 
complex 
backdrop, 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
once 
again 
the 
subject 
of 
economic, 
political, 
scientific 
and 
technical 
analysis 
and 
debate. 
There 
was 
no 
easy 
answer 
to 
the 
legitimate 
question 
whether 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
help 
address 
some 
of 
those 
energy 
challenges 
both 
in 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries. 
In 
February 
2007, 
the 
Chilean 
Government 
had 
established 
a 
working 
group 
composed 
of 
12 
independent 
experts 
specializing 
in 
different 
scientific 
fields 
to 
collect 
information 
on 
the 
advantages, 
cost 
and 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
working 
group 
had 
also 
been 
tasked 
to 
identify 
relevant 
studies 
which 
would 
facilitate 
the 
taking 
of 
an 
informed 
decision. 
The 
first 
report 
of 
the 
working 
group 
was 
due 
shortly 
and 
its 
recommendations 
would 
shape 
future 
action. 
Chile 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
valuable 
support 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency. 
84. 
Despite 
the 
increased 
transparency 
and 
credibility 
of 
the 
nuclear 
industry, 
controversial 
issues 
like 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
waste 
management 
still 
need 
to 
be 
addressed 
at 
the 
difficult 
level 
of 
public 
acceptance. 
To 
that 
end, 
more 
information 
should 
be 
made 
available 
on 
the 
beneficial 
uses 
and 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
It 
remained 
to 
be 
seen 
how 
public 
perception 
could 
be 
changed 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident. 
Nevertheless, 
there 
were 
signs 
that 
public 
opinion 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
slowly 
changing. 
A 
survey 
conducted 
in 
2007 
showed 
that, 
in 
those 
European 
countries 
that 
had 
worked 
hard 
to 
achieve 
transparency 
and 
credibility, 
the 
public 
had 
greater 
knowledge 
of 
the 
risks 
and 
benefits 
of 
major 
projects. 
85. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
work 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
his 
impartial 
and 
dedicated 
leadership 
of 
the 
organization. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
them.

Implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Democratic 
People's 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
(GC(51)/19, 
L.3 
and 
Add.1) 


86. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
item 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(50)/RES/15 
adopted 
the 
preceding 
year. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
reported 
periodically 
to 
the 
Board 
on 
the 
issue 
during 
the 
intervening 
year 
and 
his 
report, 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/19, 
summarized 
developments 
over 
that 
period. 
A 
draft 
resolution 
on 
the 
agenda 
item 
had 
been 
submitted 
in 
document 
GC(51)/L.3 
and 
Add.1. 
87. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
it 
had 
been 
negotiated 
by 
a 
core 
group 
of 
countries 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
China 
and 
was 
now 
sponsored 
by 
61 
Member 
States. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
six-
party 
talks 
and 
the 
return 
of 
Agency 
staff 
to 
the 
DPRK 
for 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
activities, 
but 
expressed 
deep 
concern 
about 
the 
nuclear 
explosive 
test 
proclaimed 
by 
the 
DPRK 
in 
October 
2006. 
It 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
process 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
the 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
through 
the 
agreement 
on 
initial 
actions. 
Given 
the 
large 
number 
of 
sponsors 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
was 
supported 
by 
the 
five 
Agency 
Member 
States 
involved 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
her 
country 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
88. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
he 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/L.3 
and 
Add.1 
without 
a 
vote. 
89. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
90. 
Mr. 
AMANO 
(Japan), 
noting 
that 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
authorized 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
9 
July 
2007 
to 
implement 
the 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
arrangement 
in 
the 
DPRK 
foreseen 
in 
the 
initial 
actions 
agreed 
at 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
prompt 
response 
to 
that 
decision, 
including 
the 
verification 
of 
the 
shutdown 
status 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
initial 
actions 
was 
a 
first 
step 
towards 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
Joint 
Statement 
issued 
by 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
in 
September 
2005. 
Further 
progress 
in 
the 
talks 
was 
needed 
to 
achieve 
the 
disablement 
of 
all 
existing 
nuclear 
facilities, 
the 
provision 
of 
a 
complete 
declaration 
of 
all 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
the 
next 
phase, 
and 
the 
abandonment 
of 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes. 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
with 
its 
partners 
to 
achieve 
those 
goals. 
91. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
also 
comply 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1718 
(2006) 
and 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
its 
safeguards 
agreement, 
giving 
the 
Agency 
access 
to 
individuals, 
documentation, 
equipment 
and 
facilities 
as 
required. 
Japan, 
which 
had 
made 
a 
positive 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
activities 
in 
the 
DPRK, 
trusted 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
make 
full 
use 
of 
its 
knowledge 
and 
experience, 
inter 
alia 
in 
the 
ongoing 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility, 
and 
that 
the 
other 
parties 
concerned 
and 
Member 
States 
would 
contribute 
to 
its 
activities. 
92. 
Mr. 
TANG 
Guoqiang 
(China) 
said 
that, 
thanks 
to 
the 
concerted 
efforts 
of 
China 
and 
the 
other 
parties 
concerned, 
the 
six-party 
talks 
had 
produced 
three 
documents: 
the 
September 
2005 
Joint 
Statement, 
the 
February 
2007 
initial 
actions 
text 
and 
the 
July 
2007 
framework 
consensus 
text. 
The 
DPRK 
had 
shut 
down 
and 
sealed 
its 
nuclear 
facility 
under 
an 
Agency 
monitoring 
and 
verification

arrangement. 
All 
working 
groups 
established 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
talks 
were 
currently 
operational. 
Major 
progress 
had 
thus 
been 
made 
towards 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 


93. 
The 
six-party 
talks 
had 
become 
an 
important 
platform 
for 
enhancing 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
trust, 
and 
promoting 
harmony 
in 
north-east 
Asia. 
The 
parties 
had 
engaged 
in 
candid 
dialogue 
and 
earnest 
negotiations, 
seeking 
to 
narrow 
their 
differences 
and 
build 
common 
ground. 
They 
now 
had 
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
the 
momentum 
achieved 
to 
strengthen 
communication 
and 
coordination 
and 
implement 
the 
agreements 
reached 
in 
a 
comprehensive 
and 
a 
balanced 
manner. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
deliberations 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
assist 
in 
achieving 
that 
goal. 
Resolving 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
through 
dialogue 
was 
critical 
for 
the 
peace 
and 
stability 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
north-east 
Asia. 
China 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
constructive 
role, 
working 
with 
all 
parties 
concerned, 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
bring 
about 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Peninsula. 
94. 
Mr. 
PARK 
Hae-Yoon 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
welcomed 
the 
implementation 
by 
the 
Agency, 
in 
a 
timely, 
impartial 
and 
professional 
manner, 
of 
its 
ad 
hoc 
arrangement 
with 
the 
DPRK 
for 
monitoring 
and 
verification, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
verification 
of 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
facility. 
The 
action 
taken 
constituted 
the 
first 
steps 
towards 
implementation 
of 
the 
agreement 
of 
13 
February 
2007. 
His 
country 
trusted 
that 
the 
next 
phase, 
including 
the 
complete 
declaration 
of 
all 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
the 
disablement 
of 
all 
existing 
nuclear 
facilities, 
would 
proceed 
in 
an 
expeditious 
manner. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
DPRKÂs 
recent 
invitation 
to 
a 
team 
of 
nuclear 
experts 
to 
survey 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
discuss 
the 
disablement 
process. 
95. 
The 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
reflected 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
addressing 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
It 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
commitment 
of 
all 
six 
parties 
to 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
2005 
Joint 
Statement. 
It 
further 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
DPRK 
for 
effective 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea, 
for 
its 
part, 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
other 
participants 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
resolve 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
and 
achieve 
enduring 
peace 
in 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
96. 
Ms. 
LACANLALE 
(Philippines), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
ASEAN 
countries 
Indonesia, 
Malaysia, 
the 
Philippines, 
Singapore, 
Thailand 
and 
Vietnam, 
said 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
announced 
at 
the 
recent 
14th 
ASEAN 
Regional 
Forum 
that 
it 
would 
earnestly 
implement 
its 
commitment 
to 
make 
a 
full 
declaration 
of 
all 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
to 
disable 
all 
nuclear 
facilities. 
The 
ASEAN 
Foreign 
Ministers 
had 
welcomed 
that 
announcement 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
report 
verifying 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility. 
They 
had 
reiterated 
their 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
had 
welcomed 
the 
July 
2007 
agreement 
that 
the 
parties 
would 
fulfil 
their 
commitments 
in 
the 
Joint 
Statement 
of 
September 
2005 
and 
the 
agreement 
of 
February 
2007 
in 
line 
with 
the 
principle 
of 
action 
for 
action. 
The 
Ministers 
had 
also 
stressed 
that 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
essential 
for 
maintaining 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Asia 
and 
the 
Pacific 
region 
and 
had 
expressed 
support 
for 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue 
through 
dialogue 
and 
negotiation.

Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
(GC(51)/14, 
L.1 
and 
Add.1) 


97. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
item 
21 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(50)/RES/16 
adopted 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Pursuant 
to 
paragraph 
9 
of 
that 
resolution, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
submitted 
the 
report 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/14. 
The 

GC(51)/OR.8

matter 
had 
been 
considered 
by 
the 
Board 
the 
preceding 
week 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
that 
report. 
In 
addition, 
Egypt 
had 
submitted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/L.1 
and 
Add.1. 


98. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
its 
purpose 
was 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities 
under 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
NPT. 
The 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
had 
assigned 
high 
priority 
to 
the 
accession 
of 
all 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
placement 
of 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
region 
under 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
When 
the 
Treaty 
had 
been 
extended 
indefinitely 
in 
1995, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
on 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
which 
it 
had 
expressed 
concern 
at 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
region, 
which 
undermined 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
as 
a 
whole. 
99. 
Egypt 
had 
sponsored 
a 
similar 
draft 
resolution 
on 
many 
previous 
occasions 
and 
no 
significant 
amendment 
had 
been 
made 
to 
it 
for 
14 
years. 
At 
the 
preceding 
session, 
however, 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
been 
updated 
by 
amendments 
of 
form 
rather 
than 
of 
substance 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
existing 
consensus. 
Yet 
Israel 
had 
requested 
a 
vote 
and 
the 
consensus 
had 
been 
broken. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
or 
implemented 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
since 
it 
was 
determined 
to 
prevent 
international 
monitoring 
of 
its 
nuclear 
facilities. 
100. 
Egypt 
had 
updated 
the 
draft 
resolution 
before 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
the 
current 
session 
by 
adding 
two 
paragraphs. 
Paragraph 
4 
called 
on 
the 
States 
of 
the 
region 
not 
to 
develop, 
produce, 
test 
or 
otherwise 
acquire 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
paragraph 
6 
urged 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
assist 
in 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
They 
were 
both 
taken 
from 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
60/52 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
in 
2006. 
101. 
Egypt 
had 
engaged 
in 
consultations 
with 
Member 
States 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
during 
the 
preceding 
six 
weeks, 
and 
the 
Egyptian 
delegation 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
undertaken 
intensive 
consultations 
with 
other 
delegations 
during 
the 
preceding 
two 
weeks 
and 
with 
the 
Israeli 
delegation 
during 
the 
preceding 
week. 
Unfortunately, 
those 
consultations 
had 
not 
succeeded 
in 
securing 
a 
consensus 
because 
some 
States 
insisted 
on 
linking 
agenda 
item 
21 
to 
item 
22 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat, 
which 
was 
unacceptable. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
the 
draft 
resolution 
if 
it 
was 
put 
to 
the 
vote 
in 
order 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and 
their 
willingness 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
obligations 
they 
had 
assumed 
in 
other 
international 
forums 
with 
respect 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
To 
avert 
the 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
the 
international 
community 
must 
fulfil 
its 
responsibility 
to 
address 
all 
non-proliferation 
issues 
in 
the 
region 
in 
the 
light 
of 
existing 
international 
resolutions 
and 
without 
applying 
double 
standards. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
the 
General 
Conference 
voted 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
would 
send 
a 
message 
from 
the 
voting 
States 
to 
the 
States 
of 
the 
region 
regarding 
the 
seriousness 
of 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
main 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
when 
it 
came 
to 
implementing 
the 
principles 
they 
claimed 
to 
uphold. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
message 
would 
be 
a 
positive 
one, 
convincing 
States 
that 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
implemented 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
that 
they 
had 
made 
the 
right 
choice, 
and 
making 
it 
clear 
that 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
in 
particular, 
met 
their 
obligations 
and 
took 
a 
strong 
line 
against 
States 
that 
flouted 
international 
disarmament 
norms 
and 
refused 
to 
assume 
any 
non-proliferation 
or 
safeguards 
commitments. 
102. 
Mr. 
WIBOWO 
(Indonesia) 
said 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
a 
critical 
issue 
which 
needed 
to 
be 
addressed, 
as 
it 
was 
related 
to 
proliferation 
concerns. 
Indonesia 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
at 
the 
impossibility 
of 
establishing 
such 
a 
zone 
owing 
to 
the 
continuously 
defiant 
attitude 
and 
policy 
of 
a 
single 
country 
which 
refused 
to 
place 
its 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
or 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
It 
was 
even 
more 
regrettable 
that 
that 
countryÂs 

GC(51)/OR.8

belligerent 
policy 
found 
support 
among 
the 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
persistent 
application 
of 
double 
standards 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
unacceptable. 


103. 
The 
NPT 
Review 
and 
Extension 
Conference 
held 
in 
1995 
had 
expressed 
concern 
at 
the 
dangerous 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
resulting 
from 
the 
presence 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
region 
that 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
safeguards. 
The 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2000 
had 
requested 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
Indonesia 
strongly 
believed 
that 
IsraelÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
Treaty 
and 
the 
placement 
of 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
were 
crucial 
prerequisites 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
mutual 
confidence 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
104. 
He 
urged 
Israel 
to 
accept 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
safeguards 
to 
all 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
to 
respond 
positively 
to 
the 
demands 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
Indonesia 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
the 
full 
in 
implementing 
the 
tasks 
entrusted 
to 
him 
by 
all 
previous 
General 
Conference 
resolutions. 
105. 
Mr. 
ABDULRAHMAN 
DOMRAN 
(Yemen) 
said 
that 
the 
idea 
of 
putting 
a 
resolution 
on 
international 
safeguards 
to 
the 
vote 
because 
of 
a 
lack 
of 
consensus 
was 
inconceivable, 
since 
the 
implication 
was 
that 
some 
Member 
States 
were 
opposed 
to 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Paragraphs 
4 
and 
6 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
were 
based 
on 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
60/52 
and 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
in 
particular 
Article 
III.A.5. 
He 
appealed 
to 
Member 
States 
not 
to 
vote 
against 
it. 
106. 
Mr. 
KODAH 
(Jordan) 
said 
that 
his 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
region. 
Israel 
should 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
comply 
with 
its 
obligations, 
conclude 
and 
implement 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
submit 
all 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
to 
international 
monitoring 
and 
verification. 
107. 
Mr. 
DANIELI 
(Israel) 
requested 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
under 
Rule 
72 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
108. 
Mr. 
DUARTE 
(Portugal), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
requested 
a 
suspension 
of 
the 
meeting 
for 
consultations. 
109. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
if 
he 
heard 
no 
objection, 
he 
would 
suspend 
the 
meeting 
for 
15 
minutes. 
110. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
The 
meeting 
was 
suspended 
at 
5.15 
p.m. 
and 
resumed 
at 
5.30 
p.m. 


111. 
At 
the 
request 
of 
Mr. 
DANIELI 
(Israel), 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
was 
taken. 
112. 
The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia, 
having 
been 
drawn 
by 
lot 
by 
the 
President, 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
vote 
first. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
representative 
of 
The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia, 
the 
voting 
started 
with 
Tunisia. 
113. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
was 
as 
follows: 
In 
favour: 
Afghanistan, 
Algeria, 
Argentina, 
Armenia, 
Azerbaijan, 
Bangladesh, 
Belarus,

114. 
There 
were 
53 
votes 
in 
favour 
and 
2 
against, 
with 
47 
abstentions. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
was 
adopted. 
115. 
Mr. 
SCHULTE 
(United 
States 
of 
America), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
his 
vote, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
sought 
a 
consensus 
outcome 
on 
the 
resolution 
and 
was 
disappointed 
that 
one 
had 
not 
been 
reached. 
The 
United 
States 
believed 
that 
the 
resolution, 
which 
had 
been 
adopted 
without 
consensus 
the 
preceding 
year, 
could 
have 
commanded 
consensus 
at 
the 
current 
session 
with 
a 
little 
more 
effort. 
The 
United 
States 
hoped 
that 
a 
harmonious 
approach 
to 
the 
issue 
could 
be 
found 
in 
the 
future 
which 
would 
allow 
the 
important 
work 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
advance. 
His 
countryÂs 
vote 
did 
not 
indicate 
any 
change 
in 
its 
substantive 
position 
on 
the 
issue. 
116. 
Mr. 
BAIEDINEJAD 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
it 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
resolution 
could 
not 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
It 
was 
based 
on 
elements 
that 
had 
all 
been 
approved 
in 
different 
forms 
and 
on 
different 
occasions 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
It 
was 
astonishing 
that 
such 
a 
non-
contentious 
issue 
could 
not 
be 
supported 
by 
all 
Member 
States. 
That 
called 
into 
question 
the 
sincerity 
of 
the 
view 
expressed 
by 
some 
members 
that 
full-scope 
safeguards 
needed 
to 
be 
complemented 
by 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
Their 
position 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
purely 
rhetorical 
one, 
aimed 
at 
extending 
discrimination 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
117. 
A 
key 
element 
of 
the 
resolution 
was 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Unfortunately, 
despite 
major 
international 
efforts 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
numerous 
resolutions 
on 
the 
issue, 
no 
tangible 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
that 
endeavour. 
Operative 
paragraphs 
4 
and 
6 
of 
the 
resolution 
were 
essential 
in 
that 
regard. 
Iran 
hoped 
that 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
resolution 
would 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
118. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
said 
that 
he 
had 
voted 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
because 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
strong 
desire 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
to 
have 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
region 
placed 
under 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
Those 
aims 
could 
only 
be 
achieved 
if 
Israel 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
placed 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
safeguards. 
He 
had 
voted 
in 
favour 
although 
the 
bilateral 
talks 
between 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
and 
Israel 
had 
been 
suspended 
since 
1996 
and 
Israel 
showed 
no 
willingness 
to 
return 
to 
the 
negotiating 
table. 
Moreover, 
the 
Multilateral 
Working 
Group 
on 
Arms 
Control 
and 
Regional 
Security 
had 
not 
met 
for 
more 
than 
15 
years. 
119. 
The 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
was 
greatly 
troubled 
at 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
make 
any 
progress 
in 
the 
consultations 
aimed 
at 
facilitating 
the 
early 
application 
of 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
to 
the 
only 
State 
in 
the 
region 
that 
had 
failed 
to 
accept 
them, 
thereby 
impeding 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
disappointed 
at 
the 

GC(51)/OR.8

attitude 
of 
activist 
States 
that 
might 
have 
been 
expected 
to 
support 
draft 
resolutions 
aimed 
at 
maintaining 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
ensuring 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 


120. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards, 
which 
were 
one 
of 
the 
pillars 
of 
the 
multilateral 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
a 
legal 
obligation 
under 
the 
NPT. 
She 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Her 
country 
was 
also 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
verifiable 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
121. 
It 
was 
disappointing 
that 
a 
consensus 
had 
not 
been 
reached 
on 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
resolution. 
In 
past 
years, 
the 
resolution 
had 
enjoyed 
broad 
support 
and 
it 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
changes 
introduced 
had 
not 
been 
the 
result 
of 
a 
consensus 
approach. 
They 
included 
new 
language 
which 
significantly 
altered 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
resolution 
and 
unduly 
politicized 
a 
forum 
that 
had 
historically 
taken 
a 
more 
technical 
perspective 
on 
the 
issue. 
Canada 
was 
also 
disappointed 
that 
the 
changes 
did 
not 
address 
the 
vital 
issue 
of 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
obligations. 
122. 
Mr. 
SHANNON 
(Australia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
placing 
of 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
that 
region 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
establishment 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
an 
effectively 
verifiable 
zone 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery, 
and 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
123. 
Australia 
had 
abstained 
in 
the 
vote 
because 
the 
resolution 
did 
not 
form 
part 
of 
the 
consensus 
package 
approach 
for 
Middle 
East 
nuclear 
issues 
adopted 
for 
many 
years 
by 
the 
General 
Conference. 
That 
approach 
provided 
the 
best 
means 
of 
pursuing 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
breakdown 
of 
the 
consensus 
approach 
could 
only 
distract 
the 
Agency 
from 
the 
key 
issues 
it 
should 
be 
addressing. 
124. 
Mr. 
DE 
CEGLIE 
(Italy) 
said 
that 
it 
was 
with 
regret 
that 
his 
country 
had 
chosen 
to 
abstain 
in 
the 
vote. 
Italy 
was 
strongly 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
verifiable 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
two 
new 
paragraphs 
had 
been 
added 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution 
too 
late 
to 
allow 
for 
sufficient 
negotiation. 
125. 
Mr. 
FRANK 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
for 
14 
years, 
until 
the 
preceding 
year, 
his 
country 
had 
supported 
a 
consensus 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
based 
on 
the 
conviction 
that 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
would 
eventually 
serve 
as 
an 
important 
complement 
to 
the 
overall 
peace 
and 
security 
of 
the 
region, 
strengthened 
by 
arms 
control. 
It 
had 
done 
so 
in 
spite 
of 
its 
fundamental 
reservations 
about 
the 
language 
and 
relevance 
of 
those 
resolutions, 
and 
had 
formally 
distanced 
itself 
from 
the 
modalities. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted, 
unnegotiated 
paragraphs 
had 
once 
again 
been 
introduced. 
Despite 
efforts 
to 
reach 
an 
agreement, 
it 
had 
become 
clear 
that 
the 
sponsors 
were 
not 
prepared 
to 
negotiate 
any 
part 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
The 
inevitable 
conclusion 
had 
been 
that 
there 
was 
no 
interest 
in 
consensus. 
Israel 
was 
of 
the 
view 
that, 
if 
consensus 
was 
not 
important 
to 
the 
sponsors, 
the 
resolution 
had 
no 
intrinsic 
value. 
Regrettably, 
it 
had 
therefore 
had 
to 
vote 
against 
it. 
126. 
The 
fundamental 
goal 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
as 
in 
other 
regions, 
was 
to 
achieve 
regional 
peace, 
security 
and 
stability, 
not 
arms 
controls 
per 
se. 
The 
basic 
premises 
underlying 
lasting 
regional 
security 
and 
the 
arms 
control 
process 
were 
the 
enhancement 
of 
security 
margins 
and 
adequate 
consideration 
of 
threat 
perceptions 
of 
all 
participating 
States. 
Any 
steps 
diminishing 
security 
margins 
should 
be 
mutually 
implemented. 
In 
addition, 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
in 
such 
a 
process 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
any 
meaningful 
progress, 
as 
non-participants 
continued 
to 
pose 
an 
undiminished 
threat, 
making 
genuine 
regional 
cooperation 
impossible.

127. 
An 
effective 
approach 
in 
the 
face 
of 
current 
regional 
political 
realities 
was 
a 
step-by-step 
approach. 
The 
process 
should 
begin 
with 
confidence-and 
security-building 
measures 
which 
should 
be 
carefully 
selected 
so 
as 
not 
to 
detract 
from 
the 
security 
margins 
of 
any 
State. 
Such 
a 
gradual 
approach 
to 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
was 
based 
on 
the 
vast 
experience 
gained 
in 
similar 
processes 
in 
other 
regions. 
The 
way 
to 
build 
security 
was 
to 
aim 
high 
but 
start 
modestly 
and 
proceed 
carefully, 
since 
confidence 
building 
was 
a 
long 
and 
enduring 
process. 
128. 
Israel 
questioned 
the 
statements 
made 
by 
some 
of 
its 
neighbours, 
some 
of 
which 
did 
not 
even 
recognize 
IsraelÂs 
right 
to 
exist. 
Such 
statements 
were 
not 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
responsibility 
and 
mission 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
also 
undermined 
confidence 
building, 
making 
the 
road 
ahead 
even 
more 
torturous. 
129. 
To 
sum 
up, 
IsraelÂs 
policy 
and 
vision 
had 
not 
changed, 
but 
the 
resolution 
had 
lost 
its 
value 
and 
relevance. 
Israel 
held 
to 
the 
vision 
of 
transforming 
the 
Middle 
East 
into 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
ballistic 
missiles, 
but 
it 
could 
be 
under 
no 
illusions 
about 
the 
current 
regional 
context. 
It 
never 
gave 
up 
hope 
for 
a 
better 
future 
of 
reconciliation, 
security 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2006 
(resumed) 
(GC(51)/5) 
130. 
Ms. 
INTERIANO 
(El 
Salvador) 
said 
that 
she 
was 
pleased 
to 
be 
able 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
General 
Conference 
following 
the 
recent 
establishment 
of 
the 
Permanent 
Mission 
of 
El 
Salvador 
in 
Vienna, 
which 
attested 
to 
her 
GovernmentÂs 
wish 
to 
participate 
more 
actively 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
international 
organizations 
based 
in 
Vienna, 
including 
the 
Agency. 
131. 
El 
Salvador 
was 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
all 
initiatives 
and 
instruments 
promoting 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
and 
was 
convinced 
that 
a 
multilateral 
approach 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
encourage 
a 
political 
dialogue 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peaceful 
co-existence 
and 
security. 
132. 
Her 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities, 
in 
particular 
those 
related 
to 
safeguards, 
verification 
of 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
and 
promotion 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-
free 
zones. 
The 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
to 
which 
her 
country 
had 
been 
party 
since 
its 
entry 
into 
force 
in 
1969, 
had 
provided 
a 
model 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
other 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
and 
had 
made 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
disarmament 
efforts, 
stating 
in 
its 
preamble 
that 
militarily 
denuclearized 
zones 
were 
not 
an 
end 
in 
themselves, 
but 
rather 
a 
means 
for 
achieving 
general 
and 
complete 
disarmament 
at 
a 
later 
stage. 
133. 
She 
called 
on 
States 
to 
redouble 
their 
efforts 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
other 
nuclear-weapon-
free 
zones, 
in 
order 
to 
build 
a 
collective 
security 
structure 
conducive 
to 
mutual, 
regional 
and 
international 
confidence. 
Such 
a 
structure 
was 
essential 
for 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
the 
reduction 
of 
nuclear 
arsenals 
and 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
134. 
Efforts 
should 
also 
continue 
to 
be 
made 
to 
strengthen 
the 
verification 
and 
control 
regime 
for 
nuclear 
weapons 
to 
prevent 
them 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
non-State 
actors 
with 
unforeseeable 
consequences 
for 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
It 
was 
also 
imperative 
that 
negotiations 
continue 
with 
a 
view 
to 
achieving 
significant 
progress 
in 
disarmament 
and 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime.

135. 
The 
moratorium 
on 
nuclear 
testing 
should 
be 
maintained 
pending 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
Collective 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
that 
Treaty 
entered 
into 
force 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
and 
she 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
work 
towards 
general 
and 
complete 
disarmament 
in 
order 
to 
promote 
international 
confidence. 
136. 
She 
welcomed 
the 
fact 
that, 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2006, 
additional 
protocols 
were 
in 
force 
in 
78 
States. 
137. 
Her 
country 
also 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
relating 
to 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
International 
Steering 
Committee 
on 
Denials 
of 
Shipment 
of 
radioactive 
material. 
138. 
The 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
led 
to 
the 
development 
of 
medical 
techniques 
and 
treatments 
that 
had 
saved 
millions 
of 
lives 
around 
the 
world. 
El 
Salvador 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
which 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
the 
sustainable 
development 
of 
all 
countries, 
particularly 
the 
most 
vulnerable; 
and 
to 
the 
ARCAL 
programme. 
Her 
countryÂs 
priorities 
were 
shared 
by 
other 
States 
in 
the 
region 
and 
included 
the 
fight 
against 
cancer, 
preservation 
of 
the 
environment, 
renewable 
energy 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
The 
regional 
and 
national 
projects 
implemented 
by 
the 
Agency 
had 
served 
to 
complement 
her 
GovernmentÂs 
efforts 
to 
meet 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
139. 
A 
national 
liaison 
agency 
had 
been 
established 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
activities 
undertaken 
with 
the 
Agency 
were 
consistent 
with 
national 
development 
priorities. 
El 
Salvador 
was 
collaborating 
with 
the 
Agency 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
South-South 
cooperation 
through 
the 
designation 
of 
national 
experts 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
geothermics 
and 
nuclear 
instrumentation. 
In 
the 
cancer 
field, 
it 
had 
taken 
joint 
action 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
modernize 
the 
public 
health 
system 
with 
the 
involvement 
of 
central 
government, 
private 
enterprise 
and 
local 
non-profit 
organizations. 
140. 
The 
Ministers 
of 
Health 
of 
Central 
America 
and 
the 
Dominican 
Republic 
had 
recently 
met 
in 
El 
Salvador 
and 
discussed 
such 
issues 
as 
the 
feasibility 
of 
establishing 
a 
subregional 
policy 
for 
combating 
of 
cancer 
and 
quality 
control 
of 
medicines 
for 
public 
hospitals. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
in 
that 
regard 
would 
be 
appreciated. 
141. 
Lastly, 
she 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
continued 
progress 
would 
be 
made 
with 
respect 
to 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
humankind. 
Mr. 
Schulte 
(United 
States 
of 
America) 
took 
the 
Chair. 


142. 
Mr. 
UZCÃTEGUI 
DUQUE 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela) 
recalled 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
pacifist 
tradition 
was 
enshrined 
in 
its 
constitution, 
which 
stipulated 
that 
the 
State 
should 
prevent 
the 
manufacture 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
His 
countryÂs 
Magna 
Carta 
also 
called 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
peaceful 
cooperation 
among 
nations, 
the 
democratization 
of 
international 
society 
and 
ecological 
balance. 
143. 
Aware 
that 
it 
was 
the 
right 
and 
duty 
of 
every 
generation 
to 
protect 
its 
natural 
resources 
for 
its 
own 
benefit 
and 
the 
benefit 
of 
future 
generations, 
the 
Venezuelan 
authorities 
had 
drafted, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
regulations 
for 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
which 
it 
was 
hoped 
would 
be 
approved 
shortly. 
The 
country 
was 
also 
cooperating 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
national 
radiological 
emergency 
response 
plan 
and 
a 
study 
of 
liquid 
waste 
from 
the 
aluminium 
industry. 
144. 
Similarly, 
it 
had 
been 
receiving 
Agency 
assistance 
for 
projects 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
health, 
environment, 
industry, 
agriculture 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
including 
a 
human 
resource 
training 
programme 
in 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine.

145. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
technical 
training 
in 
isotope 
hydrology 
at 
a 
regional 
level, 
Venezuela 
had 
made 
available 
to 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
a 
human 
resource 
training 
course 
at 
the 
Inter-
American 
Centre 
for 
Environmental 
and 
Land 
Development 
and 
Research, 
which 
received 
30 
to 
40 
Agency 
fellows 
a 
year. 
146. 
As 
the 
international 
community 
was 
aware, 
Venezuela 
was 
particularly 
attached 
to 
the 
integration 
of 
States 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean, 
strengthening 
of 
South-South 
relations 
and 
promotion 
of 
solidarity 
among 
all 
peoples. 
Both 
the 
Agency 
and 
ARCAL 
were 
of 
assistance 
in 
working 
towards 
those 
goals. 
147. 
In 
May 
2007, 
Venezuela 
had 
hosted 
the 
eighth 
meeting 
of 
the 
ARCAL 
Technical 
Coordination 
Board, 
attended 
by 
the 
20 
member 
countries 
of 
the 
Agreement, 
plus 
Spain 
as 
an 
associated 
State 
and 
France 
as 
an 
observer. 
The 
participants 
had 
approved 
the 
Regional 
Strategic 
Profile, 
a 
guide 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
2007Â2013. 
148. 
At 
the 
eighth 
meeting 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
ARCAL 
Representatives, 
held 
on 
18 
September 
2007, 
Venezuela 
had 
been 
elected 
to 
the 
chair 
that 
body. 
Also, 
the 
first 
ARCAL 
Prize 
had 
been 
awarded 
to 
the 
countries 
that 
had 
originated 
the 
Agreement, 
namely 
Bolivia, 
Colombia, 
Ecuador, 
Peru 
and 
Venezuela, 
the 
aim 
being 
to 
stimulate 
interest 
in 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
an 
effective 
means 
of 
contributing 
to 
development. 
149. 
Nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
ought 
to 
be 
used 
as 
tools 
to 
achieve 
social 
and 
economic 
progress 
and 
be 
seen 
as 
areas 
for 
strengthening 
cooperation, 
solidarity 
and 
peaceful 
coexistence, 
rather 
than 
political 
discrimination. 
150. 
Venezuela 
had 
repeatedly 
defended 
the 
principles 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
as 
it 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
need 
to 
eliminate 
all 
nuclear 
weapons, 
that 
being 
the 
most 
effective 
way 
of 
addressing 
the 
many 
challenges 
posed 
by 
their 
very 
existence. 
The 
practical 
actions 
it 
had 
taken 
in 
that 
regard 
included 
its 
ratification 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
CTBT. 
Moreover, 
two 
seismological 
stations 
had 
been 
installed 
in 
Venezuela 
as 
part 
of 
the 
international 
monitoring 
system 
established 
under 
the 
CTBT. 
151. 
The 
facts 
showed 
that 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
needed 
to 
be 
stepped 
up 
in 
order 
to 
make 
faster 
progress 
towards 
the 
objective 
of 
a 
world 
free 
of 
such 
weapons. 
Though 
it 
was 
obvious 
that 
the 
existence, 
and 
the 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
proliferation 
of 
such 
weapons 
not 
only 
did 
not 
increase 
security 
but 
actually 
reduced 
the 
chances 
of 
achieving 
lasting 
and 
sustainable 
peace, 
military 
doctrines 
were 
being 
applied 
which 
still 
contemplated 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
added 
to 
the 
possible 
reasons 
for 
their 
use 
or 
justified 
the 
need 
to 
make 
them 
even 
more 
sophisticated. 
152. 
Firmly 
convinced 
that 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
should 
be 
multilateral, 
simultaneous 
and 
non-discriminatory, 
the 
Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela 
rejected 
the 
suggestion 
that 
certain 
countriesÂ 
nuclear 
weapons 
posed 
no 
threat 
while 
those 
apparently 
held 
by 
other 
States 
placed 
the 
world 
in 
mortal 
danger. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
noted 
that 
any 
attack, 
or 
threat 
of 
attack, 
on 
nuclear 
facilities 
Â 
even 
when 
they 
were 
under 
construction 
Â 
jeopardized 
peace 
and 
confidence, 
and 
the 
survival 
of 
the 
human 
race 
and 
the 
environment. 
International 
peace 
and 
security 
should 
not 
depend 
on 
privileges 
and 
discrimination, 
since 
any 
peace 
founded 
on 
such 
a 
basis 
was 
weak. 
153. 
The 
international 
situation 
was 
both 
complex 
and 
uncertain 
in 
view 
of 
the 
threats 
and 
challenges 
to 
peace, 
security 
and 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
A 
lack 
of 
trust 
seemed 
to 
prevail 
which 
affected 
the 
ability 
of 
international 
organizations 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus 
or 
agreement 
on 
the 
important 
issues 
of 
global 
disarmament 
and 
security. 
Efforts 
therefore 
needed 
to 
be 
stepped 
up 
to 
make 
progress 
towards 
the 
adoption 
of 
agreements 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
negative 
security 
assurances. 
However, 
to 
achieve 
those 
goals, 
which 
were 
aspired 
to 
by 
all 
peace-loving 
countries, 
it 
had 
to 
be

accepted 
that 
national 
security 
could 
not 
exist 
in 
isolation, 
or 
be 
invoked 
in 
order 
to 
weaken 
or 
undermine 
the 
security 
of 
other 
States. 


154. 
The 
construction 
of 
an 
international 
system 
focused 
on 
peace, 
justice 
and 
development 
had 
to 
be 
based 
on 
unlimited 
respect 
for 
the 
standards 
and 
principles 
of 
international 
law. 
Discriminatory 
practices 
which 
undermined 
the 
principle 
of 
equality 
among 
States, 
whereby 
some 
countries 
were 
required 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
international 
agreements 
while 
others 
were 
exempted, 
were 
out 
of 
touch 
with 
current 
realities. 
The 
efforts 
of 
some 
States 
to 
combat 
unproven 
attacks 
by 
other 
States 
should 
not 
be 
used 
as 
a 
pretext 
to 
violate 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
engage 
in 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination. 
155. 
The 
Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela 
noted 
with 
concern 
that 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
usurped 
the 
AgencyÂs 
powers 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
That 
interference 
undermined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
authority 
and 
credibility, 
and 
the 
independence 
that 
all 
agencies 
and 
bodies 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
system 
must 
enjoy. 
The 
Agency 
remained 
the 
appropriate 
technical 
forum 
for 
reaching 
a 
peaceful, 
negotiated 
solution 
with 
the 
Iranian 
authorities. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
team 
for 
insisting 
on 
a 
diplomatic 
solution 
and 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
recently 
reached 
with 
Iran. 
Venezuela 
also 
welcomed 
the 
peaceful 
solution 
arrived 
at 
in 
the 
case 
of 
the 
nuclear 
programme 
of 
the 
DPRK. 
156. 
His 
country 
had 
consistently 
backed 
initiatives 
to 
establish 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region. 
For 
that 
to 
succeed, 
it 
was 
vital 
that 
Israel, 
like 
the 
majority 
of 
States, 
including 
all 
Arab 
States, 
adhere 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
allow 
the 
Agency 
to 
apply 
safeguards 
to 
its 
nuclear 
facilities. 
That 
had 
become 
even 
more 
pressing 
since 
the 
Israeli 
Government 
had 
publicly 
acknowledged 
that 
it 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons. 
157. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
wished 
the 
Agency 
success 
over 
the 
next 
50 
years 
of 
its 
existence. 
158. 
Mr. 
LEE 
(Singapore), 
said 
that, 
as 
the 
Agency 
celebrated 
its 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
its 
role 
was 
undiminished 
because 
access 
to 
reliable 
and 
adequate 
sources 
of 
energy 
was 
essential 
for 
development. 
As 
concerns 
about 
global 
warming 
caused 
by 
greenhouse 
gases 
grew, 
the 
increased 
recognition 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
carbon-free 
compared 
to 
fossil 
fuels 
would 
result 
in 
an 
increase 
in 
its 
use. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
2006, 
435 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
had 
been 
in 
operation 
worldwide, 
generating 
16% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
electricity. 
Although, 
to 
date, 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
concentrated 
in 
industrialized 
countries, 
17 
of 
the 
29 
reactors 
currently 
under 
construction 
were 
in 
developing 
countries. 
The 
Agency 
would 
need 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
changing 
trends 
in 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
expanding 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
and 
emerging 
proliferation 
concerns. 
159. 
Singapore 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
Not 
only 
was 
it 
crucial 
to 
set 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security; 
more 
importantly, 
effective 
implementation 
was 
needed. 
The 
various 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
conventions, 
codes 
of 
conduct, 
safety 
guides 
and 
standards 
which 
existed 
should 
serve 
as 
building 
blocks 
for 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
provide 
the 
relevant 
benchmarks 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
through 
the 
various 
instruments 
adopted, 
peer 
reviews, 
assistance 
and 
review 
missions. 
Its 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
provided 
the 
framework 
and 
impetus 
for 
States 
to 
cooperate 
in 
promoting 
a 
strong 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
Singapore 
also 
supported 
greater 
regional 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
to 
complement 
and 
strengthen 
international 
and 
national 
efforts. 
160. 
In 
addressing 
the 
issue 
of 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
the 
importance 
of 
transboundary 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
the 
response 
capabilities 
of 
States 
could 
not 
be 
overemphasized. 
Singapore 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
such 
initiatives 
as 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre 
and 
the 
bilateral 
networks 
operating 
alongside 
regional 
networks 
through 
which 
Member 
States 
could 
share 
their 
emergency 
response 
plans. 
The 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
had 
included

emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
in 
its 
discussions 
for 
2006 
and 
the 
setting 
up 
of 
a 
caucus 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
safety 
within 
ASEAN 
had 
been 
proposed. 


161. 
The 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
caucus 
would 
be 
timely 
as 
more 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
such 
as 
Indonesia, 
Thailand, 
Vietnam, 
the 
Philippines, 
Myanmar 
and 
Malaysia, 
had 
indicated 
an 
interest 
in 
or 
were 
pursuing 
nuclear 
energy 
programmes 
to 
meet 
growing 
energy 
needs. 
The 
search 
was 
also 
under 
way 
for 
alternative, 
carbon-free 
and 
sustainable 
energy 
sources. 
Given 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
issue, 
the 
ASEAN 
Energy 
Ministers, 
at 
their 
annual 
meeting 
held 
in 
August 
2007 
in 
Singapore, 
had 
endorsed 
in 
principle 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear 
energy 
safety 
subsector 
network 
to 
discuss 
nuclear 
safety 
issues, 
one 
of 
whose 
key 
tasks 
would 
be 
to 
put 
in 
place 
a 
credible 
and 
robust 
regional 
nuclear 
safety 
regime, 
which 
should 
help 
promote 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
viable 
energy 
source 
by 
enhancing 
public 
confidence. 
ASEAN 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
developing 
a 
regional 
framework 
for 
collaboration 
and 
cooperation 
and 
adoption 
of 
best 
practices. 
162. 
Advances 
in 
the 
use 
of 
radiation 
techniques 
in 
medicine 
necessitated 
greater 
attention 
to 
the 
safety 
of 
such 
applications. 
Singapore 
continued 
to 
contribute 
to 
radiation 
protection 
by 
hosting 
scientific 
visits 
and 
providing 
fellowship 
placements 
and 
training 
courses 
on 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
163. 
In 
promoting 
nuclear 
safety, 
nuclear 
security 
should 
not 
be 
neglected. 
Threats 
to 
global 
security 
included 
terrorists 
with 
no 
qualms 
about 
resorting 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
devices 
and 
material, 
and 
even 
more 
vigilance 
was 
required 
to 
protect 
nuclear 
material 
and 
installations. 
His 
country 
remained 
committed 
to 
supporting 
efforts 
to 
combat 
terrorism 
in 
all 
its 
forms 
and 
at 
all 
levels, 
and 
it 
had 
hosted 
the 
pilot 
IAEA 
subregional 
workshop 
on 
illicit 
nuclear 
trafficking 
information 
management 
and 
coordination 
in 
July 
2007. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Safety 
Fundamentals 
series, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
updated 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009, 
and 
the 
increased 
use 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
to 
expand 
Agency 
activities 
in 
that 
area, 
together 
with 
the 
various 
measures 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
enhance 
StatesÂ 
ability 
to 
detect 
the 
sources 
of 
radiological 
threats 
and 
take 
the 
necessary 
countermeasures. 
164. 
Singapore 
remained 
committed 
to 
the 
full 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
by 
stepping 
up 
domestic 
controls 
and 
international 
cooperation 
against 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
continued 
to 
review 
its 
strategic 
goods 
control 
list, 
which 
would 
incorporate 
the 
full 
lists 
of 
controlled 
items 
under 
the 
four 
multilateral 
export 
control 
regimes 
as 
of 
January 
2008. 
It 
had 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
in 
December 
2006. 
165. 
The 
Agency 
safeguarded 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
However, 
that 
right 
had 
to 
be 
exercised 
in 
compliance 
with 
StatesÂ 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
with 
the 
utmost 
transparency. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
had 
to 
be 
able 
to 
respond 
to 
new 
challenges 
within 
its 
mandate 
in 
a 
credible 
and 
effective 
manner, 
and 
its 
verification 
regime 
should 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
providing 
the 
necessary 
safeguards 
assurances. 
As 
a 
means 
to 
ensure 
credible 
and 
effective 
safeguards, 
Singapore 
continued 
to 
advocate 
the 
universalization 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
He 
urged 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
undertake 
such 
commitments 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
Singapore 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
September 
2005 
and 
had 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
conduct 
an 
IAEA 
SSAC 
Advisory 
Service 
mission 
in 
December 
2006 
to 
help 
in 
making 
the 
necessary 
preparations 
for 
ratifying 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
concluding 
a 
small 
quantities 
protocol. 
Pursuant 
to 
that 
mission, 
legislative 
measures 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
facilitate 
that 
process. 
166. 
The 
Agency 
had 
dealt 
with 
several 
cases 
which 
gave 
rise 
to 
proliferation 
concerns 
in 
recent 
years. 
His 
country 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
ad 
hoc 
arrangement 
for 
monitoring 
and 
verification 
agreed 

GC(51)/OR.8 
20 
September 
2007,

23 


between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
DPRK. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
verify 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
shut 
down 
various 
installations 
at 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
the 
200 
MW(e) 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
at 
Taechon. 
Nevertheless, 
it 
remained 
deeply 
concerned 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
chosen 
to 
remain 
outside 
the 
NPT 
and 
urged 
it 
to 
return 
to 
the 
Treaty, 
accept 
full 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
dismantle 
any 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent 
and 
verifiable 
manner. 


167. 
The 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
was 
another 
issue 
of 
concern. 
He 
urged 
Iran 
to 
extend 
its 
full 
cooperation 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
resolve 
all 
outstanding 
issues 
by 
fully 
implementing 
the 
requirements 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
1737 
(2006) 
and 
1747 
(2007). 
IranÂs 
right 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
not 
inconsistent 
with 
its 
responsibility 
to 
restore 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
of 
August 
2007 
had 
indicated 
that, 
while 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
verify 
the 
non-diversion 
of 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
in 
Iran, 
Iran 
had 
not 
suspended 
its 
enrichment-related 
activities 
and 
had 
continued 
with 
the 
operation 
of 
its 
pilot 
fuel 
enrichment 
plant, 
the 
construction 
and 
operation 
of 
its 
fuel 
enrichment 
plant, 
the 
construction 
of 
the 
IR-40 
reactor 
and 
the 
operation 
of 
its 
heavy 
water 
production 
plant. 
Singapore 
remained 
hopeful 
that 
diplomatic 
efforts 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
peaceful 
and 
sustainable 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue. 
168. 
The 
proliferation 
risks 
deriving 
from 
the 
sensitive 
aspects 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
had 
sparked 
discussions 
on 
new 
approaches 
to 
assure 
supplies 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
all 
States 
with 
nuclear 
power 
programmes. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
find 
a 
balanced 
approach 
to 
curbing 
proliferation 
activities 
while 
upholding 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
power 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
notion 
of 
assurance 
of 
supply 
and 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel, 
including 
international 
supply 
guarantees 
with 
Agency 
participation, 
was 
an 
important 
topic 
that 
warranted 
further 
consideration. 
A 
multinational 
approach 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
was 
the 
way 
forward. 
169. 
Singapore 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continued 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
harnessing 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
achieve 
socio-economic 
development. 
The 
Agency 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
facilitating 
international 
cooperation 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
successful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
would 
have 
a 
meaningful 
impact 
on 
socio-economic 
growth 
in 
developing 
countries, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
achieving 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
Nuclear 
technology 
had 
brought 
benefits 
to 
developing 
countries 
in 
the 
area 
of 
human 
health, 
industrial 
applications, 
animal 
production 
and 
health, 
food 
quality 
and 
safety, 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
Singapore 
remained 
fully 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
170. 
Expressing 
satisfaction 
at 
the 
expansion 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
recent 
years, 
he 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
establishing 
partnerships 
with 
international 
and 
regional 
development 
organizations. 
His 
country 
remained 
committed 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
Member 
States. 
Singapore 
was 
hosting 
several 
regional 
training 
events 
under 
the 
RCA. 
171. 
A 
comprehensive 
and 
effective 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
required 
adequate, 
steady 
and 
sustainable 
funding, 
and 
Singapore 
would 
continue 
to 
pay 
its 
contributions 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full. 
172. 
Mr. 
ABEYWICKREMA 
(Sri 
Lanka) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
developing 
Member 
State, 
his 
country 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate 
which 
embraced 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
under 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
technology, 
peace, 
and 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
balanced, 
impartial 
and 
non-politicized 
pursuit 
of 
those 
objectives 
was 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
173. 
Access 
to 
reliable 
and 
adequate 
sources 
of 
energy 
was 
essential 
for 
development. 
Given 
the 
rapidly 
increasing 
demand 
for 
energy 
worldwide, 
particularly 
in 
developing 
countries, 
nuclear 
power 
was 
an 
attractive 
option. 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
initiative 
taken 
earlier 
in 
the 
year 
by 
the 
Agency 

GC(51)/OR.8

and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
in 
organizing 
a 
regional 
seminar 
on 
considerations 
to 
launch 
a 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
Nuclear 
energy 
was 
gaining 
recognition 
as 
a 
source 
of 
energy 
free 
of 
greenhouse 
gases. 
Developing 
countries 
required 
the 
assistance 
of 
financial 
institutions 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power 
to 
help 
them 
meet 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
However, 
the 
advantages 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
over 
energy 
produced 
from 
fossil 
fuels 
needed 
to 
be 
balanced 
against 
possible 
disadvantages, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
safety 
and 
security. 


174. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
to 
enhance 
food 
security 
and 
human 
health 
and 
improve 
the 
sustainable 
and 
integrated 
management 
of 
water 
resources 
was 
of 
direct 
benefit 
to 
developing 
countries 
such 
as 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
contributed 
to 
the 
central 
objective 
of 
achieving 
national 
development 
goals. 
His 
country 
was 
following 
the 
progress 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
PACT 
programme 
which 
it 
hoped 
would 
be 
of 
tangible 
benefit 
to 
cancer 
patients, 
medical 
specialists 
and 
policy-makers 
working 
on 
cancer 
prevention 
and 
management. 
The 
Government 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
initiative 
taken 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
selecting 
his 
country 
as 
a 
model 
recipient 
country 
in 
the 
Asia 
and 
Pacific 
region 
under 
the 
PACT 
programme. 
It 
would 
be 
holding 
a 
meeting 
of 
stakeholders 
in 
the 
field 
in 
the 
first 
half 
of 
2008. 
Furthermore, 
in 
a 
country 
that 
needed 
to 
address 
the 
challenges 
of 
malnutrition, 
especially 
among 
children, 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund 
was 
of 
special 
relevance 
to 
Sri 
Lanka. 
175. 
The 
Agency 
verification 
programme 
was 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
multilateral 
efforts 
to 
curb 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
As 
a 
minimum 
verification 
requirement, 
Sri 
Lanka 
called 
for 
the 
universalization 
of 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements. 
176. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
security, 
in 
particular 
measures 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
that 
area 
was 
part 
of 
a 
wider 
spectrum 
of 
action. 
The 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
adopted 
under 
the 
chairmanship 
of 
Sri 
Lanka, 
would 
encourage 
cooperation 
among 
States, 
which 
was 
crucial 
to 
defeating 
terrorism. 
Sri 
Lanka 
was 
also 
a 
partner 
nation 
of 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
announced 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
Given 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
threat, 
nuclear 
security 
activities 
benefited 
all 
States, 
including 
those 
without 
large 
nuclear 
programmes. 
177. 
Over 
the 
years, 
the 
operational 
success 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
increasing 
relevance 
of 
its 
mandate 
had 
raised 
expectations 
regarding 
what 
it 
could 
and 
should 
deliver. 
The 
nuclear 
renaissance, 
including 
the 
increased 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
energy, 
growing 
international 
awareness 
and 
concern 
about 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
the 
need 
for 
nuclear-based 
solutions 
to 
support 
national 
development 
objectives 
and 
combat 
hunger, 
disease 
and 
poverty, 
had 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
ask 
more 
of 
the 
Agency. 
178. 
The 
availability 
of 
adequate 
funding 
to 
cope 
with 
the 
increasing 
expectations 
of 
Member 
States 
had 
been 
an 
important 
topic 
of 
discussion 
in 
the 
Agency 
during 
the 
course 
of 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Sri 
Lanka 
strongly 
supported 
the 
Agency 
in 
maintaining 
its 
competence 
and 
enhancing 
its 
capabilities 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
work. 
As 
a 
developing 
Member 
State 
which 
faced 
important 
development 
challenges 
in 
many 
areas, 
including 
health 
care, 
agricultural 
production, 
poverty 
and 
technical 
capabilities, 
Sri 
Lanka 
believed 
that 
a 
balance 
had 
to 
be 
maintained 
between 
the 
verification 
and 
promotional 
aspects 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
That 
meant 
ensuring 
equal 
priority 
for 
all 
Agency 
activities, 
and 
in 
the 
budgetary 
allocations 
to 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
its 
activities. 
His 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
proposed 
comprehensive 
study 
on 
the 
financial 
requirements 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Despite 
budgetary 
constraints, 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
paid 
its 
2006 
contributions 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
full, 
including 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF. 
179. 
Sufficient, 
adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
for 
the 
TCF 
were 
a 
matter 
of 
high 
priority. 
An 
increasing 
number 
of 
developing 
Member 
States 
were 
seeking 
support 
from 
the 
TCF, 
while 
a 
high 

GC(51)/OR.8

25 


volume 
of 
projects 
remained 
unfunded. 
Under 
the 
compromise 
embodied 
in 
the 
budget 
package 
proposal 
of 
2003, 
any 
increase 
in 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
of 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
matched 
by 
a 
corresponding 
increase 
in 
the 
TCF. 
The 
2008 
Regular 
Budget 
had 
increased 
by 
4.2%, 
2.8% 
to 
compensate 
for 
inflation 
plus 
1.4% 
for 
a 
programme 
increase 
over 
2007. 
The 
lack 
of 
an 
indicator 
to 
measure 
price 
adjustment 
in 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
was 
an 
obstacle 
to 
the 
satisfactory 
application 
of 
the 
concept 
of 
balance 
in 
financial 
allocations 
for 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 


180. 
His 
country 
had 
benefited 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
acquiring 
the 
capability 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
industry. 
Its 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
were 
designed 
to 
address 
such 
issues 
as 
improvement 
of 
radiotherapy 
services 
in 
cancer 
hospitals, 
diagnosis 
of 
infectious 
diseases 
using 
molecular 
diagnostic 
techniques, 
assessment 
of 
pesticide 
contamination 
of 
surface 
water 
and 
groundwater 
with 
a 
view 
to 
judicious 
application 
of 
agrochemicals, 
improvement 
of 
livestock 
productivity 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
livestock 
products, 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
sustainability 
of 
dams 
used 
for 
irrigation 
and 
hydroelectric 
power, 
and 
the 
development 
of 
radiation 
safety 
infrastructure, 
including 
radiological 
emergency 
preparedness, 
food 
preservation, 
radiation 
processing, 
environmental 
studies 
and 
refurbishment 
of 
nuclear 
instruments. 
181. 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
of 
Member 
States. 
It 
was 
enhancing 
its 
capability 
to 
respond 
to 
radiological 
emergencies. 
Its 
national 
disaster 
management 
plan 
gave 
priority 
to 
radiological 
emergency 
preparedness 
planning 
and 
preparedness 
for 
dam 
emergencies. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
had 
been 
encouraging 
and 
his 
Government 
intended 
to 
request 
enhanced 
support 
through 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
priority. 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
use 
of 
information 
technology 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
management. 
The 
experience 
gained 
should 
enable 
further 
improvements 
to 
be 
made 
in 
the 
use 
of 
information 
technology 
as 
an 
effective 
tool 
for 
communication 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
stakeholders. 
The 
Agency 
might 
consider 
developing 
infrastructure 
to 
deliver 
training 
material 
and 
conduct 
meetings 
with 
the 
help 
of 
information 
technology 
in 
a 
cost-effective 
manner. 
182. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
self-reliance 
and 
sustainability 
of 
national 
nuclear 
institutes 
had 
been 
helpful 
to 
Sri 
Lanka 
in 
exploring 
new 
avenues 
utilizing 
market-oriented 
technologies. 
Given 
the 
importance 
of 
food 
security, 
and 
against 
the 
backdrop 
of 
climate 
changes 
and 
their 
adverse 
effects, 
Sri 
Lanka 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
its 
capability 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
with 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
preservation 
and 
phytosanitary 
treatment 
of 
food 
and 
for 
responding 
to 
pandemics. 
183. 
His 
country 
also 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
and 
preservation. 
Increasing 
the 
availability 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
provided 
an 
ideal 
platform 
for 
launching 
projects 
in 
that 
area. 
Sri 
Lanka 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
and 
would 
like 
to 
extend 
its 
support 
through 
in-kind 
contributions 
for 
hosting 
of 
regional 
events. 
184. 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
become 
a 
party 
to 
the 
RCA 
in 
1976 
and 
had 
actively 
participated 
in 
its 
programmes, 
which 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
end-user-oriented 
national 
programmes 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
above 
all 
in 
the 
health 
care, 
agriculture 
and 
industrial 
sectors. 
The 
technical 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
crucial 
to 
the 
initiation 
of 
those 
programmes 
and 
his 
Government 
had 
provided 
support 
to 
make 
them 
sustainable 
and 
of 
long-term 
benefit 
to 
the 
Sri 
Lankan 
people. 
His 
country 
strongly 
endorsed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
approach 
in 
fostering 
regional 
cooperation 
agreements, 
which 
were 
effective 
mechanisms 
for 
addressing 
a 
range 
of 
transboundary 
issues, 
including 
safety 
and 
security.

185. 
His 
Government 
had 
allocated 
funds 
to 
establish 
the 
first 
government-owned 
multi-purpose 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility 
and 
the 
project 
has 
been 
given 
high 
priority 
in 
Sri 
LankaÂs 
development 
programme. 
The 
Agency 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
project 
by 
providing 
expert 
services 
during 
the 
planning 
stages 
and 
Sri 
Lanka 
hoped 
for 
further 
collaboration 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
manpower 
development 
and 
technology 
transfer. 
186. 
Mr. 
MOREJÃN-ALMEIDA 
(Ecuador) 
said 
that, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
its 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
tribute 
was 
due 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
the 
Austrian 
Government 
for 
its 
generosity 
in 
hosting 
the 
IAEA 
and 
numerous 
other 
international 
bodies 
and 
conferences. 
Half 
a 
century 
had 
gone 
by 
since 
the 
first 
General 
Conference 
and, 
during 
that 
time, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
witnessed 
the 
consolidation 
of 
an 
organization 
that 
carried 
out 
its 
work 
with 
commendable 
professionalism, 
impartiality 
and 
independence. 
However, 
further 
efforts 
were 
required 
to 
build 
a 
safer 
and 
more 
just 
world 
where 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
used 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
humanity 
rather 
than 
destruction. 
187. 
EcuadorÂs 
unwavering 
commitment 
to 
non-proliferation 
was 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
and 
values 
that 
had 
always 
inspired 
its 
foreign 
policy. 
It 
belonged 
to 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
a 
densely 
populated 
area 
and 
it 
had 
consistently 
opposed 
in 
international 
forums 
non-peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes 
conducted 
by 
any 
country. 
His 
country 
actively 
promoted 
the 
conclusion 
of 
international 
agreements 
in 
that 
area 
and 
called 
for 
compliance 
with 
the 
obligations 
deriving 
from 
those 
instruments. 
188. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
to 
have 
been 
elected 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
for 
the 
period 
2007Â2009 
and 
thanked 
GRULAC 
for 
its 
support. 
The 
endorsement 
of 
EcuadorÂs 
candidature 
represented 
a 
vote 
of 
confidence 
and 
his 
delegation 
would 
assume 
its 
responsibilities 
with 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
region 
and 
the 
international 
community 
at 
heart, 
in 
order 
to 
help 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
and 
ensure 
that 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
produced 
concrete 
results. 
Ecuador 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities 
both 
in 
words 
and 
in 
action 
and 
firmly 
believed 
that 
a 
balance 
needed 
to 
be 
maintained 
between 
the 
main 
pillars 
of 
its 
activities. 
189. 
Establishing 
regulatory 
frameworks 
for 
nuclear 
security 
was 
crucial. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
the 
potential 
consequences 
of 
the 
accidental 
or 
malicious 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
sources 
or 
nuclear 
technologies, 
it 
was 
essential 
that 
States 
exercise 
control 
over 
them. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
legal 
framework 
consisting 
of 
various 
international 
instruments 
and 
had 
supported 
the 
adoption 
and 
implementation 
of 
those 
instruments. 
The 
Ecuadorian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
national 
security 
regime 
for 
radioactive 
material 
during 
transport 
and 
temporary 
and 
final 
storage. 
The 
Commission 
had 
implemented 
the 
RAIS-3 
system 
for 
digital 
registration 
of 
sealed 
sources, 
allowing 
an 
inventory 
to 
be 
kept 
of 
all 
radioactive 
material 
in 
the 
country. 
Ecuador 
hoped 
for 
Agency 
support 
to 
put 
in 
place 
customs 
portal 
monitors 
to 
detect 
illicit 
movement 
of 
material. 
190. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
in 
favour 
of 
an 
international 
regime 
for 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
which 
covered 
liability 
for 
damage 
to 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment, 
or 
economic 
losses 
resulting 
from 
nuclear 
accidents 
or 
incidents. 
Communication 
between 
States 
regarding 
the 
movement 
of 
radioactive 
material 
prior 
to 
shipment, 
especially 
by 
sea, 
was 
also 
crucial. 
Measures 
needed 
to 
be 
taken 
to 
promote 
and 
maintain 
mechanisms 
for 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States. 
191. 
Ecuador 
recognized 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
competent 
authority 
to 
verify 
and 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
safeguards 
agreements 
concluded 
with 
Member 
States 
pursuant 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
The 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
of 
great 
importance, 
including 
in 
countries 
which 
remained 
outside 
the 
regime. 
Being 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
should 
not 
be 
seen 
as 
an 
option, 
but 
rather 
as 
a 
priority 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
ensure 
global 
and 
regional 
security. 
The 
major 
powers 
had 
a 
moral 
obligation 
to 
work 
towards 
that 
goal. 
In 
that 
connection, 
the

establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
both 
necessary 
and 
appropriate 
and 
he 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
promote 
the 
convening 
of 
a 
forum 
on 
that 
issue, 
as 
had 
been 
recommended 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2000 
in 
its 
decision 
GC(44)/DEC/12. 
The 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
regrettable. 


192. 
Ecuador 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
as 
demonstrated 
by 
its 
hosting 
of 
a 
regional 
seminar 
on 
strengthened 
safeguards, 
small 
quantities 
protocols 
and 
additional 
protocols 
in 
Quito 
in 
April 
2006. 
Following 
that 
event, 
one 
country 
had 
concluded 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
six 
others 
had 
amended 
their 
small 
quantities 
protocols. 
193. 
His 
country 
believed 
in 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination, 
provided 
that 
they 
met 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
Treaty 
diligently, 
promptly 
and 
in 
a 
fully 
transparent 
manner. 
It 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
diplomacy 
as 
a 
means 
of 
resolving 
international 
conflicts 
in 
a 
consensual 
manner 
and 
was 
therefore 
in 
support 
of 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue. 
It 
had 
repeatedly 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
in 
order 
to 
create 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
transparency 
and 
confidence 
and 
dispel 
any 
doubts 
about 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
fact 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
able 
to 
confirm 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
diverted 
declared 
nuclear 
material, 
and 
that 
Iran 
had 
provided 
additional 
information 
to 
resolve 
various 
outstanding 
issues, 
including 
the 
scope 
and 
nature 
of 
past 
plutonium 
experiments, 
was 
encouraging. 
Ecuador 
welcomed 
the 
work 
plan 
and 
the 
modalities 
for 
resolving 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
agreed 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
August 
2007, 
which 
offered 
another 
opportunity 
for 
Iran 
to 
dispel 
any 
doubts 
and 
gain 
the 
trust 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
which 
had 
been 
undermined 
by 
Iran 
concealing 
activities 
for 
20 
years. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
countries 
to 
give 
the 
Agency 
the 
time 
it 
needed 
to 
find 
a 
solution 
to 
the 
issue 
that 
would 
satisfy 
the 
hopes 
of 
the 
Iranian 
people 
and 
reassure 
the 
international 
community 
of 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
activities. 
194. 
His 
country 
favoured 
a 
peaceful 
solution 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
and 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would 
abandon 
its 
military 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
return 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
shutdown 
of 
the 
Yongbyon 
nuclear 
facility 
and 
the 
Taechon 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
under 
Agency 
monitoring 
and 
called 
on 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
DPRK 
to 
continue 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency. 
195. 
Given 
the 
growth 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services, 
and 
the 
proliferation 
risks 
that 
entailed, 
his 
country 
welcomed 
the 
debate 
on 
options 
for 
assurance 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
which 
should 
be 
examined 
closely. 
Ecuador 
was 
ready 
to 
support 
the 
most 
viable 
initiatives 
which 
both 
prevented 
proliferation 
and 
guaranteed 
access 
to 
nuclear 
power. 
196. 
Efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
legal 
and 
institutional 
framework 
for 
verification, 
safeguards 
and 
security 
would 
be 
in 
vain 
without 
international 
cooperation 
for 
development 
Â 
there 
could 
be 
no 
security 
without 
development. 
Nuclear 
energy 
was 
a 
driving 
force 
for 
peace, 
security 
and 
cooperation, 
and 
cooperation 
was 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
of 
modern 
States 
and 
international 
organizations 
to 
the 
progress 
of 
humanity 
and 
law. 
By 
granting 
cooperation 
legal 
standing, 
a 
new 
international 
legal 
order 
had 
been 
established 
based 
on 
a 
commitment 
to 
the 
well-being 
of 
individuals 
and 
societies. 
The 
duty 
to 
cooperate 
had 
become 
a 
principle 
of 
contemporary 
international 
law. 
197. 
Thus, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
The 
work 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
was 
to 
be 
commended. 
Ecuador 
had 
made 
a 
special 
contribution 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
by 
hosting 
the 
coordination 
meeting 
for 
regional 
project 
RLA/0/029, 
on 
capacity 
building 
for 
the 
development 
of 
sustainable 
energy, 
held 
in 
Quito 
from 
19 
to 
21 
March 
2007. 
IAEA-supported 
projects 
in 
Ecuador 
had 
helped 
promote 
sustainable 
social 
development. 
His 
country 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
ARCAL.

198. 
Ecuador 
had 
made 
great 
efforts 
to 
meet 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF. 
It 
also 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
bring 
nuclear 
legislation 
into 
line 
with 
Agency 
standards. 
199. 
Mr. 
MYRTIL 
(Haiti) 
said 
that 
currently 
only 
two 
member 
countries 
of 
the 
Caribbean 
Community, 
Jamaica 
and 
Haiti, 
were 
receiving 
Agency 
technical 
assistance 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
consider 
sending 
information 
and 
outreach 
missions 
to 
the 
region. 
Haiti 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
offer 
its 
help. 
200. 
Mindful 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development, 
and 
despite 
the 
financial 
difficulties 
his 
country 
faced, 
the 
Government 
of 
Haiti 
had 
paid 
off 
its 
arrears 
in 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
amounting 
to 
over 
US 
$300 
000 
and 
had 
paid 
all 
its 
debts 
and 
met 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
2007. 
It 
would 
also 
be 
meeting 
its 
financial 
obligations 
in 
2008 
and 
urged 
all 
other 
States 
to 
follow 
its 
example. 
As 
the 
President 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
said, 
members 
paying 
their 
contributions 
would 
help 
the 
Agency 
increase 
its 
technical 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States. 
201. 
For 
almost 
five 
years, 
technical 
cooperation 
between 
Haiti 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
proceeding 
very 
well, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
quality 
and 
quantity 
of 
projects 
for 
which 
Haiti 
received 
technical 
assistance, 
and 
at 
the 
level 
of 
human 
resources 
training. 
Haiti 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
projects 
relating 
to 
energy 
planning, 
radiotherapy, 
water 
resources 
management, 
agriculture 
and 
nutrition. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
systematizing 
and 
rationalizing 
its 
efforts 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
his 
country 
would 
soon 
be 
elaborating 
a 
strategic 
plan 
for 
its 
nuclear 
sector, 
which 
should 
help 
the 
Government 
maintain 
sustainable 
development 
in 
strategic 
sectors 
for 
economic 
growth 
such 
as 
water, 
energy, 
health, 
environmental 
protection, 
agriculture, 
etc. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Haiti 
had 
also 
been 
benefiting 
from 
its 
increasingly 
active 
participation 
in 
regional 
projects, 
including 
those 
under 
ARCAL. 
Under 
the 
project 
on 
re-establishment 
of 
radiotherapy 
services, 
the 
Government 
had 
asked 
the 
Agency 
to 
send 
a 
PACT 
integrated 
mission 
to 
perform 
a 
systematic 
evaluation 
of 
HaitiÂs 
cancer 
control 
needs. 
202. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
for 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
and 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
Division 
for 
Latin 
America 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
for 
the 
assistance 
they 
had 
given 
his 
country 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques. 
However, 
Haiti 
believed 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
pay 
special 
attention 
to 
LDCs 
as 
they, 
more 
than 
other 
countries, 
needed 
isotopic 
and 
nuclear 
techniques 
not 
only 
to 
meet 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
but 
also 
to 
achieve 
economic 
growth 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
For 
three 
years, 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
the 
Haitian 
delegation 
had 
emphasized 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
to 
pay 
greater 
attention 
to 
LDCs 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
catch 
up 
in 
terms 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
to 
benefit 
more 
efficiently 
and 
effectively 
from 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
also 
appealed 
to 
the 
members 
of 
the 
Group 
of 
77 
and 
donor 
countries 
to 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
that 
issue. 
At 
the 
52nd 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
Haiti 
was 
planning 
to 
table 
a 
draft 
resolution 
that 
would 
take 
into 
account 
the 
wishes 
of 
the 
LDCs 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
special 
technical 
cooperation 
they 
were 
entitled 
to. 
Thus, 
for 
LDCs 
the 
maximum 
number 
of 
projects 
should 
not 
be 
limited 
to 
five. 
Furthermore, 
given 
that 
the 
problems 
the 
LDCs 
faced 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field 
were 
not 
the 
same 
as 
those 
of 
emerging 
nations 
or 
developed 
countries, 
the 
Secretariat 
should 
consider 
setting 
up 
a 
special 
unit 
to 
consider 
and 
propose 
specific 
solutions 
to 
their 
problems. 
203. 
Recalling 
his 
countryÂs 
commitment 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism, 
in 
particular 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
he 
said 
that 
Haiti 
was 
more 
committed 
than 
ever 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
had 
already 
signed 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Prohibition 
of 
the 
Development, 
Production, 
Stockpiling 
and 
Use 
of 
Chemical 
Weapons 
and 
on 
their 
Destruction, 
and 
it 
was 
about 
to 
ratify 
the 
Convention 
on 
the 
Prohibition 
of 
the 
Development, 
Production 
and 
Stockpiling 
of 
Bacteriological 
(Biological) 
and 
Toxin 
Weapons 
and 
on 
Their 
Destruction, 
in 
line 
with 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004).

204. 
The 
Haitian 
Government 
was 
contemplating 
setting 
up 
a 
nuclear 
safety 
authority 
whose 
role 
would 
be 
not 
only 
to 
ensure 
radiological 
security 
but 
also 
to 
prevent 
and 
suppress 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material. 
Haiti 
thus 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
and 
its 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear 
security 
plan. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
205. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
the 
NPT 
to 
comply 
with 
it 
fully, 
as 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
depended 
on 
it. 
206. 
The 
Haitian 
Government 
had 
taken 
note 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
efficiency, 
but 
efficiency 
could 
not 
be 
increased 
without 
substantial 
investment 
in 
an 
integrated 
information 
system. 
The 
report 
by 
the 
MANNET 
consulting 
group, 
which 
had 
examined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
management 
processes, 
indicated 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
displaying 
signs 
of 
organizational 
stress. 
Since 
the 
cost 
of 
reforming 
the 
management 
process 
would 
be 
high, 
at 
around 
Â24 
million, 
Member 
States 
should 
give 
the 
Secretariat 
financial 
assistance 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
carry 
out 
that 
initiative. 
Haiti 
would 
do 
all 
it 
could 
to 
help. 
207. 
Having 
listened 
with 
interest 
to 
the 
statement 
made 
by 
the 
representative 
of 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
Haiti 
was 
ready 
to 
cooperate 
with 
that 
country 
in 
the 
study 
of 
transboundary 
aquifer 
management, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
radiation 
protection 
through 
bilateral 
projects. 
208. 
Ms. 
MUTANDIRO 
(Zimbabwe) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
its 
technical 
assistance 
and 
cooperation 
programme 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
acknowledged 
the 
immense 
benefits 
it 
had 
derived 
therefrom, 
particularly 
under 
its 
current 
CPF 
for 
2005Â2009. 
The 
growth 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
membership 
and 
the 
phenomenal 
expansion 
of 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
over 
the 
past 
50 
years 
was 
eloquent 
testimony 
to 
its 
critical 
role 
in 
helping 
developing 
countries 
address 
their 
development 
challenges 
through 
the 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
were 
also 
fundamental 
to 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals, 
especially 
with 
respect 
to 
combating 
hunger 
and 
poverty, 
promoting 
gender 
equality 
and 
empowering 
women, 
reducing 
child 
mortality, 
improving 
maternal 
health, 
combating 
disease 
and 
ensuring 
environmental 
sustainability. 
209. 
Zimbabwe 
had 
not 
been 
spared 
by 
the 
alarming 
global 
rise 
in 
cancer 
cases. 
Effective 
control 
of 
cancer 
called 
for 
comprehensive 
strategies 
for 
diagnosis 
and 
therapy 
which 
were 
often 
beyond 
the 
means 
of 
most 
developing 
countries, 
Zimbabwe 
included. 
Her 
Government 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
under 
the 
PACT 
programme 
and 
its 
positive 
contribution 
to 
a 
comprehensive 
global 
strategy 
for 
cancer 
therapy. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
had 
significantly 
boosted 
her 
GovernmentÂs 
endeavours 
to 
establish 
a 
sustainable 
and 
comprehensive 
national 
cancer 
care 
service, 
which 
had 
been 
extended 
through 
the 
rehabilitation 
and 
upgrading 
of 
radiotherapy 
treatment 
facilities 
and 
training 
of 
requisite 
personnel. 
Further 
support 
was 
envisaged 
under 
the 
proposed 
programmes 
for 
improved 
teaching 
in 
medical 
physics 
and 
radiation 
oncology. 
Her 
delegation 
joined 
others 
in 
calling 
for 
increased 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
critical 
area. 
210. 
Her 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
aimed 
at 
improving 
nutrition 
standards 
in 
developing 
countries, 
particularly 
given 
the 
high 
global 
incidence 
of 
HIV/AIDS, 
and 
it 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
commencement 
of 
the 
Agency-backed 
programme 
to 
determine 
the 
nutritional 
needs 
of 
HIV-
negative 
infants 
born 
to 
HIV-positive 
mothers. 
211. 
Nuclear 
applications 
had 
had 
a 
notably 
positive 
impact 
on 
enhancing 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
raising 
the 
income 
of 
farmers 
in 
developing 
countries 
through 
improved 
and 
more 
resistant 
crop 
varieties, 
nuclear 
insect 
control 
techniques, 
livestock 
disease 
management, 
the 
development 
of 
sustainable 
water 
resources 
and 
soil 
nutrition. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
programmes 
in 
food 
agriculture 
had 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
mitigating 
hunger 
and 
poverty 
and 
ensuring 
environmental 
sustainability.

Zimbabwe 
was 
benefiting 
from 
Agency 
assistance 
with 
the 
development 
of 
drought-tolerant 
and 
disease-resistant 
grain 
legumes, 
combating 
of 
desertification 
and 
isotopic 
assessments 
of 
groundwater. 
It 
applauded 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
veterinary 
diagnostic 
laboratory 
services 
and 
the 
proposed 
feasibility 
studies 
on 
the 
use 
of 
the 
SIT 
to 
eradicate 
tsetse 
in 
the 
north-west 
of 
the 
country, 
which 
would 
allow 
agricultural 
and 
livestock 
development 
in 
that 
part 
of 
Zimbabwe. 
213. 
Within 
the 
regional 
context 
and 
AFRA, 
the 
Agency 
had 
facilitated 
the 
participation 
of 
Zimbabwean 
nationals 
in 
capacity-building 
programmes 
for 
human 
resources 
development 
and 
knowledge 
management 
for 
nuclear 
applications, 
including 
in 
the 
industrial 
and 
agriculture 
sectors. 
Zimbabwe 
looked 
forward 
to 
further 
enhanced 
cooperation 
and 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
beyond 
the 
current 
CPF, 
with 
concepts 
for 
2009Â2011 
already 
under 
consideration. 
214. 
Her 
country 
commended 
the 
assistance 
the 
Agency 
was 
giving 
to 
the 
African 
UnionÂs 
PATTEC 
initiatives 
to 
eradicate 
tsetse 
flies 
on 
the 
African 
continent. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
studies 
currently 
being 
undertaken 
by 
South 
Africa 
within 
the 
Southern 
African 
Development 
Community 
to 
integrate 
the 
SIT 
in 
an 
area-wide, 
integrated 
pest 
management 
programme 
in 
the 
northern 
part 
of 
the 
country 
as 
well 
as 
in 
southern 
Mozambique. 
Helping 
affected 
African 
countries 
to 
eradicate 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
using 
SIT 
techniques 
would 
address 
a 
major 
impediment 
to 
AfricaÂs 
socio-economic 
development. 
215. 
The 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
strengthened 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
was 
a 
fundamental 
step 
towards 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
objectives 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
Zimbabwe 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty 
and 
it 
encouraged 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
in 
regions 
where 
they 
did 
not 
yet 
exist, 
particularly 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
216. 
Zimbabwe 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
critical 
role 
in 
promoting 
international 
peace 
and 
ensuring 
the 
stability 
of 
the 
NPT. 
There 
was 
a 
compelling 
need 
to 
uphold 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
develop, 
research, 
produce 
and 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
sole 
competent 
authority 
responsible 
for 
verifying 
the 
compliance 
of 
State 
Parties 
with 
their 
NPT 
safeguard 
obligations. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that, 
in 
addressing 
challenges 
that 
might 
arise 
in 
the 
future 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
international 
security 
and 
disarmament, 
the 
supremacy 
of 
multilateralism 
and 
diplomacy 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Charter 
would 
prevail. 
217. 
Mr. 
APOSTOL 
(Republic 
of 
Moldova) 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
like 
many 
in 
the 
region, 
paid 
great 
attention 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
international 
conventions 
it 
had 
ratified, 
and 
to 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
medicine, 
industry 
and 
other 
important 
branches 
of 
the 
national 
economy. 
218. 
During 
the 
preceding 
year, 
Moldova 
had 
adopted 
a 
new 
law 
on 
the 
safe 
conduct 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
activities, 
pursuant 
to 
which 
a 
single 
regulatory 
authority 
had 
been 
created. 
Bringing 
its 
legislative 
framework 
into 
line 
with 
Agency 
and 
European 
Union 
standards 
was 
the 
next 
step 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safe 
implementation 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
activities 
in 
the 
country. 
219. 
In 
2005, 
Moldova 
had 
signed 
its 
CPF 
which 
identified 
the 
priority 
areas 
for 
cooperation 
as 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
human 
health, 
radiation 
processing, 
radiation 
safety, 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
The 
project 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
radiation 
processing 
centre 
was 
the 
second 
large 
and 
ambitious 
ongoing 
national 
project 
in 
Moldova 
and 
it 
would 
make 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
development 
of 
such 
branches 
of 
the 
economy 
as 
pharmaceuticals, 
medicine, 
food 
and 
science. 
His 
country 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
the 
support 
it 
had 
given 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
its 
regulatory 
authority 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
ongoing 
national 
and 
regional 
projects. 
It 
was 
also 
grateful 
to 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
for 
the 
bilateral 
support 
it 
had 
given 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
inventory 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources.

220. 
A 
draft 
law 
on 
acceptance 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
Articles 
VI 
and 
XIV.A 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
Government 
for 
approval. 
Furthermore, 
the 
ratification 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
Agreement 
on 
the 
Privileges 
and 
Immunities 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
expected 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
221. 
In 
its 
first 
half 
century, 
the 
Agency 
had, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
played 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
in 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dynamic 
international 
organizations. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
its 
activities. 
222. 
Mr. 
KEBEDE 
(Ethiopia) 
said 
that 
the 
year 
2007, 
as 
well 
as 
marking 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
marked 
the 
new 
millennium 
in 
the 
Ethiopian 
calendar. 
On 
that 
occasion, 
the 
Ethiopian 
people 
and 
Government 
had 
renewed 
their 
commitment 
to 
meaningful 
change 
based 
on 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development 
and 
strengthening 
of 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
country. 
Nuclear 
energy 
could 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
that 
process. 
223. 
Ethiopia 
was 
engaged 
in 
a 
number 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
with 
the 
Agency, 
of 
which 
the 
most 
important 
was 
the 
one 
which 
aimed 
at 
eradicating 
the 
tsetse 
fly, 
and 
the 
devastating 
disease 
trypanosomosis 
which 
it 
transmitted, 
from 
25 
000 
km2 
of 
land 
in 
the 
Southern 
Rift 
Valley 
using 
the 
SIT. 
Over 
240 
000 
km2 
of 
fertile 
agricultural 
land 
in 
the 
west 
and 
south 
of 
the 
country 
were 
infested 
with 
five 
species 
of 
tsetse 
fly. 
The 
project 
comprised 
three 
major 
components: 
suppression 
of 
the 
existing 
fly 
population; 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
centrally 
operated 
sterile 
insect 
production 
plant; 
and 
field 
operations 
using 
SIT 
technology. 
Two 
of 
the 
six 
modules 
of 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
rearing 
and 
irradiation 
facility 
had 
been 
inaugurated 
in 
February 
2007. 
The 
tsetse 
fly 
colony 
already 
amounted 
to 
over 
147 
000 
flies. 
The 
first 
pilot 
release 
of 
flies 
had 
taken 
place 
with 
an 
encouraging 
survival 
rate 
of 
95% 
2Â3 
weeks 
after 
release. 
With 
a 
view 
to 
intensifying 
activities, 
negotiations 
were 
in 
progress 
between 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government, 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
an 
industrial 
irradiator 
for 
the 
new 
centre. 
The 
project 
enjoyed 
the 
support 
of 
many 
development 
partners, 
such 
as 
the 
FAO, 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank, 
the 
OPEC 
Fund 
for 
International 
Development, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Trust 
Fund 
for 
Human 
Security 
and 
the 
governments 
of 
China, 
Japan 
and 
the 
United 
States. 
His 
country 
was 
very 
grateful 
for 
the 
support 
provided 
for 
the 
project. 
224. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
assistance, 
his 
country 
had 
been 
able 
to 
build 
up 
a 
modest 
national 
infrastructure 
for 
nuclear 
medicine, 
radiotherapy 
and 
isotope 
hydrology. 
A 
cobalt 
therapy 
machine 
had 
recently 
been 
acquired 
under 
a 
cost-sharing 
agreement 
between 
the 
Ethiopian 
Government 
and 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
only 
radiotherapy 
centre 
in 
Addis 
Ababa, 
which 
was 
serving 
over 
77 
million 
people. 
An 
average 
of 
400 
cancer 
patients 
per 
year 
were 
being 
treated 
by 
that 
centre, 
out 
of 
an 
estimated 
115 
000 
new 
cancer 
cases. 
To 
narrow 
the 
gap 
between 
demand 
and 
supply, 
it 
was 
planned, 
with 
Agency 
collaboration, 
to 
expand 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
services 
to 
five 
university 
hospitals 
around 
the 
country. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
and 
Member 
States 
to 
provide 
greater 
technical 
and 
financial 
support 
for 
that 
endeavour. 
225. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance, 
his 
country 
had 
succeeded 
in 
building 
up 
the 
basic 
capacity 
required 
to 
generate 
useful 
isotopic 
data. 
An 
isotope 
hydrology 
laboratory 
had 
been 
set 
up 
at 
Addis 
Ababa 
University, 
a 
national 
groundwater 
database 
had 
been 
established 
and 
staff 
had 
been 
trained. 
Thus, 
with 
the 
financial 
and 
technical 
support 
of 
various 
international 
organizations 
including 
the 
Agency, 
the 
basic 
infrastructure 
was 
being 
put 
in 
place 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Ethiopian 
Groundwater 
Resource 
Assessment 
Programme 
which 
was 
part 
of 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
15-year 
water 
sector 
development 
programme. 
226. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
participating 
in 
a 
number 
of 
regional 
projects 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
enabled 
it 
to 
build 
basic 
capacity 
and 
generate 
useful 
data 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
mutation 
breeding

of 
indigenous 
crops, 
energy 
planning, 
non-destructive 
testing 
and 
molecular 
detection 
of 
drug 
resistance 
in 
malaria 
and 
tuberculosis. 
He 
commended 
the 
role 
played 
by 
AFRA 
from 
the 
inception 
of 
projects 
to 
ensuring 
the 
sustainability 
of 
their 
results. 
The 
efforts 
under 
AFRA 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries 
and 
to 
devise 
national 
and 
regional 
strategies 
for 
human 
resources 
development 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
deserved 
to 
be 
encouraged. 


227. 
His 
country 
had 
been 
developing 
new 
project 
concepts 
and 
proposals 
through 
the 
PCMF. 
That 
Web-based 
tool 
had 
been 
considerably 
improved 
since 
the 
2007Â2008 
programme 
cycle. 
Ethiopia 
had 
also 
recently 
finalized 
its 
second 
CPF 
for 
the 
period 
2007Â2012. 
228. 
Ethiopia 
remained 
committed 
to 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technologies, 
with 
due 
respect 
for 
global, 
regional 
and 
national 
security 
and 
safety. 
The 
most 
important 
mission 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
next 
half-century 
would 
be 
to 
create 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
world 
through 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
all 
relevant 
guiding 
principles 
and 
treaties, 
including 
the 
CTBT. 
His 
country 
had 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
and 
had 
begun 
the 
formal 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
It 
also 
recognized 
the 
need 
for 
adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
for 
the 
Agency 
and 
regularly 
paid 
its 
annual 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF. 
229. 
Mr. 
ELWAZER 
(Palestine) 
said 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
assisted 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
through 
the 
financing 
of 
three 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
for 
2007Â 
2008 
on 
strengthening 
of 
and 
support 
for 
environmental 
radiation 
monitoring, 
strengthening 
of 
radiation 
protection, 
and 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
230. 
The 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Department 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
Energy 
Authority 
had 
put 
forward 
a 
number 
of 
project 
concepts 
for 
the 
2009Â2011 
cycle, 
which 
it 
hoped 
would 
be 
approved. 
They 
related 
to 
the 
building 
of 
national 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
capabilities, 
strengthening 
of 
radiation 
protection, 
establishment 
of 
a 
Palestinian 
radiation 
map, 
and 
support 
for 
training 
in 
radiation 
protection. 
231. 
The 
Palestinian 
Authority 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
cooperate 
with 
it 
in 
protecting 
the 
Palestinian 
environment 
from 
the 
risk 
of 
radiation 
from 
Israeli 
nuclear 
reactors, 
especial 
the 
ageing 
Dimona 
reactor 
which 
was 
reportedly 
in 
a 
dangerous 
condition, 
with 
the 
result 
that 
there 
had 
been 
several 
radiation 
incidents. 
Dimona 
was 
located 
only 
40 
kilometres 
from 
Palestinian 
territory 
and 
therefore 
constituted 
a 
major 
risk. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
informed 
that 
Palestinian 
doctors 
who 
were 
members 
of 
International 
Physicians 
for 
the 
Prevention 
of 
Nuclear 
War 
had 
recently 
reported 
an 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
cancer 
cases 
in 
the 
southern 
West 
Bank 
region 
which 
were 
thought 
to 
be 
due 
to 
radiation 
leaks 
from 
the 
Israeli 
Dimona 
reactor. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
requested 
to 
verify 
the 
research 
findings 
because 
Palestinians 
were 
increasingly 
worried 
about 
such 
leaks, 
which 
could 
have 
catastrophic 
consequences 
in 
the 
future 
for 
the 
region 
as 
a 
whole. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
also 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
give 
priority 
to 
developing 
Palestinian 
emergency 
preparedness 
capabilities. 
232. 
It 
was 
imperative 
for 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
apply 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
forthwith 
to 
all 
their 
nuclear 
activities 
as 
a 
confidence-building 
measure. 
Noting 
that 
all 
States 
except 
Israel 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT, 
he 
said 
that 
global 
experience 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
with 
Agency 
support 
should 
serve 
as 
an 
incentive 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
a 
goal 
to 
which 
Palestine 
gave 
top 
priority. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
bring 
pressure 
to 
bear 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
opportunity. 
As 
the 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
it 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
strive 
for 
its 
universality 
and 
devote 
equal 
attention 
to 
its 
three 
basic 
components: 
nuclear

disarmament, 
the 
right 
of 
non-nuclear 
State 
Parties 
to 
obtain 
and 
develop 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 


233. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
recent 
deterioration 
in 
the 
economic 
situation 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
people, 
especially 
in 
the 
Gaza 
Strip, 
where 
more 
than 
one 
and 
a 
half 
million 
people 
were 
suffering 
under 
a 
harsh 
blockade 
owing 
to 
the 
closures 
imposed 
by 
Israel. 
Moreover, 
the 
Israeli 
Government 
had 
declared 
the 
Gaza 
Strip 
a 
Âhostile 
entityÂ 
and 
was 
threatening 
to 
deprive 
its 
people 
of 
water, 
fuel 
and 
electricity. 
The 
imposition 
of 
such 
collective 
punishment 
would 
have 
a 
disastrous 
impact 
and 
would 
also 
adversely 
affect 
efforts 
to 
revive 
the 
peace 
process 
with 
the 
ultimate 
aim 
of 
ending 
the 
current 
conflict 
and 
realizing 
the 
aspirations 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
for 
an 
independent 
State 
with 
its 
capital 
in 
Jerusalem, 
together 
with 
the 
return 
of 
Palestinian 
refugees 
to 
their 
homes 
in 
accordance 
with 
United 
Nations 
resolutions. 
234. 
The 
Palestinian 
Authority 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
the 
meeting 
planned 
for 
November 
2007, 
under 
United 
States 
auspices, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reviving 
the 
peace 
process; 
however, 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
meeting 
needed 
to 
be 
clarified. 
The 
question 
was 
whether 
it 
was 
it 
to 
be 
a 
peace 
conference 
or 
an 
ephemeral 
event 
where 
no 
practical 
decisions 
were 
taken 
to 
achieve 
the 
desired 
goals. 
It 
was 
also 
important 
to 
invite 
all 
parties 
concerned, 
including 
Syria 
and 
Lebanon, 
since 
only 
a 
comprehensive, 
just 
and 
lasting 
peace 
could 
finally 
banish 
the 
spectre 
of 
war 
from 
the 
region. 
235. 
He 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
agreement 
reached 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
on 
resolving 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
regarding 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
it 
would 
prove 
successful. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
noted 
that 
the 
NPT 
recognized 
the 
right 
of 
all 
State 
Parties 
to 
build 
and 
develop 
their 
nuclear 
capabilities 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
meeting 
rose 
at 
8.20 
p.m.

Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
(GC(51)/1/Add.1, 
GC(51)/24 
and 
25) 


1. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
item 
22 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
a 
request 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
that 
were 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
An 
explanatory 
memorandum 
was 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/1/Add.1. 
The 
Conference 
also 
had 
before 
it 
documents 
GC(51)/24 
and 
25. 
2. 
Mr. 
AL-MEMARI 
(Oman), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group, 
said 
that 
the 
Arab 
States 
and 
other 
States 
were 
deeply 
concerned 
about 
the 
failure 
to 
achieve 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Israel 
had 
been 
refusing 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
for 
37 
years 
and 
had 
been 
developing 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
any 
international 
monitoring. 
While 
all 
kinds 
of 
international 
pressure 
was 
exerted 
on 
States 
that 
had 
already 
ratified 
the 
NPT, 
none 
whatsoever 
was 
brought 
to 
bear 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede. 
Universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
its 
effectiveness 
and 
credibility 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
present 
situation 
was 
having 
a 
particularly 
adverse 
impact 
on 
the 
Middle 
East, 
where 
it 
was 
fuelling 
unrest 
and 
was 
conducive 
to 
a 
dangerous 
arms 
race, 
especially 
since 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
except 
Israel, 
which 
refused 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
was 
preventing 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
notwithstanding 
the 
many 
Security 
Council, 
General 
Assembly 
and 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
on 
the 
subject. 
It 
remained 
free 
to 
develop 
its 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
without 
being 
subjected 
to 
any 
real 
pressure. 
Indeed, 
some 
parties 
were 
regrettably 
providing 
it 
with 
political 
cover 
and 
assisting 
it 
in 
developing 
its 
arsenal. 
3. 
The 
Arab 
States 
were 
greatly 
troubled 
by 
the 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
of 
developments 
in 
a 
number 
of 
international 
disarmament 
forums. 
They 
wished 
to 
reaffirm 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
Conference 
the 
importance 
of 
adopting 
a 
comprehensive 
regional 
approach 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
an 
approach 
that 
took 
into 
account 
the 
security 
of 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
rather 
than 
dealing 
separately 
with 
each 
country, 
since 
that 
suggested 
selectivity, 
bias 
and 
double 
standards. 
At 
their 
summit 
in 
Khartoum, 
the 
Arab 
leaders 
had 
noted 
that, 
although 
all 
Arab 
States 
without 
exception 
had 
voluntarily 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT, 
security 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
until 
Israel 
became 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
placed 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
General 
Conference 
should 
take 
a 
firm 
stand 
on 
the 
issue. 
IsraelÂs 
security 
would 
not 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
possession 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
but 
by 
giving 
priority 
to 
peace. 
4. 
The 
Arab 
Group 
and 
friendly 
States 
wished 
an 
item 
entitled 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
to 
be 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
next 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
5. 
The 
Arab 
Group 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
support 
the 
Arab 
request 
to 
rid 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
draw 
attention 
to 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
threat 
and 
to 
demand 
that 
Israel 
accede 
to 
the 
relevant 
international 
agreements 
and 
open 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
international 
inspection. 
Also, 
it 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
support 
Arab 
diplomatic 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
security 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
6. 
It 
was 
ironic 
to 
hear 
a 
delegate 
express 
annoyance 
in 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
in 
other 
international 
forums 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
attention 
was 
being 
drawn 
to 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
Israeli 
nuclear 
threat 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
That 
attitude 
doubtless 
reflected 
contempt 
for 
international 
law 
and 
for 
resolutions, 
particularly 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
General 
Assembly

resolution 
61/103 
of 
3 
January 
2007, 
which 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
full-scope 
Agency 
safeguards. 


7. 
The 
Arab 
summit 
held 
in 
Riyadh 
on 
29 
March 
2007 
and 
the 
meeting 
of 
Arab 
Ministers 
for 
Foreign 
Affairs 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
September 
2007 
had 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
regional 
and 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
8. 
It 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
apply 
double 
standards 
in 
the 
context 
of 
agenda 
item 
22. 
He 
urged 
certain 
Agency 
Member 
States 
to 
adopt 
an 
equitable 
stance, 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
dangers 
inherent 
in 
IsraelÂs 
ongoing 
nuclear 
weaponization 
policy, 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
terms 
of 
relevant 
international 
resolutions 
and 
to 
consider 
the 
facts 
objectively 
instead 
of 
turning 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
them 
and 
deferring 
discussion 
under 
the 
item 
from 
one 
session 
of 
the 
Conference 
to 
the 
next. 
It 
was 
time 
to 
send 
a 
message 
to 
international 
public 
opinion 
by 
adopting 
a 
just 
decision. 
In 
that 
connection, 
the 
Arab 
Group 
was 
displeased 
with 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
consultations 
with 
some 
regional 
groups 
which 
were 
obstructing 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
draft 
resolution 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
or 
the 
adoption 
by 
consensus 
of 
a 
PresidentÂs 
statement 
like 
ones 
adopted 
at 
previous 
sessions. 
Their 
attitude 
was 
undermining 
the 
constructive 
spirit 
that 
had 
prevailed 
in 
the 
past 
among 
regional 
groups. 
9. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
the 
preservation 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
principles 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
were 
closely 
interrelated 
goals. 
The 
persistence 
of 
double 
standards 
regarding 
IsraelÂs 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
capabilities 
constituted 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
security 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
silence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
face 
of 
that 
threat 
and 
the 
willingness 
to 
provide 
political 
cover 
for 
it 
were 
undermining 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
and 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
silence 
persisted 
despite 
the 
existence 
of 
binding 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
and 
resolutions 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
held 
in 
1995 
and 
2000, 
all 
of 
which 
supported 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
abandon 
the 
nuclear 
option, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
full-
scope 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
to 
work 
with 
its 
neighbours 
to 
create 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
The 
international 
silence 
persisted 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
now 
openly 
stated 
that 
his 
country 
possessed 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities. 
10. 
Unfortunately, 
neither 
Israel 
nor 
many 
other 
States 
appreciated 
the 
Arab 
StatesÂ 
concession 
in 
refraining 
from 
submitting 
a 
draft 
resolution 
under 
the 
current 
agenda 
item. 
Israel 
was 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
political 
cover 
that 
some 
States 
were 
continuing 
to 
provide, 
advancing 
the 
unacceptable 
argument 
that 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
guaranteed 
peace 
and 
security. 
11. 
Member 
States 
should 
give 
balanced 
consideration 
to 
the 
issue 
now 
before 
the 
Conference, 
demonstrating 
an 
international 
commitment 
to 
work 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
all 
the 
aforementioned 
resolutions 
and 
for 
the 
continued 
credibility 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
as 
embodied 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
hope 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
would 
send 
a 
clear 
message 
to 
Israel 
under 
the 
current 
agenda 
item, 
regardless 
of 
the 
form 
it 
took, 
reaffirming 
the 
commitment 
of 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
address 
the 
serious 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
to 
restore 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
five 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
in 
particular, 
when 
they 
called 
for 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
12. 
Mr. 
AL-KHOURY 
(Lebanon) 
said 
that 
the 
current 
agenda 
item 
was 
extremely 
important 
because 
of 
the 
threat 
presented 
by 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
Israel 
to 
neighbouring 
countries 
and 
to 
security 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
world 
was 
well 
aware 
of 
the 
number 
of 
Israeli 
attacks 
on 
LebanonÂs 
territory, 
people, 
resources 
and 
infrastructure 
and 
of 
their 
catastrophic 
impact 
on

the 
entire 
Lebanese 
population. 
His 
country 
was 
still 
attempting 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
July 
2006 
War 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
friendly 
countries. 


13. 
The 
atmosphere 
of 
consensus 
that 
had 
prevailed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
current 
General 
Conference 
session 
had 
augured 
well 
for 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
proceedings. 
Lebanon 
continued 
to 
believe 
in 
the 
importance 
of 
consensus 
on 
fundamental 
principles 
Â 
for 
instance, 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
air 
their 
problems 
and 
express 
their 
fears 
of 
States 
manufacturing 
and 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Also, 
it 
was 
the 
duty 
of 
every 
State 
to 
express 
its 
hopes 
and 
to 
promote 
the 
adoption 
of 
international 
resolutions 
that 
furthered 
international 
peace 
and 
sustainable 
development 
in 
order 
to 
build 
a 
secure 
society 
that 
was 
based 
on 
justice 
and 
that 
eschewed 
double 
standards. 
14. 
It 
was 
incumbent 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
comply 
unconditionally 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regulations 
and 
resolutions 
and 
with 
international 
agreements, 
including 
the 
NPT, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
compromise 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
successful 
future 
that 
its 
Member 
States 
hoped 
lay 
in 
store 
for 
it. 
15. 
Lebanon, 
which 
was 
committed 
to 
compliance 
with 
United 
Nations 
resolutions 
and 
with 
the 
NPT, 
considered 
it 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
Israel 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
opened 
up 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
Agency 
inspectors 
and 
the 
safeguards 
regime. 
While 
regretting 
the 
failure 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus 
on 
a 
draft 
resolution, 
and 
even 
on 
a 
PresidentÂs 
statement, 
Lebanon 
would 
support 
any 
Arab 
initiative 
at 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
would 
like 
all 
regional 
groups 
to 
show 
understanding 
of 
that 
position, 
to 
support 
it 
and 
to 
desist 
from 
political 
bias 
and 
from 
any 
linkage 
with 
other 
items. 
16. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
expressed 
disappointment 
at 
the 
negative 
outcome 
of 
the 
deliberations 
regarding 
the 
agenda 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
At 
previous 
sessions, 
the 
Arab 
Group 
and 
friendly 
States 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
have 
a 
draft 
resolution 
adopted 
and 
had 
been 
forced 
to 
content 
themselves 
with 
a 
weak 
PresidentÂs 
statement. 
At 
the 
current 
session, 
they 
had 
been 
hoping 
at 
least 
to 
secure 
agreement 
from 
other 
States 
on 
a 
more 
robust 
statement 
and 
hence 
their 
assistance 
in 
eliminating 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
the 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
arsenal 
of 
Israel 
to 
the 
security 
and 
environment 
of 
the 
other 
countries 
of 
the 
Middle 
East, 
a 
threat 
that 
constituted 
a 
breach 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Sadly, 
however, 
that 
assistance 
had 
not 
been 
forthcoming 
since 
a 
number 
of 
influential 
States 
were 
still 
seeking 
to 
support 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
arsenal 
and 
continuing 
to 
apply 
double 
standards. 
17. 
The 
Israeli 
threat 
could 
be 
described 
as 
a 
form 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Israel 
had 
consistently 
refused 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
relevant 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
and 
remained 
outside 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
Moreover, 
it 
was 
continuing 
to 
attack 
its 
neighbours. 
The 
impact 
of 
its 
onslaught 
on 
LebanonÂs 
infrastructure 
was 
still 
visible, 
and 
Israel 
was 
continuing 
to 
violate 
the 
rights 
of 
the 
occupied 
Palestinian 
people 
and 
of 
the 
Syrian 
people 
of 
the 
occupied 
Golan 
Heights, 
flouting 
international 
law 
in 
the 
knowledge 
that 
it 
could 
count 
on 
the 
support 
of 
certain 
influential 
States. 
18. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
announced 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
current 
session 
that 
he 
had 
failed 
to 
make 
progress 
towards 
the 
goal 
of 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
was 
common 
knowledge 
that 
the 
only 
obstacle 
was 
the 
non-accession 
of 
Israel 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
its 
unwillingness 
to 
open 
up 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
international 
inspection. 
19. 
The 
persistent 
unwillingness 
of 
some 
influential 
States 
to 
allow 
the 
Arab 
States 
to 
express 
their 
deep 
concern 
at 
the 
threat 
to 
the 
Middle 
East 
posed 
by 
the 
Zionist 
entity 
and 
its 
nuclear 
arsenal 
under 
the 
agenda 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
was 
undermining 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Their 
refusal 
even 
to 
accept 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
weak 
PresidentÂs 
statement 
confirmed 
the 
existence 
of 
double 
standards 
Â 
witness 
the 
turmoil 
being 
stirred 
up 
about 
one 
State 
on 
account 
of 
the 
mere 
suspicion 
that 
it 
might 
possess 
nuclear 
weapons, 
while 
a 
blind 
eye 
was 
turned 
to 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear

weapons 
although 
its 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
recently 
confirmed 
their 
existence 
in 
a 
statement 
containing 
an 
implicit 
threat. 
Those 
influential 
States 
were 
continuing 
to 
assist 
Israel, 
overtly 
and 
covertly, 
in 
building 
up 
its 
nuclear 
arsenal. 
The 
tense 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
Israeli 
GovernmentÂs 
reckless 
policy 
of 
launching 
attacks 
on 
its 
neighbours 
should 
persuade 
those 
influential 
States 
and 
the 
international 
community 
as 
a 
whole 
that 
it 
was 
time 
to 
change 
their 
discriminatory 
policies. 


20. 
The 
Arab 
StatesÂ 
demands 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
were 
legitimate, 
their 
ultimate 
goal 
being 
the 
elimination 
of 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
arsenal, 
which 
posed 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
Arab 
States 
would 
not 
give 
up 
Âas 
long 
as 
the 
Zionist 
entity 
and 
its 
arsenal, 
which 
breached 
international 
law, 
existed 
in 
the 
region, 
they 
would 
continue 
to 
express 
their 
deep 
concern 
in 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
in 
other 
forums, 
in 
order 
to 
persuade 
the 
international 
community 
to 
address 
the 
threat 
and 
preserve 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime, 
thereby 
preventing 
an 
uncontrollable 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
region. 
21. 
The 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
requested 
that 
the 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
be 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
22. 
Mr. 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran), 
reviewing 
past 
events 
that 
had 
a 
bearing 
on 
the 
item 
under 
discussion, 
said 
that, 
when 
the 
Israeli 
regime 
had 
attacked 
IraqÂs 
nuclear 
reactor 
in 
1981, 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
submitted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
condemning 
the 
attack. 
Although 
Saddam 
HusseinÂs 
regime 
in 
Iraq 
was 
attacking 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
at 
the 
time 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
United 
States 
and 
other 
Western 
countries, 
his 
country 
had 
supported 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
The 
United 
States, 
as 
the 
guardian 
of 
Israel, 
had 
warned 
all 
sponsors 
that 
if 
the 
draft 
resolution 
was 
adopted 
it 
would 
leave 
the 
Agency, 
causing 
a 
major 
financial 
crisis. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
thereupon 
undertaken 
to 
offset 
the 
financial 
deficit. 
Although 
the 
resolution 
had 
been 
adopted, 
the 
United 
States 
had 
remained 
a 
Member 
State 
of 
the 
Agency. 
23. 
Resolutions 
entitled 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
had 
been 
adopted 
at 
subsequent 
sessions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
In 
all 
of 
them, 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
demanded 
IsraelÂs 
prompt 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
placing 
of 
all 
of 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
About 
ten 
years 
previously, 
a 
weak 
resolution 
on 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
whole 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
and 
a 
PresidentÂs 
statement 
had 
replaced 
the 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
resolution. 
The 
statement 
and 
its 
successors 
had 
contained 
no 
legally 
binding 
provisions. 
When 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
recently 
acknowledged 
that 
his 
country 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons, 
the 
Agency 
Member 
States 
that 
were 
members 
of 
NAM 
had 
deplored 
the 
fact 
Â 
the 
Western 
countries 
had 
remained 
silent, 
in 
keeping 
with 
their 
double 
standards 
policy. 
24. 
The 
1995 
and 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
had 
called 
for 
prompt 
Israeli 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
safeguards 
to 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
facilities. 
25. 
At 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Arab 
States 
and 
other 
like-minded 
Member 
States 
had 
submitted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
entitled 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ. 
The 
United 
States 
and 
some 
other 
Western 
countries 
had 
put 
forward 
a 
Âno 
actionÂ 
motion. 
Moreover, 
they 
had 
called 
for 
a 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
on 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
whole 
Â 
although 
such 
resolutions 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
in 
previous 
years 
Â 
and 
had 
voted 
against 
it. 
Thus, 
instead 
of 
addressing 
othersÂ 
legitimate 
security 
concerns 
and 
seeking 
peaceful 
solutions, 
they 
had 
used 
procedural 
means 
or 
threats 
in 
order 
to 
block 
discussion. 
26. 
The 
proposal 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
put 
forward 
initially 
by 
Iran 
in 
1974, 
was 
caught 
in 
a 
vicious 
circle 
owing 
to 
IsraelÂs 
non-compliance 
with 
international 
law. 
The 
continuous 
support 
by 
the 
United 
States 
for 
aggression 
and 
atrocities 
and 
for 
the 
violation 
of 
over 
30 
United 
Nations 
and 
General 
Conference 
resolutions, 
and 
the 
silence 
of 
other 
countries, 
constituted 
a 
shameful 
chapter 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
and 
the 
Agency. 
The 
acknowledgement 
of 

GC(51)/OR.9

IsraelÂs 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
a 
serious 
setback 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
was 
undermining 
the 
AgencyÂs 
credibility 
at 
a 
time 
when 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
was 
the 
victim 
of 
discrimination 
and 
double 
standards 
and 
being 
prevented 
from 
exercising 
its 
inalienable 
rights 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 


27. 
It 
was 
high 
time 
to 
send 
out 
a 
strong 
message, 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
which 
remained 
outside 
international 
control, 
particularly 
the 
AgencyÂs 
full-scope 
safeguards, 
constituted 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
regional 
and 
global 
peace 
and 
security. 
All 
Member 
States 
that 
cared 
about 
the 
AgencyÂs 
independence, 
professionalism 
and 
credibility 
should 
take 
serious 
corrective 
measures 
before 
it 
was 
too 
late. 
28. 
Mr. 
MISSLATTI 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
said 
that 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
were 
a 
constant 
source 
of 
instability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
could 
lead 
to 
an 
arms 
race 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
sorely 
needed 
infrastructure 
development. 
The 
statement 
by 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
in 
December 
2006 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
Israel 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons 
provided 
solid 
proof 
that 
double 
standards 
were 
being 
applied 
to 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region, 
since 
the 
statement 
had 
not 
elicited 
the 
requisite 
response 
from 
States 
that 
constantly 
claimed 
to 
be 
pursuing 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
especially 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Just 
as 
the 
Agency 
required 
the 
other 
States 
of 
the 
region 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
nuclear 
safeguards 
regime, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
NPT, 
so 
also 
it 
should 
demand 
that 
Israel 
conclude 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
full-
scope 
Agency 
safeguards. 
29. 
He 
requested 
that 
the 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
be 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
30. 
Mr. 
AYOUB 
(Iraq) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
at 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
States 
were 
preventing 
the 
General 
Conference 
from 
reaching 
a 
consensus 
on 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
resolution 
calling 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
since 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
State 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
with 
an 
advanced 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
with 
nuclear 
weapons, 
as 
recently 
admitted 
by 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister. 
The 
Middle 
East 
was 
prone 
to 
major 
crises 
because 
of 
the 
policy 
of 
double 
standards 
pursued 
by 
some 
influential 
States. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
insist 
on 
IsraelÂs 
compliance 
with 
international 
resolutions 
just 
as 
it 
had 
insisted 
on 
IraqÂs 
complying 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
687(1991) 
as 
a 
step 
towards 
the 
goal 
of 
establishing 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
a 
zone 
free 
from 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
31. 
He 
requested 
that 
the 
agenda 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
be 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
next 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
32. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
the 
wish 
of 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
region 
had 
still 
not 
been 
achieved, 
despite 
the 
large 
number 
of 
resolutions 
adopted 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
and 
various 
United 
Nations 
bodies. 
Israel, 
which 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
was 
not 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
which 
had 
not 
expressed 
an 
intention 
to 
become 
one, 
should 
adhere 
to 
that 
treaty 
without 
delay 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
That 
would 
be 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-
weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
it 
would 
be 
an 
extremely 
important 
step 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
peace 
process. 
33. 
The 
12 
December 
2006 
declaration 
of 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
that 
Israel 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
causing 
serious 
concern 
among 
all 
peace-loving 
people 
worldwide, 
as 
it 
confirmed 
that 
Israel 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
its 
neighbours 
and 
to 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
For 
the 
sake 
of 
the 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
the 
transfer 
to 
Israel 
of 
all 
nuclear 
equipment, 
information 
and

material 
should 
be 
stopped, 
along 
with 
the 
provision 
of 
scientific 
and 
technological 
assistance 
useful 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 


34. 
The 
United 
States 
and 
various 
European 
governments 
should 
be 
consistent; 
they 
should 
abandon 
their 
permissive 
attitude 
towards 
Israel 
and 
demand 
the 
destruction, 
with 
international 
verification, 
of 
its 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
it 
appeared 
willing 
to 
use 
if 
necessary 
in 
order 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
plans 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
collusion 
with 
its 
main 
ally 
Â 
the 
United 
States. 
35. 
In 
the 
opinion 
of 
her 
country, 
IsraelÂs 
attitude 
should 
be 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
forceful 
Security 
Council 
resolution, 
and 
what 
better 
way 
for 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
celebrate 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
than 
to 
react 
energetically 
to 
that 
attitude? 
Refusing 
to 
allow 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
do 
so 
was 
disgraceful. 
36. 
There 
was 
a 
need 
for 
real 
political 
will, 
so 
that 
an 
end 
might 
be 
put 
to 
the 
double 
standards 
in 
nuclear-related 
matters. 
Only 
so 
would 
the 
Middle 
East 
become 
a 
region 
of 
peace 
and 
security 
for 
all. 
37. 
Cuba 
supported 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
2008 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
38. 
Mr. 
ARSHAD 
(Malaysia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
strongly 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
speedy 
establishment 
of 
a 
WMD-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487(1981), 
paragraph 
14 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
687(1991) 
and 
the 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
Pending 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone, 
Malaysia, 
as 
the 
current 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Conference, 
called 
on 
Israel, 
which 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
was 
not 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
which 
had 
not 
expressed 
an 
intention 
to 
become 
one, 
to 
renounce 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay. 
It 
also 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
promptly 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487(1981) 
and 
to 
conduct 
its 
nuclear-related 
activities 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
39. 
Malaysia 
considered 
it 
important 
that 
the 
General 
Conference, 
in 
its 
current 
session, 
appropriately 
reflect 
the 
concerns 
of 
Member 
States 
about 
the 
nuclear 
capabilities 
of 
Israel 
and 
the 
threat 
which 
they 
posed 
to 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Also, 
it 
supported 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group 
for 
the 
inclusion 
of 
the 
item 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
in 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
2008 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
40. 
Mr. 
DUQUE 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
very 
concerned 
at 
the 
continuing 
refusal 
of 
Israel 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
despite 
repeated 
calls 
from 
the 
international 
community. 
His 
countryÂs 
concern 
had 
grown 
considerably 
in 
December 
2006, 
when 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
admitted 
publicly 
that 
Israel 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons. 
41. 
The 
world 
could 
not 
remain 
indifferent 
to 
the 
knowledge 
that 
a 
State 
which 
had 
for 
decades 
been 
disregarding 
United 
Nations 
resolutions 
and 
the 
basic 
rights 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
was 
conducting 
an 
advanced 
nuclear 
programme 
not 
subject 
to 
any 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Nor 
could 
the 
world 
ignore 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
State 
capable 
of 
attacking 
a 
neighbour, 
Lebanon, 
in 
open 
violation 
of 
the 
basic 
principles 
of 
international 
humanitarian 
law 
was 
in 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
without 
specialized 
multilateral 
controls. 
42. 
It 
was 
contradictory 
that 
certain 
Member 
States 
which 
claimed 
to 
be 
defenders 
of 
freedom 
and 
justice 
refused 
to 
deplore 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
State 
with 
a 
history 
of 
aggression 
within 
its 
region 
had 
a 
nuclear 
programme 
outside 
international 
law.

43. 
Mr. 
WIBOWO 
(Indonesia) 
said 
that 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
continued 
to 
be 
a 
matter 
of 
deep 
concern 
to 
his 
country. 
The 
region 
remained 
unsettled 
despite 
many 
efforts, 
and 
the 
conflict 
there 
continued 
to 
pose 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
IsraelÂs 
military 
actions, 
which 
Indonesia 
strongly 
condemned, 
constituted 
a 
flagrant 
violation 
of 
international 
law, 
and 
the 
international 
community 
should 
take 
measures 
to 
halt 
them. 
The 
invasion 
by 
Israel 
of 
another 
Middle 
East 
country 
had 
not 
only 
caused 
material 
damage 
and 
civilian 
casualties, 
but 
also 
undermined 
regional 
security 
and 
stability. 
44. 
The 
situation 
was 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
installations 
with 
no 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
outside 
international 
control. 
That 
was 
likely 
to 
lead 
to 
a 
destructive 
arms 
race, 
and 
was 
having 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
proliferation 
in 
the 
region. 
45. 
In 
recent 
years, 
a 
number 
of 
countries 
had 
made 
efforts 
to 
raise 
the 
issue 
in 
the 
General 
Conference. 
Thus 
far 
their 
efforts 
had 
not 
been 
fruitful, 
however, 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
made 
no 
progress 
under 
his 
mandate 
relating 
to 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
1995 
and 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences 
had 
requested 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
as 
early 
as 
possible, 
and 
Indonesia 
strongly 
believed 
that 
IsraelÂs 
accession 
and 
the 
placing 
of 
all 
of 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
were 
the 
most 
critical 
steps 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
confidence 
and 
security 
there. 
46. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
pay 
serious 
attention 
to 
and 
take 
action 
on 
the 
issue. 
One 
single 
country 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
prevent 
the 
establishment, 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
of 
the 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
that 
was 
desired 
by 
all 
other 
countries 
in 
that 
region. 
The 
General 
Conference 
should 
take 
appropriate 
measures 
to 
ensure 
that 
Israel 
placed 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT, 
as 
called 
upon 
to 
do 
in 
a 
number 
of 
General 
Assembly 
and 
General 
Conference 
resolutions. 
47. 
Considering 
how 
long 
the 
issue 
had 
been 
on 
the 
General 
Conference 
agenda, 
an 
agreement 
should 
have 
been 
reached 
by 
now. 
For 
its 
part, 
Indonesia 
would 
support 
any 
resolutions 
or 
decisions 
that 
illuminated 
a 
pathway 
towards 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
creation 
there 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
48. 
Mr. 
ZARKA 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
some 
delegates 
had 
lied 
about 
a 
statement 
made 
by 
his 
countryÂs 
Prime 
Minister, 
who 
had 
not 
said 
what 
they 
claimed 
he 
had. 
49. 
All 
delegates 
should 
bear 
in 
mind 
that 
the 
name 
of 
his 
country 
was 
the 
State 
of 
Israel, 
or 
simply 
Israel, 
and 
that 
those 
who 
had 
called 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
his 
country 
had 
no 
moral 
standing 
when 
they 
criticized 
policies 
of 
Israel 
aimed 
at 
defending 
its 
very 
existence. 
50. 
Mr. 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
it 
was 
strange 
that 
the 
Israeli 
Prime 
Minister 
had 
acknowledged 
his 
countryÂs 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
but 
that 
his 
statement 
was 
now 
being 
denied. 
The 
only 
practical 
way 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
discover 
the 
truth 
was 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
send 
inspectors 
to 
Israel; 
they 
could 
verify 
the 
situation 
and 
their 
findings 
could 
be 
reported 
to 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
its 
next 
session. 
The 
claims 
being 
made 
were 
confusing 
the 
international 
community. 
NAM, 
which 
represented 
over 
100 
countries 
and 
many 
millions 
of 
people, 
had 
expressed 
serious 
concern 
about 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
by 
Israel 
and 
its 
non-accession 
to 
the 
NPT. 
The 
matter 
should 
be 
resolved 
through 
Agency 
access 
to 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
activities.

Oral 
report 
by 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of

61. 
Ms. 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria), 
Chairperson

which 
was 
endorsed

General 
Conference 
at 
its 
forty-
seventh

as 
across 
all 
major

and 
that

taking 
into

the 
voluntary

of 
the

of 
paragraph

ÂEncourages

She 
recommended 
that 
the

adopt 
the

contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/COM.5/L.1/Rev.1 
with 
the 
amendments 
which 
she 
had 
just 
presented. 
64. 
Turning 
to 
item

ÂStrengthening

As 
recommended 
by 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole, 
the 
draft

in

67. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt) 
requested 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.1. 
68. 
Mr. 
BILAL 
(Pakistan) 
requested 
that 
a 
vote 
on 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
be 
taken 
before 
a 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
a 
whole. 
69. 
Mr. 
LUNBY 
(Norway) 
pointed 
out 
that 
the 
title 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
in 
document 
GC(51)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.1 
did 
not 
correspond 
fully 
to 
the 
agenda 
item. 
It 
should 
read 
ÂStrengthening 
the 
Effectiveness 
and 
Improving 
the 
Efficiency 
of 
the 
Safeguards 
System 
and 
Application 
of 
the 
Model 
Additional 
ProtocolÂ. 
70. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
recalling 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
request 
for 
a 
separate 
vote 
on 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
put 
that 
paragraph 
to 
a 
vote 
by 
show 
of 
hands. 
71. 
There 
were 
81 
votes 
in 
favour 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
and 
3 
against, 
with 
no 
abstentions. 
The 
paragraph 
was 
adopted. 
72. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
founder 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
had 
always 
supported 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Statute. 
India 
had 
always 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities 
and 
had 
made 
constructive 
contributions 
to 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
had 
approached 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
in 
that 
spirit. 
The 
value 
and 
success 
of 
the 
Agency 
lay 
in 
the 
meticulous 
manner 
in 
which 
it 
operated 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
mandate 
without 
being 
influenced 
by 
extraneous 
issues. 
73. 
Until 
2000, 
there 
had 
consistently 
been 
consensus 
on 
the 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
on 
safeguards. 
In 
2001, 
however, 
an 
operative 
paragraph 
had 
been 
added 
whose 
language 
contradicted 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
chapeau 
to 
the 
operative 
part 
of 
the 
resolution, 
which 
had 
been 
the 
product 
of 
difficult 
negotiations. 
In 
urging 
all 
States 
to 
bring 
into 
force 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
ignored 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
agreements 
flowed 
from 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
It 
therefore 
appeared 
to 
impose 
the 
same 
obligations 
on 
non-parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
as 
on 
parties, 
which 
was 
unfair. 
The 
signing 
of 
treaties 
was 
a 
sovereign 
decision 
by 
States. 
IndiaÂs 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
did 
not 
impose 
on 
his 
country 
any 
obligation 
not 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Statute. 
Any 
resolution 
conflicting 
with 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Statute 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
his 
country. 
74. 
Despite 
IndiaÂs 
readiness 
to 
work 
out 
a 
compromise, 
the 
operative 
paragraph 
had 
continued 
to 
appear 
in 
successive 
draft 
resolutions 
on 
safeguards 
without 
change 
since 
2001. 
75. 
Mr. 
BILAL 
(Pakistan), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
consistently 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
assigned 
functions 
and 
responsibilities 
in 
a 
credible 
manner 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Statute 
and 
legal 
authority. 
That 
had

draft 
resolution

been 
manifested 
in 
the 
faithful 
implementation 
by 
Pakistan 
of 
its 
safeguards 
undertakings 
and 
in 
the 
cooperation 
it 
extended 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard. 


76. 
Pakistan 
had 
always 
sought 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
consensus 
text 
for 
resolutions 
like 
the 
one 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.1. 
However, 
the 
language 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
failed 
to 
recognize 
the 
differentiated 
nature 
of 
the 
safeguards 
obligations 
of 
Member 
States. 
His 
countryÂs 
vote 
represented 
the 
commitment 
of 
Pakistan 
to 
upholding 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
in 
every 
respect, 
and 
Pakistan 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
positive 
and 
constructive 
role 
in 
the 
furtherance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives. 
77. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
recalling 
the 
request 
for 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
made 
by 
the 
delegate 
of 
Egypt, 
put 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/COM.5/L.12/Rev.1 
to 
the 
vote. 
78. 
Mauritius, 
having 
been 
drawn 
by 
lot 
by 
the 
President, 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
vote 
first. 
In 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
representative 
of 
Mauritius, 
the 
voting 
started 
with 
Mexico. 
79. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
was 
as 
follows: 
In 
favour: 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Afghanistan, 
Albania,

80. 
There 
were 
80 
votes 
in 
favour 
and 
none 
against, 
with 
12 
abstentions. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
was 
adopted. 
81. 
Mr. 
FAWZY 
(Egypt), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
which 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
meetings 
of 
the 
working 
group 
that 
had 
produced 
the 
draft 
resolution 
just 
voted 
on, 
had 
done 
so 
on 
the 
understanding 
that 
their 
objective 
would 
be 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
consensual 
agreement 
on 
substantive 
issues 
on 
which 
diverging 
views 
continued 
to 
exist. 
82. 
Egypt 
had 
presented 
to 
the 
working 
group 
three 
proposals 
which 
it, 
and 
others, 
considered 
to 
be 
of 
direct 
relevance 
to 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
draft 
under 
consideration. 
One 
proposal 
had 
been 
to 
refer 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
strengthening 
safeguards. 
The 
second 
proposal 
had 
been 
to 
reflect 
the 
language 
of 
Article 
III.B.1 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
by 
referring 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
conducting 
its 
activities 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
purposes 
and 
principles 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
and 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
policies 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
furthering 
the 
establishment 
of 
safeguarded 
worldwide 
disarmament. 
The 
third 
proposal, 
recalling 
one 
of 
the 
thirteen 
steps 
agreed 
to 
by 
consensus 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
Final 
Document 
of 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
had 
been 
to 
refer 
to 
arrangements 
by 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
place 
fissile 
material

designated 
by 
them 
as 
no 
longer 
required 
for 
military 
purposes 
under 
Agency 
or 
other 
relevant 
international 
verification. 


83. 
All 
three 
proposals, 
though 
supported 
and 
viewed 
as 
valuable 
additions 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution 
by 
a 
number 
of 
delegations, 
had 
been 
rejected 
outright 
by 
others. 
Such 
rejection 
had 
demonstrated 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
sponsors 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
was 
to 
create 
a 
consensus 
on 
additions 
and 
amendments 
put 
forward 
by 
them 
while 
rejecting 
substantive 
ideas 
proposed 
by 
others, 
rather 
than 
to 
accommodate 
all 
positions 
in 
a 
consensual 
manner, 
particularly 
as 
regards 
issues 
of 
substance. 
As 
a 
result, 
the 
text 
just 
voted 
on 
was 
not 
balanced 
or 
consensual 
and 
did 
not 
adequately 
reflect 
the 
views 
of 
the 
Egyptian 
delegation. 
84. 
Furthermore, 
the 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)/L.1, 
ÂApplication 
of 
IAEA 
Safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
EastÂ, 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
inconsistency 
in 
the 
positions 
held 
by 
the 
sponsors 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(51)COM.5/L.12/Rev.1, 
except 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Ireland. 
It 
was 
incomprehensible 
that 
delegations 
could, 
on 
one 
hand, 
call 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
safeguards 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
oppose 
or 
abstain 
on 
a 
draft 
resolution 
whose 
objective 
was 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
85. 
Egypt 
was 
keen 
to 
support 
all 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
Agency 
safeguards. 
However, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
very 
safeguards 
which 
Member 
States 
were 
trying 
to 
strengthen 
were 
not 
being 
applied 
to 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
could 
not 
be 
ignored. 
The 
situation 
was 
a 
regrettable 
one 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
changed. 
86. 
Mr. 
MINTY 
(South 
Africa), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
working 
group 
discussions 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
just 
voted 
on 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
compromise, 
and 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
that 
context, 
it 
had 
supported 
EgyptÂs 
proposal 
regarding 
a 
reference 
to 
Article 
III.B.1 
of 
the 
Statute. 
Given 
the 
opposition 
to 
that 
proposal 
in 
the 
working 
group, 
it 
had 
made 
a 
proposal 
regarding 
recognition 
of 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
safeguarding 
of 
material 
previously 
devoted 
to 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes 
that 
had 
been 
irreversibly 
transferred 
to 
safeguarded 
peaceful 
uses 
Â 
a 
proposal 
that 
had 
unfortunately 
not 
been 
accepted. 
It 
was 
disappointing 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
just 
voted 
on 
did 
not 
address 
that 
very 
important 
matter 
and 
the 
lessons 
learned 
from 
disarmament 
processes 
which 
had 
impacted 
positively 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
87. 
Despite 
the 
inadequacies 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
his 
delegation 
had 
voted 
for 
it 
in 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
failure 
to 
reflect 
an 
important 
provision 
of 
the 
Statute 
would 
be 
rectified 
at 
the 
2008 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
88. 
Mr. 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that, 
while 
his 
country 
supported 
the 
general 
thrust 
of 
and 
many 
principles 
reflected 
in 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
it 
had 
abstained 
because 
the 
negotiations 
on 
some 
paragraphs 
had 
been 
inconclusive. 
That 
had 
resulted 
from 
time 
constraints 
and 
the 
uncompromising 
positions 
of 
some 
working 
group 
members. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
compromised 
on 
some 
of 
its 
main 
positions 
and 
other 
NAM 
members 
had 
also 
shown 
great 
flexibility 
on 
some 
critical 
paragraphs, 
but 
that 
had 
not 
been 
reciprocated 
by 
certain 
other 
countries. 
Developments 
during 
discussions 
on 
some 
agenda 
items 
related 
to 
the 
one 
now 
under 
consideration 
had 
had 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
atmosphere 
in 
which 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
been 
negotiated. 
89. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
more 
time 
and 
energy 
would 
be 
devoted 
to 
discussing 
the 
draft 
resolution 
on 
safeguards 
in 
the 
coming 
year 
and 
that 
sufficient 
flexibility 
and 
understanding 
would 
be 
shown 
by 
all 
delegations, 
so 
that 
a 
solid 
compromise 
might 
be 
reached. 
The 
cause 
of 
strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
should 
be 
supported 
across 
all 
political 
groupings, 
and 
more 
should 
be 
done 
in 
order 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
compromise.

90. 
That 
having 
been 
said, 
his 
delegation 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
chairman 
of 
the 
working 
group 
for 
his 
efforts. 
91. 
Mr. 
BILAL 
(Pakistan), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
always 
supported 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
assigned 
responsibilities, 
including 
safeguards 
within 
its 
statutory 
mandate. 
Despite 
having 
serious 
objections 
to 
one 
of 
the 
draft 
resolutionÂs 
operative 
paragraphs, 
Pakistan 
had 
refrained 
from 
voting 
against 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
a 
whole. 
In 
a 
spirit 
of 
compromise, 
his 
country 
had 
voted 
for 
it. 
92. 
Unfortunately, 
it 
had 
not 
been 
possible 
to 
address 
some 
delegatesÂ 
concerns 
during 
negotiations 
on 
the 
text. 
93. 
The 
vote 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
a 
whole, 
while 
regrettable, 
had 
underscored 
the 
fact 
that 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
should 
reflect 
the 
common 
interests 
and 
positions 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
membership. 
94. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
vote 
would 
not 
set 
a 
precedent 
with 
regard 
to 
future 
draft 
resolutions 
on 
safeguards, 
but 
mark 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
genuine 
process 
of 
negotiation 
and 
consensus-building. 
95. 
The 
objective 
should 
be 
to 
take 
account 
of 
the 
concerns 
of 
all 
Member 
States, 
including 
those 
which 
had 
in 
the 
past 
felt 
constrained 
to 
request 
a 
vote 
on 
one 
operative 
paragraph. 
The 
next 
draft 
resolution 
on 
safeguards 
should 
reflect 
the 
collective 
commitment 
of 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
the 
Statute 
and 
the 
safeguards 
functions 
of 
the 
Agency. 
96. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India) 
said 
that, 
as 
in 
preceding 
years, 
his 
country 
would 
have 
agreed 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
without 
a 
vote. 
His 
delegation 
regretted 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
been 
put 
to 
a 
vote. 
In 
voting 
for 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
it 
had 
adhered 
to 
its 
position 
of 
preceding 
years. 
97. 
Ms. 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote, 
said 
that 
her 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
NPT, 
to 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
98. 
Her 
country, 
like 
other 
Arab 
countries, 
was 
disappointed 
at 
the 
lack 
of 
balance 
during 
discussions 
on 
issues 
of 
interest 
to 
them. 
The 
refusal 
to 
allow 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
purely 
procedural 
declaration 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
under 
the 
agenda 
item 
entitled 
ÂIsraeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threatÂ 
pointed 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
consideration 
for 
the 
expectations 
of 
the 
Arab 
Member 
States, 
which 
had 
demonstrated 
flexibility 
and 
a 
spirit 
of 
compromise. 
99. 
The 
General 
Conference 
should 
take 
account 
of 
the 
legitimate 
concerns 
of 
all 
Member 
States 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
cooperation 
and 
dialogue, 
which 
were 
vital 
in 
matters 
relating 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security.

Report 
on 
contributions 
pledged 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2008 
(GOV/2007/28/Rev.4) 


100. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
document 
GOV/2007/28/Rev.4 
contained 
details 
of 
pledges 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2008 
which 
governments 
had 
made 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
by 
8.00 
p.m. 
on 
20 
September 
2007. 
By 
that 
time, 
Member 
States 
had 
pledged 
a 
total 
of 
US 
$7 
272 
647, 
or 
9.09% 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2008. 
That 
was 
10% 
higher 
than 
the 
percentage 
of

pledges 
received 
by 
the 
corresponding 
time 
in 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Since 
the 
document 
had 
been 
sent 
for 
printing, 
further 
Member 
States 
had 
communicated 
pledges 
to 
the 
Director 
General: 
Brazil 
had 
pledged 
$500 
000, 
China 
had 
pledged 
$2 
058 
400, 
Cyprus 
had 
pledged 
$33 
600 
and 
Jordan 
had 
pledged 
$9 
600. 
That 
brought 
the 
total 
amount 
pledged 
to 
$9 
874 
247, 
or 
12.34% 
of 
the 
target. 


101. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
make 
their 
2008 
pledges 
and 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
in 
full 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
might 
submit 
a 
proposed 
2008 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
the 
Technical 
Assistance 
and 
Cooperation 
Committee 
in 
November 
based 
on 
the 
level 
of 
pledges 
received, 
and 
thereafter 
implement 
the 
approved 
programme 
without 
hindrance 
or 
uncertainty. 
Â 
Closing 
of 
the 
session 
102. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
current 
General 
Conference 
session 
had 
been 
particularly 
well 
attended 
by 
high-level 
representatives 
of 
Member 
States. 
There 
had 
been 
46 
ministerial-level 
delegations 
and 
107 
speakers 
in 
the 
general 
debate, 
which 
was 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
importance 
Member 
States 
attached 
to 
the 
Agency's 
work. 
103. 
Mr. 
MINTY 
(South 
Africa), 
commending 
the 
President 
for 
his 
leadership 
in 
bringing 
the 
session 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion, 
said 
that 
he 
had 
been 
instrumental 
in 
reconciling 
divergent 
views 
and 
had 
forged 
a 
common 
understanding 
of 
how 
to 
take 
forward 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
year 
to 
come. 
104. 
Also, 
he 
paid 
tribute 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
for 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
she 
had 
guided 
the 
CommitteeÂs 
deliberations 
and 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
dedication 
and 
professionalism 
in 
preparing 
the 
session. 
105. 
Mr. 
DUARTE 
(Portugal), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
thanked 
the 
President 
for 
successfully 
guiding 
the 
fifty-first 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference; 
his 
well-known 
diplomatic 
skills 
had 
greatly 
contributed 
to 
the 
outcome. 
106. 
He 
also 
thanked 
the 
Vice-Presidents, 
the 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee, 
the 
Chairperson 
and 
Vice-Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole, 
and 
the 
chairmen 
of 
the 
working 
groups 
established 
during 
the 
session. 
107. 
He 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
professionalism 
in 
preparing 
the 
session 
and 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
Austria 
and 
the 
Austrian 
authorities 
for 
hosting 
the 
General 
Conference. 
108. 
Mr. 
ELAMIN 
(Sudan), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Group 
of 
77 
and 
China, 
commended 
the 
President 
for 
his 
efforts 
in 
bringing 
the 
session 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion. 
109. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
for 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
she 
had 
guided 
the 
CommitteeÂs 
work 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
tireless 
efforts 
to 
promote 
development 
in 
the 
world. 
110. 
Mr. 
GUMBI 
(South 
Africa), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
African 
Group, 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
PresidentÂs 
efforts 
in 
bringing 
the 
session 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion. 
The 
resolutions 
and 
decisions 
adopted 
would 
have 
a 
positive 
impact 
on 
Africa, 
and 
the 
African 
Group 
looked 
forward 
to 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
in 
their 
full 
implementation.

111. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Vice-Presidents 
and 
the 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
and 
commended 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the

for 
her 
untiring

112. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Vienna 
Chapter 
of 
the 
Non-
Aligned 
Movement, 
commended 
the 
President 
for 
his 
efforts, 
dedication 
and 
leadership 
and 
expressed 
gratitude 
to 
the 
Chairperson 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole. 
The 
output 
of 
the 
session 
would 
undoubtedly 
help 
to 
promote 
lasting 
peace 
and 
greater 
international 
security. 
113. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
thanking 
the 
preceding 
speakers 
for 
their 
kind 
words, 
said 
that 
it 
had 
been 
an 
honour 
and 
a 
privilege 
for 
him 
and 
his 
country 
that 
he 
had 
been 
elected 
to 
serve 
as 
President 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
its 
fifty-first 
session. 
He 
was 
very 
grateful 
to 
the 
Vice-Presidents, 
who 
had 
assisted 
him 
during 
the 
general 
debate, 
and 
to 
all 
delegates 
for 
their 
cooperation 
and 
assistance, 
which 
had 
enabled 
the 
problems 
encountered 
during 
the 
conduct 
of 
business 
to 
be 
resolved. 
114. 
On 
behalf 
of 
the 
Conference, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Austrian 
authorities 
and 
the 
City 
of 
Vienna 
for 
their 
hospitality 
over 
the 
previous 
week. 
He 
also 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff 
for 
their 
valuable 
support. 
115. 
Finally, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
48 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
and 
in 
commemoration 
of 
the 
International 
Day 
of 
Peace 
being 
celebrated 
that 
day, 
he 
invited 
the 
Conference 
to 
observe 
one 
minute 
of 
silence 
dedicated 
to 
prayer 
or 
meditation. 
All 
present 
rose 
and 
stood 
in 
silence 
for 
one 
minute. 


116. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
declared 
the 
fifty-first 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
closed. 
The 
meeting 
rose
