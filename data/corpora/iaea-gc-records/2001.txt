RESTORATION OF IRAQÂS VOTING RIGHTS (resumed) 

1. The PRESIDENT reminded the Conference of the General CommitteeÂs 
recommendation that IraqÂs voting rights not be restored on the grounds that its failure to pay 
the amount necessary to prevent the application of Article XIX of the Statute was not due to 
conditions beyond its control. He noted that some delegations had expressed reservations 
regarding that recommendation. 
2. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that his Government sincerely wished to pay its 
contributions to all international organizations and, since 1994, it had repeatedly petitioned 
the United Nations to be allowed to pay its contributions in local currency. On 6 June 1999, 
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iraq had sent a letter to the United Nations Secretary 
General requesting that Iraq be allowed to pay its financial contributions from the revenue 
accruing from oil exports under the Âoil for foodÂ arrangement, but that request had been 
turned down by the Security Council owing to United States opposition. Thus, his country 
was clearly being prevented from paying its contributions by conditions beyond its control, 
and he therefore requested that the General CommitteeÂs unfair and biased recommendation 
be put to the vote. 
3. Mr. DELHAYE (Belgium), speaking on behalf of the European Union and 
associated States, expressed support for the General CommitteeÂs recommendation that IraqÂs 
voting rights not be restored. Iraq had failed to meet key criteria for the restoration of voting 
rights set out in document GC(42)/10; notably, it had failed to provide an indication of 
specific measures taken to wipe out its arrears, e.g. by a schedule of proposed payments. 
4. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that her country supported the General 
CommitteeÂs recommendation since there was no evidence that Iraq was not in a position to 
pay its contributions. Moreover, the criteria and guidelines set out in document GC(42)/10 
were not applicable to Iraq. 
5. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote, by a show of hands, on the 
General CommitteeÂs recommendation that IraqÂs right to vote at the current session of the 
General Conference not be restored. 
6. There were 49 votes in favour of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation and 
6 against, with 28 abstentions. The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 
RELATING TO IRAQ 
(GC(45)/18, GC(45)/L.1 and Add.1) 

7. Mr. DELHAYE (Belgium), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(45)/L.1 on behalf of the European Union and associated States, said that the Agency had 
not been in a position to carry out its mandate in Iraq under the relevant Security Council 
resolutions for 32 months and was therefore unable to provide any assurance regarding IraqÂs 
compliance with its obligations. The draft resolution called on Iraq to implement the relevant 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 6 

Security Council resolutions in full, and to co-operate fully with the Agency and provide it 
with the access it needed to carry out its mandate. 

8. Mr. KVOK (Russian Federation) said that his delegation would abstain in any 
vote on the draft resolution because some of its provisions remained unbalanced, despite 
efforts to improve its wording compared with the corresponding resolution adopted at the 
preceding session. In particular, operative paragraph 2 called upon Iraq to co-operate fully 
with the Agency and to provide access to sites. To his knowledge, Iraq had never refused to 
collaborate with the Agency, as was borne out by the Director GeneralÂs report. Moreover, 
inspectors had not been denied access to sites in connection with the carrying out of the 
AgencyÂs mandate. He also failed to see the need to refer, in operative paragraph 4, to the 
investigation of remaining questions and concerns, since recent reports by the Director 
General had stated clearly that those questions could easily be addressed in the context of the 
long-term monitoring regime. His country also had difficulties with operative paragraph 3 
concerning the revision of the list of items and technology to which the export/import 
mechanism applied. 
9. The Russian Federation remained convinced that co-operation with Iraq in the areas of 
disarmament and monitoring under the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions 
could only be restored through a political settlement. It was actively promoting such a 
settlement, first and foremost through consultations in the Security Council; and it had 
proposed a package approach, which it viewed as the optimal solution, whereby the 
restoration of international monitoring would go hand in hand with the lifting of sanctions. 
The Agency would then be in a position to carry out its mandate in Iraq in full. 
10. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) thanked those delegations which had voted against the 
recommendation not to restore IraqÂs voting rights, or which had abstained. 
11. His delegation saw no point in placing the agenda item under consideration on the 
agenda of each session, since it led to a specious and unproductive debate. Iraq had fulfilled 
its obligations set forth in paragraphs 12 and 13 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), as 
had been confirmed by the Director General in paragraph 31 of his report to the Security 
Council appended to document GOV/INF/1999/4, which stated that the AgencyÂs verification 
activities had revealed no indication that Iraq possessed nuclear weapons or retained any 
practical capability for the production of nuclear material. The question of IraqÂs 
implementation of Security Council resolutions was thus a political rather than a technical 
issue and was being used as blackmail by two permanent members of the Security Council. 
12. Iraq was honouring its obligations under its safeguards agreement with the Agency and 
had repeatedly urged the Agency to restore normal relations. A team of Agency inspectors 
had visited Iraq in 2000 and 2001 to verify the physical inventory of nuclear material, and the 
Agency had expressed its satisfaction with the results of those inspections in letters to the 
Security Council. Moreover, in the report before the Conference (GC(45)/18), the Director 
General stated that Iraq had provided the co-operation necessary for the inspection team to 
perform its activities effectively and efficiently. The issue of the implementation of Security 
Council resolutions, under which the Agency had fulfilled its limited mandate, should not be 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 7 

confused with the issue of IraqÂs co-operation with the Agency under its safeguards 
agreement. He urged the Agency to report frankly to the Security Council that it had fulfilled 
the technical mandate assigned to it by the Council and its Statute, a mandate in which 
political stratagems had no place. 

13. The draft resolution was a politically motivated document that formed part of the 
campaign by the United States and the United Kingdom to maintain the embargo and their 
daily military attacks on the people of Iraq. Security Council resolution 1284 (1999) was 
unacceptable because its purpose was to harm the Iraqi people and prevent the lifting of the 
embargo, which was contrary to international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Moreover, the majority of the permanent members 
of the Security Council had expressed reservations regarding its provisions. 
14. Preambular paragraph (d) made no mention of developments during the period 1991 to 
1998, when the Agency had failed to find any evidence that Iraq was not honouring its 
obligations. As indicated by its reports to the Security Council, the Agency knew full well 
that Iraq currently possessed no nuclear material or facilities. 
15. Preambular paragraph (e) acknowledged IraqÂs co-operation with the Agency in 
connection with the physical inventory verification the latter had carried out, noting however 
that that activity could not serve as a substitute for Agency activities designed to provide the 
assurances sought by the Security Council; yet the objective of both bodies was to ensure that 
Iraq did not possess nuclear material and facilities, in accordance with the safeguards 
agreement. 
16. Operative paragraph 3 called for the adoption of a revised list of dual-use items and 
technology. However, that list was opposed by a large number of countries because it fell 
into the category of so-called Âsmart sanctionsÂ designed to maintain the embargo and prolong 
the suffering of the Iraqi people. 
17. From operative paragraph 6 it would appear that the United States and the United 
Kingdom intended to resume their previous base endeavours to use the former United Nations 
Special Commission as a tool for espionage against Iraq by seeking to exploit the Agency for 
the same purpose. He warned the sponsors of the draft resolution that the paragraph in 
question would entail an additional financial burden that would no doubt ultimately be borne 
by the Iraqi people. 
18. For the above reasons, he rejected the draft resolution and requested that it be put to a 
vote. 
19. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that no Member State of the United Nations was 
entitled to pick and choose among Security Council resolutions, describing some as 
unacceptable. Article 25 of the Charter of the United Nations required Member States to 
comply with all decisions of the Security Council. It was not enough for Iraq to claim that it 
had complied with its safeguards agreement. The safeguards regime did not provide 
comprehensive coverage and was no substitute for Security Council resolutions. Kuwait was 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 8 

seriously concerned over the suspension of Agency activities in Iraq and insisted on the need 
for Agency inspection teams to return there as soon as possible. It also supported the 
AgencyÂs continuing co-operation with UNMOVIC in the implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1284. 

20. Mr. WULF (United States of America) noted with concern that, since 1998 when 
Iraq had prohibited the Agency from conducting inspections, the Director General had 
consistently stated that the Agency could not provide any assurance that Iraq was in 
compliance with its United Nations-mandated disarmament obligations. Nevertheless, the 
organization had rightly maintained its readiness to resume those activities at short notice. 
Upon its return to Iraq, it would have to focus on what had been done there since 1998; and 
the longer Iraq delayed that return, the greater would be the time needed to re-establish a 
baseline of knowledge. 
21. Security Council resolution 1284 had provided Iraq with a way forward towards lifting 
of the sanctions. Unfortunately, it had not chosen to accept that opportunity. The Security 
Council had made serious efforts to improve the welfare of the Iraqi people, despite IraqÂs 
rejection of its obligations. The United Kingdom had submitted a draft resolution to the 
Council which, were it adopted, would introduce a new trade system for Iraq ending sanctions 
on purely civilian goods. That might help persuade the Government of Iraq that suspension 
and lifting of sanctions was only possible if Iraq complied. Furthermore, putting in place a 
goods review list, as the draft resolution proposed, was the most effective means of addressing 
concerns about the rearmament of Iraq as long as the latter continued to reject the return of 
United Nations weapons inspectors. 
22. The United States was in favour of full implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1284 and it would continue to support the IAEA Action Team. He urged other 
Member States to do likewise. Overwhelming support for the draft resolution under 
discussion seemed more important than ever under the current circumstances. 
23. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that the resolution would have destructive 
implications for the Iraqi people who had been subject to an unjust embargo for 11 years. Iraq 
had implemented resolution 687. Moreover, the inspection team had left voluntarily in 1998, 
not because Iraq had requested it to but in preparation for the aggression. During the 
aggression, all the inspection equipment had been destroyed. Thus, Iraq had respected its 
commitments. However, had the United States fulfilled its commitments to alleviate the 
suffering of the Iraqi people? He also noted the lack of interest in implementing Security 
Council resolutions relating to IsraelÂs nuclear programme. 
24. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote, by a show of hands, on the draft 
resolution. 
25. There were 57 votes in favour and none against, with 31 abstentions. The resolution 
was adopted. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 9 

26. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that Iraq should fulfil all its obligations under 
Security Council resolutions and co-operate fully with the Agency. However, more effort 
should have been put into producing a draft resolution which could have been adopted by 
consensus. The issue was one to which Egypt attached particular importance in the light of 
the fact that operative paragraph 14 of resolution 687 made it clear that IraqÂs compliance 
constituted a first step towards the setting up of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East. Finally, the need to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people should be taken into 
consideration. 
27. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China), said that the failure to resolve the Iraq issue had 
exacerbated the humanitarian crisis in the country and had undermined peace and stability in 
the region. China sympathized with the sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by the sanctions 
and the bombardment by the United States and the United Kingdom. He called for an end to 
the indiscriminate use of force and the violation of IraqÂs sovereignty, an objective review of 
IraqÂs progress towards the compliance with Security Council resolutions, and the mitigation 
and lifting of the sanctions against Iraq at the earliest possible opportunity. Though the 
authority of the Security Council had to be upheld, so did the basic norms of international 
relations, including IraqÂs sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. 
28. Mr. AL-BESBAS (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), drawing attention to the sixth 
preambular paragraph and operative paragraphs 17, 19 and 29 of Security Council 
resolution 1284, appealed to the international community to lift the embargo against Iraq and 
grant the Iraqi people access to food, health care and education, which all United Nations 
specialized agencies recognized as the rights of all peoples. 
APPOINTMENT OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR 
(GC(45)/27) 

29. The PRESIDENT said that in September 1995, the General Conference, on the 
recommendation of the Board of Governors, had appointed the Comptroller and Auditor 
General of the United Kingdom as the AgencyÂs External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs 
accounts for the financial years 1996 and 1997. In September 1997 the appointment had been 
extended for the financial years 1998 and 1999, and in September 1999 it had been extended 
again for the financial years 2000 and 2001. 
30. The tenure of the AgencyÂs External Auditor would end with the completion of the audit 
of the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial year 2001. It would therefore be necessary to 
appoint an External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for 2002 and 2003. Although the 
matter had been considered by the Board of Governors at its June and September sessions, the 
Board had not been able to make a recommendation on the matter to the Conference as it had 
done in the past. Under those circumstances there was no other option but to appoint the 
External Auditor by a vote. 
31. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India) said that his country had nominated the Comptroller 
and Auditor General of India as a candidate for the position of External Auditor of the IAEA, 
in response to the invitation issued and after the Comptroller and Auditor General of the 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 10 

United Kingdom had served three consecutive terms, on the understanding that its detailed 
offer, including estimated costs, would be considered on its own merits and would prevail 
without politicization of the issue or forcing of an unprecedented vote. 

32. IndiaÂs Comptroller and Auditor General had vast experience of auditing in the United 
Nations system, and the offer submitted covered the entire spectrum of auditing outlined in 
the related documents and would bring savings of US $73 000 per year to an organization 
which was constantly under budgetary constraints. Unfortunately, although efficiency and 
cost should have been of primary importance for a technical agency, the discussion so far had 
focused on extraneous issues rather than on the merit of the offer itself. 
33. His country had not intended to press the issue to a vote and had therefore co-operated 
fully with the Chairman of the Board of Governors in his effort to link the post of External 
Auditor of the Agency with that of UNIDO, thus accomplishing a compromise. Those efforts 
had not been successful, and a divisive vote could well undermine the effectiveness of the 
AgencyÂs External Auditor. Therefore, despite having the endorsement of the Group of 77 
and China, which would guarantee success in any election, India had decided to heed the 
sentiment in the Agency that a divisive vote should be avoided and extend its support to the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom. 
34. In conclusion, he thanked the Group of 77 and China for their readiness to vote for India 
in the event of an election, and the Chairman of the Board and the President of the General 
Conference for their efforts. 
35. Mr. JENKINS (United Kingdom) thanked the representative of India for his 
statesmanship and his support for the United Kingdom candidate. He also thanked those 
countries which would have supported the United Kingdom candidate in a vote. A vote 
would not have been in the best interests of the organization nor of the important audit 
function. The United Kingdom Auditor, Sir John Bourn, had sought an extension of his term 
because he believed that continuity would benefit the Agency at a crucial time which would 
see the introduction of biennial budgeting and accounting, and results-based budgeting. He 
and his team would be glad to learn that the Conference had extended their mandate for a 
further two years, and would do everything in their power to give satisfactory service.. 
36. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to appoint the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of the United Kingdom as the External Auditor to audit the 
AgencyÂs accounts for the years 2002 and 2003. 
37. It was so decided. 
APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(GC(45)/19 and Corr.1; GC(45)/L.2 and Add.1) 

38. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(45)/L.2, said that it aimed at promoting confidence-building among States in the region by 
ensuring that all nuclear facilities and activities were subject to comprehensive safeguards, 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 11 

and that all States in the region complied with international treaties relating to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the NPT. Its wording reflected the numerous 
initiatives Egypt had undertaken to set up a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East, and the principles espoused by the international community on numerous 
occasions, in particular the need to ensure universal adherence to the NPT and the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system. He called on the Director General and all Member States, and especially 
Israel -the only country in the region refusing to accede to the NPT and place its facilities 
under comprehensive Agency safeguards - to implement the resolution, which he hoped would 
be adopted by consensus. 

39. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that his country had sponsored the draft resolution 
because it related to nuclear disarmament and implementation of the safeguards system. 
Yemen had signed a safeguards agreement with the Agency in the preceding year and was 
eager to co-operate with the Agency with a view to ensuring peace and security throughout the 
world, especially in the Middle East. 
40. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference was ready to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(45)/L.2 without a vote. 
41. It was so decided. 
42. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his country had first called for 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974. Regrettably, 
Israel had failed to heed that call and the wishes of the international community, even refusing 
to allow the Agency to inspect its nuclear installations. In supporting the draft resolution, his 
country wished to make it clear that such initiatives could not be made subject to prior 
conditions. 
43. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that, although his country had 
supported the draft resolution for the sake of consensus, the text failed to reflect the real 
situation in the Middle East in a number of respects. Firstly, Israel was the only State in the 
region which had not acceded to the NPT and had failed to make its nuclear installations 
subject to the provisions of that Treaty. Secondly, the multilateral working group on arms 
control and regional security had not met since 1994. Thirdly, the ongoing peace negotiations 
in the Middle East had been disrupted because of IsraelÂs aggressive acts towards the 
Palestinian people. Finally, it would have been preferable if the draft resolution had contained 
a paragraph calling on Israel to accede to the NPT as a first step towards commencing 
negotiations genuinely aimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
44. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) said that his country attached enormous importance to the 
establishment of a regional nuclear-weapon-free zone. Accordingly, it had acceded to the 
NPT, subjected its facilities to Agency safeguards and concluded an additional protocol. 
Israel was the only State in the region which had not subjected its nuclear facilities to Agency 
safeguards or to any other international monitoring system. That being so, the resolution the 
Conference had just adopted was not capable of bringing about the desired objectives of 
regional peace and disarmament. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 12 

45. As IsraelÂs closest neighbour, Jordan was particularly vulnerable to the consequences of 
a radiation accident at one of its facilities. He therefore appealed to the Agency and all its 
Member States to step up their efforts to persuade Israel to place its nuclear facilities under 
Agency control. 
46. The fact that Jordan had not signed the Arab Group statement expressing reservations 
regarding the Israeli delegationÂs credentials for the current General Conference reflected its 
profound attachment to the cause of peace for all peoples in the region. 
47. However, like other Arab States, Jordan continued to refuse on principle to accept the 
legitimacy of IsraelÂs annexation of Jerusalem, and to press for the implementation of United 
Nations General Assembly resolution 35/169 of 1980. Finally, he reaffirmed the right of the 
Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State with 
its capital in East Jerusalem. 
48. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his country had joined the consensus on the 
resolution, despite its inherent deficiencies, because it recognized that a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone could contribute to peace, security and arms control in the region. Some elements of the 
resolution ran counter to IsraelÂs policy, and his countryÂs decision not to block consensus on 
it should not be interpreted as an acceptance of all its provisions. Israel had always 
maintained that the nuclear issue, together with all other regional security issues, could only 
be addressed within the framework of the peace process. 
49. A regional nuclear-weapon-free zone had to be supported by all countries in the region 
and could not be imposed on a State. In any regional security and arms control process, the 
security margins of a participating State had to correspond to its perception of the threats to 
which it was exposed, and any decrease in those margins had to be based on mutual steps to 
maintain security. A practical step-by-step approach was the only way forward, beginning 
with confidence- and security-building measures that did not detract from the security margins 
of any regional State, followed by the establishment of peaceful relations and reconciliation. 
Then, in due course, conventional and non-conventional arms control could be addressed. 
Confidence building was a long process, and experience had shown that the way to build 
security was to aim high but to start modestly and move ahead carefully. He hoped that the 
future would bring reconciliation, security and peace in the Middle East. 
ISRAELI NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES AND THREAT 
(GC(45)/10) 

50. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to consultations, it had been agreed that he 
would read out the following statement, which was the result of a delicate compromise: 
ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement made by the President of the thirty-sixth 
session in 1992 concerning the agenda item ÂIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities and ThreatÂ. 
That statement considered it desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 
thirty-seventh session. The General Conference also recalls the statement by the 
President of the forty-third session in 1999 concerning the same agenda item. At the 


GC(45)/OR.10 
page 13 

forty-fourth and forty-fifth sessions, this item was, at the request of certain Member 
States re-inscribed on the agenda. The item was discussed. The President notes that 
certain Member States intend to include this item on the provisional agenda of the 
forty-sixth regular session of the General Conference.Â 

51. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 
52. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were 
important global objectives worldwide, but were of especially pressing importance in the 
Middle East. Egypt had been advocating a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East 
since 1974 and President Mubarak, in 1990, had called explicitly for the establishment of such 
a zone. That initiative had been endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on 
numerous occasions since 1980. Moreover, his country had repeatedly called for the 
application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East, 
which constituted an extremely important step towards regional and global non-proliferation, 
and a preliminary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The fact that 
all Arab countries had placed their nuclear facilities under safeguards demonstrated their full 
confidence in the nuclear non-proliferation system and their positive intentions. 
53. By contrast, not only had Israel not acceded to the NPT, it had never expressed any 
intention of doing so and refused to subject its facilities to international safeguards. The final 
document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had confirmed the extreme importance of 
Israel acceding to the NPT and submitting its nuclear facilities to safeguards. The level of 
agreement in the international community on the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation 
in the Middle East had been an influential element in the decision to extend the NPT 
indefinitely. That being so, it was all the more disappointing to reflect that, owing to the 
political paralysis which had set in, so little tangible progress had been made towards the 
desired objectives. 
54. Despite its strenuous efforts, Egypt still had to contend with the existence of an active 
nuclear programme on its eastern borders which was not subject to any safeguards and which 
posed a threat to the entire region. Failure to summon up the political will to deal with that 
situation could only continue to cast doubt on the capability of the non-proliferation system to 
achieve regional and international peace and contain the existing nuclear arms race, let alone 
rid the region of any new threat that might emerge. It was high time for the international 
community to shoulder its responsibilities in that regard. 
55. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that, as a long-standing signatory of the NPT and 
recent adherent to the AgencyÂs safeguards system, his country had demonstrated its desire to 
see an end to the arms race at both regional and international level. He called upon the 
international community to strengthen its efforts to persuade Israel to take both the above 
steps, for the sake of peace and security in the Middle East. 
56. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that, still mindful of the recent manifestations of manÂs 
capacity for evil which had occurred in the United States, his delegation would exercise 
self-restraint and not respond to the hostile statements that had just been made. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 14 

57. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his country had wished for a draft 
resolution calling on Israel to forego further procurement or possession of nuclear weapons 
and to submit its nuclear installations to international safeguards, which might have been a 
first step towards establishing the climate for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in 
the Middle East. The Presidential statement which had just been adopted made no mention of 
such concerns. The Syrian Arab Republic was disappointed with that result and he called on 
the international community to do away with double standards under the NPT. 
ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

58. Ms. HERNES (Norway), Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole, presented 
the outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 15-20 and 25. All of the draft 
resolutions the Committee was submitting to the Plenary had been adopted in the Committee 
by consensus. In the case of the draft resolution contained in document GC(45)/COM.5/L.10 
on item 18, Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Protocol, the Committee had, however, been unable to 
agree. Moreover, the delegations of Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, 
Norway and Sweden had expressed reservations regarding certain parts of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(45)L.5 on item 16, Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation activities; and the delegations of Austria, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, 
Norway and Sweden had expressed reservations regarding one paragraph of draft resolution F 
contained in document GC(45)/L.6 on item 17, Strengthening of the AgencyÂs activities 
related to nuclear science, technology and applications. Finally, under item 20, Amendment 
to Article VI of the Statute, the Committee had recommended that the Conference take note of 
the information contained in document GC(45)/INF/7. 
59. The PRESIDENT, having congratulated the Chairperson on the manner in which 
she had conducted the CommitteeÂs proceedings, invited the Conference to take up one by one 
the items considered by the Committee of the Whole. 
Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation, transport and 
waste safety (agenda item 15) 

60. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A, B and C 
contained in document GC(45)/L.4 were adopted. 
61. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that he wished to place on record his countryÂs 
belief, expressed during the meetings of the Committee of the Whole, that insufficient 
attention had been paid to the issue of safety of radiation sources, in particular their physical 
security. 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities (agenda item 16) 

62. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(45)/L.5 was adopted. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 15 

63. Mr. STELZER (Austria), speaking also on behalf of Denmark, Ireland, 
Luxembourg and New Zealand, expressed the utmost concern with regard to preambular 
paragraph (f) of the draft resolution contained in GC(45)/L.5. Those countries did not share 
the view put forward in the resolution that nuclear power had great potential for meeting 
energy requirements and did not consider nuclear energy to be an acceptable energy source. 
Rather, they held the view that nuclear energy was incompatible with the objectives of 
sustainable development and that the risks relating to safety, waste management and transport 
remained unresolved. 
64. Those countries also wished to disassociate themselves from the notion that nuclear 
energy contributed to the reduction of greenhouse gases. They welcomed the agreement 
reached at the recent Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change that developed states should refrain from using emission 
reduction units generated from nuclear facilities to meet their commitments under the Kyoto 
Protocol. That decision was in line with their conviction that nuclear power was incompatible 
with the concept of sustainable development. 
65. However, despite their strong reservations, those countries did not wish to block the 
adoption of the resolution in question. 
66. Mr. HÃGBERG (Sweden) said that his country recognized that some others might 
wish to use nuclear power as a part of their national energy supply, provided they had acceded 
to the NPT and fulfilled their obligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management. Nevertheless, Sweden did not consider energy production from nuclear 
fission to be an acceptable option in the context of a long-term, sustainable energy supply 
programme, nor a technology that should be used for greenhouse gas reduction. It could not 
therefore endorse the text of preambular paragraph (f), but had decided not to block the 
adoption of the resolution. 
67. Mr. NORENDAL (Norway) said that he wished to record his countryÂs 
reservations regarding preambular paragraph (f). Norway was not convinced that nuclear 
energy was compatible with sustainable development, nor would it recommend using nuclear 
energy as a means of reducing greenhouse gases. However, it did not wish to block the 
adoption of the resolution by consensus. 
68. Mr. BORCHARD (Germany) said that his country could support the draft 
resolution in principle. However, his Government held the view that nuclear energy should 
not be recognized as making a contribution to sustainable development, and it had 
reservations over preambular paragraph (f) which departed from the wording of the equivalent 
paragraph in the preceding yearÂs resolution. 
69. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that, despite certain reservations, his delegation had 
joined the consensus on the draft resolution. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 16 

Strengthening of the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and 
applications (agenda item 17) 

70. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A, B, C, D, E and F 
contained in document GC(45)/L.6 were adopted. 
71. Mr. STELZER (Austria), also speaking on behalf of Denmark, Ireland, 
Luxembourg and New Zealand, expressed strong reservations regarding preambular 
paragraph (c) of draft resolution F. Although those countries did not wish to stand in the way 
of the resolutionÂs adoption, they did not consider nuclear energy to be an acceptable source of 
energy, and they held the view that nuclear energy was incompatible with the objectives of 
sustainable development and that the risks relating to safety, waste management and transport 
remained unresolved. 
72. Mr. NORENDAL (Norway) said that his country too had reservations regarding 
preambular paragraph (c) of draft resolution F because it did not believe that nuclear energy 
could contribute to sustainable development. However, it did not wish to block consensus on 
the resolution. 
73. Mr. RIMDAP (Nigeria) said that draft resolution D in document GC(45)/L.6, on 
support to the Organization of African UnityÂs Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis 
Eradication Campaign, had initially been discussed under item 16 and had only later been 
clustered under item 17. He requested assurance that the adoption of the resolution under 
item 17 would in no way weaken the implementation of the tsetse control programme by the 
Agency or diminish the resolutionÂs importance. 
74. Mr. NEGERI (Ethiopia) said that his country too felt that the resolution in 
question was more appropriate to item 16 than item 17, since the activity it related to was not 
at the research and development stage but rather at the stage of implementation at continental 
level. 
75. Mr. ALLOTEY (Ghana), Mr. BAKAYOKO (CÃ´te dÂIvoire), Mr. SANON 
(Burkino Faso) and Mr. DIYEZWA (Angola) associated themselves with the statements made 
by the representatives of Nigeria and Ethiopia. 
76. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that the clustering of the resolutions had been 
meant merely to reflect the three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities. It had absolutely no impact 
on the implementation of the activity in question, or on the importance attached to it or to 
technical co-operation. 
Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system 
and application of the Model Protocol (agenda item 18) 

77. The PRESIDENT suggested that, since the Committee of the Whole had failed to 
agree on the draft resolution contained in document GC(45)/COM.5/L.10, discussion of the 
item in question should be postponed till later. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 17 

78. It was so agreed. 
Measures to improve the security of nuclear materials and other radioactive materials 

(agenda item 19) 

79. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A and B contained 
in document GC(45)/L.8 were adopted. 
Amendment to Article VI of the Statute (agenda item 20) 

80. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the Conference took note of the 
information contained in document GC(45)/INF/7. 
81. Mr. Sang-duk CHOI (Republic of Korea) pointed out that, in the two years since 
its adoption by the General Conference, only 21 States, or less than half of the number 
required for its entry into force, had officially accepted the amendment. Progress was thus 
disappointingly slow. He urged all States which had not done so to accept the amendment as 
soon as possible, and requested the Director General to make further efforts to facilitate its 
entry into force and to keep the Conference informed of the progress made. 
Personnel (agenda item 25) 

82. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A and B contained 
in document GC(45)L.9 were adopted. 
STATEMENT BY THE PRESIDENT ON THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA 

83. The PRESIDENT said that, during the Conference, widespread condolences had 
been expressed to the victims and their families, as well as to the Government of the United 
States of America, for the terrorist acts that had taken place on 11 September 2001 in New 
York, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania. Delegates had been unequivocal in their 
condemnation of those terrorist acts. As had been called for in United Nations General 
Assembly resolution 56/1 (2001) and Security Council resolution 1368 (2001), Member States 
had recognized the urgent need to work together to bring to justice the perpetrators, organizers 
and sponsors of those terrorist attacks, and to hold accountable those responsible for aiding, 
supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organizers and sponsors of those acts. With 
particular regard to the AgencyÂs mandate, the Conference had expressed its concern about the 
possible impact of terrorism on the security of nuclear material and other radioactive material. 
In that regard, the Conference had requested the Director General to make a thorough review 
of the activities and programmes of the Agency with a view to strengthening its work relevant 
to preventing acts of terrorism involving nuclear material and other radioactive material. It 
had also urged all Member States to co-operate fully with the Director General and to support 
the AgencyÂs efforts in that regard

EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS (resumed) 

84. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that his countryÂs acceptance of IsraelÂs credentials 
did not extend to the territories occupied since 1967, in particular Jerusalem and the Golan 
Heights. 
85. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that, as in previous years, his 
delegation was unable to recognize credentials issued from the holy land of Jerusalem. 
REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION 
FUND FOR 2002 
(GC(45)/25/Rev.4) 

86. The PRESIDENT said that, by 5.30 p.m. on 20 September 2001, the contributions 
pledged by Member States to the Technical Co-operation Fund had amounted to $8 333 131. 
Since then further members had communicated pledges to the Director General, bringing the 
total amount pledged to $10 060 505, which exceeded the amount pledged by that point in the 
preceding year. 
87. He urged those delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2002 pledges and to 
pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, so that the Secretariat could submit to 
the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee a proposed 2002 programme based on 
reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement the approved programme without 
hindrance or uncertainty. 
The meeting was suspended at 6.50 p.m. and resumed at 7.20 p.m. 

STRENGTHENING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF 
THE SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM AND APPLICATION OF THE MODEL PROTOCOL 
(GC(45)/L.7 and GC(45)/L.11) 

88. The PRESIDENT drew the ConferenceÂs attention to the modified version of the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(45)/COM.5/L.10 which had been submitted by 
Belgium on behalf of the European Union, and which was contained in document GC(45)/L.7. 
He also drew attention to the proposed amendment to that modified version which had been 
submitted by Israel and was contained in document GC(45)/L.11. 
89. Furthermore, he reminded those present that, under Rule 76 of the Rules of Procedure, 
amendments had to be voted on first. 
90. Mr. WULF (United States of America) said that the General Conference had a 
long and distinguished history of adopting resolutions by consensus and he therefore 
requested that the meeting be suspended to allow for one last effort to reach agreement. 
The meeting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 8.15 p.m. 


GC(45)/OR.10 
page 19 

91. Mr. DELHAYE (Belgium), invoking Rule 59 of the Rules of Procedure, moved 
the adjournment of the debate on the amendment contained in document GC(45)/L.11. The 
amendment in question did not take into account all the compromises reached so far and 
consideration of it would necessitate reopening the debate on the issue. 
92. Mr. ABE (Japan), in the interests of maintaining the tradition of the General 
Conference of reaching decisions by consensus, urged the Israeli delegation to withdraw its 
proposed amendment. Failing that, Japan wished to second the motion put forward by the 
representative of Belgium. 
93. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that, in a spirit of co-operation, he was willing to 
withdraw the proposed amendment, but requested that operative paragraph 3 of the resolution 
be voted on separately. 
94. Mr. DELHAYE (Belgium) thanked the Israeli delegation for withdrawing its 
proposed amendment. However, he objected to IsraelÂs request to divide the proposal and 
requested a vote on that motion, in accordance with Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure. 
95. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote, by show of hands, on the motion 
put forward by the delegate of Israel. 
96. There were 3 votes in favour and 83 votes against, with 2 abstentions. The motion was 
rejected. 
97. The PRESIDENT took it that the conference was prepared to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(45)/L.7 by consensus. 
98. Mr. ÃLVAREZ GOYOAGA (Uruguay) pointed out that the draft resolution had 
not been issued in all the AgencyÂs official languages which ran counter to Rule 88 of the 
Rules of Procedure. 
99. Mr. FRANK (Israel) requested a vote on the draft resolution. 
100. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to vote, by show of hands, on the draft 
resolution. 
101. There were 84 votes in favour and none against, with 3 abstentions. The resolution was 
adopted. 
102. Mr. WULF (United States of America) said that the subject of the resolution was 
such that it should have commanded a consensus and his delegation would have preferred it to 
have been adopted on that basis. For that reason it had abstained, but its abstention should not 
be interpreted as relating to the substance of the resolution. The United States continued to 
support the Agency and the safeguards system. 
103. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India) expressed regret that the request for a separate vote 
on operative paragraph 3 of the resolution had been rejected. His country had therefore been 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 20 

forced to abstain, rather than vote for the resolution as it had originally intended. At its 
preceding session, the Conference had been able to arrive at a consensus on the issue based on 
compromise. India would have been more than ready to accept a similar consensus solution 
which it felt would have been in the interests of the Agency. His country had strong 
reservations regarding operative paragraph 3. The signing of international treaties and 
conventions lay in the realm of the sovereign rights of a State, and IndiaÂs membership in the 
Agency did not impose on it any obligations other than those which derived from the Statute. 
As a technical agency, the IAEA should steer clear of exhortations to countries which had no 
legal commitment to comprehensive safeguards. 

104. Mr. NAQVI (Pakistan) said that his country too would have wished to see a 
consensus on the issue in question, as had been the case in the past. Pakistan had been unable 
to vote for the resolution owing to its reservations regarding operative paragraphs 3 and 5. 
His understanding of those paragraphs was that they were consistent with the terms of the 
chapeau of the resolution. 
105. Mr. FRANK (Israel) associated himself with the statements made by the 
representatives of India and Pakistan. 
CLOSING OF THE SESSION 

106. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) commended the President for the wisdom 
he had shown in conducting the work of the General Conference and bringing it to a 
successful conclusion. Despite the recent tragic events which had occurred, a spirit of 
co-operation had prevailed throughout. He also thanked the Chairperson of the Committee of 
the Whole and the Vice-Chairmen, as well as the Secretariat. 
107. Mr. WULF (United States of America) said that he, his colleagues and the people 
of the United States valued highly the expressions of sympathy they had received regarding 
the tragic events of 11 September. They had been a great source of comfort to his country. 
He extended his own countryÂs condolences to the over eighty countries whose citizens had 
been killed by those acts of terrorism. The terrorist acts in New York, Washington and 
Pennsylvania had transformed his country and forced it to make a choice: either not to act and 
thereby live in fear, or to act and thereby live in freedom. His country had chosen to act, and 
it urged other States to choose a similar course. 
108. The PRESIDENT thanked all participants for the co-operation they had shown 
and the assistance they had given him during the Conference. At its opening, many had 
expressed the hope that a spirit of co-operation would prevail despite the recent heinous acts 
of terrorism. It appeared that those appeals had borne fruit. Especial thanks were due to the 
Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole who had done a remarkable job. He also thanked 
the Director General and his staff, especially the interpreters, and the Austrian authorities and 
the city of Vienna for their hospitality. 
109. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the 
Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer and meditation. 

GC(45)/OR.10 
page 21 
All present rose and observed one minute of silence. 
110. The PRESIDENT declared the forty-fifth regular session of the General 
Conference closed. 
The meeting rose at 9.00 p.m.

OPENING OF THE SESSION 

1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-fifth regular session of 
the General Conference. 
2. He recalled that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his message to staff on 
the tragic events of the previous week, had stated that those events made the work of the 
United Nations to promote peace and relieve suffering all the more important. That was 
certainly true of the work of the Agency. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of 
Procedure of the General Conference, he invited delegates to observe one minute of silence 
dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT then, as a further mark of respect for the victims 
and with thoughts for their families and friends, invited the Vienna BoysÂ Choir to perform 
two songs. 
The Vienna BoysÂ Choir performed two songs. 

4. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT thanked the Choir on behalf of the Conference 
for their performance. 
5. Speaking on behalf of all participants, as well as on behalf of his own country, the 
Syrian Arab Republic, he offered his heartfelt condolences to the American people on the loss 
of innocent victims in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. 
6. He expressed his gratitude to the Secretariat, the members of the General Committee 
and to all delegations, whose efforts during the forty-fourth session of the General Conference 
had greatly contributed to its success. 
7. The annual session of the General Conference provided an opportunity for Member 
States to reaffirm their commitment to the Agency and to its predominant role in the service of 
prosperity, peace and security. The need for a proper balance between the safeguards system 
and technical co-operation, which had been highlighted at the previous General Conference, 
merited attention. The developing countries had accepted the consensus on the gradual 
abandonment of partial shielding. They hoped that contributions to the TCF would reach the 
target figure, and that adequate and reliable resources for technical co-operation would 
continue to be forthcoming. 
8. Most developing countries looked to the Agency as the means whereby the transfer of 
technology could help to attain sustainable development. There was no doubt that plant 
protection and agricultural improvement were of great importance in combating malnutrition 
and poverty. Likewise, the medical application of irradiation techniques to diagnose and 
combat disease was of great importance, and should be expanded and further strengthened.

9. The previous yearÂs General Conference had confirmed the importance of those issues 
by adopting resolutions designed to achieve the objective laid down in Article II of the 
Statute, namely to enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity. 
Since its inception, the Agency had always been a forum for co-operation and for the 
promotion of understanding between developed and developing nations, and he was sure that 
it would continue to fulfil that role in the future. 
ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND APPOINTMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE 

10. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President 
of the Conference. 
11. Mr. KIRWAN (Ireland), speaking on behalf of the Western Europe Group, 
proposed Mr. GrÃ¶nberg (Finland) for that position. 
12. Mr. GrÃ¶nberg (Finland) was elected President by acclamation. 
13. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr. GrÃ¶nberg on his election and 
wished him every success in his task. 
Mr. GrÃ¶nberg (Finland) took the Chair. 

14. The PRESIDENT thanked all delegations, particularly the members of the 
Western Europe Group, for the trust they had shown in him by electing him as President. He 
expressed appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Othman, for his able guidance of the previous 
session of the General Conference. 
15. The United Nations Millennium Declaration made in September 2000 had highlighted a 
number of objectives to which the General Assembly had assigned special significance, 
notably peace, security and disarmament; poverty eradication; and protection of the 
environment. According to the Annual Report for 2000, the Agency played a modest but 
important role in the achievement of those objectives. The horrendous act of terrorism which 
had taken place the previous week further underlined the need for the Agency to play its role 
in fostering peace and security. He hoped that during the coming five days a spirit of 
co-operation would prevail, so that the Agency could emerge stronger and more effective and 
would be able to fulfil its tasks even better in the future. 
16. The Member States convened General Conferences annually to give guidance to the 
AgencyÂs work, and to adopt resolutions and decisions giving the Director General and the 
Secretariat tasks on various key issues. However, delegates should keep in mind that the 
burden on the Secretariat resulting from such resolutions should be in proportion to the 
resources Member States were prepared to give to the Agency. 
17. Lastly, he appealed to Members to observe the working practices for General 
Conferences as agreed in documents GC(XXXIII)/GEN/77 and GC(42)/4. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 7 

18. Turning to the election of officers and appointment of the General Committee, he 
recalled that under Rules 34 and 40 of its Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect 
8 Vice-Presidents, the Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole, and 5 additional members 
of the General Committee, resulting, with himself as Chairman, in a Committee of 15. From 
consultations that had taken place, he understood that there was a consensus on the matter and 
he therefore proposed that the delegates of China, Ecuador, Germany, Malaysia, the Russian 
Federation, Sri Lanka, the United States of America and Zimbabwe be elected as 
Vice-Presidents, that Ms. Hernes (Norway) be elected as Chairperson of the Committee of the 
Whole and that the delegates of Argentina, Cameroon, the Czech Republic, Kuwait and 
Lithuania be elected as additional members of the General Committee. 
19. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
20. The PRESIDENT further proposed that, prior to receiving the General 
CommitteeÂs recommendation on the provisional agenda, the General Conference should 
suspend Rule 42 of its Rules of Procedure and proceed with consideration of items 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 
and 8 of its agenda so as not to lose time. 
21. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AGENCY 
(GC(45)/2 and 3) 

22. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(45)/2 and 3 containing 
applications for membership by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of 
Botswana, respectively. Both those applications had been endorsed by the Board, which had 
also submitted two draft resolutions for adoption by the General Conference. 
23. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt both resolutions by acclamation. 
24. It was so decided. 
25. Mr. TROJANOVIC (Yugoslavia) said his delegation was very pleased to be 
resuming its membership of the Agency after almost a decade of absence. He thanked all 
those who had made it possible, thereby contributing to the further development of the 
application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. YugoslaviaÂs policy in the field of 
nuclear energy had not changed since the AgencyÂs foundation. It had acceded to a large 
number of conventions and treaties, including the NPT and a safeguards agreement in 
connection with that Treaty. 
26. He pointed out that Yugoslavia had been fulfilling its obligations as a member of the 
Agency even during the time when it had been prohibited from taking part in many of its 
activities: thus, safeguards inspections had been carried out even during the difficult period of 
NATO air strikes, and the AgencyÂs standards regarding the safe use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes had been incorporated into national regulations. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 8 

27. His country highly appreciated the assistance given by Agency experts in solving the 
problem of the spent nuclear fuel ponds of the RA research reactor in the ÂVincaÂ Institute of 
Nuclear Sciences. It had provided its own financing for the project, which had been 
successfully completed in collaboration with Russian experts. 
28. The programmes currently under way in his country included activities to provide 
security for the spent nuclear fuel ponds; modernize the RB research reactor at the ÂVincaÂ 
Institute; permanent storage of low- and medium-level radioactive waste in interim storage at 
that Institute; further utilize spent cobalt-60 for industrial and medical applications in the 
InstituteÂs radiation unit for industrial sterilization; and to update regulations in the field of 
ionizing radiation and nuclear safety to take account of Agency recommendations and 
standards. All those programmes were fully in compliance with the AgencyÂs own long-term 
programmes, and Yugoslavia was counting on receiving professional and financial support for 
them from the Agency, particularly since it had not received such support since 1992. His 
delegation endorsed the Annual Report and the accounts of the Agency for 2000, as well as 
the proposed programme and budget for 2002-2003, but reiterated its view that resources 
should chiefly be allocated to the solution of serious problems of nuclear energy development 
and application in Member States, notably in the field of nuclear safety and protection from 
ionizing radiation. 
29. Mr. PHILLEMON MOTSU (Botswana) expressed his countryÂs willingness to 
carry out the obligations of membership of the Agency and to act in accordance with the 
purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
30. Botswana was particularly interested in the use of the SIT in pest control to combat not 
only their devastating effect on crop and animal production but also the transmission of 
diseases that killed both livestock and people. Botswana hoped to collaborate with the Agency 
in that area when addressing the issues of food security, poverty alleviation and sustainable 
socio-economic development. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS 

31. Mr. BJORNSSON (Representative of the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations) read out the following message: 
ÂI am pleased to convey my warm greetings to all the participants in the forty-fifth 
regular session of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
The IAEA plays a key role in our collective efforts to achieve the twin goals of peace 
and development, and has been a catalyst for the development and transfer of peaceful 
nuclear technologies, as well as assisting the international community in curbing nuclear 
weapon proliferation. 

ÂMaking progress in the areas of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament is 
more important than ever in the aftermath of last weekÂs appalling terrorist attack on the 
United States. The States Party to the NPT agreed last year that this challenge could not 
be overcome by halfway measures. Indeed, they concluded that Âthe total elimination of 


GC(45)/OR.1 
page 9 

nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear 
weapons.Â Regrettably, several important treaties aimed at nuclear non-proliferation, 
nuclear disarmament or nuclear reductions still await entry into force. It is vitally 
important for the world community to continue its efforts to implement the 
commitments already made, and to further identify the ways and means of achieving 
nuclear disarmament as soon as possible. 

ÂLooking towards the future, it is evident that broad international co-operation is 
essential to upgrade the physical protection of nuclear material, to improve capabilities 
for intercepting and responding to illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other 
radioactive sources, and to enhance the protection of facilities against terrorism and 
sabotage. Another issue of fundamental importance is the enhancement of nuclear 
safety worldwide. I would like to commend the IAEA for its efforts in assisting the 
people affected by the Chernobyl accident, and in enhancing safety levels in the hope 
that an accident of this nature is never repeated. 

ÂFinally, I would like to urge the IAEA to further develop its work in developing the use 
of nuclear energy for sustainable development. Coupled with your work in identifying 
environmentally sound sources of energy, these efforts can help transform nuclear 
energy into a universal force for progress and peace. 

ÂThe IAEAÂs mission is likely to grow and deepen in the decades ahead, and as you 
tackle this vast array of challenges, I wish you all success.Â 

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 

32. The DIRECTOR GENERAL, speaking on behalf of the entire staff of the Agency, 
extended heartfelt condolences to the people and Government of the United States of America 
and to all others directly affected by the recent tragedy. He prayed that they might find the 
strength and faith to cope with their pain and sorrow. 
33. As he was about to complete four years as Director General, the Conference marked a 
time of personal reflection for him - a time to review some of the AgencyÂs achievements and 
some of the challenges it faced in the three areas, or pillars, of its activities: technology, 
safety and verification. 
34. The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for 
sustainable development had placed increasing emphasis on the environmental consequences 
of burning fossil fuels. Nuclear power was the principal alternative in the foreseeable future 
that could provide electricity on a large scale with practically no greenhouse gas emissions, 
yet it continued to be viewed with some concern regarding safety and non-proliferation. 
35. The past twelve months had seen positive developments for nuclear power: reduced 
generating costs, improved capacity factors and the first licence extensions to 60-year 
lifetimes. Also, 6 new power plants had been connected to the grid in 2000 and construction 
had continued on a further 31. Views on the future of nuclear power were still mixed, 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 10 

however. While the United States GovernmentÂs new energy policy explicitly endorsed 
nuclear expansion, the German Government had concluded an agreement with the industry to 
phase out nuclear power. Those mixed views had been reflected in the conclusions reached 
on the role of nuclear power at major conferences on climate change and sustainable 
development. It was perhaps too early to forecast how the future would unfold for nuclear 
power. It would depend on three crucial factors: whether nuclear power could be proven to be 
a safe technology, whether it could be effectively safeguarded against diversion for 
non-peaceful purposes and whether it was economically competitive. 

36. There were currently around 25 innovative reactor and fuel cycle designs in various 
stages of development around the world. The Agency was continuing to provide technical 
assistance to Member States in their development efforts. In response to a resolution adopted 
at the previous General Conference, the Agency had established INPRO, whose objective was 
to support the safe, economical and proliferation-resistant use of nuclear power and assist in 
meeting the global energy needs of the twenty-first century. 
37. The back end of the fuel cycle, namely spent fuel and waste management and facility 
decommissioning, continued to be a major public concern in relation to nuclear power. While 
short-term concerns about waste, specifically the disposal of low-level and short-lived waste 
and the storage of waste in all categories, were already being dealt with safely and effectively, 
high-level waste management and disposal still faced public opposition in many countries. 
Progress towards the demonstration of successful high-level waste disposal was therefore 
crucial to the future of nuclear power. There had been some noteworthy steps in that 
direction. In May 2001, the Finnish parliament had ratified the GovernmentÂs decision to 
construct a deep disposal facility for spent fuel at Olkiluoto. In the United States of America, 
a site recommendation for the proposed geological repository at Yucca Mountain might be 
made to the President in late 2001. The Agency was seeking to maintain international focus 
on waste management issues and to accelerate progress towards demonstrated solutions. 
38. The other major component of the back end of the fuel cycle was facility 
decommissioning. For power reactors, research reactors and fuel cycle facilities alike, 
decommissioning planning and preparation must continue in order to ensure adequate 
funding, expertise and regulatory infrastructure. The Agency was active in each of those 
areas, providing safety standards and technical guidance, monitoring implementation by 
Member States and providing technical assistance to ongoing decommissioning projects. 
39. A major part of the AgencyÂs technological activity was focused on transferring nuclear 
technology in applications other than nuclear power. Under its CRPs and the technical 
co-operation programme, the Agency was building up the scientific and technological 
capacities of its Member States and functioned as a catalyst for social and economic 
development. 
40. In the area of human health, for example, radiotherapy had long been recognized as a 
valuable tool in both the cure and palliation of cancer. Agency attention was increasingly 
focusing on developing countries as life expectancies and cancer rates increased. It was 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 11 

seeking to build up indigenous capabilities by training practitioners, improving the quality of 
therapy equipment and enhancing treatment quality and effectiveness. 

41. Nuclear techniques were gaining recognition in the area of water resource management. 
The Agency programme on isotope hydrology now included 75 active technical co-operation 
projects in some 40 Member States. In Ethiopia, the use of isotope hydrology had helped to 
tap a new groundwater field to provide more than 40% of Addis AbabaÂs water supply. 
42. Agricultural yield and livestock production continued to benefit from the expanding 
application of the SIT. The OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government, meeting in 
July 2001 in Lusaka, had approved a plan for the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis 
Eradication Campaign (PATTEC), which would be supported by the Agency, WHO and FAO, 
among others. As more and more SIT applications became available, the economic and 
environmental benefits to the countries in question should increase significantly. 
43. To conclude his review of developments in the field of nuclear technology, he 
highlighted three important challenges. First, the Agency must continue to encourage 
innovation in reactor and fuel cycle technology in a manner that matched the energy needs and 
requirements of users worldwide. For public acceptance, it was crucial that, like other 
technologies, nuclear power should be innovative and be perceived as such. Second, the focus 
on the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle must be increased, providing solutions that created 
confidence about the safety of the entire cycle. Third, the Agency must continue to provide 
Member States with objective and comprehensive information, including comparative 
assessments, to enable them to make informed choices about the use of nuclear technologies. 
44. Safety in nuclear activities around the globe was also central to the future of nuclear 
energy. Since the Chernobyl accident, safety performance had continued to show significant 
improvement, but much remained to be done at both the national and international level. The 
development and adoption of legally binding norms had proven to be a powerful mechanism 
for enhancing nuclear safety worldwide. However, many States were not yet party to the 
major conventions, certain key areas of nuclear activity were still not the subject of 
conventions and some of the conventions that existed were not comprehensive in their 
coverage. He urged all States that had not already done so to become parties to all the 
safety-related conventions. Consideration should continue to be given to the merits of 
establishing legally binding norms in areas not currently covered by conventions. 
45. The development and maintenance of a comprehensive body of safety standards, 
together with the provision of assistance in their implementation, was a key component of the 
AgencyÂs safety role. The AgencyÂs safety standards could influence national nuclear safety 
regulations, and an increasing number of States used Agency standards directly or as the 
reference basis for their national regulations and guidelines. The Secretariat, with the 
assistance of the Commission on Safety Standards, had initiated a study of the overall 
structure of Agency safety standards to ensure that they were complete and up-to-date. 
46. Safety standards could be effective only if applied in practice. The Agency continued to 
assist Member States in applying its standards, promoting information exchange on best safety 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 12 

practices, providing education and training for technical and regulatory personnel, tailoring 
technical co-operation projects to the specific safety needs of Member States and rendering a 
broad range of safety services in response to Member StatesÂ requests. Its safety services 
continued to be in high demand, particularly peer review missions in which international 
experts provided independent advice based on Agency safety standards and best international 
practices. The benefits of those services were shown by the increasing degree to which 
follow-up missions found that the safety problems identified had been resolved. Some 
services covered a broad area, such as reviews of design or operational safety, while others 
focused on narrower areas, such as seismic safety or equipment ageing. 

47. In the past year, the Secretariat had begun to develop a more comprehensive approach to 
assessing the safety of a countryÂs overall nuclear programme through Âintegrated safety 
evaluationÂ. The aim was to provide a diagnostic of the countryÂs overall nuclear safety 
profile, tailored to the degree of complexity of the countryÂs nuclear programme and 
identifying those areas where safety enhancements should be focused. The results would be 
consolidated in a report to be prepared jointly by the Agency and the country concerned. 
48. Fifteen years had now passed since the Chernobyl accident. With Agency support, two 
international conferences had been held in Kiev on the consequences of the accident including 
the health, environmental and social impacts. He had recently visited some of the affected 
areas in Belarus. Mistrust still prevailed among the people of the region, due in part to the 
contradictory data and reports about the precise environmental and health impacts of the 
accident from national authorities as well as from the relevant international organizations. It 
would be helpful to establish a common forum on the consequences of Chernobyl in which 
the relevant United Nations organizations and the governments of the affected countries 
would deliver a clear and unified message to the people of the region and the public at large. 
49. Clearly, a number of challenges persisted in nuclear safety. The first was to continue to 
improve safety in obviously vulnerable areas, such as research reactors, and to cultivate a 
global nuclear safety culture. Nuclear safety was primarily a national responsibility, but it was 
also a legitimate international concern; nuclear safety practices, like environmental practices, 
had implications that transcended national boundaries. The Chernobyl accident had made that 
message clear and had resulted in the upgrading of safety practices in many countries, but the 
remaining lack of uniformity in safety practices in different countries must continue to be 
addressed. The second challenge, intimately linked to the first, was the international 
harmonization of safety norms, not simply as written but also as applied, and the development 
of legislative and regulatory infrastructure in all countries with the proper degree of 
independence, adequate financial resources and trained personnel. A third challenge related to 
the need for transparency in all nuclear activities, which was crucial to public acceptance. 
Such transparency should include effective communication on events, feedback on operational 
experience, self-assessments and peer reviews. Agency safety services could play an 
important role in that regard. 
50. A final challenge, applicable to both nuclear technology and nuclear safety, concerned 
the substantial need for nuclear expertise and trained personnel, a need that would exist well 
into the future. Fundamental nuclear research had been receiving less support from 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 13 

governments in recent years and many university programmes in nuclear sciences and 
engineering had closed because of decreasing interest. As the nuclear workforce aged and 
retired, the accompanying loss of institutional memory could have significant safety 
implications. The Agency intended to convene a meeting on that topic in the near future to 
discuss the size and nature of the problem, what various Member States were doing to address 
the issue and what could perhaps be done collaboratively. 

51. In the Safeguards Implementation Report for 2000, the Agency had been able to 
conclude that, for all 140 States with safeguards agreements in force, nuclear material and 
other items placed under safeguards had remained in peaceful nuclear activities or had been 
otherwise adequately accounted for. For seven States, each with both a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, the AgencyÂs evaluation had been able to 
provide a broader assurance that not only had there been no diversion of declared nuclear 
material, but also there was no indication of the presence of undeclared nuclear material or 
activities. 
52. He remained concerned about the lack of progress in concluding comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols. In the early 1990s, after the discovery of the 
clandestine nuclear weapons programme in Iraq, the international community had declared its 
readiness to give the Agency broader authority to strengthen its verification ability, 
particularly its ability to detect undeclared activities. Except in a limited number of countries, 
however, it still did not have that authority, because the requirement for a safeguards 
agreement and an additional protocol to be in force had not been met. Fifty States Party to the 
NPT still had no comprehensive safeguards agreement in force, and the Agency could not 
provide any safeguards assurances for those countries. Since its adoption of the Model 
Additional Protocol in 1997, the Board had approved additional protocols for only 58 Member 
States, and only 22 of those had entered into force or were being provisionally applied. 
53. For nearly three years, the Agency had not been in a position to implement its mandate 
in Iraq under Security Council resolution 687 (1991) and related resolutions. As a 
consequence, it was not able at present to provide any assurance that Iraq was in compliance 
with its obligations under those resolutions. It remained prepared to resume its verification 
activities in Iraq under the relevant Security Council resolutions at short notice. 
54. Since 1993, the Agency had been unable fully to implement its comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the DPRK. In accordance with the Agreed Framework, however, 
the Agency had since November 1994 been monitoring the freeze of the DPRKÂs graphitemoderated 
reactor and related facilities and had maintained a continuous inspector presence at 
the Nyongbyon site. It remained unable to verify the completeness and correctness of the 
DPRKÂs initial 1992 declaration, however. The work required to verify that all nuclear 
materials subject to safeguards in the DPRK had been declared to the Agency would take 
three to four years. In May 2001, the Agency had proposed to the DPRK the first concrete 
steps that needed to be carried out in that verification process and had indicated its readiness 
to start implementing those measures as soon as permitted to do so. It had not yet received a 
response from the DPRK, which continued to link its acceptance of Agency verification to 
progress in the implementation of the Agreed Framework. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 14 

55. In keeping with his mandate from the General Conference, he had continued to consult 
with the States of the Middle East on the application of full-scope safeguards to all nuclear 
activities there and the development of model agreements that would contribute to the 
eventual establishment of a NWFZ in that region. Regrettably, he had not yet been able to 
make progress in fulfilling that mandate. 
56. Within the framework of the initiative to submit nuclear material released from the 
military programmes of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to Agency 
verification, consultations were continuing in an effort to resolve various legal and technical 
issues, including the development of a new model verification agreement. In the past 
12 months, progress had been made on developing technical criteria and methods for 
implementing verification measures, but agreement had still to be reached on the scope of 
those measures, the nature of the material subject to safeguards and the duration of the 
verification measures under the agreement. That afternoon, he would be meeting American 
and Russian representatives to take stock of developments and see how to move forward. 
57. The first International Conference on Security of Material had been held in Stockholm 
in May. Security experts had emphasized not only the need for increased co-operation 
between relevant bodies such as customs organizations, Interpol, national governments and 
the Agency, but also the importance of improving awareness of potential threats, incidents of 
theft and sabotage and illicit trafficking, as well as the need to enhance R&D on techniques 
for detection and analysis. The Conference had also highlighted the AgencyÂs key role in 
supporting those efforts at the national level through the development of norms and guides, 
the co-ordination of technological development and assistance to States in implementing 
security measures. 
58. Stemming the spread of nuclear weapons and moving towards nuclear disarmament 
remained a major human endeavour, of which Agency verification was a cornerstone. A 
number of challenges were critical to future success. 
59. The primary challenge for the Agency was the universal application of its safeguards 
system, namely the conclusion of the relevant safeguards agreements and additional protocols 
by all States that had made non-proliferation commitments and the continuation of efforts to 
achieve the universality of the non-proliferation regime. While that objective continued to be 
supported by all, the necessary actions were not being taken by Member States. That situation 
was unsatisfactory; the Agency could provide the required assurances only if it was given the 
corresponding authority. Second, the Agency must support the development of an effective 
national and international system for the physical protection of nuclear material and the 
combating of illicit trafficking in order to avoid the risk of nuclear proliferation and to protect 
the public from possible radiation and health effects. In the light of recent events, that 
imperative could not be overemphasized. Third, accelerated and tangible progress must be 
made towards nuclear arms control and disarmament. That was crucial for sustaining and 
consolidating the non-proliferation regime in the long run. The unequivocal commitment 
made by the nuclear-weapon States during the 2000 NPT Review Conference to accomplish 
the total elimination of nuclear weapons had yet to be translated into concrete action. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 15 

60. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme delivered approximately 
US $65 million annually in expert services, training and equipment, complementing the 
Regular Budget programme under all three pillars of Agency activities but in a manner 
directly tied to the specific priorities of recipient Member States. The technical co-operation 
programme for 2000 concentrated in part on a limited number of areas in which nuclear 
science and technology could have a strong developmental impact in the fields of human 
health, agriculture, water resources management, environmental protection and industrial 
applications. Close attention continued to be paid to the core areas of nuclear power, nuclear 
safety, radiation protection and radioactive waste management. The year 2000 had been a 
significant milestone in the development of the AgencyÂs approach to technical co-operation. 
The targets set for implementing the first phase of the technical co-operation strategy had been 
largely achieved. The programme had thus shifted from being technology-driven to being 
driven by the needs and priorities of Member States, a change reinforced by the AgencyÂs 
adoption of a results-based approach to all its programmes. 
61. In a resolution adopted in 2000, the General Conference had established a rate of 
attainment for measuring the contributions paid to the TCF as a percentage of the TCF target. 
The Conference had approved TCF targets of $73 million for 2001 and 2002 and had set the 
rates of attainment at 80 and 85%, respectively. However, the total amount pledged and paid 
to the TCF as of 15 September 2001 was only $40 million, representing a rate of attainment of 
only 55% so far that year. The Agency was relying on all its Member States to pledge and pay 
their contributions to the TCF in full and on time each year and, for Member States that had 
not been paying or had been paying only a portion, to pay at least an amount equivalent to the 
rate of attainment. That was essential for the Agency to have sufficient resources to serve the 
needs of Member States. 
62. Over the past four years a programme of reform in the management of the Agency had 
been initiated. The annual Senior Management Conferences had had both catalysing and 
reviewing roles in that process, creating a Âone-houseÂ approach to the changes. Of particular 
importance had been the accelerated introduction of results-based programming and 
budgeting, accompanied by a transition to biennial programming and budgeting. Those 
changes had been facilitated by considerable restructuring within the Secretariat. Thus, while 
reform would remain an ongoing process and the search for efficiency gains and increases in 
effectiveness would remain energetic, the basic machinery was now sharp and focused. 
63. Additional funding requirements and cost pressures posed a continuing and growing 
problem. Every year the Agency was asked to assume more responsibilities and to provide 
more services without a corresponding increase in the Regular Budget. The result was that 
many priority activities could not be implemented and many programmes suffered from 
squeezed resources. The compromises achieved to resolve short-term budget issues should 
not obscure the need for better long-term solutions. If the Agency was to fulfil its mandate 
while maintaining the required balance among its activities, it must find more sensible 
approaches to ensuring adequate and predictable funding. He urged all parties to engage in 
fresh thinking as to how the current budgetary approach could be improved. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 16 

64. A management challenge that the Agency faced in all aspects of its work was 
improvement of public outreach, namely the ability to provide objective information on the 
benefits of and the risks associated with nuclear technology for opinion leaders, the media, 
NGOs and the public at large and to explain the AgencyÂs contribution in that regard. In 
August 2001, CNN TV had begun broadcasting public service announcements to give greater 
visibility to the important role of nuclear technology and of the Agency. The Secretariat had 
taken steps to revitalize the AgencyÂs public information seminar programme and had 
substantially stepped up its presence on the Internet, developing the WorldAtom website into 
a valuable source of information. 
65. Reviewing the AgencyÂs achievements and challenges illustrated, on the one hand, how 
far it had come and, on the other, how much remained to be done. He was heartened by the 
achievements of the past four years in aligning the AgencyÂs programmes and streamlining its 
structure to serve the needs of its members more effectively and efficiently, and he looked 
forward to the continued commitment and support of the Member States. 
66. The PRESIDENT, commending the Director General on his statement, said that 
his interesting ideas on the challenges that lay ahead for the Agency would certainly be 
considered carefully by Member States. 
The Director General left the meeting. 

APPROVAL OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 
(GC(45)/5) 

67. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to Article VII.A of the Statute, the Board had 
decided to appoint Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei to serve as Director General of the Agency for a 
term of four years from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2005 and had requested the 
General Conference to approve that appointment by adopting the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(45)/5. He took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(45)/5. 
68. It was so decided and the Conference confirmed the appointment of Mr. ElBaradei to 
the post of Director General by acclamation. 
At the invitation of the President, Mr. ElBaradei re-entered the meeting. 

69. The PRESIDENT informed Mr. ElBaradei that the Conference had approved his 
appointment to the post of Director General for another four years. He was pleased to be the 
first to congratulate him on behalf of the General Conference. His able and skilful leadership 
of the Agency during the past term gave confidence that the further term would be equally 
successful. He invited him to take the oath of office. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 17 

70. Mr. ELBARADEI took the following oath: 
"I solemnly swear to exercise in all loyalty, discretion and conscience the functions 
entrusted to me as Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to 
discharge these functions and to regulate my conduct with the interest of the Agency 
only in view, and not to seek or accept instructions in regard to the performance of my 
duties from any government or other authority external to the Agency." 

71. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said he was grateful for the General Conference's 
support and humbled by the confidence placed in him. He trusted that, by working together, 
Member States could make the world a safer and more humane place. 
72. The PRESIDENT requested delegates, as the morningÂs meeting was already well 
advanced, to refrain from congratulating the Director General at this point and to save their 
words of congratulation for their statements in the general debate. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION FUND FOR 2002 
(GC(45)/25) 

73. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to an agreement reached in the Board of 
Governors in 2000, the Board recommended a figure of $73 million as the target for 
contributions to the TCF for 2002. He drew attention to a table in the attachment to document 
GC(45)/25 which showed the contributions that each Member State would need to make in 
order to meet its share of that target. 
74. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the 
Secretariat in planning the Agency's technical co-operation programmes. Delegations in a 
position to do so, but which had not done so yet, were therefore urged to notify the Secretariat 
during the General Conference of the contributions which their governments would be making 
to the TCF for 2002. 
75. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions 
which had been pledged up to that time. He hoped to be able to report favourably on the 
percentage of the 2002 target figure already pledged. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 
(GC(45)/4) 

76. The PRESIDENT recalled that among the recommendations approved by the 
General Conference for streamlining the Conference's working practices was that delegates 
should limit their statements in the general debate to 15 minutes. Pointing out that over 
84 delegates had already inscribed their names on the speakers' list, he said he took it that the 
Conference authorized him, under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of 
speeches to 15 minutes. 
77. It was so decided. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 18 

78. The PRESIDENT appealed for understanding and co-operation in the arrangement 
of the daily speakers' list. Adjustments had been necessary to allow the participation of 
several Ministers and other senior officials from Member States and international 
organizations who were unable to spend the whole week in Vienna. Additional adjustments 
might be required, but he was confident that the Secretariat would do its best to cope with 
conflicting demands. He took it that the Conference was in agreement with those 
arrangements. 
79. It was so agreed. 
80. Mr. ABRAHAM (United States of America) said that he had been deeply moved 
by the memorial service commemorating those killed in the terrorist acts of September 11 in 
his country. He thanked all those who had offered help and sympathy in the wake of those 
unspeakable attacks. International expressions of support were heartening and signalled that 
such violence, the murder of innocents, was an attack on all civilized nations. In mourning 
the loss of thousands of its citizens in an appalling catastrophe, the United States of America 
was fully resolved to recover and respond to that vicious act of terror. 
81. Nevertheless, the work of his Government continued. Congress was acting quickly and 
in consensus to give assistance to the victims, begin the long job of rebuilding and support the 
President. He was particularly proud of the employees of his department, who had been back 
at work the day after the terrorist attack, doing their part to keep the Government operating. 
82. The current meeting was important; there were few better ways of signalling resolve 
than to stand together with other nations in condemning terrorism, as had been done the 
previous week at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, and working actively to 
prevent future acts of barbarism. Although the attacks had struck America, the broader target 
had been the entire freedom-loving world. Indeed, citizens from over 40 nations were among 
the victims and the United States expressed condolences to those countries. No one was 
immune and clearly no method could be ruled out. That fact sent an unmistakable message to 
the Agency. Its role in preventing the spread of dangerous nuclear materials, providing 
physical security over those materials, verifying peaceful uses of nuclear energy, advancing 
science and monitoring technology transfer would become more pivotal to international 
security in the years ahead. The Agency must help ensure that nuclear materials were never 
used as weapons of terror. In that task the Agency could rely on AmericaÂs continuing and 
robust support. The security of his country and of others around the world largely depended 
upon what the Agency did to prevent the proliferation and misuse of nuclear materials. 
83. At the same time, the AgencyÂs role in helping meet global energy demands remained 
vital to the well-being of people and to international security. To underscore his 
GovernmentÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs critical work in that regard, he read out the 
following message from Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United States of America: 
ÂDear Conferees, on September 11th, the United States was attacked by terrorists in a 
series of vicious and despicable acts of violence. America and our friends and allies 
will stand together and will win the war against terrorism to ensure peace and security 


GC(45)/OR.1 
page 19 

for the world. As you gather for the 45th General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency, I urge you to advance the role of the IAEA in securing 
international peace and well-being. 

ÂThe IAEA is central to the worldÂs efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. For more than 40 years, the IAEA and it Member States have established 
safeguards for special nuclear materials and the facilities that produce them. Much 
more remains to be done, and we will look to the IAEA to continue serving as a critical 
instrument to help combat the real and growing threat of nuclear proliferation. 

ÂEarly in my Administration, I ordered the development of a national energy policy to 
promote the dependable, affordable and environmentally sound production of energy. 
Nuclear energy is a key part of this endeavour. The world looks to the IAEA to promote 
the world-wide peaceful use of nuclear energy. 

ÂThe United States has a long tradition of strong support for the IAEA that my 
Administration will continue. Best wishes for a successful conference.Â 

84. As the PresidentÂs message noted, nuclear safety - preserving nuclear security in a 
dangerous world - must remain a critical priority for all. The AgencyÂs skills and expertise in 
that area would be needed more than ever. In that regard, his Government was pleased by the 
decision to reappoint Mr. ElBaradei as Director General and looked forward to working with 
him. The Agency was responsible for ensuring that the civilian use of nuclear power was for 
peaceful purposes only and that materials which could be used to create nuclear weapons were 
properly guarded and carefully accounted for. The terrible events of the previous week 
demonstrated in the clearest possible fashion the importance of maintaining the highest levels 
of security over nuclear materials. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was critically important 
to the security of the United States and the entire international community. In the year 2000 
alone, the Agency had carried out more than 2500 inspections at nearly 600 facilities in 
70 countries. By demonstrating that States were complying with their international nonproliferation 
commitments, the Agency promoted public confidence in nuclear power. It had 
a long and fruitful history concerning the international implementation of good physical 
security practices and co-operation to prevent illicit nuclear trafficking. The United States 
welcomed the AgencyÂs work in those areas and urged all countries to review and, where 
necessary, upgrade their national efforts. 
85. In addition to its unwavering support for the AgencyÂs non-proliferation activities and 
the NPT, his country was determined to find fresh approaches to resolving proliferation 
problems. It was already working with Russia and other countries to improve physical 
protection for hundreds of tons of plutonium and enriched uranium. Earlier in the year, the 
United States had hosted the annual plenary of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, whose 
39 members had adopted the basic principle that nuclear exports must be prohibited in cases 
where there was a significant risk of diversion. His Government called on all States to 
implement nuclear export controls in keeping with that principle and favoured strengthened 
international commitment and co-operation on the physical protection of nuclear materials, 
particularly those that could readily be converted to weapons use. The United States was 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 20 

conscious of the fact that todayÂs changing environment would require increased international 
co-operation and vigilance. It was essential that all countries adjust their policies accordingly. 
His GovernmentÂs initiatives would emphasize two principles: co-operation and 
accountability. It would work with others, but expect them to act responsibly as well. 

86. In conclusion, he said that the United States stood behind the Agency and was grateful 
that it would be strong and vibrant in the difficult times ahead. There was no reason to shrink 
from the dual responsibility of protecting the world from nuclear terrorism and providing it 
with abundant, safe, affordable and clean energy. His Government looked forward to 
strengthening the AgencyÂs efforts and co-operating with it to achieve world peace. 
87. Mr. OMI (Japan) expressed his sincere condolences to the families of the victims 
of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States of America. Such attacks posed a grave 
challenge to people all over the world. He believed that the Agency could make a significant 
contribution to world-wide efforts to combat terrorism. 
88. Japan had actively promoted the peaceful use of nuclear energy as a stable component of 
its economic development, and would certainly increase such efforts in the coming years. As 
the only country to have suffered the devastation caused by atomic bombs, Japan was well 
aware that the economic benefits brought by nuclear energy were but a part of the overall 
picture, and longed for the total elimination of nuclear weapons. His GovernmentÂs standing 
policy was that Japan must never possess, produce, or permit the importation of nuclear 
weapons - the so-called three non-nuclear principles. Those were the principles underlying 
JapanÂs decision to accede to the NPT in 1976 after much heated national debate, and also its 
solid support for the AgencyÂs activities in the area of nuclear non-proliferation, in particular 
its vitally important verification responsibilities. 
89. Nuclear energy was important for the world community, and especially for Japan given 
the scarcity of its domestic energy resources, because it provided a stable energy supply and 
preserved the global environment. JapanÂs 51 commercial nuclear reactors currently 
accounted for about 35 % of total national power generation; that level was expected to 
increase to over 40 % by 2010, following the commissioning of a further 13 reactors. As part 
of its long-term programme for nuclear energy, Japan had attached increased priority to R&D 
in relation to fast reactors and the use of plutonium in light-water reactors. Japan also 
continued to make steady progress towards the establishment of a nuclear fuel cycle and 
would continue making its use of plutonium transparent and accountable to the rest of the 
world. 
90. Japan hoped that nuclear fusion would succeed nuclear fission as a practicable energy 
source during the current century. The most prominent fusion initiative, the ITER project which 
was being conducted jointly by Japan, the European Union and Russia -would benefit 
from renewed participation by the United States of America. 
91. Enhancement of the nuclear non-proliferation regime was one of the most important 
items on the international communityÂs agenda. In the belief that strengthening the NPT 
safeguards regime represented the most realistic means of achieving that end, Japan had 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 21 

promptly concluded its additional protocol and had also proposed, during the previous 
General Conference1, a plan of action designed to expedite its universalization. On the basis 
of the plan of action and in co-operation with the Agency, Japan had organized earlier in the 
year an international symposium for further reinforcement of Agency safeguards in the 
Asia-Pacific region. He hoped that the Agency would hold similar events in other parts of the 
world, and pledged JapanÂs support in contributing both human and financial resources for 
that purpose. Finally, recalling the conclusion of the 2000 NPT Review Conference that early 
adoption of integrated safeguards would rationalize the burden of safeguards and provide an 
important incentive for concluding additional protocols, he urged the Secretariat to accelerate 
its efforts with regard to integrated safeguards. 

92. The Agency bore a grave responsibility in the context of the DPRKÂs suspected nuclear 
weapons development programme. Japan intended to continue its active support of the LWR 
project being carried out by KEDO and urged the DPRK to improve its relationship with the 
Agency and fulfil promptly and completely its obligations under the safeguards agreement it 
had concluded with the Agency. 
93. Japan welcomed the recent appointment of Mr. Tomihiro Taniguchi as the AgencyÂs 
Deputy Director General for Nuclear Safety and looked forward to contributing more qualified 
personnel. 
94. The task of ensuring nuclear safety was nowhere more urgent than in Asia, where 
23 nuclear reactors were currently under construction. Japan remained ready to contribute 
financial and human resources towards achieving the key Agency objectives of increasing its 
provision of nuclear safety training and establishing new safety standards. 
95. With regard to the challenge that many countries faced in managing radioactive waste, 
he announced that his Government intended to make a new extrabudgetary contribution to the 
AgencyÂs activities in that area in 2001. 
96. In keeping with JapanÂs policy of encouraging all international organizations to achieve 
zero nominal growth in their budgets as a means of promoting efficient fiscal management, he 
urged the Secretariat to achieve further cost reductions in all its operations and to set priorities 
based upon the AgencyÂs one-house principle. An important way of meeting that challenge 
would be to achieve cost neutrality in the safeguards budget through increased efficiency in 
implementation. He asked the Secretariat to formulate a detailed plan for achieving that 
objective. 
97. Finally, he emphasized that the future deployment of nuclear energy for destructive or 
positive ends was entirely in the hands of the human race. Convinced that wisdom would 
prevail, he said it was incumbent on the international community to make every effort to 
ensure that the Agency fulfilled its mission. Japan remained committed to providing the 
Agency with all possible support towards achieving that objective. 
See document GC(44)/OR.1, para. 92.

98. Mr. Young-hwan KIM (Republic of Korea), having offered his condolences to the 
American people for the enormous losses suffered as a result of the recent terrorist attacks, 
said that terrorism was the enemy of all peace-loving people around the world. He strongly 
denounced actions that threatened international peace and security and emphasized that his 
country would join in the efforts to eradicate terrorism. 
99. With nuclear energy being recognized as a practical and sustainable future energy 
source, the Republic of Korea supported and would participate in the AgencyÂs INPRO 
initiative. Korea was developing its own advanced nuclear power technology, including the 
APR-1400, a 1400 MW(e) next-generation reactor, and the SMART (system-integrated 
modular advanced reactor) for use in both desalination and power generation. 
100. He welcomed the fact that the Joint Convention had entered into force in June 2001. 
For its part, Korea was in the process of ratifying that convention. To ensure the safety and 
security of radioactive materials, Korea had implemented a radiation safety information 
system, which monitored all stages from production to disposal via the Internet. He proposed 
that the Agency establish a worldwide information network on that topic. 
101. Commending the Director GeneralÂs timely initiative to establish an International 
Advisory Group for Gender Issues, he said that the role of women in nuclear activities was 
gaining importance in the twenty-first century and that, earlier in the year, the Republic of 
Korea had hosted the 9th WIN (Women in Nuclear) Global Annual Meeting, in Seoul. 
102. The Republic of Korea now had 16 nuclear power plants in operation supplying 41% of 
the nationÂs total electricity. A further 4 units were under construction and it was expected 
that 8 more would be completed by 2015. 
103. His country had established its national safeguards inspection system in 1997 and had 
collaborated with the Agency in implementing the New Partnership Approach, which he 
hoped would become a model for all international safeguards. 
104. Owing to the commendable efforts of KEDO, construction work was under way for the 
LWR project. The DPRK had issued a permit in September 2001 allowing KEDO to begin 
excavation of the power block. Once the site arrangement and building infrastructure were 
completed, KEDO would proceed to the main construction work. Under the Agreed 
Framework, the DPRK should be in full compliance with its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency before the delivery of key nuclear components. Given the AgencyÂs assessment that it 
would take three to four years to verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs 
initial report, he called on the DPRK to co-operate fully with the Agency. The General 
Conference had adopted a series of resolutions requesting the DPRK to come into full 
compliance with its safeguards agreement with the Agency. The Director General had pointed 
out in his statement to the current session of the General Conference that there had been no 
major developments in that connection and the Agency was still unable to verify the 
correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs initial declaration. He therefore supported the 
Director GeneralÂs request for the DPRK to normalize its relations with the Agency. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 23 

105. His country, which had previously proposed the establishment of an international 
nuclear university, commended the inclusion in the AgencyÂs 2002-2003 programme, of a 
feasibility study on the establishment of the Agency-sponsored international school on nuclear 
science and technology and would consider making a contribution. Also on the topic of 
education, he called for the support and participation of Member States in the second 
International Youth Nuclear Congress to be held in Seoul in April 2002. 
106. He noted with satisfaction that, as a result of consultation at the 30th RCA General 
Conference, it had been agreed by the RCA Member States that a regional office be 
established in the Republic of Korea. He expressed his countryÂs willingness to contribute to 
the operation of that office. 
107. He added that his country planned to establish a mirror site of the INIS in the Republic 
of Korea for the convenience of Asia-Pacific users. 
108. He reminded the General Conference of resolution GC(45)/RES/19 regarding 
amendment to Article VI of the Statute, and urged Member States to take prompt action so 
that the amendment would enter into force as soon as possible. 
109. In conclusion, he emphasized the importance of international co-operation and 
collaboration for the development of sustainable nuclear technology for the benefit of future 
generations. 
110. Mr. ADAM (Belgium), speaking on behalf of the European Union and its 
associated states - Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Turkey - expressed his 
deepest sympathy to the United States of America for the great loss of life incurred in the 
recent terrorist attack. In that connection, he referred to the joint declaration of 
14 September 2001 made by the Heads of State and Government and bodies of the European 
Union, condemning terrorism and expressing their willingness to fight it with all the means at 
their disposal. 
111. Mr. ElBaradeiÂs re-election as Director General showed the confidence the members 
placed in him. One problem he would have to resolve would be how to replace the many 
specialized staff whose contracts would expire in the near future. The European Union would 
welcome some clarification in that regard. 
112. Given the AgencyÂs financial constraints, the European Union was concerned by the 
failure of a large number of Member States to contribute to the Regular Budget. It thus 
welcomed the initiatives launched by the Director General, such as the one-house concept, 
results-based budgeting, emphasis on quality rather than quantity, and prioritization of 
projects to improve the overall efficiency of the AgencyÂs activities. 
113. The safeguards programme should on no account be considered as being in competition 
with the AgencyÂs promotional or technical co-operation programmes. Safeguards provided 
the necessary confidence for international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear power. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 24 

However, there was an increasing gap between expenditure on safeguards and 
non-proliferation activities on the one hand and Member StatesÂ contributions to the Regular 
Budget for that purpose on the other. The Agency must be given sufficient resources to fulfil 
its statutory obligations pursuant to the NPT. Excessive budgetary constraints and a lack of 
internal budgetary flexibility should not make that already difficult task more arduous. 

114. The efficiency of the safeguards system depended on its universality. Most European 
Union member countries had now ratified additional protocols. He urged all Parties to the 
NPT which had not yet done so to conclude Agency safeguards agreements, and all those with 
such agreements which had not yet done so to conclude an additional protocol without further 
delay. Also, he called on all other States which were not party to the NPT to place their 
nuclear activities under Agency control. 
115. The European Union supported the AgencyÂs efforts to develop integrated safeguards. It 
welcomed the progress made since the previous General Conference, in particular with regard 
to LWRs without MOX fuel and research reactors, and looked forward to proposals for other 
types of facility. It recognized the importance of SAGSI and Member State support 
programmes in that regard. The new system must however be based on qualitative 
assessment. The Secretariat should pursue efforts to achieve maximum effectiveness and 
long-term cost neutrality through a reduction in inspection effort. In the long run, that should 
benefit countries that had successfully implemented additional protocols. 
116. The European Union supported work undertaken by the Agency in the area of physical 
protection, including the findings of the expert meeting convened to discuss the need to revise 
the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It urged Member States to 
endorse the draft resolution on the matter and looked forward to the forthcoming meeting of 
technical and legal experts to prepare a draft amendment to strengthen that Convention. 
117. The lack of progress in implementing the safeguards agreement with the DPRK 
remained a matter for concern. The European Union strongly urged the DPRK to comply 
fully with its safeguard agreement and co-operate with the Director General without further 
delay, especially regarding the verification of its initial declaration. 
118. The situation in Iraq was also a major concern. More than two years after the departure 
of the AgencyÂs Action Team, verification activities had still not resumed. The European 
Union called on Iraq once again to comply strictly with all the relevant Security Council 
resolutions, to give the Agency the necessary access to fulfil its mandate and to co-operate 
with it unreservedly by providing an up-to-date and technically coherent picture of its 
clandestine nuclear programme. The verification of the physical inventory of nuclear 
materials under a routine inspection that year could not serve as a substitute for the AgencyÂs 
activities under the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
119. The shutdown of the Chernobyl nuclear power station in December 2000 had been an 
important event. The 1986 disaster had highlighted the need to accord priority to safety 
aspects at all stages of nuclear programmes. The European Union welcomed the AgencyÂs 
successful initiatives in that area, particularly the OSART missions, as well as efforts to draft 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 25 

safety standards for fuel cycle installations. Priority should be given to completing the Safety 
Series documents. He hoped that the second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety would result in further safety improvements. 

120. The search must continue for long-term solutions to the problem of the safe disposal of 
radioactive waste and spent fuel. The Cordoba conference had shown the vital importance of 
public information and the Agency, given its experience and technical expertise, could play a 
useful role in that connection. He hoped that the development of projects on innovative 
reactors and cycles, such as INPRO, would open up new possibilities in the area of safety, 
proliferation resistance and waste reduction. 
121. The European Union would continue to co-operate with the Agency in assisting 
Member States to foster the peaceful applications of nuclear energy, inter alia through 
substantial contributions to the TCF. The Secretariat should pursue its efforts to improve the 
effectiveness of the technical co-operation programme, for instance through the rigorous 
selection and assessment of projects and using modern management methods to ensure their 
implementation. Notwithstanding such reforms and additional budgetary allocations, the 
working conditions of Secretariat staff in the Department of Technical Co-operation had 
apparently deteriorated. He would welcome further information on the situation and on the 
Director GeneralÂs intended course of action. Perhaps, as suggested at the meetings of the 
Board of Governors in June 2001, the services of an external consultant could be sought on 
how to make technical assistance more cost-effective. The European Union would request 
from the Secretariat at the appropriate time a detailed breakdown of Regular Budget 
expenditure on technical co-operation project support and management. 
122. Technical co-operation must above all benefit the least developed countries. The 
European Union would look favourably on the idea of taking into account the GDP of 
countries when assessing their eligibility for assistance. It also wondered why many countries 
which for several years had failed to pay their assessed programme costs continued to benefit 
from the TCF. 
123. It was regrettable that negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty had not yet got 
under way despite the appeal made at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. He called on 
Member States to remedy that situation without delay. He also urged Member States to sign 
or ratify the CTBT with a view to accelerating its entry into force. 
124. In November 2000, the European Commission had published a Green Paper with a view 
to prompting a wide-ranging debate and reaching consensus on the security of the European 
UnionÂs future energy supply. That would provide an opportunity to consider the various 
energy mix options available to the European Union, taking into account the need to control 
greenhouse gas emissions and to maintain a civil nuclear safety culture, regardless of the 
future of nuclear power. 
125. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China) strongly condemned the terrorist attacks carried out 
in New York and Washington and expressed his heartfelt sympathy for the victims and their 
families. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 26 

126. One of the main tasks of the General Conference was to review the AgencyÂs work and 
to outline its future objectives. Only by faithfully adhering to the Statute and maintaining the 
balance between its two main functions could the Agency gain vitality and function properly. 
Amongst its positive achievements in the preceding year, the Agency had actively participated 
in the work of the CSD-9 and the COP6, thereby contributing to scientific and objective 
evaluation of the role of nuclear energy in sustainable development. It had continued to assist 
its Member States in establishing and improving their nuclear safety infrastructures. It had 
also promoted international co-operation in the safety of nuclear waste and radiation sources 
and the security of radioactive materials, and had facilitated the enhancement of nuclear safety 
worldwide. The Agency had helped introduce nuclear applications in agriculture, water 
resource management, human health and environmental protection, bringing social and 
economic benefits to its Member States. It had also made significant progress in developing 
integrated safeguards while continuing to carry out its obligations under safeguards 
agreements, thus strengthening the international non-proliferation regime. 
127. Emphasizing the importance of nuclear power to sustainable development and the 
AgencyÂs role in that connection, he pointed out that the world was facing unprecedented 
ecological challenges. The developed countries, which accounted for about two thirds of the 
total greenhouse gas emissions, bore the major responsibility for global warming, while the 
developing countries, whose emissions were low, were faced with the task of revitalizing their 
economies and eliminating poverty to achieve sustainable development. The UNFCCC and 
the Kyoto Protocol provided for common but differentiated responsibilities for developed and 
developing countries in meeting those challenges. 
128. The demand for energy was increasing as the worldÂs economy developed, and 
traditional energy sources like coal, petroleum and gas would still have to be used until a new 
clean energy source was developed. Optimized energy structure policies should be adopted to 
cut down pollution, and advanced technologies applied to improve the fossil fuel utilization 
rate. At the same time, the use of clean energy should be increased. More than 40 years of 
experience had demonstrated that nuclear energy was clean, safe and economical. Nuclear 
power now accounted for one sixth of the worldÂs total power generation and also had helped 
to reduce greenhouse gas emission. China, along with many other countries, was in favour of 
including nuclear energy in the Clean Development Mechanism. He hoped that the Agency 
would make greater efforts to make the general public realize the significance of nuclear 
power in that regard. 
129. China, the largest developing country in the world, had prepared guidelines for 
appropriate development of nuclear power as part of its recently published tenth five-year 
plan. China had 8 nuclear power units, with a total installed capacity of 6600 MW, under 
construction and several more were being planned. At the same time, it attached great 
importance to developing and using advanced technologies aimed at increasing the utilization 
factors of traditional fossil fuels. It was willing to co-operate with other countries to protect 
the worldÂs environment. 
130. Doubts continued to be expressed about nuclear proliferation, nuclear safety and the 
economic competitiveness of nuclear power. The Agency had a pivotal role to play in the 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 27 

proper understanding and settlement of those issues. It should play a co-ordinating role in 
developing new nuclear energy technologies. After more than 40 years of operating 
experience and in the light of scientific and technological advances, attention was focusing on 
new-generation reactors and fuel cycles with inherent safety and non-proliferation features and 
economic competitiveness. At the request of its Member States, the Agency had initiated 
INPRO. China, which fully supported that initiative, had sent experts to the Agency to 
contribute. The effectiveness of that programme could be improved in a number of ways. 
Firstly, the Agency, the only inter-governmental organization in the nuclear field, should make 
greater efforts to co-ordinate and encourage more countries with R&D capability to participate 
in the programme. Secondly, the Agency should establish close relations with other 
co-operation mechanisms in that area (for example, the USDOE Generation IV International 
Forum) with a view to exchanging information. Thirdly, in implementing its programme, the 
Agency should take into account the practical requirements of the developing countries 
intending to develop nuclear power so that they could benefit from research results. 

131. While responsibility for nuclear safety was primarily a matter for the governments of the 
countries concerned, the Agency should serve as the centre of international co-operation. The 
Agency, with the support of its Member States, had prepared many international legally 
binding instruments, including the Early Notification Convention, the Assistance Convention, 
the Nuclear Safety Convention, the Joint Convention, and a series of nuclear safety criteria. 
Those, together with assistance to individual Member States and the peer review mechanism, 
had played an important role in enhancing nuclear safety around the world. His country had 
received assistance under the technical co-operation programme on training for senior 
management at the Qinshan nuclear power plant. China commended all those efforts and 
hoped that the Agency would continue to play a key role in that regard. 
132. The AgencyÂs safeguards constituted an effective barrier against nuclear proliferation 
and its safeguards system had proven its effectiveness for more than 40 years. It was being 
further strengthened by the ÂProgramme 93+2Â and development of the integrated safeguards 
approach. China supported those efforts and looked forward to an even more effective and 
efficient safeguards system. He hoped that a timely report would be made by the Secretariat 
to the Board and the General Conference on the progress of the integrated programme and that 
issues of principle would be subject to the approval of those organs. China considered that the 
Agency had adequate legal authority and technical means to further improve the effectiveness 
of safeguards. 
133. In conclusion, he promised ChinaÂs unswerving support to the Agency in its efforts to 
achieve a better world for mankind. 
134. Mr. VALECA (Romania), having endorsed the statement made by Belgium on 
behalf of the European Union, expressed gratitude for the support his country had received 
from the Agency in implementation of its national nuclear strategy, and also for the recent 
official visit made by the Director General to his country. 
135. His Government attached great importance to development of the nuclear power sector. 
Nuclear power continued to be a reliable source of energy and by the year 2005, when Unit 2 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 28 

of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant reached completion, would constitute 20% of 
RomaniaÂs national electricity production RomaniaÂs national nuclear strategy also provided 
for the continuation of work on Unit 3. R&D efforts were focusing on ensuring the cost 
competitiveness and viability of nuclear energy, which his country believed should be part of 
the global clean energy mix. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to keep the nuclear option 
open and to ensure that nuclear power was given a full and fair hearing in multilateral debates 
under the UNFCCC. 

136. Emphasizing the AgencyÂs key role in the success of the NPT, he urged States that had 
not yet concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency to do so in 
accordance with their NPT obligations. 
137. He reiterated RomaniaÂs commitment to its NPT obligations and said that it was giving 
the Agency every support in implementation of its additional protocol. The first report under 
Article 3 of that protocol had been submitted to the Secretariat in January 2001. A successful 
national workshop on the application of integrated safeguards had recently been held in 
Romania and had concentrated on implementation of the additional protocol at the national 
level, traditional safeguards measures and legal issues. New legislation was being introduced 
to facilitate implementation of the protocol and provide complementary access to all national 
nuclear facilities. 
138. Commending the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, particularly its 
fellowships, scientific visits, training courses and workshops, he said that Romania itself had 
hosted training courses for fellows and scientific visitors from several developing countries. 
Romania was willing to participate more actively in that programme and hoped that the 
Agency would continue to use the two nuclear facilities made available by his Government for 
international and regional training and research, namely the training centre for nuclear safety 
activities at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant and the Institute for Nuclear Research at 
Pitesti. The latter was managing the conversion of its Triga research reactor core from HEU 
to LEU. His Government attached great importance to that conversion and to the 
development of nuclear research activities to support nuclear energy production. It also hoped 
that the Institute for Nuclear Research would be integrated into the regional and international 
network of nuclear research centres, and be used for the production of tracers, radioisotopes 
and medical products. 
139. Decommissioning of the VVR-S research reactor at Magurele was a priority issue and a 
preliminary plan had been elaborated under a national technical co-operation project. The 
reactor had been shut down in December 1997 and no progress had been made owing to lack 
of funds. An important issue yet to be solved was the management of the spent fuel 
originating from the reactor. Romania was hoping that it could be returned to its country of 
origin. 
140. RomaniaÂs national nuclear programme would be ready by the end of 2001, and a draft 
thereof would be forwarded to the Secretariat for its consideration. 

GC(45)/OR.1 
page 29 

141. He expressed support for the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2002-2003 and hoped 
that appropriate balance would be maintained between its verification and promotional 
activities. His country would pay, in full and on time, its financial obligations to the Regular 
Budget and TCF, including its assessed programme costs. 
142. His GovernmentÂs legislative priorities in the nuclear field were to adopt a law on the 
promotion of nuclear activities, a law on civil liability for nuclear damage and a law on the 
safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel. The first had already been drafted and 
took into account the directive of the European Commission on the peaceful promotion of 
nuclear applications. The final draft would be submitted to Parliament for approval by the 
second quarter of 2002. The second was also expected to be put before Parliament at about 
the same time, while the third was still under consideration by Parliament. 
143. Finally, on legislative matters, he said that the law on the safe performance of nuclear 
activities, which had entered into force in 1996, had recently been amended to provide for the 
licensing of private consulting rooms using radioactive sources. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 
(GC(45)/4) 

1. Ms. FERRERO-WALDNER (Austria) said that the recent terrorist attacks against 
the United States had been cowardly acts directed against all the peace-loving people and 
countries of the world. She extended her countryÂs sympathy to the people of the United 
States, the victims and their families and friends. The tragedy was a vivid reminder of the 
responsibility all countries bore in trying to ensure a peaceful existence for human beings 
everywhere and prevent similar outrageous acts in the future. In the context of the AgencyÂs 
work, that meant enhancing nuclear safety and preventing nuclear proliferation. She appealed 
to all Member States to maximize the safety of their nuclear installations, and to the Agency 
to exercise its supervisory capacity in that regard. 
2. It was imperative that maximum levels of nuclear safety be maintained in all phases of 
the nuclear fuel cycle throughout the world. She welcomed the comprehensive reports the 
Secretariat had provided at the BoardÂs meetings during the preceding week on the actions 
taken since the previous General Conference to address safety issues in Member States. 
Austria appreciated the AgencyÂs intensive efforts to enhance nuclear safety, in particular by 
elaborating nuclear safety standards and providing safety services to Member States to 
facilitate their application, and by promoting good international safety practices. 
3. The focus on increasing the safety of nuclear research reactors was particularly 
welcome. It was cause for concern that the Agency had no information about the condition of 
the vast majority of the 651 research reactors worldwide. Furthermore, over half the 
284 operational research reactors were more than 30 years old and Agency missions had 
revealed that many had significant safety problems. Austria thus fully endorsed the BoardÂs 
decision that the Secretariat should develop and implement, in conjunction with Member 
States, an international research reactor safety enhancement plan. It also looked forward to 
the formulation of a legally binding instrument on the safety of nuclear research reactors, 
notably through the addition of a protocol to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. A first, 
welcome step in that direction would be to develop a code of conduct for research reactors. 
4. As one of the 26 countries which had adhered to the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, Austria 
welcomed its entry into force and noted with satisfaction that all of its neighbours which used 
nuclear energy had joined that Convention. Her country was also currently finalizing its 
national report on implementation of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, in preparation for the 
second review meeting of the Contracting Parties. 
5. She welcomed the agreement reached by the European Union with countries which were 
candidates for joining it regarding the closure of nuclear power plants which could not be 
upgraded to comply with prevailing practice in the Union. Austria was particularly concerned 
over the Temelin nuclear power plant and welcomed the initiative of the European Parliament 
to investigate an exit scenario for the plant, and the suggestion that the European Commission 
host a conference on the matter. The example of Temelin demonstrated that, when 
constructing a nuclear power plant, all costs had to be evaluated, especially environmental 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 6 

costs. Her country also attached the utmost importance to the promotion and conclusion of 
the Melk process. 

6. Turning to the role of nuclear power in the sustainable development debate, she noted 
that the outcome of the recent Sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change, where it had been agreed that industrialized 
States should refrain from using emission reduction units generated from nuclear facilities to 
meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, had endorsed her countryÂs long held view 
that nuclear power was not compatible with the concept of sustainable development. The 
latter, if fully applied to the energy sector, would require substantial increases in energy 
efficiency and savings and a switch to renewable energy sources. In any thorough discussion 
of the role of nuclear power, aspects such as the participation of civil society in decision 
making, possible radiological impacts on the public, and the capital requirements for nuclear 
strategies needed to be taken into account. 
7. Austria welcomed the gradual development and implementation of the integrated 
safeguards system, which would allow the Agency to draw well-founded conclusions not only 
about non-diversion of declared nuclear material but also about the absence of undeclared 
nuclear activities. Since the systemÂs development was dependent on the experience gained in 
its implementation, it was important that a large number of additional protocols be in place. 
Regrettably, only some 50 countries had signed additional protocols to date, and even fewer 
had brought them into force. Austria had recently ratified its additional protocol and had 
informed the European Commission accordingly. She commended the Japanese 
GovernmentÂs efforts to foster adherence to additional protocols, and encouraged the Agency 
to organize similar activities along the lines of the international symposium for the Asia and 
Pacific region held in Tokyo earlier in the year. In the context of the preparatory meetings for 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference, her country would be interested in hearing other Member 
StatesÂ views as to whether the conclusion of additional protocols was merely an option or 
whether it constituted a legal obligation deriving directly from Article III(1) of the NPT. 
8. It was disappointing that the Conference on Disarmament had still not been able to open 
negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. Austria attached high importance to such a 
treaty and was convinced that its verification aspect would profit enormously from the 
AgencyÂs vast experience in the verification of nuclear material and activities. 
9. She noted the progress that had been achieved over the preceding year with respect to 
security of nuclear and other radioactive material and, in particular, combating of illicit 
trafficking. Her country continued to support the AgencyÂs activities in that field and she 
commended the role it had played in the organization of the Conference on Security of 
Material held in Stockholm earlier in the year. Austria had completed a three-year pilot study 
on practical testing of border monitoring systems at the end of 2000. 
10. The AgencyÂs work on the possible revision of the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material was also commendable. The expert group which had 
examined that issue had concluded that there was a clear need to strengthen the international 
physical protection regime, prompting the Director General to invite a group of legal and 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 7 

technical experts to draft an amendment to strengthen the Convention. Her country hoped that 
that would lead to the holding of a diplomatic conference to revise the Convention. 

11. Austria subscribed fully to the goals of technical co-operation. Activities in that area 
formed part of the obligations deriving from Article IV of the NPT. Her country supported, 
and would continue to support the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities in the field of 
non-power applications of nuclear energy, and had always been scrupulous in meeting its 
financial obligations in that regard. 
12. With regard to the AgencyÂs budget for 2002, a solution needed to be found to the 
problem of the increased costs which would arise initially from the implementation of new 
safeguards measures under additional protocols and from the development of the integrated 
safeguards system. Any solution considered should not disrupt the delicate balance between 
the different pillars of the AgencyÂs work. 
13. In conclusion, she thanked the Director General and his staff for the great efforts they 
had made over the preceding 12 months to live up to the high expectations of Member States. 
The Agency could count on AustriaÂs continuing support for the coming year. 
14. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) offered his countryÂs condolences to the United States for 
the victims of the dreadful events in New York and Washington, and to those other States 
whose citizens had lost their lives. President Mubarak had written to President Bush 
expressing his solidarity with the people of the United States in the face of those disgraceful 
terrorist acts which the Egyptian Government strongly condemned. 
15. His country supported the growth in the AgencyÂs activities and was therefore deeply 
concerned at the problems faced by the organization in 2000 in providing the necessary 
budgetary resources for many new activities within its core areas of competence. Those 
difficulties had been overcome thanks to the flexibility shown by a number of Member States, 
in particular the Group of 77 and China. In future, the AgencyÂs budget should be viewed 
from an objective and practical perspective, based on priorities set by Member States and on 
the Statute. The former should demonstrate their commitment and not impose artificial 
restrictions on budgetary resources, hindering the Agency from carrying out its functions. 
16. It was particularly important to maintain a balance between the AgencyÂs different 
statutory activities, both in allocating funding and in deciding on areas of activity. That 
essential principle had been reaffirmed repeatedly in General Conference resolutions, and any 
attempt to detract therefrom would have harmful consequences for the organizationÂs future 
and would dissuade many Member States from serious participation in its activities. 
17. Since the AgencyÂs inception, Egypt had co-operated with it closely, developing the 
scientific and practical skills of its manpower through the AgencyÂs various training 
programmes and utilizing technical co-operation programmes to meet its socio-economic 
development requirements. The technical co-operation programme included a number of 
projects in Egypt in a variety of fields. His country was particularly grateful that the 
Department of Technical Co-operation had agreed to include a project on fruit fly control in 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 8 

the current programme. The Agency seminar on small- and medium-sized reactors, held in 
Cairo in May 2001, had also yielded notably positive results. 

18. Egypt made available its expertise and its facilities and laboratories to States in the 
region. It took an active part in the work of the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, hosting many of 
the events organized by the latter and providing training in topics of interest to Arab States in 
the fields of nuclear safety, safe transport of radioactive material, radiation monitoring and 
seawater desalination. In the African region, it had hosted seminars and workshops under 
AFRA during 2000-2001 and had supported a variety of Agency projects. 
19. His country had a long-standing interest in nuclear non-proliferation issues and attached 
high priority to universal application of Agency comprehensive safeguards. There had been 
unanimous agreement at the 2000 NPT Review Conference of May 2000 on the importance of 
that objective. Egypt was surprised at the contradictory positions adopted by some influential 
States active in the non-proliferation field. The efforts of those States to deal with instances 
of failure to comply with internationally established principles in that area consequently 
lacked credibility and smacked of double standards. It was to be hoped that other members of 
the international community would take a clearly defined approach in non-proliferation 
matters and not defend principles in one forum and oppose them in another. Such behaviour 
undermined the non-proliferation regime. 
20. Since signing the NPT in 1968, Egypt had undertaken a number of initiatives to 
eliminate the nuclear danger in the world in general and in the Middle East in particular. In 
1974, it had called for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, an 
initiative which had been endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly on several 
occasions. In April 1990, President Mubarak had called for the establishment of a zone free 
from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. His country favoured the 
application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear installations in the Middle East without 
discrimination, the desirability of which had also been recognized by the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference. 
21. Despite all efforts to achieve equal and mutual security for all States in the region, and 
the flexibility shown by Egypt in trying to understand the viewpoints of all the parties 
concerned and reach acceptable compromises, Israel continued to procrastinate and obstruct 
all efforts aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation and improving security in the region. 
Nevertheless, his country was determined to continue its efforts to achieve universal 
application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. 
22. The AgencyÂs efforts to improve the effectiveness of its technical co-operation 
programmes were commendable, in particular such steps as early consultation with Member 
States on the details of projects to be submitted and greater co-ordination between the 
Secretariat and those responsible for projects. Technical co-operation activities were an 
essential part of the AgencyÂs work and it was important that the funding for them was 
predictable. Though contributions to the TCF were voluntary, States should not take 
advantage of that fact to evade their obligations, particularly since all States were involved in 
setting the target for the Fund.

23. In conclusion, he pledged his countryÂs continuing support for the Agency and its 
activities. 
24. Ms. BONIVER (Italy), said that the horrible attacks on thousands of innocent 
people which had taken place in the preceding week deserved the strongest condemnation 
from all countries and she offered her sincere condolences to the people of the United States. 
25. The current year marked the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Enrico Fermi, whose 
work had paved the way for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. To mark that fact, an 
international conference was being planned in Pisa which could prove a fruitful occasion to 
consider the viability of the nuclear option to meet world energy needs. 
26. The NPT was the cornerstone of the existing non-proliferation regime, and the Agency 
had a fundamental role to play in implementing the Treaty. The review and strengthening of 
the non-proliferation regime were crucial to peace and stability and Italy therefore looked 
forward to the entry into force of the CTBT and supported the early establishment of the 
related verification regime. It also welcomed the efforts to manage and dispose of excess 
stocks of weapons-grade plutonium pursuant to the agreement between the United States and 
the Russian Federation. 
27. The strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the signing of additional 
protocols to safeguards agreements should enable the Agency to provide credible assurance of 
the non-diversion of nuclear material from declared activities. In the coming months, Italy 
expected to complete the process of ratifying its additional protocol. It accorded special 
attention to the implementation of its safeguards agreement, and representatives of its national 
authorities participated regularly in the EURATOM and Agency inspections carried out at its 
nuclear installations. 
28. In view of the importance of the universality of the NPT, her country was deeply 
concerned at the AgencyÂs continuing inability to verify the correctness and completeness of 
the DPRKÂs initial declaration of nuclear material. She urged the DPRK to preserve and 
make available to the Agency all the information required for verification of its initial 
inventory, and commended the Agency on the efforts it had undertaken to monitor the freeze 
on the DPRKÂs nuclear facilities pursuant to the Agreed Framework. She also called upon 
Iraq to allow the Agency to implement its mandate under Security Council resolution 687 and 
related resolutions. 
29. In response to the potential danger of illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive 
material, Italy had recently enhanced the effectiveness of its national monitoring network. 
The International Conference on Security of Material, held in Stockholm earlier in the year, 
had addressed ways and means of preventing and intercepting illicit uses of nuclear material 
and radioactive sources at international level. The Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material could also play a major role in combating illicit trafficking, provided its 
limitations were seriously taken into consideration. Her Government favoured an integrated 
approach to the problem based on the following three measures: firstly, the adoption of a 
resolution at the current session of the General Conference welcoming the endorsement by the 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 10 

Board of the physical protection objectives and fundamental principles referred to in 
document GC(45)/INF/14; secondly, the development and adoption of the security 
fundamentals contained in document INFCIRC/225/Rev.4 (corrected); and thirdly, the 
revision of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, expanding its 
scope and incorporating the fundamental principles. 

30. Italy attached enormous importance to nuclear safety and the safe management of 
radioactive waste. In 2000, it had set up a working group on nuclear waste charged with 
reporting on research and studies in Italy on the siting of a national radioactive waste 
repository, measures to optimize provision of information to the public and levels of 
collaboration with local authorities and the population, and procedures to be followed in 
selecting a final disposal site. Her country also assigned great importance to the AgencyÂs 
efforts to revise the Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material and welcomed 
the recent entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which was essential to achieving and 
maintaining high safety levels worldwide and which Italy was committed to ratifying as early 
as possible. With regard to the problem of scrap containing radioactive sources or carrying 
radioactive contamination, detection systems had been installed at the Italian borders and at 
the entrances of facilities processing scrap in order to reduce the risk of radioactive 
contamination. 
31. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme helped promote national investment by 
recipient countries in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The possibility of 
partnerships with other development organizations in the technical co-operation context 
should be further pursued, and the AgencyÂs efforts to situate its technical co-operation 
programme within the context of UNDAF and the poverty reduction strategies of the United 
Nations was welcome. On the one hand, the aim should be to design a programme with fewer 
but better projects. On the other hand, to persuade Member States to provide the necessary 
human resources and financial input to achieve project objectives the programme would need 
to be reshaped in order to increase efficiency and reduce delivery costs. Any question of the 
provision of permanent additional resources would also be dependent on those factors. 
32. She commended the Secretariat on the initiatives it had undertaken to implement the 
Medium Term Strategy. Member States and the Secretariat needed to join forces to identify 
priorities in order to reconcile a zero-real-growth budget with the activities requested and the 
AgencyÂs statutory obligations. Results-based budgeting offered a means of resolving the 
problem of restoring the balance between the AgencyÂs mandatory and development activities. 
Prioritizing activities involved political choices which had to be made by Member States. 
However, the Agency could not remain neutral since it was in a position to provide Member 
States with useful guidance as they made those political choices, as in the past. 
33. The current budgetary situation of the Agency required new approaches and solutions. 
The level of extrabudgetary funding had increased to 15% of the total funds required for the 
2002-2003 Regular Budget. Moreover, safeguards activities were becoming more and more 
reliant on extrabudgetary resources, which could weaken the effectiveness of the safeguards 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 11 

system. Member States should make every effort to provide the Agency with adequate and 
reliable resources. 

34. As the fifth largest contributor to the AgencyÂs budget, and one which consistently 
honoured its financial obligations, Italy trusted that its political and financial commitment to 
the organization would be matched by an appropriate effort on the part of the Secretariat to 
recruit senior staff members from under-represented Member States of which it was a notable 
example. 
35. In conclusion, she reaffirmed her countryÂs support for the AgencyÂs activities in the 
fields of nuclear safety, nuclear verification and technical co-operation. 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 

(a) 
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS FOR INITIAL 
DISCUSSION 
36. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the 
agenda for the current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in 
document GC(45)/1. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, the 
Committee had recommended that all the items listed in document GC(45)/1 be taken up for 
discussion as indicated in that document. It had also recommended that the order of items 
proposed in document GC(45)/1 be maintained. 
37. The General CommitteeÂs recommendations regarding the agenda for the current session 
were accepted. 
(b) 
CLOSING DATE OF THE SESSION AND OPENING DATE OF THE NEXT 
SESSION 
38. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the 
Conference set Friday, 21 September, as the closing date of the forty-fifth regular session and 
Monday, 16 September 2002, as the opening date of the forty-sixth regular session, which 
would be held in Vienna. 
39. 
The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

40. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee, which had had before it 
requests from Iraq and Kazakhstan for the restoration of their voting rights pursuant to 
Article XIX.A of the Statute, had postponed consideration of IraqÂs request. With regard to 
KazakhstanÂs request, the Committee had recommended that that State be permitted to vote 
during the current session of the Conference in view of its adherence to the payment plan it 
had agreed with the Agency, and that its voting rights be restored until the end of its payment 
plan on the understanding that the Secretariat would report annually on the status of that plan.

41. The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (resumed) 
(GC(45)/4) 

42. Mr. NOVITSKY (Belarus) offered condolences to the relatives of the victims of 
the recent terrorist attacks in the United States. That terrible tragedy was proof of the need for 
the whole international community to unite in the fight against terrorism. 
43. One of the many pressing problems facing mankind was climate change caused by 
greenhouse gas emissions. Belarus advocated the use of all available energy generation 
technologies to meet future energy requirements. Many States were planning to develop, or 
were already developing nuclear power programmes. However, the future of nuclear power 
depended to a great extent on the successful development of new-generation, enhanced-safety, 
proliferation-resistant and economically competitive reactors and fuel cycles. Belarus 
therefore set great store by INPRO, which should open up new opportunities in nuclear power 
technology. It was studying the possibility of setting up its own nuclear power programme; 
however, a decision would only be taken after careful scientific and economic analysis and a 
national referendum on the subject. In the meantime, it recognized the important contribution 
non-power applications of nuclear technology continued to make to sustainable development 
and considered that further work should be done to publicize the comparative advantages of 
nuclear technologies. 
44. Belarus had demonstrated its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation by voluntarily 
renouncing nuclear weapons, signing the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State, and concluding 
a safeguards agreement with the Agency. It had also been one of the first States to sign the 
CTBT and had already ratified that Treaty. His country was committed to strengthening the 
international security regime, inter alia through the United Nations, and urged other countries 
to support its election to the Security Council. 
45. Improving radiation safety was a major challenge for all States. Agency documentation 
on that subject should address the need to account not only for lost radiation sources, but also 
for located orphan sources at international level. International undertakings by States to 
co-operate on matters relating to the safety and security of radiation sources, including 
identification of the owners of lost sources, return of such sources to their country of origin, 
and information exchange, would facilitate the wider application of the Basic Safety 
Standards. 
46. His country attached great importance to strengthening of the international physical 
protection regime and called upon all Member States to accede to the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It also welcomed the conclusions of the informal 
open-ended expert meeting which had been convened to discuss the possible revision of the 
Convention. The Agency should broaden the scope of its activities aimed at combating illicit 
trafficking of nuclear and radioactive material and continue its training and 
infrastructure-related activities. Belarus was also interested in participating in the programme 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 13 

for return of spent fuel from research reactors which was being discussed in connection with 
the Trilateral Initiative. 

47. For the past 15 years, Belarus had been suffering from the consequences of the 
Chernobyl disaster: over 6000 km2 of land, or 23% of its territory, could no longer be put to 
productive use because of radionuclide contamination, including almost 3000 km2 of 
agricultural land; the health situation of people living in the affected areas had deteriorated; 
and there had been an unprecedented rise in the incidence of thyroid disease among children. 
The country did not have the means to cope with the problems stemming from the Chernobyl 
accident and was therefore grateful for the assistance it had received from the Agency. It also 
welcomed the proposal for an international forum on the consequences of Chernobyl. Belarus 
was also actively involved in the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, in particular in 
projects aimed at mitigating the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, one example of 
which was the project on production of oil from rapeseed grown on contaminated land. 
48. Mr. HASSAN (Sudan) said that his country strongly condemned terrorism and 
violence and offered its sincere condolences to the people and Government of the United 
States of America, and to the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attacks. He called 
upon the international community to join forces to rid the world of the threat of terrorism. 
49. The AgencyÂs work in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was 
commendable, and Sudan also fully supported its efforts to eliminate the risks resulting from 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy via international agreements in that field. In that 
connection, he stressed the urgent need to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East. That objective could only be attained through a comprehensive treaty which was 
binding on all parties. 
50. Unfortunately however, Israel still refused to sign the NPT. He called upon the 
international community to reject double standards and condemn the barbaric Israeli practices 
in the occupied Palestinian territories. In particular, the Agency, together with the 
international community, should investigate the use by Israel of depleted uranium against 
peaceful demonstrations by Palestinians. 
51. The AgencyÂs efforts to achieve greater transparency and the more active participation 
by Member States in the various stages of project programming and evaluation under the 
technical co-operation programme were commendable, as was the emphasis on TCDC and 
support for less developed countries. Technical co-operation constituted an integral part of 
the AgencyÂs activities pursuant to the Statute and an obligation under the NPT. It was thus 
important to strengthen financing thereof, and he urged Member States and donors worldwide 
to be generous in their pledges to the TCF. 
52. The technical co-operation programme had made an outstanding contribution to 
improving the capabilities of developing countries in the fields of medicine, health, industry, 
water resources, energy, the environment, and nuclear and radiological safety. The civil war 
in Sudan had impeded implementation of the Agency programme on eradication of the tsetse 
fly using the SIT in the south of the country. The Sudanese Government was willing to 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 14 

initiate a ceasefire to allow the Agency to implement its tsetse control activities. He hoped 
that the international community would exercise pressure on the rebels to bring about the 
ceasefire. He appealed to donors to support the AgencyÂs efforts to apply the SIT to the 
eradication of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Moreover, as the problem of water shortages 
became progressively more acute, it was important that the Agency continued and expanded 
its activities on the production of potable water economically and on use of isotope hydrology 
for water resource management. Finally, he commended the Agency and Member States on 
the success of projects implemented in the African region and called upon donors to support 
the AFRA programme. 

53. It was important that Member States supported the efforts to promote co-operation and 
co-ordination among the parties to nuclear and radiation safety conventions. There was also a 
need to elaborate legislation in that area and provide for adequate capacity-building. Sudan 
was making every effort to ratify agreements it had entered into in the context of the Agency. 
In that connection, he announced that his country had recently accepted the amendment to 
Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, and he urged other Member States to do likewise. 
54. Mr. STASHEVSKY (Ukraine) offered condolences to the United States of 
America in connection with the recent terrorist attacks in that country. Bitter lessons had to 
be learned from those events. In particular, any efforts in the fields of nuclear 
non-proliferation, nuclear safety and environmental protection would have to take account of 
the need to combat terrorism. 
55. Ukraine continued to make considerable use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
Nuclear power, alongside thermal power plants, would form the basis of the electricity 
generation sector of the country for the foreseeable future, hence the importance of taking 
appropriate measures to extend the operating life of nuclear power plants. Agency assistance 
with research, technology transfer and exchange of experience was seen as a highly important 
aspect of international co-operation in the nuclear field. There was also significant potential 
for growth in the use of nuclear energy in industry, agriculture and medicine in the country. 
56. Fifteen years previously, Ukraine had battled to protect the world from the dangers of 
the greatest man-made disaster of the twentieth century, the Chernobyl accident. It had paid a 
high price in that battle, and would continue to do so for a long time to come. In keeping with 
its international obligations, on 15 December 2000 it had shut down the last reactor still in 
service in Chernobyl. Unfortunately, it continued to bear the brunt of the problems caused by 
the accident alone. The shutting down of Unit 3 had actually exacerbated the unresolved 
problems. An adequate infrastructure still needed to be put in place for the safe 
decommissioning of the plant, and the lost capacity had to be replaced. In particular, the large 
quantities of radioactive waste which would be generated during the decommissioning process 
would have to be disposed of. His Government was grateful for the assistance it was 
receiving from the European Union and the G-7 countries, in particular the United States, with 
those problems. 
57. Work was under way to make the Shelter ecologically safe. The second phase of the 
work, to start soon, would entail strengthening the most critical structures, putting an optimum 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 15 

containment in place, and dealing with other problems related to nuclear and radiation safety 
and processing of radioactive waste. Progress had been good on the whole, and the EBRD 
and the countries involved in carrying out the project had made a useful contribution. Finding 
a replacement for the lost capacity was a major problem. In that connection, he noted that the 
construction and commissioning of the two new units at the Khmelnitski and Rovno nuclear 
power plants would be completed in line with international safety standards. Two new 
Agency technical co-operation projects were addressing the problems of decommissioning the 
Chernobyl plant and making the Shelter ecologically safe. 

58. Ukraine supported unreservedly the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international 
co-operation on nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. In view of the risk to the 
public, a conceptual and methodological basis needed to be elaborated for regulatory radiation 
monitoring that took account of the combined effect of radiation from different sources. The 
Agency should continue to work on that problem with a view to developing and improving 
international recommendations in the field. In that connection, the experience gathered by 
Ukraine in decommissioning the Chernobyl plant should be made accessible to experts from 
Agency Member States. 
59. The international community continued to face urgent problems in the nuclear and 
radiation safety field. Ukraine had learned first-hand the cost of underestimating safety 
problems. It supported the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance safety levels and, in particular, to 
implement the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It also welcomed the entry into force of the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management. Earlier in the year, the President of Ukraine had established by decree an 
independent State nuclear regulatory body. His country firmly supported the efforts of the 
international community to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime and had rigorously 
fulfilled its obligations in that regard, notwithstanding the difficult economic situation in the 
country. He thanked the Agency for its understanding attitude towards his countryÂs problems 
and the support it had provided. An adequate legislative infrastructure had been put in place 
for the implementation of UkraineÂs safeguards agreement, an SSAC had been set up, and his 
country was involved in the programme to prevent illicit trafficking. His Government 
attached particular importance to strengthening the international regime for the physical 
protection of nuclear material and was in favour of revising the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material, in which process it was prepared to play an active part. 
60. Within the technical co-operation programme, his country looked forward to ongoing 
co-operation with the Agency in such areas as extension of the operating life of reactors 
currently in service, provision of expert support on strategic planning for development of the 
energy sector, enhancement of the safety of nuclear power plants, decommissioning of nuclear 
power plants and quality assurance programmes. It was also pleased that Ukrainian nationals 
were being involved in regional technical co-operation projects. 
61. Mr. EYYUBOV (Azerbaijan) extended his countryÂs sympathy to the Government 
and people of the United States in connection with the terrorist attacks in New York and 
Washington. Azerbaijan condemned terrorism in all its forms. It should be remembered that 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 16 

uncontrolled access to nuclear material and waste constituted a potential terrorist risk to the 
international community. 

62. International co-operation on control of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, radiation 
safety and other related matters was one of AzerbaijanÂs priorities, given its strategic 
geographical location. It fully supported the principle of universal nuclear disarmament and 
was determined to play an active role in ensuring full compliance with the international 
nuclear safety regime. 
63. In 1997, AzerbaijanÂs President had called for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone 
in Southern Caucasus. Regrettably that initiative had not been carried through owing to the 
occupation of 20% of AzerbaijanÂs territory by its neighbour, Armenia. As a result, a 
significant proportion of the countryÂs frontiers were no longer under Government control, 
which greatly increased the risk of illicit trafficking in radioactive material, thereby 
jeopardizing the security of the whole region. A further concern was the restart of nuclear 
power plants whose technology was obsolete. 
64. Although Azerbaijan had no uranium mines, enrichment plants, nuclear power plants, 
military bases with nuclear weapons or testing grounds, the problem of dealing with radiation 
sources and radioactive waste had always been a pressing concern. ManÂs interference in the 
environment, together with global and regional climatic changes, was having serious, 
sometimes disastrous and possibly irreversible consequences for the ecosystem and the local 
population. A comprehensive programme to detect and dispose of radiation sources and 
radioactive contamination of human origin on the Apsheron Peninsula had confirmed fears. 
His country was counting on Agency assistance to carry out detailed radiation monitoring of 
the contaminated areas. Given the many different sources of radioactive waste and the serious 
radiation situation in many parts of the country, the problem of economically containing that 
waste required urgent attention. 
65. In view of AzerbaijanÂs geopolitical situation, strict border controls were necessary to 
curb any attempts at the illegal trafficking of nuclear material and radiation sources through 
the country. In recent years, vigorous efforts had been made to provide equipment and 
training for border guards, customs officials and medical staff; however, those measures could 
not have full effect while a sizeable part of AzerbaijanÂs territory and frontiers remained under 
the control of a foreign occupying power. 
66. His country was elaborating legislation on radiation safety. Laws prohibiting the import 
of nuclear and radioactive waste into the country had already been passed. With the AgencyÂs 
assistance, legislation on accounting and control of nuclear and radioactive material had been 
harmonized. Training was being provided to local specialists through short courses and 
seminars organized by the Agency, but more assistance was required in that area, in particular 
for the introduction of new techniques. Another pressing task was the complete centralized 
inventorying and certification of all ionizing radiation sources, radioisotope equipment and 
other items belonging to public and private entities. It was also important to promote greater 
awareness of environmental issues among specialized staff and the public at large. 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 17 

67. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) extended his countryÂs sympathy to the 
people of the United States and the innocent victims of the recent terrorist attacks. It was 
imperative that the international community join forces to combat terrorism. 
68. For almost a year, the Middle East had been witnessing a serious escalation in the 
hostilities against Palestinians by Israel. The Israeli war machine attacked children, women, 
the elderly and the disabled, and destroyed the homes of Palestinian families, giving no heed 
to international conventions and charters. Furthermore, Israel was proceeding unscrupulously 
to build new settlements on occupied Palestinian territories. Successive Israeli governments 
had failed to respect agreements concluded with their predecessors, they had adopted racist 
practices and had obstructed efforts to reach a permanent solution to the conflict in the region. 
Israel had even gone as far as to exploit the recent terrorist attacks in the United States to 
justify the perpetuation of its own terrorist campaign against Palestinians. 
69. His country still believed that a peace that preserved the rights and dignity of all parties 
was possible. For four consecutive years, the agenda of the General Conference had included 
an item on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat. It was time that due attention was paid to 
that issue, the main aim being to achieve implementation of Security Council 
resolution 487 (1981) which called upon Israel to place its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East would 
remain impossible unless Israel agreed to join the NPT and subject its facilities to safeguards. 
All States in the Middle East with the exception of Israel had signed and ratified the NPT and 
had concluded safeguards agreements. 
70. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had confirmed the importance of that issue and the 
role the Agency was called upon to play in it. IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons 
constituted a clear threat to world peace and security, quite apart from the risk posed by its 
unmonitored storage of nuclear material and waste. It was unacceptable that one State should 
enjoy exceptional treatment at the expense of others. He therefore appealed to the 
international community to place pressure on Israel to subject its mysterious nuclear activities 
to Agency safeguards. 
71. The Director GeneralÂs report on the application of safeguards in the Middle East, which 
was contained in document GC(45)/19, indicated that the activities of the multilateral working 
group on arms control and regional security had been halted since 1994. IsraelÂs refusal to 
abide by its commitments had blocked the peace process and threatened to explode it. Peace 
could not be attained without confidence-building, transparency and the necessary political 
will. One blatant example of double standards was that successive resolutions on the 
application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East had failed to indicate explicitly that Israel 
was the only State in the region that had not yet jointed the NPT. 
72. There was an urgent need to raise the level of the TCF in order to ensure that assistance 
could be provided to the increasing number of developing Member States. Projects 
implemented using TCF resources helped developing countries meet their development needs 
through nuclear technology transfer, and such assistance should not be limited by unnecessary 
constraints. There was a need to review the AgencyÂs technical co-operation strategy in close 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 18 

collaboration with Member States, in particular recipient Member States, with a view to 
realistically evaluating that strategy. 

73. In the preceding year, a group of West Asian countries had submitted a proposal to the 
Agency for a regional co-operation agreement. Following intensive consultations with the 
Secretariat, the text of an agreement had been elaborated and he hoped that it would soon be 
endorsed. 
74. The Syrian Atomic Energy Commission, in collaboration with the Agency, had 
organized a one-year graduate diploma course in radiation protection in Arabic from which 
the first batch of students had graduated in the preceding year. It had also organized field 
training and training courses for technicians from West Asian countries on a variety of topics. 
His country appreciated the existing co-operation between the Agency and the Syrian Atomic 
Energy Commission and was eager to expand it with a view to strengthening nuclear 
technology development and transfer activities in Arab Member States. 
75. Mr. COLOMBANI (France) offered condolences to the people of the United 
States and the relatives of the victims in connection with the recent terrorist attacks. France 
had consistently condemned all acts of terrorism. 
76. The NPT was the cornerstone of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, of 
which the Agency safeguards system was an essential instrument. Two priorities had emerged 
from the 2000 NPT Review Conference: the need to continue working towards achieving the 
entry into force of the CTBT and also to open negotiations within the Conference on 
Disarmament on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. He 
urged the members of the Conference on Disarmament to overcome their differences and open 
negotiations without delay. He also appealed to all States which had yet to sign or ratify the 
CTBT, especially those States whose ratification was a prerequisite for the entry into force of 
the Treaty, to do so at an early date, expressing the hope that real progress would have been 
made in that regard by the next NPT Review Conference. 
77. To be fully effective, Agency safeguards agreements had to be universal. To date, 
over 50 States which were party to the NPT had yet to comply with their obligation under 
Article III to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency; he called upon 
them to do so without delay, and to sign and implement an additional protocol. In France, the 
parliamentary procedure for ratification of its additional protocol was under way and should 
be concluded soon. In countries where an additional protocol was in force, the Secretariat 
would be in a position to apply integrated safeguards, which was the optimum situation from 
the standpoint of effectiveness and cost. France actively and strongly supported the AgencyÂs 
efforts to design and implement the new system. 
78. The situation in Iraq remained a matter of concern. Since 16 December 1998, the 
Agency had not been in a position to conduct activities pursuant to the Security Council 
resolutions pertaining to Iraq, and it thus could not provide any assurance as to that countryÂs 
compliance with its obligations. France appreciated the efforts of the Director General and 
the Action Team to implement the resolutions and maintain the AgencyÂs operational 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 19 

capability. It also noted that, in January 2001, the Agency had satisfactorily verified the 
physical inventory of nuclear material pursuant to IraqÂs safeguards agreement. However, that 
could not be a substitute for the activities the Agency was called upon to perform under 
Security Council resolutions. He therefore called on Iraq to implement all Security Council 
resolutions, including resolution 1284, and to co-operate fully with the Agency, in particular 
by granting it the access required for it to carry out its mandate. 

79. The Agency had made some limited progress in preparing the activities needed to verify 
the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs initial declaration. Nevertheless, France 
deplored the DPRKÂs continuing failure to comply with the obligations it had entered into by 
acceding to the NPT, and it urged the DPRK authorities to allow the Agency to carry out its 
mission, and to respond positively to the AgencyÂs recent technical proposals and initiate the 
co-operation that would lead to the verification of its initial declaration. 
80. France had been an active participant to the work of the group of experts convened to 
discuss whether there was a need to revise the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material. While it felt that the group had found no compelling reason for revising the 
Convention, it had noted with interest the results of that exercise, in particular the drafting of 
physical protection objectives and fundamental principles which provided the conceptual 
framework needed for defining any physical protection policy or measure. 
81. While the primary objective of the AgencyÂs verification activities was nuclear 
non-proliferation, those activities were also crucial to the dissemination of knowledge and to 
the development of peaceful nuclear applications. France had always been a strong supporter 
of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. In addition to making a substantial 
contribution to the TCF and participating in several footnote-a/ projects, it provided services 
and experts to the Agency and recipient countries and hosted many trainees. 
82. The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management, had entered into force on 18 June 2001. France intended to 
meet its commitments scrupulously and to participate as actively as possible in the 
implementation of the Convention, in particular the review meetings. Attracting the largest 
possible number of parties to the Convention would bolster the international communityÂs 
confidence in the quality and safety of management of the back-end of the fuel cycle in 
signatory countries. He therefore called upon all States which had not yet signed or ratified 
the Convention to do so as soon as possible so that the co-operation mechanisms provided for 
in the Convention could be put in place by 2002. 
83. In the preceding year, WENRA had issued a report giving a comprehensive evaluation 
of the nuclear safety situation in countries which were candidates for European Union 
membership. The conclusions drawn in that document, and the progress it revealed with 
regard to harmonization of nuclear safety in Europe, were encouraging. France remained 
committed, in particular within the context of the G-7, to the objective of enhancing safety 
standards in Eastern Europe. That task was a long-term process, but one that had to be 
pursued with determination as the credibility of all nuclear activities was at stake. Finally, it 
should be stressed that the independence of safety authorities was of prime importance.

84. The preparation of the AgencyÂs budget for 2002-2003 had highlighted the growing 
difficulty of striking a balance between the resources available to the Secretariat and the 
expenditure required to accomplish its tasks. He commended the efforts the Director General 
and the Secretariat had made to ensure better control of expenditure, and encouraged them to 
continue those efforts and look for further productivity gains and management savings 
wherever possible. Although his country supported the principle of cost neutrality in real 
terms, the Agency had to be able to carry out its statutory tasks, and Member States had to 
respond to that need in the interest of both international peace and security and the 
development of international co-operation for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
85. Nuclear power was currently showing clear signs of renewed vitality in countries which 
had chosen it as an energy source to ensure sustainable development of their economies. One 
consideration which had prompted a reappraisal of nuclear powerÂs role in energy strategies 
had been concern over security of energy supplies. In November 2000, the European 
Commission, faced with the prospect of worsening energy dependency in the coming 20 years, 
had published a Green Paper entitled ÂTowards a European strategy for the security of energy 
supplyÂ which acknowledged the importance of nuclear power as a domestic source of 
electricity, its competitiveness and its continuing role in an expanded European Union over 
the coming 30 years. 
86. The concept of energy security had always been central to FranceÂs energy strategy. By 
building 58 nuclear reactors which produced 76-78% of its electricity, his country had 
doubled its level of energy independence over a quarter of a century despite having no fossil 
fuel resources. 
87. Other, environmental concerns had emerged in addition to the question of energy supply 
constraints, in particular the problem of global warming. In that context, the merits of nuclear 
power as an energy source which generated no greenhouse gases were indisputable. The 
European CommissionÂs Green Paper also took that point into consideration and recognized 
that, without nuclear power, abiding by the commitments undertaken by the European Union 
in Kyoto would be a major challenge. Many Governments had emphasized the extraordinary 
asset nuclear power represented in the struggle to reduce greenhouse emissions. 
88. At the same time, much thought had been devoted to the competitiveness of the nuclear 
option. A French report which had confirmed the competitiveness of nuclear power in France 
had been followed by other studies. Encouraged by the reappraisal of nuclear power, France 
had pursued its research work in the field, in particular within the framework of international 
co-operation. The Generation IV initiative, in which France was taking part, should make 
nuclear power even more competitive and safe, reducing waste levels and improving 
proliferation resistance. His country was also following closely the INPRO initiative and 
hoped that it would complement Generation IV. Research of that kind was indispensable to 
improve the acceptability of nuclear power. 
89. In France, the past year had been a time of reorganization with a view to improving 
efficiency in research and safety, and building a first-rate industrial base. The Commissariat Ã  
lÂÃ©nergie atomique had structured its research and development activities around major 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 21 

themes. One related to the nuclear field and aimed at providing the scientific and 
technological support required to enhance competitiveness and safety, and at preparing for the 
future by pressing on with research on waste and future nuclear systems; a second related to 
fundamental research and focused on material and life sciences, placing special emphasis on 
the biological effects of ionizing radiation which was an issue that had a crucial impact on 
nuclear energyÂs public image; a third related to technology and defence. 

90. As part of the ongoing reorganization in the field of nuclear safety and radiation 
protection, a new single radiation protection and nuclear safety research institute had been set 
up by merging two separate institutes. Moreover, in July 2000 the Government had 
introduced a draft law on transparency and security in the nuclear industry aimed at increasing 
public access to information in order to encourage constructive dialogue between the industry, 
the public authorities and civil society. Much progress had been made in the nuclear safety 
area in 2000, notably in the fields of radiation protection and environmental impact, and 
transparency of nuclear activities. However, the French authorities and plant operators would 
continue their efforts in that direction and remain vigilant, especially with regard to discharges 
into the environment and the role of the human factor in safety. 
91. A major reorganization was currently under way in the French nuclear industry. On 
3 September, a decision had been taken to combine CEA Industrie, COGEMA and 
FRAMATOME SA into one industrial group to be called AREVA. Its activities would be 
divided into two main areas: nuclear technologies and services, and information and 
communication technologies. It would combine all aspects of the French nuclear industry, 
from the fuel cycle to site clean-up and decommissioning, from engineering services to 
reactors and fuel, thus optimizing synergies between the different parts of the nuclear industry 
so as to offer better service to electricity utilities. The reorganization would also give 
AREVA enormous innovation capabilities in the research and development field. With a staff 
of 45 000 its turnover would be 10 000 million euros, three quarters of which would be in 
nuclear technology activities. 
92. Ms. MÃLLER (Germany) offered condolences to the Government and the people 
of the United States of America in connection with the horrible and tragic events of the 
preceding week which had claimed so many lives and caused so much suffering and 
destruction. 
93. The German GovernmentÂs new policy of phasing out nuclear energy had made an 
important step forward over the preceding year. A text negotiated with four major utility 
companies had been signed in June 2001 on the basis of which the Government had 
introduced a bill amending key provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. The goal was to end 
promotion of nuclear energy and terminate, in an orderly fashion, the industrial use of nuclear 
energy for electricity production. The bill had been prepared in co-operation with the utility 
companies concerned, and it was expected to be adopted by the end of the year. That new 
policy would not prevent Germany from remaining an active and constructive member of the 
Agency. 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 22 

94. Her country would, of course, continue to co-operate in nuclear research and 
development projects which contributed to the safe operation of nuclear power plants 
worldwide, and to promote improvements in the safety and proliferation resistance of nuclear 
installations and the fuel cycle. It would also continue to support the AgencyÂs programmes in 
nuclear sciences and applications. The AgencyÂs activities in the fields of food and 
agriculture, human health and water resources it viewed as being of particular importance, and 
it was following the AgencyÂs project on demining techniques with particular attention. It was 
also aware that technical co-operation needed the full backing of all Member States, including 
through regular payments to the TCF. 
95. Germany was committed to making the international non-proliferation system more 
universal and workable. It had been one of the first countries to meet the internal 
requirements for the entry into force of the additional protocol negotiated between the Agency 
and the 13 non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union and hoped that that instrument 
would soon enter into force throughout the Union. It invited all Member States which had not 
yet done so to sign and ratify additional protocols and urged them to support the Department 
of Safeguards in its efforts to develop the new integrated safeguards system. 
96. The AgencyÂs programmes and activities in the field of nuclear safety were of universal 
importance. Together with other Member States of the European Union, Germany was 
currently engaged in an intensive dialogue with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe 
which were candidates for membership of the Union on present and future nuclear safety 
standards. The AgencyÂs programmes on the safety aspects of WWER and RBMK reactors 
had been extremely useful in the European UnionÂs enlargement process. 
97. The Agency was one of the most important international organizations and deserved the 
strong support of all countries, irrespective of whether they were committed to nuclear energy 
or not. The worldÂs safety and security depended on the AgencyÂs effective and efficient 
work. 
98. Mr. WÃHLK (Denmark) said that the Danish Government and people had been 
deeply shocked by the horrible recent tragedy in the United States and wished to express their 
profound sympathy with the victims and their families. 
99. The NPT was the cornerstone of global non-proliferation and an essential foundation for 
nuclear disarmament. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had clearly reaffirmed those 
universal principles, and Agency safeguards were a fundamental pillar of the international 
non-proliferation regime and indispensable for ensuring the implementation of the NPT. 
Denmark called upon those countries which were not yet party to the Treaty to join it as soon 
as possible and without conditions. 
100. The NPT Review Conference had also endorsed the measures contained in the Model 
Additional Protocol which, once implemented, should greatly strengthen the safeguards 
system, placing the Agency in a much better position to detect clandestine nuclear activities in 
non-nuclear-weapon States. Denmark was party to the additional protocol signed by the 
Agency, EURATOM and the 13 non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union in 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 23 

September 1998, and it was committed to implementing the new obligations in a concerted 
move with its European Union partners in 2001; he urged other Member States to sign and 
implement additional protocols. 

101. It remained cause for concern that 53 of the non-nuclear-weapon States party to the NPT 
had not yet signed even basic safeguards agreements in accordance with their obligations 
under the Treaty. Although some agreements still pending might relate to States with no 
significant nuclear activities, it was important for the universality and credibility of the NPT 
and the safeguards system that all States comply with their obligations. 
102. Supplier countries had always recognized their responsibility for ensuring that 
international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy did not contribute to the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. That principle was enshrined in the NPT and reflected in 
the multilateral consultation systems on nuclear export control put into place after the entry 
into force of the Treaty in 1970. Effective export control was a precondition for fulfilling the 
commitment contained in the NPT concerning co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. The Nuclear Suppliers Group had made a very important contribution to the cause of 
nuclear non-proliferation and Denmark fully endorsed the endeavours to make the measures in 
the additional protocol a condition for supply, and it was working with others to promote and 
enhance adherence to the principles that guided the activities of the Group. Deeper 
understanding and broader knowledge of the above issues would be furthered through 
continued transparency of supplier arrangements. 
103. The Danish Government attached the utmost importance to nuclear safety. Sixteen 
years earlier, Denmark had decided that nuclear power should not be included in its energy 
planning. That decision had been based on its assessment that the problems of safety and 
waste storage remained unsolved, despite the many years that nuclear energy had been in use. 
Many nuclear power plants operated at unacceptably low levels of safety, and nuclear waste 
management was still unsatisfactory. In particular, there was no evidence that spent fuel and 
high-level radioactive waste could be safely managed in the long term. For that reason, 
nuclear power could not be considered a sustainable source of energy. Denmark belonged to a 
growing group of countries which could not support nuclear power as an option in the context 
of sustainable development, and he trusted that that trend would be duly recognized by the 
Agency and its policy-making organs. 
104. His country supported the ongoing endeavours to strengthen safety activities and ensure 
consistency between the AgencyÂs nuclear, radiation and radioactive waste safety activities. 
The assistance the Agency had provided in that area to the States of Central and Eastern 
Europe and the newly independent States was of paramount importance. However, his 
Government remained of the opinion that the only defensible solution for certain reactors 
operating in Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States was to shut them 
down as soon as possible. 
105. Denmark supported the creation of a comprehensive and legally binding safety regime 
founded on the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the Convention 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 24 

on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It also endorsed the ongoing work on the 
revision of the latter instrument. The need to strengthen the nuclear liability regime was a 
matter of concern for the entire international community. The amendment of the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and the Convention on Supplementary 
Compensation for Nuclear Damage were steps in the right direction. 

106. Turning to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, he said that his country 
found it disturbing that so much effort was being expended worldwide to extend the use of 
nuclear power, despite the fact that no sustainable solutions had been found to the problems of 
safety and waste storage. In his countryÂs view, the AgencyÂs technical assistance activities 
should not be used for the general promotion of nuclear power, and no resolution should 
affirm that there was a consensus among Member States to further the application of nuclear 
power. Programmes should be demand-driven and should contribute to ensuring the highest 
possible safety standards in those countries which had chosen the nuclear option as part of 
their energy supply, or to use nuclear technology applications in their efforts to meet their 
development needs. That applied especially to the least developed countries among the 
AgencyÂs members. It was on that understanding that Denmark had accepted the target of 
73 million dollars for the TCF for 2002 and had already pledged its full share of that target. In 
conclusion, he urged other Member States also to pledge and pay their assessed share in full. 
107. Ms. SHABANGU (South Africa) offered sympathy and condolences to the people 
of the United States and all countries that had suffered loses in the tragic events of the 
preceding week. 
108. The Annual Report demonstrated the AgencyÂs unflinching commitment to its 
objectives amid rising tendencies towards unilateralism in the nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation field, a development which had the potential of scuttling agreed 
international treaty regimes and conventions in the nuclear field. The Agency was to be 
commended for its work in accelerating and enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to 
peace, health and prosperity throughout the world, and it could count on the co-operation and 
support of her country. 
109. For developing countries, technical co-operation was of significant importance for their 
socio-economic development, and it was important to maintain an adequate balance between 
technical co-operation and the AgencyÂs other statutory activities. South Africa would 
continue its efforts to maintain a healthy TCF by pledging and paying its target share and its 
assessed programme costs in full and on time, in the interests of achieving the rate of 
attainment set at the preceding session of the General Conference. Some thought should also 
be given to whether it was appropriate to endorse the judicious application by the Board of the 
due account principle. Giving preference to those recipients which provided financial support 
to the technical co-operation programme was appropriate, but such arrangements should be 
applied in a manner which did not discriminate against those who could not afford to provide 
such support. The Secretariat could also consider the possibility of gradually reducing the 
level of assistance provided as the GDP of recipient countries increased. Furthermore, in 
seeking to reduce the number of projects, due consideration should be given to ensuring that 
projects which enhanced socio-economic development in developing countries were not 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 25 

compromised. Concerted efforts were needed to support the Partnership in Development 
concept and thematic planning. Moreover, some judgement should be exercised in moving 
towards greater utilization of regional projects. 

110. With regard to the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2002-2003, bolder attempts 
should be made to minimize reliance on extrabudgetary resources, since such reliance made 
the Agency vulnerable to sudden decisions to withhold funds and could have a debilitating 
effect on the implementation of nuclear-related projects meant to advance socio-economic 
development in the South. The Secretariat should increase efforts to avoid unbalanced 
expenditure patterns in the context of the AgencyÂs overall statutory obligations. In particular, 
it should strive to maintain a balance between the safeguards component of the budget and 
other statutory activities. 
111. Demands for energy were rising and would continue to do so in the future, hence the 
need to consider all energy options seriously. In the preceding year, South Africa had 
embarked on a feasibility study and an environmental impact assessment of the pebble bed 
modular reactor. The feasibility study had been completed, the environmental impact 
assessment was nearing completion, and the evaluation of the safety aspects continued under 
the auspices of the national nuclear regulatory body which would also handle the licensing of 
both the demonstration plant and the fuel manufacturing plant. A review panel composed of 
local and international experts had been assembled to evaluate the detailed feasibility report. 
It included people who might not necessarily be in favour of the technology, in the interests of 
ensuring a balanced and objective analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, and that the 
country embarked upon a sustainable path. South Africa had also initiated a postgraduate 
course on pebble bed modular reactor technology in order to build capacity in that field. 
Although the course focused on local needs, it could serve as a foundation for an international 
training programme on high-temperature reactor technology. 
112. In all those activities, the question of safety continued to receive serious attention, 
thanks to the AgencyÂs guidance and its development of an integrated set of safety standards 
which sought to address, inter alia, the safety of non-reactor fuel cycle facilities. She 
commended the AgencyÂs publication of safety standards on pre-disposal management of 
radioactive waste and regulatory control of radioactive discharges, though much work 
remained to be done to enhance the culture of safety. 
113. More effort needed to be devoted to establishing standards on geological disposal, 
including more innovative solutions to the problem of radioactive waste management. South 
Africa would continue to assist in meeting that challenge. It was also trying to find lasting 
solutions to the problem of regulatory control of naturally occurring radioactive material for 
which internationally consistent criteria had not been fully developed. 
114. Mindful of the scarcity of human capacity in the field of nuclear technology, later in the 
year South Africa would be hosting a regional postgraduate course on radiation protection. It 
appreciated the AgencyÂs ongoing support for that programme which aimed at promoting 
human capacity development and ensuring that nuclear technology was used in a safe and 
sustainable manner. 

GC(45)/OR.2 
page 26 

115. South Africa was proud to be hosting the 2002 world summit on sustainable 
development. It was significant that the United Nations General Assembly had decided that 
that event, whose aim was to assess global change since the historic 1992 United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development, should be held in a developing country. In 
Johannesburg, in September 2002, the world would take a critical look back at UNCED and 
the past ten years with a view to reinvigorating the global commitment to sustainable 
development. She called upon the Agency to contribute to the summit by highlighting the 
importance of nuclear power and non-power nuclear applications for global and 
country-specific sustainable development. 
116. In conclusion, she noted that the South African Government had undertaken all the 
necessary steps to enable it to sign its additional protocol and was in the process of concluding 
the administrative requirements for it to sign the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
The meeting rose at 6.00 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 
(GC(45)/4) 

1. Mr. SOERIAATMADJA (Indonesia) said his Government was shocked at the 
tragic events of 11 September in New York and Washington. His delegation expressed 
condolences to the bereaved families. 
2. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to expand the application of nuclear science and 
technology with a view to enhancing the quality of life, especially in developing countries. 
His country had recently inaugurated the Polytechnics Institute of Nuclear Science and 
Technology in Yogyakarta and, within the framework of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation, 
had expanded its capabilities in important areas such as agriculture, livestock production, 
human health, industry and environmental protection. The AgencyÂs pre-project mission 
relating to the 2003-2004 technical co-operation programme had greatly assisted Indonesia in 
preparing its technical co-operation projects in line with the CPF and thematic planning. 
3. In the face of current economic difficulties, Indonesia had intensified its efforts to 
transfer R&D results to the community in order to accelerate economic development based on 
agriculture, animal production, fisheries, and small- and medium-scale industries. To bolster 
the staple food supply, nuclear technology had been used to provide Indonesian farmers with 
several new varieties of rice, soybean and mungbean. Significant progress had been made in 
developing nuclear techniques to improve animal reproduction and animal health. Feed 
supplementation technology had been transferred to farmers to increase meat and milk 
production under a scheme involving various ministries, provincial governments, universities, 
non-governmental organizations and the private sector. Indonesia was grateful for the 
AgencyÂs support for its efforts to incorporate nuclear techniques in the integrated regional 
development programme through three technical co-operation projects in the 2001-2002 
biennium. 
4. Indonesia had actively participated in the AgencyÂs isotope hydrology programme in the 
hope of increasing land use to support sustainable agricultural development. Indonesia 
appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the groundwater resources exploitation project in Central 
Java and its assistance in studying the feasibility of introducing small and medium-size 
reactors for electricity generation and the production of potable water through nuclear 
desalination, especially to accelerate economic development in the eastern part of Indonesia 
which consisted of many small islands. 
5. Indonesia had been working hard to develop and produce radiodiagnostic equipment, 
radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, and to improve the safety of radiotherapy treatment. 
In that connection, he expressed support for the BoardÂs recommendation to convene a group 
of experts to formulate, on the basis of the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the 
Malaga Conference, an action plan for future international work relating to the radiological 
protection of patients. Indonesia faced difficulties in dealing with 300 radium-226 sources 
stored in 6 hospitals and in the Ministry of Public Health and sought the AgencyÂs advice in 
dealing with spent sources. 

GC(45)/OR.3

6. All three research reactors in Indonesia were in good operating condition. Although the 
first in Bandung and the second in Yogyakarta were 36 and 22 years old, respectively, neither 
was experiencing ageing problems. The first reactor had been upgraded in 1999 and had been 
the subject of an INSARR mission in 2000. Indonesia had recently conducted an in-service 
inspection of the tank of the second reactor in compliance with safety requirements. 
7. Under the new national development policy, in which nuclear power was seen as a 
potential alternative to oil and gas, systematic planning for the introduction of nuclear power 
would be enhanced, especially in the fields of safety, regulation, final waste disposal, 
environmental impact analysis, the decision-making process and financing. In the short term, 
the planning process would be strengthened through further investigation and data completion, 
supplemented by Agency support through technical co-operation project INS/0/016 entitled 
ÂComparative assessment of different energy sources for electricity generation.Â 
8. The wide spectrum of projects under the RCA and the AgencyÂs bilateral technical cooperation 
activities had contributed significantly to the development of human resources and 
nuclear science and technology in Indonesia. Indonesia was in favour of an extension of the 
RCA and wished to share its acquired expertise and its scientific facilities with other RCA 
member countries. It urged the Agency to increase its efforts to promote TCDC, in addition to 
existing North-South co-operation schemes. 
9. Indonesia adhered to the principles embodied in the NPT and related agreements, 
including the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It had been invited 
to an international seminar on the additional protocol in June 2001 in Tokyo to present 
IndonesiaÂs experience thus far and was currently being considered by the Agency as the third 
country to implement the integrated safeguards approach, hopefully by 2002. 
10. At the invitation of his Government, an IPPAS mission had been undertaken in early 
February 2001 and had been impressed with IndonesiaÂs efforts to conform to international 
standards. 
11. In close co-operation with the Agency, Indonesia was preparing to hold a regional 
workshop on physical protection and material security to combat illicit trafficking in 
November 2001. Ideas would be exchanged on the implementation of a physical protection 
system to combat illicit trafficking among countries of the region. To complement that, a 
national workshop on design basis threat would be held early in 2002. 
12. Mr. SHKOLNIK (Kazakhstan) extended deepest sympathy to the American 
people in the wake of the unprecedented terrorist attacks suffered. 
13. The present year marked the tenth anniversary of his countryÂs independence. After the 
dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan had been left with the fourth largest nuclear 
arsenal in the world. Nonetheless, it had declared itself a non-nuclear-weapon State. The vast 
Semipalatinsk nuclear testing range, with an area of influence larger than a medium-size 
European State, had been closed down and the considerable consequences of the testing were 
beginning to be addressed. Kazakhstan had become one of the first of the former Soviet 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 7 

States to accede to the NPT and all its nuclear activities had been under Agency safeguards 
since 1995. The same year, when the last remaining nuclear device on its soil had been 
destroyed, it had attained de facto non-nuclear-weapon status. 

14. Efforts had then concentrated on the remaining infrastructure of the nuclear test site, 
including the removal of highly enriched weapons-grade uranium from the worldÂs largest 
nuclear fuel fabrication plant. By 2000, the underground testing facilities and intercontinental 
ballistic missile launch silos at Semipalatinsk had finally been destroyed. 
15. KazakhstanÂs peaceful nuclear activities had continued; its nuclear fuel fabrication 
plant, research reactors and uranium ore enterprises were still in operation. However, in 1999, 
the BN-350 fast neutron reactor at Aktau had been shut down and, with Agency assistance, its 
decommissioning was now in hand. 
16. Kazakhstan was about to sign an additional protocol to its comprehensive safeguards 
agreement, and was also taking steps to strengthen the physical protection of its nuclear 
materials and facilities, upgrade its nuclear exports monitoring system, and improve its 
procedures to combat illegal trafficking in nuclear materials. 
17. In 1996, Kazakhstan had signed the CTBT, and was now an active member of the 
worldwide monitoring network. Its seismic observation posts were capable of registering 
nuclear explosions at any point on the globe. 
18. Kazakhstan had become a member of the Conference on Disarmament in 1999 and had 
also acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention. Discussions were currently under way on 
its accession to the Biological Weapons Convention, and work had already begun on 
eliminating all facilities concerned with biological weapons production. 
19. While the end of the millennium had brought an end to the rivalry between two 
extremely powerful war machines, the world had not become a safer place. Ownership of 
nuclear weapons was no longer the prerogative of only five countries. Kazakhstan wished to 
demonstrate by its own example that disarmament, confidence-building measures and 
adherence to non-proliferation principles offered a real alternative to the politics of force. 
20. Mr. RUMYANTSEV (Russian Federation) extended condolences to all the 
victims of the unprecedented act of aggression which had just taken place in the United States 
of America and reiterated President PutinÂs call for all nations to unite and stamp out 
international terrorism. 
21. The Russian Federation attached great significance to maintaining and strengthening the 
multilateral treaties in force in the area of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. It was 
convinced that the 1972 ABM treaty, far from being obsolete, still had a role to play, 
especially as no new global instruments had been introduced in the sphere of nuclear missile 
systems since the end of the Cold War. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 8 

22. Russia believed it had put forward a constructive arms control programme which 
provided for, inter alia, a stepwise reduction of Russian and United States strategic offensive 
weapons, and also contained measures designed to strengthen non-proliferation regimes and 
prevent an arms race in space. 
23. Under the 1993 agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States of 
America on the use of HEU resulting from nuclear weapons, some 5000 warheads had already 
been destroyed. Good progress was also being made in converting former nuclear weapon 
plants to peaceful uses. 
24. Russia felt it was now time for the five permanent members of the Security Council, 
who bore special responsibility for international security, to begin discussing strategic issues 
in relation to the multilateral mechanisms - the NPT, the CTBT and others. The success of 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference had depended crucially on the fine balance of interests 
expressed in its final document. Russia attached great importance to implementation of its 
provisions and believed that the decisions of the Review Conference had enhanced the 
AgencyÂs standing. It was now vitally important to continue strengthening the AgencyÂs role 
and authority. 
25. Nuclear power development should remain a high priority for the Agency. The previous 
year had witnessed a greater focus on that area with the inauguration of INPRO, which 
undoubtedly had the potential to help resolve problems relating to sustainable development, 
nuclear non-proliferation and manÂs destruction of the environment. Its successful 
implementation depended on the level of constructive information exchange established 
between all the relevant national programmes. His delegation urged all interested countries to 
support INPRO. 
26. Russia supported the three-pillar approach to the AgencyÂs activities and wished to see 
adequate funding and attention devoted to them. 
27. His countryÂs contribution to the welcome resurgence of nuclear power in a number of 
countries had been to approve a nuclear power development strategy for the first half of the 
21st century which aimed to achieve a growth rate three times higher than that of any other 
branch of electricity production. Moreover, RussiaÂs first new reactor unit for eight years had 
been commissioned at Rostov, and a decision had been taken to build additional units at 
Kalinin and Kursk. 
28. In the continuing climate change discussion, the anti-nuclear lobby, as had been seen at 
the COP6, was still too strong. Russia, like many Agency Member States, was convinced that 
greater use of nuclear power plants could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and better fulfil 
sustainable energy needs. It called on the countries interested in nuclear power development to 
intensify their efforts to have it included in the Clean Development Mechanism, and urged the 
Agency to adopt a more active role as the co-ordinator of such efforts. 
29. Russia had recently passed laws to permit the import of spent nuclear fuel for storage 
and reprocessing, one of the most sensitive stages of the fuel cycle. The revenue accruing 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 9 

from such operations would fund special environmental programmes designed to rehabilitate 
contaminated areas of Russia. The new laws facilitated the development of international 
co-operation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, offered greater scope for 
reprocessing spent fuel from nuclear power plants constructed and operated with Soviet or 
Russian assistance, and also provided for fuel leasing. 

30. Nuclear fusion was a potential alternative fuel source for future generations. Following 
the successful completion of the technical design stage of the ITER project, Russia looked 
forward to the elaboration of a draft agreement on its joint implementation. His Government 
had approved a federal programme to ensure that Russia participated in preparatory activities 
relating to ITER construction. 
31. Russia continued to support the development of measures to strengthen the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system, including integrated safeguards. Faced with increasing safeguards 
responsibilities and also the need to maintain a zero-real-growth budget, the Agency would 
need to develop new resource-saving approaches and control measures. The Agency also had 
a potential contribution to make in verification of excess fissile material of weapons origin in 
the framework of the Trilateral Initiative. 
32. Russia welcomed the measures being taken by the Agency in the area of nuclear, 
radiation and waste safety, including the updating of its safety standards. Russia was currently 
finalizing the legal procedures required for the entry into force of the Joint Convention, which 
it considered an important international instrument.. 
33. The AgencyÂs efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the technical 
co-operation programme were laudable. Russia would continue to provide assistance through 
the provision of experts, the supply of equipment and materials, and by holding training 
courses for personnel from developing countries. Also, it had paid its share of the target for 
voluntary contributions to the TCF for 2001 in full and on time. In future, it hoped to expand 
its co-operation in projects on nuclear power plant and waste safety and in nuclear 
applications important for the economic development of all Member States. 
34. He commended the Secretariat on the work it had done during the previous year, and on 
the usefulness of the consultations it had held during the difficult process of formulating a 
zero-real-growth budget for 2002-2003. In conclusion, he emphasized the need to maintain a 
balance between the AgencyÂs major functions. 
35. Mr. REIMANN (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, joined in 
the expression of sympathy for the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States 
of America. The Agency continued to operate in a world overshadowed by the threat of 
nuclear weapons. Far-reaching changes were taking place. On the one hand, the countries 
with the biggest arsenals were seriously contemplating reductions, so that a resumption of the 
strategic arms limitation process was to be expected. On the other hand, strategic challenges 
had changed radically since the Cold War and now included projects such as the anti-missile 
shield, whose technological and political dimensions had implications for the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 10 

36. For States that were strongly committed to disarmament, the scale of the work ahead 
and the attitude of certain powers were a source of concern. Switzerland continued to attach 
great importance to all political and diplomatic moves aimed at reducing the threat of nuclear 
proliferation, including export controls. It welcomed recent action by the NSG to increase 
public awareness of its activities and to boost dialogue with non-member countries. 
Switzerland considered it vital for all States to apply the NSGÂs principle, endorsed at the 
1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences, of requiring full-scope safeguards for all nuclear 
deliveries. 
37. He noted that some Member States were reluctant to respond to the Director GeneralÂs 
call for more rapid implementation of the integrated safeguards system and an increase in 
budgets. Switzerland was convinced that renewed progress in nuclear disarmament would 
create a more favourable environment for the introduction and financing of the integrated 
safeguards system. 
38. For some years, Switzerland had been advocating zero nominal growth in budgets 
throughout the United Nations system. Some flexibility was, however, necessary in certain 
circumstances; hence its decision to accept zero real growth in the case of the Agency. Indeed 
it had gone further in the current year by accepting an effective increase in the safeguards 
budget and a higher rate of inflation than that actually prevailing. That should not become a 
regular practice. In the event of a future shortfall in funds, the Conference should reduce the 
AgencyÂs programme of activities. Statutory activities should be fully covered by Member 
StatesÂ contributions and not by extrabudgetary funds. If necessary, the funding of more 
costly or additional activities would have to be deferred. 
39. Commending those involved in the implementation of the technical co-operation 
programme, he said that the quality of their work was a vital factor in persuading all Member 
States to pay their full share of the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF. The increase 
in the safeguards budget had refuelled the debate on the relative importance of safeguards and 
technical co-operation. The AgencyÂs basic mandate - to ensure that nuclear energy 
contributed to world peace, health and prosperity - was inextricably linked with the controls 
needed to ensure that the assistance provided was used for civilian purposes and that Member 
States honoured their obligations. Further cohesion on the budgetary front would reinforce 
the safeguards dimension of the AgencyÂs mission. 
40. Switzerland attached great importance to the physical protection of nuclear material and 
facilities. Its experts had played an active part in the debate on a possible revision of the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Switzerland fully endorsed the 
final recommendations of the group of experts, including the expansion of the Convention to 
cover material reserved for domestic use and the protection of material and facilities against 
sabotage. He noted with satisfaction that the Board of Governors had approved the basic 
security principles in that area and looked forward to their systematic application. 
Switzerland was prepared to participate in an advisory group on the subject. 
41. The use of nuclear energy was a politically sensitive issue in Switzerland. Opponents 
sought to change nuclear policy through popular initiatives aimed at amending the 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 11 

Constitution. Two such initiatives in 1999 sought to ban the construction of new nuclear 
power stations until 2010 and to close down existing stations once they had been in operation 
for 30 years. To counter the initiatives, the Government had submitted a bill on nuclear 
energy to Parliament in February 2001 which provided, inter alia, for the building of new 
nuclear power stations, an unlimited operating life and a ban on the reprocessing of nuclear 
fuel once existing contracts expired. The Swiss people would vote on the two initiatives in 
2003 and also on the bill if a referendum on its enactment was demanded. 

42. Much work remained to be done to promote the establishment of an international 
framework for the transport and storage of high-level radioactive waste. In the light of the 
preamble to the Joint Convention, his Government considered that the Agency was best 
placed to look into all relevant legal and institutional aspects of the matter. Switzerland hoped 
that the Agency would set to work as soon as possible in that area in the interests of the 
international community. 
43. Mr. SANON (Burkina Faso) prefaced his statement with an expression of 
compassion and solidarity for the American people following the tragic events of 
11 September. He commended the Agency on its contribution to peace, security, 
disarmament, development, the eradication of poverty and protection of the environment, all 
of which were priority objectives espoused by the United Nations Millennium Summit. 
Nuclear technology was being used to promote development in agriculture, food, human and 
animal health, and water resources management. 
44. In that context, he welcomed the agreement concluded between the Agency and the 
OAU on joint action against the tsetse fly through the sterile insect technique. At its thirtysixth 
and thirty-seventh sessions, the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government had 
given high priority to eradication of the tsetse fly, a major obstacle to AfricaÂs socio-economic 
development. Burkina Faso intended to participate actively in those efforts and to share its 
experience, human resources and facilities with the Agency and with other African countries. 
To that end, a tripartite project involving the Agency, Mali and Burkina Faso on integrated 
control of animal trypanosomosis through the establishment of a tsetse-fly-free zone was 
being implemented. Also, his country was honoured to host the launching, on 
5 October 2001, of PATTEC in Ouagadougou. He appealed to all countries and donors to 
support that initiative. 
45. He noted with satisfaction the steps taken by the Secretariat to implement 
GC(44)/RES/24 concerning the servicing of immediate human needs, in particular the idea of 
a regional technical co-operation project to develop and evaluate the sterile insect technique in 
fighting malaria vector mosquitoes. He hoped that the project would attract generous support 
and thanked the United States of America and Italy for their contributions. 
46. Since joining the Agency a few years previously, Burkina Faso had launched activities 
and programmes in a number of areas, including the control of animal diseases, water 
resources management, desertification control, training of human resources, the establishment 
of radioprotection facilities, the improvement of milk production, and malaria and 
tuberculosis control. The Government had just established a standing national body to 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 12 

oversee co-operation with the Agency. He expressed renewed thanks to the Africa Section of 
the Department of Technical Co-operation for its ongoing assistance. 

47. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that his country supported all international, regional 
and national action to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, nuclear, radiation and waste 
safety, the safe transport of radioactive material, and the strengthening of the safeguards 
system and its expansion to include all States without exception. It also supported the 
AgencyÂs action against illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material and the 
development of structures for the physical protection of nuclear material. 
48. Yemen renewed its appeal for a halt to the nuclear arms race everywhere and for action 
to root out the causes of tension, violence, terrorism and war through the promotion of 
understanding and co-operation among States and the creation of an international environment 
that no longer tolerated violence and injustice and in which the weak could exercise their 
rights in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations. He 
supported EgyptÂs renewed call for the establishment in the Middle East of a zone free of 
nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, compelling Israel to accede to the NPT so 
that the Middle East region no longer lived in a state of permanent fear. 
49. Expressing his condolences to the victims of the vile terrorist acts in the United States of 
America, he called on the international community to fight against all forms of terrorism, 
including nuclear terrorism, and to provide the long-suffering Palestinian people with the 
international protection they required. 
50. The threat presented by radioactive sources, particularly orphan sources, deserved 
greater attention. In Europe alone, some 30 000 sources were either not accounted for or not 
properly protected. Theft and illicit trafficking were compounding the problem. 
51. Internationally supported efforts by Member States to upgrade radiation protection and 
waste safety infrastructure projects, such as the AgencyÂs Model Project on the topic, had 
proved effective in many countries and should be stepped up. At the AgencyÂs International 
Conference on Security of Material in Stockholm in May 2001, Yemen had proposed an 
international tagging system for radioactive materials to ensure trackability, accountability and 
safety. It hoped that the proposal would attract broad support and was considering submitting 
a draft resolution on the matter at the forty-sixth session of the General Conference. 
52. He urged the Agency to enhance the material and human resources of the Department of 
Technical Co-operation in recognition of its vital contribution to sustainable development and 
its important role in radiation protection and nuclear and waste safety. He called on States 
that had not honoured their pledges to the TCF to do so without delay. He thanked the West 
Asia Section of the Department of Technical Co-operation for its valuable assistance, 
especially in connection with the establishment of the first radiotherapy centre for cancer in 
Yemen. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 13 

53. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) expressed sincere condolences to the American people 
for the senseless loss of innocent life the previous week and said that terrorism undermined 
the very foundation of civilized existence. 
54. He welcomed the Annual Report for 2000 and commended the Director General and the 
Secretariat for their accomplishments over the past year. His delegation was ready to join the 
consensus on the programme and budget for 2002-2003. The Philippines was committed to 
promoting the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and to international verification efforts, 
but believed that they should develop at the same pace. Thus, in future programmes and 
budgets, every effort should be made to maintain an equitable balance between the AgencyÂs 
activities. 
55. With regard to nuclear safety, he looked forward to the formulation of an action plan by 
the Secretariat, in the light of the Malaga Conference, for future international work relating to 
the radiological protection of patients. The Philippines, for its part, was currently upgrading 
its code of regulations using the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards. 
56. While his delegation agreed on the need for an international research reactor safety 
enhancement plan, it believed that an effort should be made, using international assistance, to 
bring research reactors which had been temporarily shut down back into productive operation. 
With regard to transport safety, he welcomed the news that international modal organizations 
such as IMO and ICAO had incorporated the 1996 edition of the AgencyÂs Transport 
Regulations into their regulatory documents. He called on other Member States to follow his 
countryÂs example and adopt the 1996 edition of those Regulations. The Philippines intended 
to participate actively in the AgencyÂs conference on the safety of transport of radioactive 
material, scheduled for 2003. 
57. He commended the SecretariatÂs efforts to strengthen the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation activities, as detailed in document GC(45)/INF/4, and reiterated his countryÂs 
appreciation for all the technical co-operation assistance it had received. He hoped that the 
revised rules for the acceptance of voluntary contributions, together with intensified fundraising 
efforts, would attract greater resources for the technical co-operation programme. 
58. Reporting on recent progress in the Philippines with respect to nuclear applications, he 
said that in the health sector, the first medical cyclotron was expected to be operational by the 
end of 2001. Also, a hydrogel burn and wound dressing had been developed which, once 
commercialized, would bring considerable cost savings. In industry, NDT was gaining 
ground with the establishment of a national infrastructure for NDT certification and a training 
programme. National specialists were eagerly awaiting the outcome of the AgencyÂs initiative 
to harmonize recognition of such certifications worldwide. The successful application of 
nuclear techniques in geothermal field studies and also the detection, monitoring and 
mitigation of toxic Âred tideÂ occurrences had resulted in the identification of three regional 
resource units, through which the Philippines hoped to contribute to TCDC. In 2001 the 
Philippines would host eight regional training courses and workshops and accept a number of 
Agency fellows for training. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 14 

59. In June 2001, the Philippines had deposited its instrument of ratification for the Treaty 
on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone. Such regional initiatives pursuant to 
Article VII of the NPT warranted international encouragement as they contributed to regional 
and, ultimately, global security. As the Philippines with its ASEAN partners prepared for 
implementation of that Treaty, it looked forward to Agency assistance and to the speedy 
conclusion of negotiations with nuclear weapon states concerning the TreatyÂs protocol. 
60. Mr. BUTT (Pakistan), conveying deep sympathy to those afflicted by the disaster 
in the United States of America, said his country was opposed to all forms of terrorism and 
would co-operate in collective actions to combat it. 
61. Like many developing countries, Pakistan had repeatedly stressed the need for an 
increased share of nuclear power in the total energy mix. Nuclear power still provided only 
about 16% of overall electricity, and the six new nuclear power reactors in the year 2000 
represented only about 3% of additional estimated world electricity capacity. The Secretariat 
and the Member States therefore needed to continue their efforts to secure for nuclear power 
its due place on the global scene. There were heartening signs of a possible resurgence of 
nuclear power. In the United States of America its contribution was increasing to 20% of total 
electricity generation. Also, the life-extension programme of various nuclear power plants in 
the United States and Spain was positive. 
62. Despite financial constraints, his country had completed its second nuclear power plant 
(Chasnupp) which had just gone into commercial operation; that was a shining example of 
South-South collaboration. His Government was following with interest worldwide efforts to 
develop innovative reactor designs, including the pebble bed modular reactor, aiming for 
improved safety and proliferation-resistance. It urged the Agency and the industrially 
advanced Member States to devise an effective partnership mechanism with the developing 
countries to share knowledge, expertise and technology in that regard. 
63. Pakistan strongly believed in giving top priority to safety, irrespective of any operational 
or financial considerations. Earlier in the year, his Government had set up an independent 
Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority. Pakistan had ratified the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety promptly and was steadfastly committed to it. To continue strengthening its safety 
practices, Pakistan was an active member of other organizations, such as WANO, and sought 
further co-operation from the world community to stay abreast of technological developments. 
He hoped that the Agency would play a more proactive role in convincing the advanced 
countries of the need for a liberal transfer of safety-related technology and equipment to 
developing countries. His delegation proposed that the Agency adopt a mechanism to ensure 
the supply of safety-related equipment to safeguarded nuclear reactors and facilities. His 
delegation appreciated the invaluable help which the Agency had rendered Pakistan in the 
field of nuclear safety and commended it for taking cognizance of the continuing loss of 
qualified and experienced manpower worldwide. It suggested that the Agency elaborate, 
under the technical co-operation programme, an education initiative in the area of nuclear 
safety for young scientists and engineers, particularly from the developing countries. In that 
connection, his Government proposed that the Agency conduct courses in Pakistan on 
operational safety and safety analysis which would lead to a diploma in nuclear safety from a 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 15 

Pakistani university. The Agency could send safety experts and sponsor travel costs while 
Pakistan would provide access to its research and power reactors. That initiative could 
develop into an international centre for safety studies. 

64. Agency safeguards were an effective tool against the proliferation and clandestine 
diversion of nuclear materials. Pakistan had enacted nuclear export control legislation 
in 2000, had acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and 
had always fulfilled its safeguards obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency. 
65. Technical co-operation was the most important aspect of PakistanÂs collaboration with 
the Agency. As a major beneficiary, Pakistan had been enhancing its technical co-operation 
management on a regular basis to keep pace with Agency strategies for greater impact, 
sustainability and outreach. It was pleased that the AgencyÂs thematic focus had included 
immediate human needs. In that respect, his delegation stressed the importance of water 
resource management, which had a direct bearing on other areas such as agriculture, human 
health, industry and the environment, and urged the Agency to step up its work in the area of 
fresh water management and desalination. 
66. The technical co-operation programme could be more effective if a few points of 
concern, such as the uncertain nature of the TCF, non-payment or delayed payment by 
Member States of their voluntary contributions, and problems associated with placements for 
the training of fellows, the travel of fellows, trainees, experts and project counterparts, were 
tackled by the Secretariat more vigorously. In addition, TCDC implementation, maximum 
utilization of available resources within the regions and greater involvement of the developing 
Member States at the programme formulation stage merited attention. Also, Pakistan was 
concerned about the vulnerability of the balance between the AgencyÂs promotional and other 
activities. 
67. Salinity and waterlogging were serious problems in Pakistan. Pakistani scientists had 
developed a biological technique for utilizing salt-affected soils and saline water 
economically, which had been adopted as a Model Project by the Agency and introduced by 
Pakistani experts in Myanmar, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Iran and Tunisia. 
68. Pakistan was engaged in numerous other Agency technical co-operation activities. It 
provided assistance to many Member States in the assimilation of NDT technologies through 
the National Centre for Non-Destructive Testing and the Pakistan Welding Institute. One 
spin-off product had been the development of a laser-based land-leveller. Manufactured by 
Pakistani scientists and costing less than half the international price, it was expected to result 
in considerable savings of irrigation water in levelled areas. A technetium-99m generator 
loading facility had recently been set up and would soon begin supplying nuclear medical 
centres throughout the country so that nearly 300 000 patients could be treated every year. 
Another national Agency-sponsored project had been the safe conditioning of disused 
radium-226 needles, and that technology had been passed on to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and 
Lebanon. Pakistan had commissioned a seawater desalination plant based on reverse osmosis 
technology at its Kanupp plant. In the medical field, it had started a postgraduate medical 
physics programme for which it welcomed nominations from Member States.

page 16 

69. Pakistan offered its experience to other developing countries under the AgencyÂs 
auspices. Not only was that in line with the AgencyÂs TCDC strategy but it would also serve 
as a confidence-building measure to encourage developing Member States to operate 
programmes of their own. Furthermore, Pakistan had taken steps towards revenue generation 
to ensure sustainability and self-reliance. 
70. His Government endorsed the AgencyÂs activities in the year 2000 as described in the 
Annual Report, particularly in the areas of safety and maintenance of knowledge and 
competence. It also appreciated the tremendous contribution of the Abdus Salam 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, which had provided training 
opportunities to a large number of Pakistani scientists. 
71. In conclusion, he recalled the considerable effort the Agency had made in past years to 
introduce an amendment to Article VI of its Statute to allow expansion of the Board. His 
delegation urged those Member States that had not yet ratified the amendment to expedite the 
process so as to bring about a more equitable Board representation. 
72. Mr. HASHIM (Malaysia), having condemned all forms of terrorism, expressed 
condolences to the United States of America and the families affected by the terrorist attacks 
of the previous week. 
73. New applications for membership of the Agency testified to the potential benefits of the 
peaceful and non-power applications of nuclear technology for developing countries, in which 
TCDC played an increasingly important role. He endorsed the request made by the Group 
of 77 and China that the Secretariat continue the long-term training courses in Member States 
on radiation protection. Malaysia ran such a postgraduate course on which Agency-sponsored 
fellows were welcome. 
74. In order to meet the expectations of developing Member States the Agency must strive 
to strike an appropriate balance in the funding and composition of its major functions. 
Non-nuclear-weapon States should not have to help shoulder the burden of the AgencyÂs 
verification activities, either through an increase in safeguards contributions or a reduction in 
benefits from the technical co-operation programme. Although the Agency was the 
safeguards implementing agency for the NPT, it was also bound by its Statute to, inter alia, 
accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity 
throughout the world. The NPT provided for non-nuclear-weapon States to benefit from the 
peaceful applications of nuclear technology in exchange for their total renunciation of such 
weapons of mass destruction. 
75. Malaysia welcomed the Board of GovernorsÂ recommendation that the General 
Conference adopt revised rules regarding the acceptance of voluntary contributions. That 
represented a significant step forward in encouraging funding from non-traditional donors. 
Perhaps other restrictive financial and legal procedures could be revised along similar lines to 
ensure that all Member States, in particular the developing countries, derived maximum 
benefit from the AgencyÂs activities. His delegation requested the Director General to pay 
special attention to the technical co-operation programme when soliciting or allocating 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 17 

voluntary contributions, since the revision of the rules had stemmed from resolution 
GC(44)/RES/18 aimed at strengthening the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. 

76. He reiterated MalaysiaÂs concern about the safety of international maritime transport of 
nuclear materials, in particular the potentially harmful effects on human life and ecosystems in 
the littoral States concerned. His delegation welcomed the proposal to hold a conference on 
the safety of transport of radioactive material in 2003 as well as the other measures outlined in 
document GC(45)/13. However, it did not support the idea of a single, binding, 
mode-independent international instrument governing the transport of radioactive material on 
the grounds that it did not seem feasible. Instead, the Agency should continue its current 
practice of updating its own Transport Regulations and encouraging their adoption by the 
relevant multilateral organizations. 
77. The AgencyÂs involvement in the post-conflict environmental assessment of the effects 
of depleted uranium munitions in Kosovo led by UNEP was laudable. Malaysia also 
welcomed the AgencyÂs undertaking to assess the radiological and environmental effects of 
the debris of such munitions in other regions. Expressing concern about the associated 
safeguards implications, he asked for clarification by the Secretariat as to whether the transfer 
of such munitions to non-nuclear-weapon States which had signed a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency should be reported to the Agency. 
78. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that for a number of decades Iraq had been a model 
Member State, attending all meetings of the governing bodies and implementing 
comprehensive safeguards. But the brutal attack on Iraq in 1991 had led to the destruction of 
all nuclear and some civilian facilities and had, at the same time, undermined the credibility of 
the stated aim of the United Nations and the Agency to promote the contribution of science 
and technology to the progress of humankind. The Security Council had then adopted a series 
of biased resolutions under pressure from the United States of America and the United 
Kingdom. Nevertheless, Iraq had complied with their provisions and co-operated with 
Agency inspection teams, allowing them to obtain a complete picture of its nuclear 
programmes despite the fact that some members had engaged in espionage. Owing to United 
States and United Kingdom interference, however, the Agency had been unable to carry out its 
mandate under the Security Council resolutions. As a technical body, it should have remained 
aloof from their nefarious political influence. It had emerged directly and indirectly from the 
AgencyÂs reports in recent years, for instance paragraph 31 of its report to the Security 
Council annexed to document GOV/INF/1999/4, that the Agency had in fact completed its 
tasks under section C of Security Council resolution 687(1991), especially paragraphs 12 
and 13 concerning inspections. The Agency should make that clear to the Security Council in 
order to put paid to the empty allegations being used by the United States and the United 
Kingdom to prolong the unjust embargo. 
79. Iraq had long sought to restore normal relations with the Agency and to recover its rights 
and privileges as a Member State. During two inspections conducted in 2000 and 2001, the 
Agency had verified the physical inventory of the nuclear material subject to safeguards. It 
was therefore duty bound, under the Statute and in accordance with paragraph 13 of Security 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 18 

Council resolution 687(1991), to restore full relations with Iraq and to respect its rights under 
the NPT. 

80. Having suspended IraqÂs rights under the technical co-operation programme in 1991, the 
Agency had partially restored them for humanitarian projects as of 1995. However, it had 
failed to implement ten projects, including three regional projects, approved from 1999 
onwards because the Security Council Sanctions Committee established by 
resolution 661(1990) had unfairly decided, under pressure from the United States and the 
United Kingdom, to make implementation dependent on the return of the inspection teams 
that had engaged in espionage. That decision was incompatible with Articles II and III of the 
Statute, under which Member States were entitled to benefit from technical co-operation. 
Given that the Board of Governors had approved those humanitarian projects, he called on the 
Conference to request the Agency to proceed with their implementation. 
81. The environment in many parts of Iraq had been severely contaminated by the weapons 
used against it in 1991. Iraq had taken urgent action within its limited resources to tackle the 
problem and had repeatedly asked for the AgencyÂs assistance both in that regard and in 
rehabilitating the radioactive waste treatment plant in Tuwaitha. Although the Agency had 
sent a technical team to Iraq in June 1995 no significant progress had been made in that 
regard. Iraq had drawn the attention of the General Conference at previous sessions to the 
damage caused by the use of depleted uranium missiles by United States and British troops in 
1991. Their radioactive and chemical effects had led to the death of thousands of civilians 
and would continue to affect future generations. Iraq had requested emergency assistance 
from the Agency, which, in turn, had referred the request to the relevant Security Council 
Sanctions Committee, where every request that might benefit the people of Iraq was rejected. 
The Conference should thus be aware that the Agency, despite having participated effectively 
in the depleted uranium fact-finding process in Kosovo, had applied double standards in the 
case of Iraq under United States pressure, although the quantities of depleted uranium used 
were far greater than in Kosovo. The WHO, recognizing the gravity of the situation, had 
developed a joint programme with Iraq to study the risks to human health and the 
environment. The United States and the United Kingdom were merely seeking to conceal the 
facts relating to the criminal use of depleted uranium against civilians. The Agency had 
decided to organize a course on the effects of depleted uranium in the countries against which 
it had been used. Iraq had nominated four experts to attend the course but the Agency had 
referred only two of the nominations to the relevant Sanctions Committee. The Agency had a 
moral and technical duty to assist Iraq in training personnel to deal with depleted uranium 
contamination and should not allow any political machinations to interfere with its 
humanitarian work. 
82. Numerous efforts were being made to rid the world of nuclear weapons. 
Nuclear-weapon-free zones could relax tension in areas of conflict such as the Middle East, 
which was still living under the threat of Zionist nuclear weapons. The Agency had been 
discussing that issue and the question of the application of comprehensive Agency safeguards 
in the Middle East for years. In 1981 the Zionist entity had destroyed IraqÂs Tammuz research 
reactor, which had been used for peaceful purposes and had been under Agency safeguards. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 19 

All international calls to the Zionist entity to place all its nuclear reactors under safeguards 
and to accede to the NPT had failed. Paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687(1991) 
constituted an important step towards the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction, especially nuclear weapons, in the Middle East, but the United States and the 
United Kingdom had impeded its implementation because it was applicable to the Zionist 
entity and no other State. 

83. He urged the General Conference to restore IraqÂs rights as a Member State, to assist it 
in recovering from the enormous damage inflicted by bombardment of its territory, and to call 
for the lifting of the unjust embargo. Iraq, for its part, was prepared to co-operate fully with 
the Agency in pursuing the objectives set forth in its Statute. 
84. Ms. MOSLEY (New Zealand) pledged her countryÂs support for efforts to combat 
terrorism and to bring to justice the perpetrators of the recent terrifying attacks in the United 
States of America. 
85. Her Government was encouraged by the outcome of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. 
Of singular significance had been the unequivocal political undertaking of the five nuclearweapon 
States to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Despite those positive developments, her 
delegation cautioned against complacency. 
86. As the previous weekÂs tragic events had shown, international security required 
collective engagement and effective international responses. That meant not only providing 
full support for bodies such as the Agency, which stood at the centre of efforts to prevent the 
spread of nuclear weapons, but also paying assessed contributions in full and on time and 
meeting safeguards commitments. She expressed concern that some Member States had yet to 
fulfil their NPT obligations by concluding safeguards agreements with the Agency and 
regretted that adherence to the strengthened safeguards system was progressing so slowly. As 
for New Zealand, which had both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional 
protocol in place, the Agency had recently concluded that it had no undeclared nuclear 
material or activities. 
87. As a practical contribution to collective engagement, in March New Zealand had hosted 
the United Nations Asia Pacific Regional Disarmament Conference to discuss a wide range of 
security and non-proliferation issues relevant to the South Pacific region. Agency 
representatives had been present to explain the safeguards system and encourage the 
conclusion of additional protocols to comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
88. The long-standing problem of the implementation of the safeguards agreement by the 
DPRK was becoming ever more acute as time passed. New Zealand urged the DPRK to 
co-operate fully and promptly with the Agency in ensuring complete compliance with its 
safeguards agreement, which remained binding and in force. 
89. Her delegation was also concerned about the AgencyÂs inability to fulfil its mandate in 
Iraq under the relevant Security Council resolutions. It urged Iraq to co-operate fully in that 
regard. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 20 

90. Nuclear safety was a matter of the highest priority. That was reflected in the importance 
Member States attached to various safety conventions, safety standards and safety services. 
New Zealand strongly supported the AgencyÂs work to strengthen international co-operation 
in nuclear, radiation and waste safety and the assistance it provided in the event of accidents. 
91. One aspect of nuclear safety of particular importance to New Zealand was the safety of 
transport of radioactive materials. New Zealand was on one of three routes for shipments of 
nuclear materials being returned to Japan after reprocessing in Europe. There were deep 
concerns about the risk of an accident and the potentially immense impact on coastal States. 
New Zealand did not want shipments of nuclear materials to come anywhere near it, and 
certainly not into its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. It wanted proper systems of 
notification and expected the highest standards of safety to apply. It asked that States 
shipping nuclear materials accept full responsibility for any damage, including liability and 
compensation. New ZealandÂs concerns about the shipment of radioactive materials were 
shared by the small island States of the South Pacific, which were dependent on fishing and 
tourism and where the stakes were, if anything, higher. The 32nd Pacific Islands Forum, held 
in Nauru in August, had urged that those concerns be constructively and vigorously pursued. 
New Zealand was co-sponsoring a resolution on the safety of transport of radioactive 
materials together with a number of countries from other regions. The text agreed for 
resolution GC(44)/RES/17 had set a benchmark for action and accountability, and there was a 
need for a realistic but progressive agenda for improving measures for the international 
transport of radioactive material and spent fuel. 
92. In todayÂs troubled times, the agreements reached and practical efforts employed to 
enhance international stability, security and safety acquired even greater significance. It was 
in that light that New Zealand viewed, and supported, the Agency and its work. 
93. Ms. URIBE TORON (Colombia) said the recent tragic events in the United States 
of America had highlighted the need to continue supporting the AgencyÂs activities. A clear 
consensus existed as to the AgencyÂs three main - interrelated - priorities: technology, safety 
and verification. Mankind was still hampered in its efforts to release the formidable potential 
of nuclear power by the dual threat of its use for aggressive purposes or an unforeseen 
accident. As a developing country, Colombia attached a high priority to the use of nuclear 
energy for sustainable development, and looked to the Agency to act as a catalyst in 
transferring the tangible benefits of nuclear applications. The AgencyÂs safety and verification 
activities had a vital role to play in allaying fears and suspicions. 
94. The international legal instruments elaborated by the Agency in recent years not only 
showed Member StatesÂ willingness to achieve high standards of nuclear safety worldwide but 
were also crucial to global collaboration in the areas of nuclear safety, physical protection and 
assistance in radiation emergencies. That international dimension of the nuclear safety 
regime, combined with the benefits brought by the widespread co-operation and exchange, 
were extremely helpful to countries such as Colombia which were beginning to make greater 
use of nuclear applications for peaceful purposes. ColombiaÂs Congress was currently in the 
process of ratifying the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the Early 
Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 21 

95. Her Government had recently established a national nuclear regulatory authority under 
the Ministry of Mines and Energy with the power to adopt national policy with respect to 
nuclear energy and the management of radioactive material, and to carry out regulatory, 
licensing, monitoring, supervisory and safeguards functions. The nuclear regulatory authority 
was responsible for ensuring compliance with international standards and agreements, and for 
ensuring personal safety and environmental protection. 
96. Her Government had recently reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation 
and disarmament through an agreement by exchange of letters with the Agency, approved by 
the Board of Governors1 
and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference. 
97. Regarding the safe transport of radioactive material, Colombia associated itself with the 
various declarations made by regional groups, as recorded in document GC(45)/INF/18, 
particularly the Santiago declaration made by the Rio Group in March 2001. Also, Colombia 
had cosponsored a resolution on the subject. There was a need to establish appropriate 
international mechanisms governing the transport of radioactive materials, given the potential 
risks of such transport through coastal routes or along navigable waterways. 
98. The use of nuclear techniques considerably improved economic and social conditions 
and she stressed the importance of technical co-operation for non-nuclear countries that 
wished to join in the effort to eliminate the risks and dangers that still overshadowed the 
whole range of peaceful nuclear applications. 
99. Colombia had met all its obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency and was satisfied with the 
technical co-operation the Agency had provided to it. With the help of Agency experts, and in 
accordance with ColombiaÂs national plan, three projects in the areas of nuclear medicine, 
mining, and sustainable agricultural development had been identified for the forthcoming 
biennial programme. Also, Colombia was a keen collaborator in regional programmes, and 
constantly sought to promote technical co-operation, especially in developing countries, with 
the help of multilateral institutions such as the Agency. 
100. Mr. BACCARI (Tunisia) strongly condemned the criminal terrorist attacks in New 
York and Washington resulting in the deaths of innocent persons. 
101. Tunisia attached high priority to the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear science 
and technology as a means of promoting progress. In particular, it was interested in the design 
and production of small and medium-sized reactors capable of producing power and 
desalinating sea water. His delegation urged the Agency to pay particular attention to that 
programme in view of its potential positive impact on development. Tunisia was also 
participating in the expert group on seawater desalination. 
102. On questions of co-operation with the Agency, he said that Tunisian personnel had 
received training in a number of areas. In addition, the Agency had supplied scientific 
See document GOV/OR.1027, paras 1-14. 


GC(45)/OR.3 
page 22 

equipment, which had been used in support of socio-economic development activities. Of 
special importance had been the assistance received in setting up laboratories of the National 
Centre for Nuclear Science and Technology and, in particular, the sterile fruit fly production 
unit. Tunisia looked forward to the AgencyÂs continued support in the establishment of 
advanced infrastructure for the application of nuclear technology in agriculture. 

103. Tunisia was actively promoting scientific and technological co-operation at multilateral 
and bilateral levels. In that connection, it was co-operating bilaterally with the Arab countries 
and also through the Arab Maghreb Union and the Tunis-based Arab Atomic Energy Agency, 
which shared similar objectives to the Agency. He called on the Agency to increase its 
scientific co-operation with that organization. 
104. He underscored the importance of the AgencyÂs co-operation with the Mediterranean 
Arab countries under the regional project (RAF/7/004) on the study of marine pollution using 
radioisotopes. He expressed the hope that the Agency would engage the support of the 
Mediterranean European countries for that project. 
105. In addition, Tunisia was regularly carrying out joint scientific and technological 
activities with countries in Africa, notably under the AFRA programme, making its facilities 
available for training human resources. He was grateful to the countries which supported that 
programme, and hoped that help from the industrialized countries would continue to be 
forthcoming so that its objectives could be achieved. 
106. Also worthy of mention, was the assistance Tunisia had received from France in 
installing an electron accelerator, which was expected to start operation in 2002. 
107. Tunisia was always punctual in paying its contributions to the Regular Budget and to the 
TCF. His delegation was thankful to all the countries which had contributed to the financing 
of technical co-operation, and hoped that they would continue to do so in a spirit of 
collaboration and solidarity. 
108. Situated as it was on a sensitive sea route, Tunisia was aware of the hazards of the 
transport of radioactive material and waste by sea, and supported all efforts to strengthen 
controls on such transport. 
109. His country was convinced that a concerted approach to nuclear security was the best 
guarantee not only for global security but also for the peaceful application of nuclear 
technology to promote sustainable development. Adherence by all States to the relevant 
international instruments and compliance with their requirements, allied with efforts to 
prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, would provide the necessary assurance to all 
States. Tunisia itself was party to the Pelindaba Treaty, had collaborated in international 
efforts to strengthen the safeguards regime and was willing to enter into negotiations with the 
Agency to conclude an additional protocol, and was party to all international instruments 
relating to nuclear safety, safeguards, non-proliferation and the banning of nuclear tests. It 
looked forward ultimately to the universality of the safeguards system and to the total 
elimination of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. 

GC(45)/OR.3 
page 23 

110. In that context, his delegation was concerned at IsraelÂs persistent refusal to accede to 
the NPT and called on Israel to co-operate with the Agency and place its nuclear installations 
under Agency safeguards. Finally, he appealed for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. 
The meeting rose at 1.00 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 

1. Ms. HAIRD (United Kingdom), expressing deepest sympathy to the United States 
of America in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks, said that there could be no 
justification for such appalling acts. The United Kingdom stood ready to help bring the 
perpetrators to justice. 
2. Recalling the history of the establishment of the Agency, she said that the Agency had 
the central role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons; its safeguards activities 
remained its raison dÂtre. The ability to detect and thus deter the diversion of nuclear 
material declared to be in peaceful use must remain a central feature of the safeguards regime. 
In recent years, the Agency had considerably strengthened its capability for detecting 
undeclared nuclear material and activities. The onus was now on Member States to ensure 
that the Secretariat was able to fully implement the strengthened safeguards system. 
3. Although the additional protocols signed by European Union Member States had not yet 
entered into force, the United Kingdom already had the relevant legislation in place, and since 
1999 it had been voluntarily providing the Secretariat with the information that would be 
required of it once its additional protocol was in force. Also, it had been helping, through its 
safeguards support programme, to develop strengthened and integrated safeguards 
methodologies. 
4. She expressed appreciation of the AgencyÂs assistance to Member States in establishing 
effective systems for the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. Agency 
guidance documents, IPPAS, conferences and training courses were serving non-proliferation 
objectives and also helping to protect public health and safety and the environment. The 
United Kingdom had been supporting the programme in question through extrabudgetary 
contributions and the provision of technical expertise. 
5. In the area of nuclear safety, the work on updating and extending the AgencyÂs safety 
standards must continue to be accorded high priority. Her delegation therefore welcomed the 
budgetary provision for work on developing safety standards for fuel cycle installations. In 
that connection, it also welcomed the entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, already ratified 
by the United Kingdom. 
6. The United Kingdom, which attached great importance to safety in the transport of 
nuclear materials, had an excellent record in the transport of such materials -both over land 
and by sea. Although it was confident that it was transporting such materials in full 
accordance with relevant international standards, it had recently requested the Secretariat to 
organize a TranSAS mission to look at its nuclear material transport operations. It was also 
confident that the mission would confirm that those operations were being carried out in 
accordance with best practice, whatever the method of transport. 
7. With the rising global demand for energy and the greater awareness of concerns about 
climate change, the potential of nuclear power as a proven energy option remained important. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 6 

In that connection, the AgencyÂs work on innovative reactors was timely given the global 
debate about the acceptability and viability of nuclear power. 

8. The Agency had worked hard to promote various non-power applications of nuclear 
energy through its technical co-operation activities. Although the Agency was not legally 
bound to carry out such activities, the United Kingdom recognized the importance of a wellrun 
and adequately funded technical co-operation programme. In 2001 it had paid its full TCF 
target share and had made additional voluntary contributions. 
9. More than 50 countries party to the NPT had so far failed to conclude NPT safeguards 
agreements with the Agency; those countries should delay no further in concluding such 
agreements. In addition, speedier progress must be made with the conclusion and 
implementation of additional protocols; in the four years since the Board had approved the 
Model Additional Protocol, fewer than 60 States had signed additional protocols - and so far 
only 22 additional protocols were being implemented. The Secretariat - with support from the 
United Kingdom and a number of other Member States - had put enormous effort into the 
development of integrated safeguards, and the progress had been impressive, but the extent to 
which it would be possible to apply integrated safeguards would depend on the extent to 
which additional protocols were being implemented. The safeguards agenda was therefore a 
challenging one - for the Agency and for Member States. 
10. Her delegation believed that the Agency should help States, on request, to meet their 
responsibilities for maintaining physical protection regimes capable of preventing the theft of 
nuclear material and the sabotage of nuclear facilities. In that connection, it welcomed the 
recently formulated ÂPhysical Protection Objectives and Fundamental PrinciplesÂ. 
11. The Agency had a broad mandate, but its resources were severely limited. Member 
States should therefore stop constantly requesting the Secretariat to carry out more activities. 
For its part, the Secretariat should be prepared to contribute to the identifying of priorities, so 
that a sensible and feasible work programme might be agreed upon, account being taken of the 
fact that the Agency needed to co-operate with other organizations. To help the Secretariat 
make the optimum use of its resources, an external study of selected areas of work would be 
useful. That would require careful preparation, which her delegation hoped could be done in 
the coming months. 
12. Mr. GANCHEV (Bulgaria) expressed condolences to the United States of 
America and to the relatives of the victims of the terrorist attacks which had taken place in 
that country the previous week. Bulgaria had condemned the attacks, which had violated all 
democratic values, and fully supported the actions being taken by the international community 
against terrorism. 
13. As a country with operating nuclear power reactors, Bulgaria was particularly interested 
in the Agency activities in the fields of nuclear power, nuclear safety, radiation protection and 
radioactive waste management and hoped that the Agency would continue to develop 
internationally recognized standards and criteria in those fields. Through its expertise, the 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 7 

Agency was helping to bring his countryÂs nuclear installations into compliance with such 
standards and criteria and to strengthen the Bulgarian nuclear regulatory authority. 

14. The AgencyÂs contribution to preventing nuclear weapons proliferation had been 
substantial, as indicated in the Annual Report for 2000, where it was stated that in 2000 the 
Secretariat had found no indication of diversion of nuclear material or misuse of facilities, 
equipment or non-nuclear material placed under safeguards. 
15. His country, which contributed to the strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system, 
had ratified the protocol additional to its safeguards agreement with the Agency and had 
presented an initial declaration in accordance with the requirements of that protocol. 
16. His delegation welcomed the improvements made in the area of technical co-operation 
management and also the results achieved in transferring nuclear techniques, training 
specialists and providing expert services and equipment. 
17. His delegation attached great importance to INPRO and to the idea - stemming from the 
International Conference on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management held in CÃ³rdoba, 
Spain, in March 2000 - of the AgencyÂs addressing the societal aspects of radioactive waste 
management. 
18. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger Committee, Bulgaria 
was, in its foreign trade, requiring full-scope safeguards as a precondition for supplying 
nuclear material and equipment. 
19. Although the main responsibility for ensuring the physical protection of nuclear 
materials and other radioactive materials lay with Member States, the AgencyÂs role in 
promoting international co-operation in physical protection, improving Member StatesÂ 
systems for nuclear material accounting and control, and providing physical protection 
training was essential. 
20. In Bulgaria, practically half of whose electricity was generated by the Kozloduy NPP, a 
draft Law on the Use of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes - prepared with the assistance 
of Agency experts - had been submitted for approval to the National Assembly. It provided 
for the Committee on the Use of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes to be transformed into 
a State Atomic Energy Agency, the aim being to strengthen the independence of BulgariaÂs 
nuclear regulatory authority. It also provided for BulgariaÂs nuclear legislation to be brought 
into line with the nuclear legislation of the European Union. 
21. With regard to the operational safety of the Kozloduy NPP, a three-stage WWER-440 
modernization programme covering the period 1990-97 had been followed by a WWER-440 
safety enhancement programme starting in 1998. After the signing of an understanding 
between the European Commission and the Bulgarian Government which envisaged the 
closure of Units 1 and 2 before 2003, the safety-enhancement programme had been converted 
into a programme for the modernization of Units 3 and 4, expected to be completed by the end 
of 2002. It was expected that the programme for the modernization of Units 5 and 6 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 8 

(WWER-1000s), in the process of implementation, would be completed by the end of 2006. 
The aforementioned programmes had received positive assessments by Agency experts. 

22. A safety review of the upgraded design of Units 3 and 4, expected to be conducted by 
the Agency in May-June 2002, would be of great importance for the future of nuclear power 
in Bulgaria. 
23. Referring to technical co-operation projects BUL/4/008 and BUL/4/006, ÂPlanning and 
Management of Decommissioning Kozloduy NPP Units 1 and 2Â and ÂFailed Fuel Assembly 
Detection and MeasurementÂ, he said that the Kozloduy NPP would in 2001 be making an 
extrabudgetary contribution of US $270 000 in support of the implementation of those 
projects and of regional projects for Europe in the field of nuclear power. 
24. Bulgaria was participating very actively in regional technical co-operation activities, 
especially activities relating to nuclear power, nuclear safety, radioactive waste management 
and nuclear medicine. It was also participating in the AgencyÂs research contract programme, 
INIS, the Incident Reporting System, PRIS and the AgencyÂs Illicit Trafficking Database 
Programme. 
25. His country greatly appreciated the work of the Secretariat in promoting international 
co-operation in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and applying effective controls 
designed to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
26. Mr. MORGAN (Canada) offered his countryÂs deepest condolences to all those in 
the United States of America and other countries affected by the horrific events of 
11 September. The United States could count on the complete support and solidarity of 
Canada, which would work in the Agency and other fora to ensure that such senseless 
tragedies never occurred again. 
27. Canada was firmly committed to the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime 
as a means of advancing global security. Agency safeguards were a fundamental pillar of that 
regime, and Canada welcomed the significant role of the Agency in supporting the 
13 practical steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons adopted at the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference. 
28. There continued to be significant challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament regime, and Canada would like to see India, Pakistan, Israel and Cuba acceding 
to the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States soon and without conditions. It remained very 
concerned about the DPRK, which was still not co-operating fully with the Agency, so that the 
Agency was unable to verify the correctness and completeness of the initial declaration made 
by the DPRK pursuant to its safeguards agreement. The DPRK should start co-operating fully 
with the Agency and resume Agency membership at the earliest opportunity. Canada was also 
concerned that the Agency had not been in a position since December 1998 to implement its 
mandate in Iraq under the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions despite the 
routine verification activities carried out by it there in 1999 and 2000. The Agency was to be 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 9 

commended for its continuing efforts to find practical and constructive solutions to the issues 
involved. 

29. Canada attached considerable importance to the strengthened safeguards regime, 
including integrated safeguards, and looked forward to completion of the AgencyÂs efforts to 
develop facility-specific integrated safeguards approaches. Additional work was clearly 
required in order to develop State-level integrated safeguards approaches that combined the 
relevant facility-specific approaches with appropriate State-level safeguards elements. The 
Agency should proceed in a timely manner with the application of integrated safeguards in 
States that had concluded additional protocols. 
30. With regard to CanadaÂs additional protocol, which had entered into force in 
September 2000, the required initial declaration had been delivered on 6 March 2001 -within 
the specified time frame. In conjunction with other interested Member States and the Agency, 
Canada had been developing an integrated safeguards approach that was appropriate for the 
country as a whole. It looked forward to the pragmatic and timely implementation of that 
approach, so that Canada might begin to reap the benefits of the implementation of integrated 
safeguards. 
31. Canada would like to see many more States demonstrating their commitment to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy by concluding additional protocols with the Agency. It was 
concerned that 54 States party to the NPT had not yet concluded comprehensive safeguards 
agreements with the Agency, and it was participating in the efforts of the Agency and a 
number of Member States to promote the universalization of safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols. 
32. Nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament developments indicated that 
there would continue to be new challenges to and pressures on the Agency in the verification 
field. One example was the Trilateral Initiative, pursuant to which an agreement between the 
Agency, the Russian Federation and the United States would be presented to the Board of 
Governors at an appropriate time. Another was the AgencyÂs possible role in the verification 
aspects of the Russian Federation/United States Plutonium Management and Dispositioning 
Agreement. Canada looked forward to early and comprehensive discussions on both issues, 
with a view, inter alia, to ensuring that key principles such as the need for irreversibility were 
incorporated into the agreements. 
33. Canada was in favour of strengthening the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material by extending its coverage to include the physical protection of nuclear 
material in domestic use, storage and transport. It would continue to participate actively in the 
current review process, which it hoped would lead to improvements in the Convention. 
34. The Agency had a vital role to play in promoting the safe use of nuclear energy, which 
was essential for sustaining public confidence in nuclear technology. Canada welcomed the 
AgencyÂs emphasis on the importance of education and training for establishing and 
maintaining adequate radiation protection and nuclear safety infrastructures and for ensuring 
the continued viability of the nuclear industry. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 10 

35. His country strongly supported the use of nuclear power, which was meeting some 15% 
of its electricity requirements. Efforts were well under way in Canada, pending regulatory 
approval, to return six of eight laid-up nuclear power reactors to service. Another significant 
development was the recent private-sector and foreign investment in Canadian nuclear power 
utilities. It was expected that the contribution of nuclear power to CanadaÂs energy mix would 
increase significantly during the next several years. 
36. His delegation was pleased that the process leading to the production of national reports 
pursuant to the Convention on Nuclear Safety was well under way, in anticipation of the 
second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention, scheduled for 
April 2002. It would like to see the few countries with nuclear power programmes which had 
not yet done so acceding to the Convention without further delay. 
37. It was also pleased that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had entered into force. It believed that 
implementation of the Convention would assist in ensuring the safe and efficient management 
of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and it would like to see many more States becoming 
Contracting Parties to the Convention in the near future. 
38. The management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste continued to be a 
significant public policy challenge. Against that background, his Government was proposing 
legislation which would require nuclear power utilities to establish an organization to carry 
out waste management activities under federal oversight. The legislation would also require 
nuclear power utilities to establish a trust fund for financing the implementation of a 
long-term waste management approach. The aim was to demonstrate that nuclear power was 
a safe and sustainable energy option. 
39. His delegation was pleased that significant international collaboration on Ânext 
generationÂ reactor designs had begun in earnest through INPRO and the United States-led 
Generation IV International Forum. Canada was participating in both initiatives, which could 
make a unique contribution to activities focused on the development of Ânext generationÂ 
technology. However, care should be taken to avoid overlapping and duplication. 
40. A significant fusion energy project (ITER Co-ordinated Technical Activities) was also 
well under way, and his Government had announced its intention to participate as a full 
member. Also, it had submitted a proposal to host the project in Canada, where an excellent 
site was available. 
41. CANDU reactors were among the best-performing power reactors in the world; their 
design had proved to be safe, viable and competitive. Furthermore, work was under way in 
Canada on the next generation of CANDU reactors, building on the proven benefits of HWR 
technology. A significant CANDU community existed, and his delegation trusted that the 
CANDU reactor would continue to be accorded attention in the AgencyÂs programme 
activities. As Canada was also a world leader in the production of radioisotopes and uranium, 
his delegation also trusted that the Agency would continue its important activities relating to 
those fields. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 11 

42. Canada strongly endorsed public information and outreach activities in accordance with 
the AgencyÂs mandate as it believed that the Agency had an important role to play in 
effectively addressing public perception issues related to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
43. His delegation welcomed the SecretariatÂs innovative approaches to technical 
co-operation programme management, such as the linking of technical co-operation activities 
with broad development strategies in recipient States, and the efforts of the Secretariat to 
increase management efficiency and eliminate administrative barriers. Canada would 
continue to encourage the development of technical co-operation partnerships with other 
international organizations and the private sector in order to broaden the base of contributors 
and thereby mitigate the effects of the continuing non-payment by some Member States of 
their full TCF target shares. 
44. Canada was concerned about continuing increases in the Regular Budget level. 
However, it had actively sought an acceptable resolution of the 2002 Regular Budget issues 
and had not stood in the way of a consensus. Increasing transparency and responsiveness in 
the budget formulation process would greatly facilitate negotiations in the future. It was 
incumbent on Member States and the Secretariat to establish a coherent programme and 
budget formulation process and to engage in a constructive dialogue on programme priorities. 
Canada, which was committed to establishing such a process and engaging in such a dialogue, 
looked forward to addressing the challenges that lay ahead in a positive and co-operative 
manner. 
45. His delegation would study with interest the results of the financial management review 
by an external consultant which the Director General had announced at the BoardÂs June 
meetings. It was confident that the review would result in a simplification of procedures, and 
it would welcome similar reviews in other areas. It expected the review to lead to further 
savings and efficiency gains and also to greater management flexibility, permitting the 
reallocation of resources to high-priority activities. 
46. To remain effective, the Agency should place appropriate emphasis on activities related 
to verifying the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, advancing safe operating practices at nuclear 
facilities worldwide and promoting beneficial applications of nuclear technology. On that 
basis, and through the careful management and efficient use of existing resources and the 
constructive engagement of Member States, the Agency would help to ensure that nuclear 
energy remained a sustainable energy option and was able to capitalize on new opportunities. 
47. Mr. RÃNAKY (Hungary), expressing condolences to the American people and the 
United States Government in connection with the 11 September terrorist attacks, said that 
terrorism knew no boundaries and that international organizations should join in the fight 
against it. 
48. The international community had been reminded by the recent terrorist attacks of the 
vital importance of the AgencyÂs work relating to the physical protection and security of 
nuclear material. Hungary endorsed the recommendation from the informal open-ended 
expert meeting to discuss whether there is a need to revise the Convention on the Physical 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 12 

Protection of Nuclear Material that a process of improving the physical protection capabilities 
of Member States in respect of nuclear material and nuclear installations be initiated, and it 
looked forward to early action to strengthen the physical protection regime, including the 
CPPNM. 

49. Associating his delegation with the statement made by the delegate of Belgium on 
behalf of the European Union, he said that HungaryÂs co-operation with the European Union 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had intensified in the past year and would doubtless 
contribute to the smooth and timely accession of Hungary to the European Union. 
50. As a committed supporter of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Hungary considered 
that the international community should take urgent steps to expedite progress in the 
implementation of the programme of action adopted by the 2000 NPT Review Conference; so 
far, the progress had been disappointingly slow. Lack of political will had prevented the 
Conference on Disarmament from commencing negotiations on an internationally and 
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and 
other explosive devices. The CTBT was still far from entering into force, and only modest 
progress had been achieved in the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements with 
the Agency and of protocols additional to such agreements. 
51. Hungary continued to attach high priority to the efficient functioning and reliable 
operation of the safeguards system and considered additional protocols to be an essential 
ingredient of a credible system. It commended the efforts of the Secretariat and a number of 
Member States to bring about universal application of the measures provided for in the Model 
Additional Protocol, and it would like to see all States that had not yet done so concluding 
additional protocols. 
52. Since the 2000 session of the General Conference, Hungary had taken a number of steps 
to fulfil its additional protocol obligations, including the submission of a first annual 
declaration and the provision for complementary access. It hoped that the Secretariat would 
soon be able to draw conclusions regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and 
activities in Hungary which would permit the early application of integrated safeguards 
measures. In the meantime, Hungary was looking forward to increased co-operation between 
the Agency and the Hungarian SSAC in implementing strengthened safeguards measures. 
Also, it stood ready to help in further enhancing the safeguards system and by making its 
facilities available for the training of Agency safeguards inspectors. 
53. Welcoming the AgencyÂs work in support of StatesÂ efforts to combat illicit trafficking 
in nuclear materials and other radioactive substances, he said that Hungary had further 
developed its procedures and that an illicit trafficking response exercise had been conducted at 
HungaryÂs borders in 2000. 
54. National and international efforts over the past decade had resulted in a higher level of 
nuclear safety worldwide. The Agency had played a decisive role by initiating the conclusion 
of international conventions and establishing internationally agreed safety standards and 
providing for their application. Hungary, which welcomed the entry into force of the Joint 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 13 

Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, was ready to fulfil its obligations under the Joint Convention and to assist the 
Agency in preparing for its implementation. 

55. Hungary was also ready to participate in the second Review Meeting of the Contracting 
Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Since the submission of its first report pursuant 
to the Convention, it had taken important steps to further improve its regulatory practices. 
The recommendations resulting from an IRRT mission to Hungary in 2000 had been acted 
upon and a follow-up mission had been requested for 2002, to review the action taken to 
increase regulatory effectiveness and efficiency. 
56. Hungary, which welcomed the efforts of the Secretariat to adjust its safety review 
services in the light of new developments, expected the OSART mission to the Paks NPP 
scheduled for October 2001 to result in further operational safety improvements. 
57. The security of energy supplies was a national responsibility, and each State was entitled 
to adopt a strategy in keeping with its geographical, economic, regional, climatic and 
structural circumstances. In that connection, his delegation welcomed a recent draft report of 
the European Parliament on a European strategy for energy supply security which reflected a 
realistic approach to nuclear power. Having relatively few domestic energy resources, 
Hungary had to carefully weigh the options available for meeting its current and future energy 
needs. The safe and profitable operation of the State-owned Paks NPP was very welcome in 
that connection. 
58. A service life extension and power uprating project was soon to be initiated at the Paks 
NPP. To prepare for it, the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority would have to elaborate 
detailed guidelines for - inter alia - plant ageing management, evaluation of the physical 
condition of ageing equipment and licence renewal processes. Hungary hoped to be able to 
draw on the experience of other Member States and to receive Agency support in that regard. 
59. It was of paramount importance to maintain HungaryÂs nuclear research and 
development capabilities, not only for improving nuclear safety but also for attracting young 
people into the field of nuclear power plant operation and into nuclear regulatory activities. 
Those capabilities had been enhanced through the installation - at the Budapest Research 
Reactor Centre - of a cold neutron source which significantly increased the usefulness of the 
research reactor not only in the area of neutron physics research but also in the investigation of 
the ageing of structural materials. Hungary greatly appreciated the support which it had 
received from the Agency and the European Union in that connection, and, given the safe 
operation of the research reactor, it was ready to offer its research reactor safety expertise to 
the Agency in support of work on preparing a code of conduct on the safety of research 
reactors. 
60. The application of nuclear techniques in fields such as medicine, agriculture, industry 
and environmental protection was of great importance. SAGNA could play a catalytic role in 
opening up new fields of application and could further increase the effectiveness of 
co-ordinated research programmes by creating synergy with other Agency activities. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 14 

61. Hungary had noted with satisfaction the efforts of the Secretariat to ensure that the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities were in line with national development priorities. 
Governmental commitment should be a central criterion in the technical co-operation project 
selection process, and projects matching the Âcore competenceÂ of the Agency should enjoy 
first priority. 
62. The AgencyÂs comprehensive regional technical co-operation programme for Europe in 
the area of nuclear power was helping Hungary to keep abreast of developments relating to 
nuclear safety. Such regional activities were an important source of expertise and an 
important means of experience-sharing. 
63. The Agency had been one of the first organizations to realize the potential importance of 
nuclear emergency preparedness and to initiate co-ordination efforts in that connection. A 
series of national and regional programmes had been conducted in eastern Europe, and, as a 
result, emergency planning and preparedness in Hungary had made significant strides. Given 
its vital importance, nuclear emergency preparedness had become a focal point of the 
activities of other international organizations too, but closer co-ordination between the 
Agency and those organizations should improve overall efficiency. The signing of a 
memorandum of understanding between the Agency and OECD/NEA would be an important 
step in the right direction. 
64. Mr. BENDJABALLAH (Algeria) expressed the deep sorrow of his delegation 
following the recent terrorist attacks on the United States of America. His delegationÂs 
thoughts were with the victims and their families. Such reprehensible acts should once more 
remind all how essential it was to strengthen international co-operation in the struggle against 
terrorism. Algeria, itself a victim of terrorism, had for many years been calling for greater 
international co-operation in that struggle. 
65. At the current session of the General Conference, Member States should not only renew 
their commitment to the objectives of the Agency but also undertake to work together in 
complete solidarity in helping to bring peace, security and prosperity to all. For its part, 
Algeria would continue making its full contribution to the efforts to promote the utilization of 
nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes and to strengthen the non-proliferation 
regime, of which the Agency was an essential element. 
66. That contribution had found very concrete expression during the 2000 NPT Review 
Conference, over which his country had had the honour to preside and where the States parties 
to the NPT had, for the first time, entered into an unequivocal commitment to eliminate 
nuclear arsenals and had agreed on specific measures designed to lead to their elimination. 
67. In that spirit, Algeria had just embarked on the process of ratifying the CTBT, which 
was one of the pillars of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
68. It was important that every Member State help to preserve what had already been 
attained in the way towards true nuclear disarmament - attainments which were still fragile. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 15 

Accordingly, Member States should abstain from all actions which might jeopardize those 
attainments, for the prize was peace and security throughout the world. 

69. Broader utilization of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes presupposed the complete 
control of it, so as to ensure its acceptance by the public. Hence the importance of the 
AgencyÂs activities in the areas of nuclear, radiation and waste safety, to which Algeria was 
giving its full support. The intensification of efforts relating to -for example -the safety and 
security of radiation sources called for wider international co-operation, which the Agency 
should do more to promote. 
70. The same applied with regard to the physical protection of nuclear material, which was a 
fundamental aspect of nuclear safety. His country appreciated the importance of becoming 
party to the CPPNM. 
71. One of the AgencyÂs principal tasks remained that of promoting the use of nuclear 
techniques in support of socio-economic development. The activities in question were 
helping developing countries to achieve a minimum of well-being by enabling them to 
respond to basic needs in the areas of food security, water supply and human health. 
72. His delegation, which attached great importance to increasing the effectiveness of the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, believed that the necessary balance between the 
various roles of the Agency should be maintained and that everything should be done to 
ensure that the resources of the TCF were assured, predictable and sufficient for full 
implementation of the AgencyÂs statutory tasks. 
73. Algeria, which considered the AgencyÂs safeguards system to be one of the surest means 
of preventing the diversion of nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes, intended to 
conclude subsidiary arrangements pursuant to its safeguards agreement with the Agency in the 
near future. 
74. The strengthening of the safeguards system, which his authorities were following 
closely, required from countries like Algeria a sustained effort in order to respond to the 
requirements of the Model Additional Protocol. His country was gradually establishing the 
regulatory framework and the structures necessary for fulfilling in an optimum manner the 
obligations associated with the strengthened safeguards system. 
75. Innumerable socio-economic development needs had prompted developing countries to 
initiate co-operation in the field of nuclear science and technology at the regional level. 
African Member States had initiated such co-operation through AFRA, which deserved wide 
support from the AgencyÂs membership. 
76. Algeria, a founder-member of AFRA, was participating very actively in all AFRA 
projects relating to radiation safety, human health, agricultural productivity and industrial 
applications of radiation technology, and it intended to work still more closely with other 
African Member States within the AFRA framework in seeking to increase the effectiveness 
of AFRA projects and thereby to contribute to sustainable development in Africa. In that 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 16 

context, it would be hosting, in April 2002, the 13th meeting of the AFRA Technical Working 
Group. 

77. The question of the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East was important 
in many respects, particularly because of the need to make the non-proliferation regime 
universal and thereby help to create a climate of peace and security in that troubled region. 
With the exception of Israel, all States in the Middle East had concluded full-scope safeguards 
agreements with the Agency, thus demonstrating their commitment to using nuclear energy 
exclusively for peaceful purposes. It was necessary to work for the implementation of the 
General Conference resolutions on that question - as an important step towards the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
78. The present dangerous situation in the Middle East highlighted the problem of the threat 
posed by IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities. Urgent action was needed in order to induce Israel to 
accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards - one of the 
preconditions for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East and for the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. 
79. Two years previously, the General Conference had approved an amendment to 
Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute which would open the way for an expansion of the Board 
of Governors. Now, it was important that the amendment - the result of 25 years of difficult 
negotiations - enter into force so that the legitimate expectations of many Member States, 
particularly African ones, might be realized and the decision-making process within the 
Agency might become more democratic. For its part, Algeria had deposited an instrument of 
acceptance of the amendment with the depositary Government in June 2001, and it would like 
to see many other Member States following suit. 
80. Mr. MONTOYA (Peru) condemned the 11 September terrorist attacks on the 
United States of America and expressed condolences to the United States Government and to 
the families of the victims. 
81. Since the 2000 session of the General Conference, Peru had benefited from a wide range 
of Agency-sponsored activities relating to fields such as the evaluation and exploitation of 
water and mineral resources, the genetic improvement of cereals, radiotherapy, radioisotope 
and radiopharmaceutical production and food irradiation. Particularly worthy of note was 
Model Project PER/5/024, ÂIntroduction of barley and other native crop mutant cultivarsÂ, 
which was being implemented in co-operation with FAO. The Model Project had led to 
improvements in the pest-resistance of barley and other native cereals of high nutritional 
value. Seeds of the improved varieties would be distributed to farmers, to be sown during the 
2001 season over a total area of about 100 000 hectares in some of the poorest parts of the 
country. 
82. In addition, the Agency had been supporting bilateral projects being implemented by 
Peru together with Ecuador and Bolivia. In the case of co-operation with Ecuador, progress 
had been made in a feasibility study relating to the use of nuclear medicine in the diagnosis 
and treatment of thyroid diseases, and the possibility was being considered of proposing 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 17 

Agency-supported projects relating to human health, pest control, food irradiation, pollution 
control, the sustainable management of water resources and the detection of anti-personnel 
mines. In the case of co-operation with Bolivia, a study of sources of pollution in the Lake 
Titicaca basin was continuing, as was a study relating to the sustainable management of the 
two countriesÂ water resources. 

83. Peru attached great importance to ARCAL, which it had ratified in May, and it would 
host the ARCAL meeting to consider the regional co-operation programme for 2003-2004 and 
projections for subsequent years. 
84. His Government and the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute were grateful to the Agency 
for supporting international events organized in Peru such as ARCAL meetings on nuclear 
instrumentation maintenance, the standardization of nuclear nephrology techniques and 
quality assurance in the production of sterilized graft tissues. They were also grateful to the 
Agency for numerous advisory missions, for equipment such as a gamma camera for a nuclear 
medicine centre, and for a very large number of fellowships. 
85. There was a need to continue promoting the conclusion of multilateral legal instruments 
covering various aspects of nuclear power. There was also a need for greater compliance by 
Member States with the existing legal instruments, particularly those relating to nuclear, 
radiation, transport and waste safety, with a view to creating a climate of public opinion more 
in favour of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
86. The Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute had continued carrying out important safetyrelated 
activities such as the calibration of dosimeters, the quality control of radioisotopes and 
radiopharmaceuticals, and environmental radiation monitoring. Regrettably, for financial 
reasons the Institute had not been properly represented at some important regional meetings 
on the physical protection of nuclear materials and radiation protection. 
87. His delegation was pleased with the progress made in revising the AgencyÂs Transport 
Regulations and arranging for their incorporation into the regulations of the international 
modal organizations. It was also pleased that transport safety was being considered under a 
separate agenda sub-item at the current session of the General Conference. 
88. His delegation welcomed the decision of an important Member State involved in the 
international transport of radioactive materials to request a TranSAS mission, but it was 
concerned about the fact that the resources available to the Agency for meeting similar 
requests from other Member States were extremely scarce. 
89. There was a need for constructive dialogue between, on one hand, the States which were 
involved in the international transport of radioactive materials and, on the other, potentially 
affected States about issues such as the early notification of shipments, emergency and 
recovery plans and the establishment of effective liability mechanisms. 
90. Member States should increase their political and legal support for the efforts being 
made to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. In particular, they should facilitate the 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 18 

AgencyÂs verification activities by concluding protocols additional to their safeguards 
agreements with the Agency. For its part, Peru had on 23 July become the first Latin 
American country to have an additional protocol in force. In December 2001, Peru would be 
hosting a regional seminar - organized by the Agency with the support of OPANAL and the 
United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America 
and the Caribbean - to promote the Model Additional Protocol among States parties to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty. 

91. In conclusion, he said that the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stood ready to make its 
scientific and technical expertise available for Agency activities aimed at promoting 
sustainable development and strengthening nuclear and radiation safety and nuclear 
non-proliferation worldwide. 
92. Mr. LIPÃR (Slovakia) extended, on behalf of the people of Slovakia, heartfelt 
sympathy to those who had been affected by the tragedy which had occurred the previous 
week in the United States of America. 
93. Slovakia strongly supported the AgencyÂs programme for strengthening the 
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and further enhancing the 
AgencyÂs ability to draw, for the State as a whole, conclusions as to whether nuclear material 
placed under safeguards remained in peaceful nuclear activities or was otherwise adequately 
accounted for. The 58 additional protocols approved by the Board of Governors represented a 
major contribution to the strengthening of the safeguards system. Slovakia had signed a 
protocol additional to its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency and was taking steps to 
bring it into force and implement its provisions. 
94. The efforts of the Secretariat in negotiating and concluding safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols were to be commended, but there was a significant number of States party 
to the NPT which had not concluded NPT safeguards agreements and the associated 
additional protocols. His delegation would like to see those States concluding NPT 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols without further delay. 
95. In Slovakia, the spent nuclear fuel from the power reactors in operation was being stored 
on-site and small quantities of nuclear material were being used by so-called Âsmall usersÂ. 
All nuclear facilities and all nuclear material within Slovak territory were subject to full-scope 
Agency safeguards in accordance with SlovakiaÂs NPT safeguards agreement. In addition, the 
Nuclear Regulatory Authority was performing regular inspections at the countryÂs nuclear 
facilities and at the premises of Âsmall usersÂ in accordance with the provisions of SlovakiaÂs 
Atomic Energy Act. 
96. Since the previous session of the General Conference there had been no significant 
development with regard to a ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
To be credible, such a ban would have to be irreversible and subject to verification carried out 
under the auspices of the Agency. Slovakia would like the Secretariat to make its expertise 
available for that purpose. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 19 

97. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the importance of the cessation of all 
nuclear weapon tests. Despite the growing number of ratifying States, the CTBT had not yet 
entered into force. His delegation would like to see far more States signing and ratifying the 
CTBT, particularly States whose ratification was a prerequisite for the CTBTÂs entry into 
force, and hoped that the forthcoming conference of States which had already deposited their 
instruments of ratification of the CTBT would give fresh impetus to the ratification process. 
98. Under SlovakiaÂs energy strategy, nuclear power would remain important in the medium 
term. Since the previous session of the General Conference, a project for the safety upgrading 
of Units 1 and 2 of the Bohunice NPP had been completed. At the invitation of his 
Government, an Agency team had reviewed the results of the upgrading. It had concluded inter 
alia -that in some respects the upgrading had gone beyond what the Agency 
recommended for the safety upgrading of WWER-440/230 reactors. 
99. In the area of radiation protection, an amendment to SlovakiaÂs Public Health Protection 
Act and new radiation protection regulations had entered into force in 2000; they took into 
account the relevant international regulations and recommendations, including those of the 
Agency. His delegation welcomed the willingness of the Secretariat to send a peer review 
team to Slovakia for the purpose of assessing the countryÂs radiation protection infrastructure. 
100. On the basis of operational performance and regulatory inspection results, the Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority considered that all nuclear facilities in Slovakia were operating safely, 
reliably and in accordance with the relevant regulations. 
101. Slovakia was continuing to co-operate in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy with 
more than 20 other Member States and with a number of international organizations, 
including the Agency. It was co-operating with the Agency in dozens of national, regional 
and interregional technical co-operation projects. One national project, relating to 
radiochemical facilities for the production of medical radionuclides, was of the utmost 
importance for Slovakia, which was supporting it through a national contribution in the 
amount of $1.45 million. 
102. The competent Slovak authorities attached great importance to the expert services 
provided through the Agency in the areas of nuclear and radiation safety, regarding them as 
valuable support for the national regulatory decision-making process. His Government was 
grateful to the Director General and the Secretariat for the expert services which had been 
provided to Slovakia in those areas. 
103. His delegation would like the Secretariat to continue providing OSART, IRRT and other 
safety-related services. In addition, it would like more attention to be paid to the transfer of 
knowledge about nuclear technologies. 
104. The Secretariat had been organizing, in co-operation with his Government, workshops 
for experts from all over the world. The feedback from participants had been very positive, 
and his Government stood ready to host further such workshops. Also, there were Slovak 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 20 

organizations with broad experience in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy which would be 
pleased to receive fellows and scientific visitors sponsored by the Agency. 

105. Special attention was being devoted in Slovakia to co-operation with neighbouring 
countries. Regular meetings of senior governmental experts were being held to consider 
questions of common interest and exchange experience in the area of peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. His Government regarded such meetings as important for confidence-building. 
106. Against that background, his Government looked forward to further meaningful 
co-operation with other Member States and with international organizations such as the 
Agency. 
107. Mr. MURPHY (Ireland) said that, following the horrific events of 11 September 
in the United States of America, his delegationÂs thoughts were with the American people, 
particularly the families of the victims. 
108. Ireland continued to regard the non-proliferation regime based on the NPT as the 
cornerstone of the collective international effort to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and to 
achieve their elimination. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had provided a blueprint for 
intensified negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons. The role of the Agency, set 
out in the NPT itself, remained crucial. Ireland, which had in 1997 welcomed the BoardÂs 
approval of the Model Additional Protocol, was close to bringing the protocol additional to its 
NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency into force. 
109. Ireland had in the previous two years paid its full TCF target shares, and he hoped that it 
would pay its full TCF target shares in the future. It did not support the use of TCF resources 
to promote the expansion of nuclear power generation, but it did welcome TCF-financed 
activities in the area of radiation protection. Staff of its national regulatory authority for 
radiation protection - the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland - had been directly 
involved in such activities. 
110. Ireland had long before rejected the nuclear power option because of strong misgivings 
about safety and the environmental risks. In IrelandÂs view, any economic benefits of nuclear 
power generation were significantly outweighed by the long-term harmful effects on public 
health and the environment. IrelandÂs approach to nuclear power generation therefore focused 
on nuclear safety, radiation protection and emergency preparedness. 
111. Although primary responsibility for the regulation and safe use of nuclear installations 
rested with those countries which had chosen the nuclear power option, nuclear safety was a 
legitimate concern also of other countries, particularly neighbouring ones. Because of its 
close proximity to certain nuclear installations, Ireland had concerns relating to plant 
operations, radioactive waste storage, radioactive discharges into the marine and the terrestrial 
environment, the transport of nuclear fuel and other radioactive materials, and the ever-present 
risk of a major accident. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 21 

112. Some governments, international organizations and other stakeholders saw global 
warming, climate change and the need for sustainable energy development as arguments for 
re-emphasizing the nuclear power option. In IrelandÂs view, nuclear power generation was 
incompatible with sustainable development, mainly for security and safety reasons. Ireland, 
which was particularly worried about the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel, saw no merit 
in the suggestion that nuclear power generation might be a solution to the problem of 
greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear accidents did not respect international boundaries, and 
countries which had rejected the nuclear power option should not be exposed to the risks of 
such accidents. At a time when some of the worldÂs most advanced countries were phasing 
out their nuclear installations, it would be a mistake to encourage developing countries to 
adopt nuclear power as part of their energy mix. 
113. Ireland, which had been the twenty-fifth State to ratify the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 
thereby ensuring its entry into force, believed that the Joint Convention would be a major 
pillar of the international nuclear safety regime. 
114. The Convention on Nuclear Safety was another such pillar. Ireland had taken part in the 
first Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties, in 1999, and was looking forward to 
participating in the second Review Meeting, in April 2002. 
115. Over the past decade or so, the Agency had been very actively involved in improving the 
safety of reactors in central and eastern Europe and in States of the former Soviet Union. In 
IrelandÂs view, if those reactors could not be upgraded quickly in order to meet modern safety 
standards, they should be shut down and decommissioned. Ireland welcomed the initiatives of 
the Agency, the European Union and OECD/NEA aimed at improving nuclear safety 
standards and establishing effective nuclear regulatory regimes in the countries in question, 
especially those which were candidates for European Union membership. 
116. The potential for catastrophic damage associated with nuclear-related activities made 
nuclear liability a very important issue. It was essential that there be an international nuclear 
liability regime providing for appropriate levels of compensation and including simple, 
effective and impartial mechanisms for the speedy settlement of claims. Ireland was 
concerned about the adequacy of the compensation provided for by the existing international 
nuclear liability instruments. Without an effective and generally recognized liability regime, 
including an enhanced compensation regime, international efforts to improve nuclear safety 
would be greatly undermined. 
117. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile) expressed his delegationÂs solidarity with the 
people of the United States of America following the terrorist attacks which had taken place 
there the previous week. 
118. In general, public opinion was negative about the uses of nuclear energy, and that was 
reflected in the manner in which the subject was dealt with at the United Nations, where 
nuclear energy was referred to mainly in the General AssemblyÂs First Committee and in 
discussions regarding weapons of mass destruction and nuclear weapons proliferation. With a 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 22 

view to dispelling some of the suspicions about - and highlighting the benefits of -the uses of 
nuclear energy, especially in the developing world, his country intended to propose that the 
subject be taken up during the General AssemblyÂs 2002 session in the Fourth Committee 
under an agenda item with a title along the lines of ÂInternational co-operation in the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energyÂ. It was his countryÂs hope that, with the highlighting of the 
potential direct benefits of the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, the Agency would 
acquire greater visibility and influence, leading to appropriate follow-up action on the part of 
the AgencyÂs Secretariat. Meanwhile, his delegation wished the Director General to submit to 
the General Conference, for consideration at its next session, a report on the political and legal 
possibilities associated with his countryÂs initiative. 

119. Safety in the transport of radioactive materials was a matter of particular concern to 
Chile, especially because of its unusual geography. His country, which abided by the United 
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, attached very great importance to care in the 
handling, exploration, exploitation and conservation of natural resources within its exclusive 
economic zone. Against that background, his country strongly believed that it was necessary 
to continue striving at the multilateral level to strengthen the present regulations governing the 
transport of radioactive materials, filling the gaps in the international legal provisions relating 
to safety - and especially to contamination of the marine environment, the advance 
notification of the start of shipments and the selected routes, contingency plans, the recovery 
of discharged materials, and liability mechanisms. 
120. There was need for continuous strengthening of all regulations designed to make the 
transport of radioactive waste and irradiated nuclear fuel safer, in accordance with the general 
principles of modern international law. To that end, Chile had decided to embark on a process 
of consultation and co-ordination with other interested countries in order to ensure that the 
matter was addressed by the relevant international organizations. 
121. Document GC(45)/INF/18, distributed at the request of the Chairman of GRULAC, 
contained declarations by various Member States - including Chile - and regional groups 
regarding safety in the maritime transport of radioactive materials, and Chile - together with 
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Turkey and 
Uruguay - had submitted a draft resolution on the matter (GC(45)/COM.5/L.3). 
122. The energy situation at the start of the 21st century was characterized by great 
uncertainties which could result in growing instability on a world scale. In developing 
countries, some 2000 million people were still having to make do without electricity, and it 
was expected that worldwide electricity consumption would double during the next 50 years. 
In that context, it was essential to make the public aware of the importance of nuclear energy 
for socio-economic development. In order to dispel the doubts in the minds of many people, 
including many decision-makers, it was necessary to interact in a sustained and systematic 
manner with various influential players on the international scene, including major 
non-governmental organizations, and to develop - through formal and informal contacts -a 
consistent academic and scientific approach taking into account all the variables, especially 
those of importance for the achievement of a better quality of life. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 23 

123. An issue which should be addressed more seriously and decisively than in the past was 
the sustainability of nuclear energy. The work of the United Nations Commission on 
Sustainable Development should therefore receive strong support, with a view to clarifying 
any remaining uncertainties. That would mean more intensive contacts with the relevant 
United Nations bodies. 
124. At its present session, the General Conference had an opportunity of addressing two 
concerns of many countries -how to reduce the risks associated with the transport of 
radioactive waste and how to highlight - in a politically relevant manner and in the right 
quarters - the benefits of the uses of nuclear energy. It was important to devise ways of 
arriving at a balanced view which would enjoy the support of informed public opinion and 
result in closer international co-operation. 
125. Chile, which was an active member of OPANAL, would like to see the Agency and 
OPANAL signing a memorandum of understanding designed to intensify the contacts between 
the two organizations and increase their ability to achieve their respective objectives. In that 
connection, it attached great importance to the seminar on the peaceful utilization of nuclear 
energy and on the safeguards regime which the Government of Peru was organizing jointly 
with the Agency and OPANAL and which would be taking place in Lima in December, and it 
welcomed the fact that the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and 
Development in Latin America and the Caribbean would be participating in the seminar. 
126. Lastly, his delegation, which was very concerned about the devastating impact which 
the drought in Central America was having on the countries there, hoped that all delegations 
would support the request, made on the initiative of Guatemala, for the preparation of a 
technical co-operation project on the use of isotope hydrology in the search for further 
groundwater resources in Central America. 
127. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey), expressing his delegationÂs sympathy with the victims 
of the recent terrorist attacks on the United States of America, condemned the attacks and said 
that, as his Government had declared on a number of occasions, Turkey was ready to 
co-operate with all nations in the fight against terrorism. 
128. In 2000, despite budgetary constraints, the Agency had been remarkably successful in 
carrying out a multitude of activities relating to verification, safety and nuclear technology. 
His delegation particularly appreciated the success of the Agency in addressing the needs of 
developing countries. 
129. In his delegationÂs view, nuclear energy would occupy a leading place among the power 
sources which did not contribute to global climate change. However, his delegation was 
aware that there were reservations about the wide utilization of nuclear energy stemming 
mainly from concerns about safety, sustainability, cost-effectiveness and nuclear weapons 
proliferation. Accordingly, it welcomed the establishment of INPRO, which it believed would 
help to address those concerns. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 24 

130. In that context, his delegation hoped that the studies on small and medium-sized reactor 
technology which were currently under way would give new impetus to projects in areas such 
as nuclear desalination. It believed that the Agency had a unique role to play in bringing 
technology-seekers together with technology-developers in the decades to come. Turkey 
looked forward to participating in INPRO and hoped that other Member States would support 
it through the provision of extrabudgetary resources. 
131. The question of the utilization of nuclear energy was creating controversy in many 
countries, including Turkey, which, believing that the main reason was the difficulty of 
explaining nuclear energy and nuclear technology to the public, had proposed a technical 
co-operation project entitled ÂPublic Awareness of Nuclear Energy and Comparative Energy 
StudiesÂ which was currently being implemented. The project was the first project of its kind, 
and continuous Agency support was of utmost importance for its sustainability. 
132. His delegation was very pleased that the Agency was implementing an increasing 
number of projects in which nuclear techniques were being used in addressing human needs in 
various fields. One such field was the detection of land mines. The project in question was of 
utmost importance, and his Government, aware of the human suffering caused by land mines, 
would continue to support it. 
133. His delegation was grateful to the Secretariat for helping with the organization of the 
1st Eurasian Conference on Nuclear Science and its Applications, which had taken place in 
Izmir the previous year and been attended by more than 250 scientists and other experts from 
nine countries and a number of international organizations. 
134. Following the adoption by the General Conference in 2000 of a resolution on 
ÂStrengthening co-operation between nuclear research centres in the area of the peaceful 
applications of nuclear technologyÂ, a seminar on the sustainability of and co-operation 
between nuclear research centres in the area of the peaceful applications of nuclear technology 
was to be held in Ankara the following month. The seminar, organized jointly by the Agency, 
the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Organization (BSECO) and the Turkish Atomic Energy 
Authority, would bring together the senior managers of nuclear institutions of the BSECO 
countries. 
135. Taking measures to ensure high levels of nuclear, radiation and waste safety was a 
national responsibility that States should assume in the interest of their own peoples and of the 
world as a whole. Turkey, which believed that the existence of binding international safety 
conventions was important for the development of safety culture worldwide, greatly 
appreciated the safety standards developed by the Agency and would like to see them adopted 
by all States and all relevant organizations. 
136. In response to a request made by Turkey, there was to be a TranSAS mission to Turkey 
the following month. His delegation had been pleased to learn that a number of other Member 
States were considering requesting TranSAS missions, and it would like to see arrangements 
made whereby such missions could be funded from technical co-operation resources. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 25 

137. Turkey, which greatly appreciated the work done by the Secretariat in reviewing and 
periodically revising the AgencyÂs Transport Regulations, welcomed the SecretariatÂs plan to 
convene a Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material early in 2003 and 
would be pleased to host the Conference in Istanbul. 
138. There was considerable concern in the world about the safety of research reactors. It 
was particularly worrying that the Agency did not have adequate information on many of the 
651 research reactors in the world. Turkey believed that there was a need for a binding 
international legal instrument on the safety of research reactors -for example, an amended 
Convention on Nuclear Safety or a protocol to the Convention. It supported the idea of the 
preparation of a code of conduct on the safety of research reactors within the framework of an 
Agency-organized international research reactor safety enhancement programme. 
139. The absence of evidence of non-compliance by State parties to the NPT with their 
safeguards obligations was a positive sign. Nevertheless, it did not mean complete immunity 
from the risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Being close to regions 
generally regarded as having a significant potential for proliferation, Turkey attached great 
importance to the speedy entry into force of strengthened safeguards measures. 
140. In that context, he was pleased to announce that the protocol additional to the NPT 
safeguards agreement between Turkey and the Agency had entered into force on 17 July 2001. 
141. In Turkey, which attached the utmost importance to the fight against illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials, there were plans to upgrade the existing equipment for the detection of 
nuclear materials and other radioactive sources passing through customs. In addition, the 
United States and Turkey had entered into a co-operative arrangement providing for -inter 
alia - the installation of advanced radiation detection equipment at Turkish border points-ofentry. 
142. In order to enhance the ability of selected Turkish laboratories to analyse seized nuclear 
materials, the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority had started co-operating with the European 
Commission in a project through which personnel were trained and technical upgrades carried 
out. 
143. It was regrettable that since the General ConferenceÂs 2000 session the Director General 
had been unable to make progress in convening a safeguards forum for participants from the 
Middle East. His country would like to see all countries of the Middle East doing their utmost 
to alleviate the tension prevalent in the region. For true and reliable application of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards in the Middle East, it was indispensable that all States in that region 
adhere to the NPT. 
144. The situation in Iraq continued to be a source of concern. Iraq should implement in full 
all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and give the Agency the access 
necessary for implementing its mandate in Iraq.

145. Turkey, which greatly appreciated the efforts of the Director General and the AgencyÂs 
staff to implement the safeguards agreement between the Agency and the DPRK, would like 
to see the DPRK complying fully with that agreement in order that the Agency might 
complete the verification of the DPRKÂs initial declaration at an early date. 
146. As a technology recipient, Turkey considered the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities to be very useful as long as they were linked to real needs. In recent years, the 
application of the Model Project concept and the Country Programme Framework exercise 
had helped considerably in guiding the selection of technical co-operation projects both by 
national authorities and by the Secretariat. 
147. The Turkish authorities were pleased with the success attained in national and regional 
projects in 2000 and with the overall project implementation rate, and Turkey, which attached 
great importance to the TCF, would once more be paying its full TCF target share. 
148. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic), expressing her delegationÂs condolences to the 
people of the United States of America and the families of the victims of the 11 September 
terrorist attacks, said her delegation hoped that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. 
149. Having subscribed to the statement made by the delegate Belgium on behalf of the 
European Union, she said that the Czech Republic supported the ongoing efforts to strengthen 
the Agency and increase its effectiveness and efficiency in the face of budgetary constraints. 
It was essential to make better use of the Agency while preserving the objective character of 
its work. 
150. The importance of the AgencyÂs responsibilities in connection with the NPT could not 
be overstated. The Czech Republic was about to complete the domestic legislative steps 
necessary for bringing into force the protocol additional to its NPT safeguards agreement with 
the Agency. Comprehensive amendment of its Atomic Energy Act, on which the Parliament 
would deliberate before the end of the year, was the last prerequisite for ratification. 
151. The Czech Republic, which had acceded to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, would like to see 
many more Member States acceding to the Joint Convention in time to participate in the first 
Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties. 
152. Her Government had already approved a national report - which included information 
about the Dukovany and the Temelin NPP - for consideration at the second Review Meeting 
of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Her delegation was confident 
that the Review Meeting would demonstrate the full compliance of the Czech Republic with 
its obligations under the Convention. 
153. Her delegation welcomed the AgencyÂs role in the consideration of whether the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material should be amended. Like the 
European Union, the Czech Republic was in favour of deciding on the need for a review 
conference after a well-defined draft amendment to the Convention had been prepared. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 27 

154. The Czech Government had recently approved an updated national energy policy. The 
nuclear power option had been retained, but a greater effort would be made to use energy 
more efficiently and to promote the utilization of renewable energy sources. There would be 
stronger emphasis on quality control and transparency in the nuclear industry and on the 
independence of those working in the areas of nuclear safety and radiation protection. 
155. The commissioning of the Temelin NPP was nearing its final stage. The first of the two 
units had become critical for the first time on 11 October 2000, in accordance with the licence 
issued by the National Regulatory Authority. In tests at up to 55% of nominal power, the 
nuclear island design had been found to be in compliance with the licensing criteria. In 
addition, as in the case of the Looviisa, Mochovce and Paks NPPs, it had been demonstrated 
that a combination of reliable, modern instrumentation and control systems with WWER 
technology made for a high level of safety. Some technical problems had occurred in the 
non-nuclear part of the plant. In particular, turbine vibrations had caused a four-month outage 
and necessitated repairs. In recent weeks, however, the operator had shown, through a series 
of tests, that the measures taken to eliminate the problem had been appropriate. The licenceholder 
was about to apply for regulatory approval to carry out commissioning tests at 75% of 
nominal power. 
156. The Temelin NPP had undergone thorough licensing procedures before the first unit had 
become critical for the first time, and no anomalies had occurred so far during the 
commissioning tests. Recognizing the international dimension of nuclear safety and radiation 
protection issues, however, the Czech authorities and the licence-holder had submitted the 
design and its improvements to the scrutiny of independent peer reviews with international 
participation. In 2000 and 2001 alone, four teams had been sent by the Agency to the Temelin 
NPP -and a fifth team was scheduled to visit the plant in November. Two teams had 
examined the operatorÂs preparations for safe commissioning and operation. The other two 
teams had reviewed the framework for and conduct of regulatory activities. In addition, there 
had been a number of similar - unfortunately for the most part overlapping - reviews by bodies 
such as WENRA and the European Union Atomic Questions Group. Nevertheless, the first 
unit of the Temelin NPP had become the subject of heated international debate with few 
rational, technical arguments. Her delegation believed that the bilateral consultative process 
launched by the Czech Prime Minister and the Austrian Federal Chancellor, and supported by 
Commissioner Verheugen, would ultimately reassure the Czech RepublicÂs south-eastern 
neighbours that the Temelin NPPÂs safety standards were on a par with those prevailing in the 
European Union. Any attempt to link the Temelin NPP safety issue with other, unrelated 
issues would not benefit anyone. 
157. In the Temelin NPP debate, there had been minimum use of peer review results, despite 
their being available to the public. Moreover, there had even been attempts to belittle the 
competence of expert organizations, including the Agency. The overlapping of safety surveys 
had made matters worse. Her delegation would like to see a better co-ordination of activities 
at the international level, with greater involvement of the Agency, which should consider 
speaking up more often about the results of reviews carried out under its auspices. Also, an 
initiative was needed to heighten the awareness of the general public and of politicians with 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 28 

regard to the philosophy behind safety requirements and recommendations and to the 
measures taken to maintain the safety level of nuclear installations throughout their service 
lives. That would enable operators and regulators to concentrate more on their primary 
mission - ensuring operational safety and thereby protecting the public. 

158. During the current year, the Czech Republic had taken a further step towards a balance 
between the technical assistance which it received and the technical assistance which it 
provided through the Agency. It was gradually increasing its involvement in technical 
co-operation activities through which it could share its knowledge and expertise. Earlier in 
the year it had pledged voluntary financial contributions for technical co-operation projects in 
Armenia, Bulgaria and Georgia, and it was continuing to accept fellows and scientific visitors 
interested in the upgrading of national radiation protection networks in various parts of the 
world. 
159. Mr. NORENDAL (Norway), expressing deep sympathy with the American people 
after the devastating terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C., said that the entire 
Norwegian nation had been shocked and outraged. Norway condemned those barbaric 
attacks, which had targeted a large number of innocent civilians and violated the fundamental 
principles of humanity and democracy. 
160. Having associated his country with the statement made by the delegate of Belgium on 
behalf of the European Union, he said that strengthening the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs 
comprehensive safeguards system by means of the Model Additional Protocol was an 
important contribution to the enhancement of nuclear non-proliferation. The protocol 
additional to NorwayÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency had entered 
into force in May 2000, and the procedures for reporting to the Agency had been finalized. 
The Agency had carried out its first inspection in Norway under the terms of the additional 
protocol during the summer of 2001. 
161. It was disappointing, however, that so far only 56 countries had signed additional 
protocols and that only 21 additional protocols were in force. Norway would like to see many 
more countries signing additional protocols and speeding up their ratification procedures, so 
as to make the enhanced safeguards system as universal as possible. 
162. Export controls were of vital importance to nuclear non-proliferation, and in that 
connection his country supported the Nuclear Suppliers GroupÂs requirement of full-scope 
safeguards as a condition of supply. That requirement had been explicitly confirmed in the 
Final Document of the NPT Review and Extension Conference and endorsed at the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference. 
163. Norway, which was pleased that the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had entered into force, 
would take an active part in the December preparatory meeting for the first Review Meeting 
of the Contracting Parties. It hoped that many more States would become Contracting Parties 
in time to be able to attend the first Review Meeting. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 29 

164. As nuclear and radiological accidents could have a significant impact over wide areas, 
the competent authorities in individual countries needed official and accurate information 
about such accidents in other countries as early as possible. It was therefore important to 
establish an international consensus that all nuclear and radiological accidents likely to cause 
public concern were reported to the international community at a very early stage. 
165. In order to emphasize the important role of the Early Notification Convention and the 
Assistance Convention, Norway had at the General ConferenceÂs 2000 session submitted a 
draft resolution encouraging Member States and the Agency to increase their capabilities for 
responding to nuclear and radiological accidents (GC(44)/RES/24). The outcome of the first 
meeting of the competent authorities under those two conventions, held in June 2001, had 
confirmed NorwayÂs view that greater efforts were needed if the two conventions were to be 
implemented in a timely and cost-effective manner. In particular, the importance of the 
Agency as co-ordinator and facilitator had been emphasized and concern had been expressed 
about the AgencyÂs limited resources for fulfilling the tasks involved within a reasonable time 
frame. The development of harmonized and cost-effective response capabilities in countries 
parties to the conventions heavily depended on international co-ordination by the Agency. 
166. In June 2001, at a ministerial meeting of the Council of Baltic Sea States, an agreement 
on the exchange of radiation monitoring data had been signed. The agreement, the purpose of 
which was to ensure that the results from national gamma monitoring networks were made 
available without delay to all parties, was at present a regional one, but it was open for 
accession by other countries and by international organizations. Norway would welcome the 
accession of other countries and of international organizations, as that would create a better 
basis for assessments and decisions in the event of nuclear or radiological accidents. 
167. Effective information exchange was very important for the security of nuclear materials 
and other radioactive materials. His country therefore welcomed the results of the 
International Conference on Security of Material held in Stockholm in May 2001, which had 
concluded, among other things, that the Agency had a key role to play in supporting State 
efforts to improve the security of and combat illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and other 
radioactive materials by providing guidance, promoting technical development and, on 
request, giving direct assistance. 
168. In the final report of the informal open-ended expert meeting to discuss whether there is 
a need to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, it was 
concluded that there was a need to strengthen the international physical protection regime. 
That was an important issue, and Norway welcomed the initiatives taken by the Director 
General. 
169. The terrorist attacks on the United States of America had shown that some terrorist 
groups were willing to use any means in order to promote terror, and nuclear terrorism could 
not be ruled out as a possible scenario in the future. Norway therefore welcomed the fact that 
the threat of nuclear terrorism was on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly and 
the fact that the Secretariat was assisting the United Nations in that connection. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 30 

170. The challenges in north-west Russia were among NorwayÂs main concerns in the area of 
nuclear safety. Norway was participating in a number of projects in the region and 
co-operating closely with the Russian authorities. Russia was faced with the necessity of 
decommissioning and dismantling a large number of nuclear-powered naval vessels and safely 
conditioning and storing the radioactive waste and spent fuel. For that purpose a completely 
new infrastructure was needed, requiring huge investments. 
171. Under the AgencyÂs auspices, a nuclear clean-up strategy for Russia, with a list of 
priorities, was being established with the co-operation of the Russian authorities within the 
Contact Expert Group. Currently, support and assistance were being sought for a spent 
nuclear fuel and radioactive waste clean-up at the Andreyev Bay storage site in the Murmansk 
region. 
172. Norway, the United States, the European Commission and a number of European Union 
countries had since 1999 been working on the establishment of a multilateral legal framework 
for the provision of assistance to nuclear safety-related projects in Russia. Such a legal 
framework would be vital for the multilateral funding of large nuclear clean-up projects. 
173. Norway was satisfied with the 1998 agreement under the OSPAR Convention providing 
for significant reductions in discharges of radionuclides into the ocean, but it was 
disappointed that the agreement had not resulted in the expected reductions in discharges from 
spent fuel reprocessing facilities. Discharges of radionuclides such as technetium-99 had 
increased substantially in recent years, and Norway would like the relevant States, which were 
also parties to the OSPAR Convention, to take the measures necessary for reducing the 
discharges from their facilities in accordance with their commitments under that convention. 
174. As both a coastal and a shipping nation, Norway attached great importance to the work 
done in revising the AgencyÂs Transport Regulations. Following the April 2001 
recommendation of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development referred to 
in document GC(45)/INF/18, his delegation would like to see Agency Member States 
increasing their efforts to further improve measures and internationally agreed regulations 
relevant to the maritime transport of spent fuel and other radioactive materials. In particular, 
there was a need for effective liability mechanisms and effective arrangements for the 
provision of relevant information relating to shipments of radioactive materials, it being 
understood that the information should in no case be contradictory to the measures of physical 
security and safety. 
175. Norway, which considered projects financed from the TCF to be of vital importance to 
the recipient countries, had recently made an extrabudgetary contribution of $400 000 in 
support of a project aimed at helping to control the tsetse fly in Mali and Burkina Faso. 
176. The representation of women in the Secretariat at the Professional and higher levels was 
still rather low, particularly in the scientific and engineering fields. Member States should 
encourage women to study nuclear science and engineering and suitably qualified female 
graduates to apply for Professional posts in the Secretariat. The Director General was to be 
commended for creating the International Advisory Group on Gender Issues, and his 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 31 

delegation was looking forward to reviewing the action plan to be drawn up by the Secretariat 
in accordance with the recommendations of the Group. 

177. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland), expressing sympathy with the whole 
American nation, said that Poland had been profoundly shocked by the brutal acts of terrorism 
committed in the United States the previous week. 
178. Having associated his country with the statement made by the delegate of Belgium on 
behalf of the European Union, he said that the principal steps in accelerating and enlarging 
Âthe contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the worldÂ were 
the creation and maintenance of a global nuclear and radiation safety culture supplemented by 
a parallel security culture. For that it was necessary to have legally binding international 
conventions together with internationally accepted safety standards. One such convention, the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive 
Waste Management, had entered into force in June, with Poland as one of the Contracting 
Parties. His country hoped that there would be wide adherence to the Joint Convention and, 
in particular, that all States with operating nuclear power plants would accede to it. 
Moreover, it attached great importance to effective implementation of the Joint ConventionÂs 
provisions and to the general publicÂs seeing that those provisions were being implemented 
effectively. 
179. There were no nuclear power plants in operation in Poland, and no nuclear power plants 
were planned. However, Poland wished to keep the nuclear power option open. It was 
therefore elaborating a set of regulations and a technical and organizational infrastructure for 
the management of radioactive waste generated by a variety of nuclear applications and the 
operation of research reactors and for the management of spent fuel from research reactors 
which would, in the longer term, be taken into account during strategic consideration of 
whether Poland should decide in favour of nuclear power. 
180. Poland, which had been among the first countries to conclude protocols additional to 
their safeguards agreement with the Agency, would like to see the regrettably short list of 
countries with ratified additional protocols grow substantially, as the implementation of 
additional protocols would be an important element of the global nuclear security system. 
181. Poland was in the process of preparing a national report for consideration at the second 
Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, to be held 
in 2002. The report would cover - inter alia - PolandÂs new Atomic Energy Act, which 
provided for an effective separation of regulatory functions from promotional ones and for 
real independence of the regulatory body. 
182. Poland, which shared the view that the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material should be amended in order to address the issue of preventing the 
unauthorized possession of nuclear material and unauthorized access to nuclear facilities, had 
recently adopted two regulations relating to the area of operation of the Convention - one on 
the physical protection of nuclear material and one on nuclear material accounting. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 32 

183. Poland greatly appreciated the steps taken by the Secretariat to strengthen both technical 
co-operation between the Agency and Member States and TCDC. It particularly welcomed 
the ÂPartners in DevelopmentÂ concept, which was being successfully implemented through 
regional agreements (one not formally signed in the case of Europe) and TCDC. As both a 
provider and a recipient of technical assistance through the Agency, Poland had for years been 
participating successfully in various technical co-operation activities - for example, by making 
its research centres available for training carried out under the auspices of the Agency. 
184. In line with its usual practice, Poland had already paid its full share of the current target 
for the TCF. It believed that strict and consistent application of the Âdue accountÂ principle 
could be an effective way of inducing Member States to pay their full TCF target shares and 
also any assessed programme costs owed by them to the Agency. It also believed that the 
Secretariat could make the AgencyÂs insufficient technical co-operation resources go further 
by promoting regional co-operation and TCDC and through the expanded outsourcing of 
technical co-operation activities. 
185. Welcoming the fact that, for the first time, there was an agenda sub-item devoted to the 
Nuclear Technology Review, he said that, at a time when nuclear power had become a subject 
of lively discussion in international fora, both governmental and non-governmental, a concise 
review of recent developments relating to nuclear power was very useful for Member States. 
At the same time, his delegation hoped that in future editions of the Nuclear Technology 
Review more attention would be paid to nuclear applications. 
186. Although Poland supported the policy of zero real Regular Budget growth, it realized 
that the policy had created a situation where implementation of the AgencyÂs approved 
programme relied very significantly on extrabudgetary resources, making comprehensive 
planning difficult. Moreover, matters were not improved by the fact that some Member 
States, besides not paying their full TCF target shares, were not paying their full assessed 
contributions. Poland, which was just finishing a term as a member of the Board, hoped that 
the implementation of resolution GC(44)/RES/8 (on the financing of technical co-operation) 
and resolution GC(44)/RES/9 (on the financing of safeguards) would benefit the AgencyÂs 
programmes. 
187. Mr. BADDOU (Morocco) expressed the condolences of his delegation in the face 
of the losses and grief caused by the acts of abject barbarism to which the United States of 
America had recently been subjected. 
188. The General Conference was meeting at a time when large sections of the populations of 
Member States were calling for security and for protection of the environment. By virtue of 
its Statute and the mandate conferred on it by Member States, the Agency had a duty to help 
in bringing about the peace without which the demands in question would remain a dead 
letter. 
189. Morocco deplored the worsening of the situation in the Middle East, which was due to 
the refusal of Israel to comply with international legal norms. The other countries in the 
Middle East were parties to the NPT and in most cases had concluded full-scope safeguards 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 33 

agreements with the Agency, whereas Israel was continuing to disregard the relevant 
resolutions of the Security Council, refusing to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency safeguards. His delegation would like to see all States with special 
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security rendering all assistance 
to the Director General in his efforts to facilitate the early application of full-scope Agency 
safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East. 

190. Progress in the utilization of nuclear energy and the broad acceptance of nuclear power 
generation by the public would depend very much on there being an extremely good safety 
record. That called for a comprehensive and integrated set of binding legal instruments and 
rigorous standards, brought up to date continuously and accompanied by practical procedures 
for assisting Member States with their implementation. The Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management would 
undoubtedly strengthen the international legal regime in question. 
191. In that connection, his delegation would welcome the development of a network of 
institutions providing safety-related training in the various official languages of the United 
Nations. In its view, the long-term action plan for education and training in radiation and 
waste safety referred to in Note by the Secretariat 2001/Note 20 would be a step in the right 
direction. From September 2002 onwards his countryÂs Centre National des Etudes des 
Sciences et Techniques NuclÃ©aires would, in co-operation with the Secretariat and France, 
host an international postgraduate radiation safety course in French. 
192. With regard to the transport of radioactive materials, his delegation continued to believe 
that transit countries should be notified about shipments in advance so that their governmental 
authorities might take steps to minimize the risks to people and the environment. 
193. In some parts of the world there were severe water shortages which could be mitigated 
only by the use of techniques such as desalination. Morocco, situated in a region threatened 
by desertification and growing water scarcity, was following with interest the work of 
INDAG, which it intended to support to the maximum extent possible. 
194. In January, a permanent commission for nuclear energy-related matters had been 
established in Morocco, under the direct authority of the Prime Minister, with responsibility 
for bringing the countryÂs legal infrastructure into line with the nuclear energy-related 
conventions to which Morocco was a party, establishing a national regulatory infrastructure in 
the field of nuclear and radiation safety, developing a communication strategy designed to 
make users and the general public more aware of the possibilities of nuclear techniques and of 
the risks involved in using such techniques, and formulating an overall strategy for the 
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. In June, the Secretariat had sent a team to Morocco to 
assist with legislative and regulatory activities and acquaint the commissionÂs members with 
international best practices. His country greatly appreciated the SecretariatÂs support. 
195. His delegation would like to see the Secretariat stepping up its activities relating to the 
rehabilitation of radioactively contaminated territories, so as to help protect the terrestrial and 
the marine environment. With the SecretariatÂs relevant experience, the Agency could make a 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 34 

valuable contribution to the work of the next world summit on sustainable development, due 
to take place in Johannesburg in 2002. 

196. From 29 October to 9 November, Morocco would be hosting the seventh conference of 
the parties to the UNFCCC. It was counting on the AgencyÂs active support. 
197. His delegation, which regretted that so far only 21 Member States had accepted the 
amendment to Article VI of the Statute approved by the General Conference in 1999, hoped 
that far more Member States would accept it in the months to come, so that it would enter into 
force without undue delay. 
198. Mr. DAINIUS (Lithuania), expressing his countryÂs condolences to the families of 
the victims of the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States of America, said that the 
ideas of freedom and democracy had been insidiously attacked by evil. His country was 
convinced that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. 
199. Having associated his country with the statement made on behalf of the European Union 
by the delegate of Belgium, he said that since the establishment of its Nuclear Power Safety 
Inspectorate, ten years previously, Lithuania had made significant progress in creating a 
nuclear safety and radiation protection regulatory infrastructure which was in accordance with 
international safety standards. In doing so, it had received valuable support from many 
countries and international organizations. The Agency had played a key role, providing 
necessary assistance to the Lithuanian institutions responsible for nuclear safety and radiation 
protection. In order to assess the progress made, an IRRT mission to Lithuania had taken 
place just before the current session of the General Conference. On the basis of the IRRT 
mission recommendations, an action plan would be drawn up for strengthening the national 
regulatory infrastructure in the years to come. 
200. Having expressed appreciation of the technical assistance received by his country 
through the Agency, he said that nuclear power reactor decommissioning was an issue of great 
importance to Lithuania, which, wishing to become a member of the European Union, had 
decided to shut down Unit 1 of the Ignalina NPP by the end of 2005, subject to the terms and 
conditions of long-term financial and technical assistance from the European Union, G-7 
countries and other States, and international financial institutions. Lithuania fully shared the 
SecretariatÂs view that the operational safety of nuclear power reactors should be maintained 
from the time when a decision to shut down was taken, through the shutdown to the 
completion of decommissioning. 
201. The decommissioning of RBMKs was a complicated exercise, and Lithuania would 
need a great deal of international support. Since a donorsÂ conference held in June 2000 in 
Vilnius, his country had received considerable assistance from the European Union, G-7 and 
other interested countries, and international institutions. The Agency had provided timely 
assistance through its technical co-operation programme in response to an urgent request from 
Lithuania, which had finished planning the preparatory stage of the decommissioning of 
Unit 1 of the Ignalina NPP. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 35 

202. Lithuania, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs work in the field of 
sustainable energy strategies, had received from the Agency considerable assistance with 
development of institutional capabilities for performing national energy strategy studies which 
took into account -among other things - the consequences of the future closure of the 
Ignalina NPP. 
203. Referring to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation Model Project on upgrading radiation 
and waste safety infrastructures, he said that, following a visit to LithuaniaÂs Radiation 
Protection Centre, an Agency peer review team had concluded that Lithuania had passed 
milestones 1 and 2 of the Model Project. In the light of that conclusion, his delegation hoped 
that Lithuania would receive Agency technical assistance designed to improve the radiation 
exposure control of patients in diagnostic radiology, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. 
204. Following an IPSART mission to the Ignalina NPP in June 2000, for the purpose of 
carrying out a peer review of a Level 1 PSA which had been performed by Lithuanian and 
Swedish specialists (the first PSA of an RBMK), a further such mission was planned for the 
beginning of October 2001. 
205. Lithuania, which recognized the AgencyÂs safeguards as playing an indispensable role in 
the implementation of the NPT, strongly supported the efforts being made to increase their 
effectiveness and improve their efficiency. The protocol additional to the safeguards 
agreement between the Agency and Lithuania had entered into force, and implementation had 
started after defects in the legal basis had been eliminated. His delegation would like to see 
many more Member States demonstrating their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation by 
signing and implementing additional protocols. 
206. His country attached great importance to Agency assistance in improving the security of 
nuclear materials and facilities in Member States and enhancing the co-operation between 
physical protection experts in various countries; that assistance was proving to be one of the 
most effective ways of strengthening the international physical protection regime. Also, his 
country remained a strong supporter of all Agency efforts to help combat illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials. 
207. The Secretariat was to be commended for helping Member States to establish 
sustainable education and training programmes. At the beginning of the Ignalina NPP 
decommissioning process, LithuaniaÂs technical universities were reorganizing their 
programmes in order to prepare the necessary specialists, and Agency assistance in that 
connection would be very important. 
208. Mr. NOBILO (Croatia), deploring the previous weekÂs terrorist attacks in the 
United States of America, said that it was necessary to strengthen the international safeguards 
regime and co-operation in the fight against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. It was not 
hard to imagine what would happen if terrorists came into possession of such materials. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 36 

209. Although Croatia was not playing a leading role in the utilization of nuclear energy, it 
was co-operating closely with the Agency in several areas, and the current projects at both the 
national and the regional level were considered to be useful and successful. 
210. Croatia had harmonized its radiation safety legislation with the relevant Agency 
standards, had been among the first countries to bring additional protocols to their 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency into force, had also been among the 
first countries to accept the latest amendment to Article VI of the Statute, and was one of the 
Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which had entered into force on 18 June. 
211. The number of persons being granted Agency fellowships for training at Croatian 
institutions and the number of Croatian experts attending Agency-organized seminars and 
training courses abroad was appreciable, and his delegation hoped that it would increase. 
212. Representatives of Croatia and Slovenia, which were joint owners of the KrÂko NPP, 
located in Slovenia, had on 23 July initialled an agreement regulating the status of - and legal 
relations in connection with - investments in and the operation and decommissioning of the 
plant; it was expected that the signing and ratification procedures would be completed before 
the end of the year, so that the agreement could enter into effect on 1 January 2002. Through 
the agreement, the two countries would be expressing their awareness of their joint 
responsibility for the safety of the KrÂko NPP. 
213. Mr. GREGORIC (Slovenia) expressed his deepest condolences to the American 
people, who had suffered great losses as a result of the previous weekÂs barbaric terrorist acts. 
214. Having associated his country with the statement made by the delegate of Belgium on 
behalf of the European Union, he said that the Agency could carry out its verification 
activities only where the necessary safeguards agreements were in place. Despite the efforts 
of the Secretariat, however, more than 50 States parties to the NPT had not yet brought into 
force the comprehensive safeguards agreements which the NPT called for. For its part, 
Slovenia had brought into force not only an NPT safeguards agreement but also a protocol 
additional to it, so that the Agency would now be able to provide assurance not only that there 
had been no diversion of declared nuclear material but also that there had been no indication 
of the presence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Slovenia. 
215. As a party to the CPPNM, his country shared the view, expressed in the final report 
from the informal open-ended expert meeting to discuss whether there is a need to revise the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, that the international physical 
protection regime should be strengthened. His delegation, which welcomed the fact that the 
Board had endorsed the ÂPhysical Protection Objectives and Fundamental PrinciplesÂ in the 
Attachment to document GC(45)/INF/14 as a ÂSecurity FundamentalsÂ document, had noted 
the Director GeneralÂs decision to convene an open-ended group of legal and technical experts 
to draft an amendment to the CPPNM. In the light of the Conference Summary Document of 
the International Conference on the Security of Material held in Stockholm in May, the 
outcome of the drafting exercise would be of great interest to Slovenia. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 37 

216. In the area of nuclear safety, besides internationally agreed safety standards the main 
prerequisite for a successful international safety regime was legally binding international 
instruments and the mechanisms for implementing them. The Early Notification Convention, 
the Assistance Convention and the Convention on Nuclear Safety had already proved their 
worth, and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management would no doubt start doing so soon. 
217. Slovenia aimed to submit a report on the fulfilment of its obligations under the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety by mid-October, and it was looking forward to the second 
Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties. It would like to see those States with nuclear 
installations which had not yet done so becoming Contracting Parties soon. 
218. To be effective, the internationally agreed safety standards to which he had just referred 
had to be applied in practice. Slovenia greatly appreciated the services provided by the 
Secretariat in that connection and would continue its efforts to maintain a high level of nuclear 
safety at its nuclear installations. In the past, Slovenia had requested several Secretariatorganized 
missions for the purpose of comparing its practices with current international 
consensus standards and guidelines and with good practices of other countries. An ORPAS 
mission to Slovenia had taken place in July, and a third OSART mission was expected to take 
place in 2003. 
219. The recent radiological emergency in Panama had highlighted the urgent need for 
further action to minimize the harmful effects of ionizing radiation used in medicine. The 
findings, conclusions and recommendations of the International Conference on the 
Radiological Protection of Patients held in MÃ¡laga, Spain, in March would undoubtedly be of 
great importance in that connection. 
220. Another conference to which his delegation attached great importance was the 
International Conference on Topical Issues in Nuclear Safety which had taken place just two 
weeks previously. In his delegationÂs view, such well-attended and well-structured meetings 
contributed to the excellent image of the Agency and could help to bring about the acceptance 
of nuclear power worldwide. 
221. Slovenia, which had pledged its full TCF target share for 2001, would like to see 
Member States providing more in-kind assistance in support of the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation activities. For its part, Slovenia had the previous year hosted several Agency 
training courses, seminars and workshops, mainly in the areas of nuclear power, nuclear safety 
and radiation safety. In addition, Slovenian institutes were providing on-the-job training and 
making experts available for technical co-operation projects. 
222. Slovenia, which needed technical assistance in the area of radiation safety, would be 
submitting proposals for technical co-operation projects during 2003-2004 which were guided 
by the principles underlying the AgencyÂs Technical Co-operation Strategy. 
223. Monsignor BOCCARDI (Holy See) said that the consequences of the recent tragic 
events in the United States of America weighed heavily upon the General Conference. The 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 38 

horrible crimes of 11 September had been condemned by the entire civilized world, which had 
demonstrated deep-felt solidarity with all the innocent victims. 

224. The AgencyÂs efforts to promote the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy were being 
exerted within the larger context of international co-operation, so that the General 
ConferenceÂs decisions could contribute to wider processes affecting the international 
community, which was becoming more and more aware of the fact that only the agreed joint 
actions of peoples and nations could ensure that the objective of peaceful coexistence was 
attained. 
225. Such actions, however, presupposed ideas, programmes and political choices responding 
to real needs and possibilities. Moreover, the readiness to set aside the resources necessary for 
ensuring that knowledge and technology were made more widely available remained a top 
priority. The gap due to different levels of development ran counter to the fundamental 
principle of the equality of political communities, and it must be bridged. 
226. His delegation, which had read with pleasure the Annual Report for 2000 and the 
Technical Co-operation Report for 2000, had noted a significant shift in the priorities of 
Member States -a shift towards greater emphasis on assistance in solving national 
development problems. Member States were more aware of the potential of applying nuclear 
techniques in areas such as human health and food and agriculture. However, that shift in 
priorities did not diminish the importance of Agency activities relating to the physical and 
chemical sciences, the use of nuclear power, water resource management and other areas 
where the Agency had an excellent reputation. 
227. In resolution GC(44)/RES/18, the General Conference had emphasized that Agency 
programmes should contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals in 
developing countries, particularly least developed ones. His delegation was therefore pleased 
that the Agency had strengthened its co-operation with many least developed countries with 
the aim of eliminating the causes of poverty and underdevelopment. The Agency should 
continue along those lines, in order to help alleviate the growing social inequalities in the 
world and reduce the widening gap between rich and poor nations. The human family was 
becoming more and more interdependent, and globalization - for all its risks -was making it 
easier, given a spirit of solidarity, to assist the least developed countries in designing and 
implementing programmes which would enable them to take their futures into their own 
hands. Pope John Paul II had stated in his message on the occasion of the World Day of 
Peace, ÂThe present reality of global interdependence makes it easier to appreciate the 
common destiny of the entire human family, and makes all thoughtful people increasingly 
appreciate the virtue of solidarity.Â The new century would present all with many 
opportunities of co-operating fully in a spirit of solidarity. 
228. A vision of international co-operation which placed man and his personal dignity at its 
centre was relevant to the Agency, enabling its programmes to be evaluated in the wider 
context of the international debate on development - a debate which would continue in 2002, 
no doubt with an essential contribution from the Agency at the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development.

page 39 

229. At the International Conference on the Radiological Protection of Patients held in 
MÃ¡laga, Spain, in March, a representative of the Holy See had chaired a round table 
discussion on the radiation protection of those who cared for and comforted patients. The 
exposure of patientsÂ relatives tended to be of comparatively short duration, but many who 
cared for and comforted patients were members of religious and other charitable organizations 
who devoted their entire lives to that admirable task, and everything possible should be done 
to protect them. 
230. His delegation hoped that the Agency would continue to participate in efforts to place 
nuclear energy at the service of sustainable development and of the well-being of the entire 
human family. 
231. Mr. GHABRIAL (Organisation of African Unity) extended condolences to the 
families of the victims of the 11 September terrorist attacks in New York and 
Washington D.C. and expressed solidarity with the people and Government of the United 
States of America in the face of the immense tragedy. 
232. Welcoming the reappointment of Mr. ElBaradei - a son of the African continent - as 
Director General, he expressed confidence that Mr. ElBaradei would exert all his energies in 
working towards the achievement of the AgencyÂs goals. 
233. The Organisation of African Unity had great expectations of the Agency with regard to 
the peaceful uses of nuclear technology in support of sustainable socio-economic 
development. The AgencyÂs African Member States hoped that the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation activities in Africa would be further intensified in areas such as the eradication of 
the tsetse fly by means of the SIT. 
234. Thanking the Department of Technical Co-operation for helping the General Secretariat 
of the Organisation of African Unity to implement decisions of the African Heads of State and 
Government regarding the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, he said that the General 
Secretariat looked forward to further close collaboration with the Agency. 
235. Mr. DE SAMPAIO NUNES (European Commission), extending heartfelt 
condolences to the United States delegation and the American people, said that the 11 
September attacks had horrified the European Union. 
236. The European Union was heavily dependent on external energy supply sources. About 
50% of its energy needs had to be met through imports, and by 2030 the figure might well be 
about 70%. That raised a number of questions. Could the European Union accept becoming 
dependent to the extent of 70% on external energy supplies? How could the European Union 
continue to accept the disruption of its economies and the economies of non-oil-producing 
developing countries by erratic oil and gas price changes? How could the European Union do 
without nuclear power? The European Commission, which had published a Green Paper 
entitled ÂTowards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy SupplyÂ, believed that 
interdependence between Member States of the European Union had become such that any 
energy policy decision in one Member State was likely to affect the energy market in others, 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 40 

so that uncoordinated national energy policy decisions could no longer be expected to provide 
satisfactory answers to such questions. 

237. With a view to reducing the risks of over-dependence on external energy supply sources 
in the context of sustainable development, the European Commission proposed the 
development of an energy demand as well as an energy supply policy. The Commission 
considered that current total energy consumption could be reduced by 18% through increased 
efficiency, especially in the areas of housing and transport. An ambitious proposal on the 
supply side was the that development of indigenous energy resources be stimulated further. 
The Commission had committed itself to increasing the percentage of total energy 
consumption in the European Union met by renewables from 6% to 12% by 2010. Another 
priority would be the development of a Âclean coalÂ technology. Nuclear power would also 
have to be considered, both from the security of supply perspective and from the greenhouse 
gas emissions perspective. The role of nuclear power in limiting the growth trend in 
greenhouse gas emissions was often underestimated, in spite of the fact that by 2010, in the 
European Union alone, the use of nuclear power would each year be preventing the emission 
of some 300 million tons of carbon dioxide while meeting 35% of the electricity needs of 
some 390 million people. 
238. If the nuclear option was to be kept alive, there would have to be complete transparency 
vis-Ã¡-vis the public. There was no place for secrecy. Moreover, further research efforts in the 
areas of nuclear waste management and nuclear safety would be necessary. 
239. It was essential to ensure that electricity from nuclear power plants was produced in 
accordance with the highest internationally recognized safety levels, and nuclear safety had 
therefore become one of the crucial issues in the European Union enlargement process - high 
levels of nuclear safety were required also in the candidate countries. A methodology for the 
evaluation of nuclear safety levels in those countries had been developed thanks to the fact 
that in the European Union, within the framework of national responsibility for nuclear safety 
regulation, a high degree of convergence of technical and organizational requirements and 
good practices had been achieved through voluntary co-operation between Member States and 
in international fora such as the Agency. 
240. Agency documents had been very important for the evaluation process, which had now 
been completed. The European Council had prepared a report in which country-specific 
recommendations were contained. Accession negotiations would be held with the candidate 
countries on the basis of those recommendations, account being taken of the fact that safety 
improvement programmes were being continuously implemented in the candidate countries for 
example, within the PHARE framework. 
241. During the period 1991-2000, the European Union had committed Â774 million under 
the TACIS programme to international efforts to improve nuclear safety in the Newly 
Independent States through 650 projects - 450 under way and 200 still being prepared. 
242. Nuclear material safeguards in the European Union were being applied by the Agency in 
close co-operation with the Euratom Safeguards Office of the European Commission. They 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 41 

were being applied in a very satisfactory manner through the New Partnership Approach, 
which enabled the Agency to save resources. 

243. The European Commission believed that the development of integrated safeguards 
would result in more effective safeguards within the present resource constraints, with a move 
away from a safeguards system based on prescriptive criteria to an information-based system 
focusing on areas of real proliferation concern. It also believed that the Agency could further 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards in the European Union by making 
greater use of the Euratom Regional Safeguards System. The Euratom Safeguards Office had 
recently made a proposal to that end to the Agency. 
244. The process of ratifying the three additional protocols to which Euratom was a party was 
continuing in the European UnionÂs Member States. At the same time, the Euratom 
Safeguards Office was, together with the Agency and the European UnionÂs Member States, 
preparing for their implementation so that they could become effective immediately after their 
entry into force. 
245. The radiation protection efforts of the European Commission were currently 
concentrated on the full application of the Basic Safety Standards Directive of 1996 and the 
Medical Directive of 1997. After the adoption of those two directives, the issue of 
strengthening the management of sealed radioactive sources had come to the foreground, as a 
consequence of several radiation accidents and other radiation events reported worldwide. 
The Commission was therefore pleased to be co-operating with the Agency in the 
implementation of the Action Plan for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of 
Radioactive Materials. 
246. The 1998-2002 Euratom programme of research covered nuclear fusion, nuclear fission 
and radiation protection. The Euratom budget for the programme was Â1260 million. The 
programme involved about 200 projects in areas such as: the safety of existing installations; 
fuel cycle safety; future systems; radiation protection; and radiological sciences. The 
CommissionÂs proposal for the 2002-2006 research programme was currently being discussed 
with the Member States. The main priorities were nuclear fusion and waste treatment and 
disposal. 
247. The European Community had bilateral co-operation agreements with several States. 
The agreements were general in scope or covered very specific areas. Further, nuclear trade 
agreements were envisaged with Japan, China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and 
consultations on such an agreement were under way with the Russian authorities. Nuclear 
fusion and nuclear safety agreements between Euratom and Russia might well be signed very 
soon. 
248. The Community had acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and was in the 
process of acceding to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management 
and on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management. Also, it was preparing to accede to the Early 
Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention. 

GC(45)/OR.4 
page 42 

249. Euratom was in the process of renewing, up to 2005, its participation in the KEDO 
project, to which its total financial contribution might increase to Â175 million. 
250. Effective and efficient international regimes for nuclear safety, safeguards, physical 
protection, technical co-operation and non-proliferation would remain essential for the safe 
and peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. Consequently, the importance of the Agency was 
beyond doubt. The role which nuclear power might play in contributing to the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions and keeping energy prices stable might require a more active role 
on the part of the Agency -and also of the European Commission after the broad energy 
debate in the European Union. 
251. The European Commission commended the Agency on the way it had acquitted its tasks 
and looked forward to continued fruitful co-operation. The Director GeneralÂs forthcoming 
visit to the Commission in Brussels would undoubtedly help to further enhance the excellent 
relations between the two organizations. 
The meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 
(GC(45)/4) 

1. Mr. URRUELA PRADO (Guatemala), deploring the terrorist attacks on the 
United States just a few days previously, expressed his condolences and sympathy with the 
victimsÂ families and the American Government. While Guatemala was used to the fear 
brought about by acts of terrorism, those had been on an inconceivable scale. 
2. Guatemala was interested in using nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes to 
promote its national development objectives to benefit the greatest possible number of 
Guatemalans and improve their quality of life. Under the general management of the Ministry 
of Energy and Mining, the technical co-operation received from the Agency had been 
integrated into the national development plan. The projects had helped to strengthen 
institutions, train human resources, introduce new technologies, solve health, agricultural and 
industrial problems, promote geothermal and oil exploration, and deal with environmental 
issues. 
3. As the Guatemalan President had confirmed in his annual address to Congress, regional 
Model Projects to upgrade radiation protection infrastructure, to develop technical capabilities 
for a sustainable radiation and waste safety infrastructure, and to improve national regulatory 
control and occupational radiological protection programmes had strengthened the countryÂs 
regulatory authorities and relevant legal framework. The national workshop on response to 
radiological emergencies, attended by participants from all sectors, had led to the elaboration 
of a national radiological emergency plan for incorporation by the National Co-ordinating 
Committee for Disaster Reduction (CONRED). The country had received equipment for its 
secondary standard dosimetry laboratory, which served the Central America region, and also 
support in nuclear waste management and the training of safety and radiation protection 
personnel. The AgencyÂs mission to evaluate GuatemalaÂs legislative and regulatory 
infrastructure and its radiation protection programme had been extremely useful and his 
delegation encouraged the Agency to continue such activities. 
4. Under the regional project for geothermal development and environmental management, 
the National Institute of Electricity (INOE) had received support and training in geochemistry 
and reservoir engineering, as well as expert assistance in estimating the production potential reckoned 
to be 430 MW(e) -of all GuatemalaÂs known geothermal areas: Moyuta, 
San Marcos, TotonicapÃ¡n, Tecuamburro, Zunil and Amatitlan. 
5. Guatemala was grateful for the continuing assistance it received under ARCAL in such 
areas as human and animal health, industry and agriculture. All projects had a significant 
social impact and were consistent with sustainable development aims. 
6. Approved national projects for 2001-2 included analysis of ecotoxic metals using X-ray 
fluorescence, strengthening of the national programme for neonatal hypothyroidism screening 
and quality assurance in the National Cancer Institute. They were being implemented using 
the new ÂoutsourcingÂ modality, which had contributed to efficient implementation and 
strengthened bilateral co-operation with Mexico. There had been successful multilateral 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 6 

co-operation with the United States of America, Mexico, the Agency and FAO under the 
medfly programme. His delegation hoped that that programme would be extended in due 
course to cover the entire territory of Guatemala. 

7. Recognizing the contribution made by the Agency to the development of nuclear 
applications in Guatemala, his Government hoped that resources would continue to be 
distributed in a balanced fashion in order to meet the maximum number of requests for 
assistance. 
8. Finally, with regard to the severe drought which had caused agricultural losses, famine 
and disease in Central America, he said that the situation could have been avoided if the 
region had had adequate irrigation systems and better knowledge and management of 
groundwater resources based on the use of isotope hydrology. He was therefore grateful for 
delegationsÂ support of the relevant resolution.1 
9. Mr. MOONESINGHE (Sri Lanka) expressed his GovernmentÂs condolences to the 
delegation of the United States of America for the recent terrorist attacks in New York and 
Washington. Efforts to combat terrorism in Sri Lanka over the past 18 years had cost 
countless lives and led to tremendous economic losses. 
10. Having read out the message sent by his President to President Bush of the United States 
affirming, inter alia, Sri LankaÂs full commitment to all international initiatives to combat 
terrorism, he welcomed the adoption by the United Nations of the International Convention 
for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. As Vice Chair of the United Nations 
Ad Hoc Committee on the Elimination of Terrorism, Sri Lanka had been at the forefront of 
the global effort against terrorism. 
11. Sri Lanka had demonstrated its recognition of the importance of the CTBT by being 
among the first countries to sign it on 24 October 1996. It was now in the process of ratifying 
the Treaty and hoped for an early entry into force. Sri Lanka had entered into an agreement 
with the CTBTO aimed at setting up a monitoring station under the international monitoring 
system. 
12. Nuclear facilities in the Middle East which were not subject to safeguards posed a 
security threat. The international community had addressed that issue with General Assembly 
resolution A/RES/53/74 to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
13. He welcomed the AgencyÂs initiative to place more emphasis on servicing immediate 
human needs as that would be beneficial to the developing Member States in terms of health 
and living standards. 
14. With regard to gender equality and the status of women in the Secretariat, more 
attention should be given to the recruitment of women from developing countries, especially 
See resolution GC(45)/RES/12.E. 


GC(45)/OR.5 
page 7 

those which were under-represented or not represented at all. Gender differences did not play 
a prominent part in Sri Lanka where a number of high-level posts were occupied by women. 

15. Although Sri Lanka had no nuclear plants in operation and no plans to use nuclear 
power, co-operation with the Agency had enabled it to use nuclear technology for a wide 
range of other purposes, mainly in the medical, agricultural and industrial sectors. 
16. The Atomic Energy Authority of Sri Lanka had just completed the construction of a new 
building to house its laboratories and administrative offices. The Government of Sri Lanka 
had provided the funds, thereby acknowledging the contribution nuclear technology could 
make to national development. It had also provided other resources for the AuthorityÂs 
programmes, including an almost threefold increase in the scientific cadre during the last five 
years and more funds for recurrent and capital expenses. Furthermore, the Government had 
agreed to double its assessed programme cost payments to the Agency in order to settle its 
arrears in a shorter period. 
17. Sri Lanka welcomed the AgencyÂs initiatives to ensure greater socio-economic benefits 
and end-user orientation of the technical co-operation programme through the Model Project 
concept, Country Programme Frameworks and thematic planning. Sri Lanka, for its part, had 
made an effort to improve the project proposals it submitted to the Agency and to ensure that 
they were in line with national development priorities. 
18. His delegation appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts aimed at making national nuclear 
institutes self-reliant and sustainable. The Atomic Energy Authority, which was the focal 
point of the AgencyÂs activities in Sri Lanka, had managed to increase its income substantially 
by initiating scientific services and training programmes. Both the seminar on self-reliance 
and sustainability of national nuclear institutes, held in Malaysia the previous year, and the 
regional project on self-reliance and sustainability were helpful in that regard. 
19. His delegation appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the radiation protection and 
waste management infrastructure of Member States. Technical assistance which Sri Lanka 
had received under the relevant interregional Model Project had resulted in the regulatory 
programme being improved. New radiation protection regulations conforming to the Basic 
Safety Standards were being introduced, all radioactive sources had been registered and 
procedures had been prepared for the notification, authorization and inspection of practices 
involving radiation and radioisotopes. 
20. Regional co-operation under the RCA had proved to be very beneficial for Sri Lanka in 
a variety of fields. 
21. He commended the Secretariat for its action plan for the safety and security of 
radioactive sources. With the rapid growth in the use of radiation therapy, care was needed to 
ensure that doses were delivered as prescribed. 
22. The adverse effects of the use of fossil fuels on the environment would mean increasing 
reliance on nuclear energy in future. The challenge facing the Agency in the 21st century was 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 8 

to satisfy the energy demands of the developing countries. The developed countries were 
responsible for climate changes since most greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to 
them; they should be made aware that non-compliance with the UNFCCC and the Kyoto 
Protocol would be catastrophic. 

23. The AgencyÂs historic task was to accelerate the utilization of nuclear energy, control 
nuclear proliferation, enhance nuclear safety and, above all, improve the economic 
competitiveness of nuclear energy. If it fulfilled that task, with fusion-rather than fissionbased 
reactors, the Agency - together with all other relevant institutions - would be making a 
giant leap forward for mankind in the realm of energy. 
24. Mr. KAKODKAR (India) said that his country had been shocked by the terrorist 
attacks in New York and Washington. The Indian Prime Minister, Mr. A.B. Vajpayee, in a 
message to the President of the United States of America, had expressed his confidence that 
the American people would find the strength and resilience to overcome the tragedy. 
25. In spite of the AgencyÂs programme on small and medium-size power reactors, access to 
affordable energy in a sustainable manner remained a distant objective for the vast majority of 
the developing world. On the other hand, many industrialized countries with the 
technological capacity to produce nuclear power had more electricity than they needed. Some 
Asian countries with growing energy demands, including India, had reached a significant 
degree of industrialization and had acquired the necessary capability to utilize nuclear power 
technology to meet their energy needs. If the global community wished to bridge the energy 
gap -an essential condition for ensuring peace in the world - there was no alternative to the 
large-scale use of nuclear energy, as had been confirmed by several studies. 
26. He was gratified to note that the United Nations CSD had recognized the value of 
nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and had agreed that the choice of 
appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned. The nuclear option, 
however, had suffered a psychological setback at the recent meeting of the COP/FCCC in 
Bonn, which had decided that developed countries could not use the emission reductions 
obtained from nuclear facilities to meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. It was 
ironic that a ÂcleanÂ energy source should be discouraged by a body concerned with the 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. He praised the role that had been played by the 
Secretariat at the latest CSD and COP meetings in providing information on nuclear power 
and sustainable development, organizing side events and presenting case studies, all of which 
had had a considerable impact. 
27. In that context, he commended the SecretariatÂs preparation of the ÂNuclear Technology 
ReviewÂ contained in document GC(45)/INF/5, which cited studies by prestigious 
organizations indicating the inevitability of nuclear power as an important component in the 
energy mix in the long term. That document reported that, in 2000, 6 nuclear power reactors 
had been connected to the grid and another 31 were under construction. That, together with 
other programmed activities, clearly pointed to a revival in nuclear energy. 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 9 

28. As nuclear power would continue to play an important role in meeting the energy needs 
of the world it was imperative to eliminate, through innovation and improvement, the 
remaining concerns surrounding it. Solutions were needed not only to achieve economical 
generation of nuclear power but also to deal with the questions of safety, sustainability, 
proliferation resistance and long-term waste management. The development of the advanced 
heavy water reactor was the first step India had taken in that direction. Also, the AgencyÂs 
initiative in launching INPRO was highly laudable and deserved strong support from Member 
States. His delegation advocated improved funding for programmes of that kind, which 
addressed Agency objectives in the areas of nuclear energy, nuclear safety and safeguards at 
the same time. Whereas INPRO was currently being financed out of extrabudgetary 
resources - and India was actively participating in it by providing cost-free expertise -his 
delegation believed that inclusion under the Regular Budget would be the most cost-effective 
strategy in the long run without detriment to the balance between the AgencyÂs promotional 
and safeguards activities. 
29. Synergy between the various international organizations in the field of nuclear energy 
was desirable. It was important to recognize that increasing technological capability and 
providing access to the benefits of research through actual participation was the most effective 
approach and India would like to see greater opportunities for interested Member States in 
such participation. 
30. India now had a total nuclear power capacity of 2720 MW(e) with 14 units in operation 
and that capacity was expected to reach 10 000 MW(e) in the coming 10 years. Self-reliance 
was the guiding principle of its nuclear programme. India planned to import LWR technology 
to increase the share of nuclear power rapidly. Its first nuclear power station at Tarapur 
consisted of two BWRs, which continued to operate extremely well, and two 1000 MW(e) 
WWERs were in the process of being set up in collaboration with the Russian Federation. 
Those reactors would be placed under facility-specific Agency safeguards, as would other 
plants imported in the future. 
31. The RCA was an important mechanism for the growth and use of nuclear technologies 
for sustainable development in the region. In line with the AgencyÂs efforts to transfer more 
and more management responsibilities and ownership to Member States, India had been 
continuously increasing its participation in the RCA programmes. It had expertise in various 
RCA-related activities and well-developed facilities, which it had made available as regional 
resource units. Furthermore, it was hosting more training/workshop events, increasing the 
expert services and fellowship training it provided, and had evolved suitable mechanisms for 
successful technology transfers to end-users. 
32. The Agency had been created with the sole objective of accelerating and enlarging the 
contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. That 
objective could be met only through the advancement of technology. Technology must 
therefore become the central pillar of the AgencyÂs activities; safeguards and safety, while 
important, could only be supporting activities. 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 10 

33. States that had developed and used atomic energy should share their expertise with 
others. The theme of the Scientific Forum during the present session of the General 
Conference focused on social and economic development under the title ÂServing Human 
Needs: Nuclear Technology for Sustainable DevelopmentÂ. India knew from its own 
experience that development in the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy provided the 
impetus for accelerated national development. The motto of the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation and technology transfer should be technological empowerment to meet human 
needs. 
34. Ms. BECERRIL MARTÃNEZ (Spain) expressed her GovernmentÂs condemnation 
of the terrorist attacks on the United States of America and condolences to the victimsÂ 
families. Spain had offered to co-operate fully with the United States Government in that 
regard. 
35. There had been significant developments in the Spanish nuclear sector in recent years as 
efforts were being made to meet the increased demand for electricity owing to economic 
development. Nuclear energy had contributed to a reduction in SpainÂs external energy 
dependence and diversification of its energy sources. In 2000, electricity generation had risen 
by 7.2% to 223 994 GWh. Of that, 27.8% was of nuclear origin, representing a 5.5% increase 
compared with 1999. At 91%, the availability factors for its nuclear power plants had been 
the highest ever, and other indicators confirmed the high levels of plant reliability, safety and 
competitiveness. In accordance with the General Radioactive Waste Plan approved by the 
Government in 1999, construction of an interim spent fuel storage facility at the Trillo power 
plant was nearing completion. It would ensure adequate storage capacity until 2013 when the 
pools at the other power plants would become full. Dismantling work had continued slightly 
ahead of schedule at the VandellÃ³s I unit. It was hoped to complete the present phase by the 
end of 2002 after which there would be a planned halt of 30 years before total dismantling. 
36. Turning to safeguards, she said that despite the SecretariatÂs efforts it was disappointing 
that only three countries -only one of which had nuclear facilities - had signed an additional 
protocol since the previous General Conference. That meant 22 countries with nuclear 
facilities had still not signed despite the fact that four years had passed since the protocolÂs 
adoption. Spain, convinced that universality was an essential condition, urged that greater 
efforts be made in that regard, particularly through Secretariat contact with countries with 
nuclear facilities. While her delegation was satisfied with the SecretariatÂs progress in 
strengthening the safeguards system, including the development of integrated safeguards, it 
would welcome more information regarding the costs of implementing the new measures to 
ensure that cost neutrality was maintained. All concrete proposals put before the Board of 
Governors should therefore be accompanied by cost estimates. 
37. Regarding nuclear safety, her delegation was confident that the second review meeting 
of the Convention on Nuclear Safety would build on the positive results of the first review 
meeting and increase the ConventionÂs credibility. Spain welcomed the entry into force of the 
Joint Convention. It hoped that as many countries as possible would have ratified it by the 
first review meeting in 2003, including all the major radioactive waste producers. Meanwhile 
Spain offered its co-operation for the preparatory meeting in December 2001. 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 11 

38. One of the main conclusions of the Cordoba Conference related to the need to integrate 
social and technical aspects into the decision-making process for managing radioactive waste. 
While it was up to each country to deal with that issue as it saw fit, the Agency could assist by 
ensuring that individual countriesÂ experiences benefited the rest of the international 
community. Thus Spain supported the actions proposed in document GC(45)/14 and offered 
its co-operation in putting them into practice. 
39. Spain thought highly of the AgencyÂs safety services and had not only requested several 
missions to its plants but also provided experts for missions in other countries. Spain 
endorsed the implementation of an international plan to enhance research reactor safety. On 
the home front, it was developing a strategy for updating research reactors, which also 
included dismantling and closure. 
40. Her delegation welcomed the achievements of the Buenos Aires Conference and the 
BoardÂs approval of the AgencyÂs revised action plan for the safety and security of radiation 
sources. For its part, Spain had adopted a set of national measures to deal with that issue. It 
was also taking initiatives to share its experience and to encourage the widespread adoption of 
similar measures. 
41. The Malaga Conference had recommended ways of reducing the risks to patients 
associated with the use of radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The Agency, in 
conjunction with other relevant international organizations, should play a key role in the 
international co-operation required to follow them up. 
42. Her country offered its support for Agency initiatives aimed at improved co-operation 
with other international organizations, particularly the OECD/NEA. It hoped that a 
memorandum of co-operation would soon be signed so that the resources of both 
organizations could be used more efficiently to benefit Member States. 
43. Spain was pleased that the funding available for technical co-operation had remained at 
a high level in 2000 despite more restrictive national budgetary policies. That showed the 
importance accorded to Agency activities by the international community. However, any 
attempts to obtain more resources by raising the TCF target which bore no relation to 
development of the Regular Budget were unrealistic. Recipient countries should comply with 
their obligation to pay assessed programme costs. Also, the Secretariat should further reduce 
the cost of equipment procurement for technical co-operation expenditure and concentrate its 
efforts and financial resources on technology transfer and training. 
44. Besides contributing to the TCF, Spain was always among the first to contribute to 
extrabudgetary projects (in 2000 it had given US $600 000), by receiving fellows and 
scientific visitors, supplying experts for missions or teachers for training courses, and hosting 
training courses in Spain. 
45. Her delegation welcomed the initiative to produce the ÂNuclear Technology ReviewÂ. 
Periodical updates would give a clear view of global nuclear perspectives. One of the 
interesting topics it covered was the launching of INPRO. Spain, which had provided a cost

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 12 

free expert for that project, looked forward to its outcome and understood that efforts would 
be duly co-ordinated with those of other relevant bodies. 

46. Ms. PELLICER SILVA (Mexico) expressed her delegationÂs sorrow at the attacks 
of 11 September and hoped that peace and stability would soon be restored. 
47. Mexico appreciated the AgencyÂs considerable efforts to improve the quality and impact 
of its technical co-operation projects over the previous year through successful application of 
such basic concepts as the central criterion of strong government commitment, the 
sustainability of projects and the logical framework methodology. Her delegation was pleased 
with activities to apply nuclear techniques to water resources management and to control and 
eradicate disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Mexico had extensive experience in application of 
the sterile insect technique and was willing to join international efforts aimed at pest control. 
Convinced of the advantages of TCDC, Mexico was - in co-operation with the Agency supporting 
Guatemala in developing two technical co-operation projects and was also a firm 
supporter of and active participant in ARCAL. 
48. As a country which contributed its annual share of the TCF target in full, Mexico was 
concerned that actual contributions fell far short of the 85% target set for 2002. That was 
undermining technical co-operation activities and was leading to a serious imbalance in the 
AgencyÂs main functions. Her delegation appealed to Member States to make contributions 
according to their obligations under Article VI of the NPT and in the spirit of the AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
49. She welcomed the AgencyÂs activities to raise nuclear safety levels, particularly through 
the development of a safety culture and a code of conduct for research reactors. In Mexico, 
the research reactor at the National Institute for Nuclear Research had been operating 
satisfactorily for 25 years. In 2000 a 1 million curie irradiator had been commissioned in 
San Juan del RÃ­o and was operating under the supervision of the National Commission for 
Nuclear Safety and Safeguards. Her country was keen to continue participating in expert 
meetings on irradiated food regulation. It was concerned that any incompatibility of national 
standards with such regulations might constitute a non-tariff trade barrier. 
50. Acceptance of nuclear energy as a sustainable development option depended on safety 
issues, especially in relation to radioactive waste management and transport. It was therefore 
appropriate that they appeared on the General ConferenceÂs agenda. Mexico attached 
considerable importance to the safe management of radwaste and had just carried out a legal 
and technical analysis with a view to early adoption of the Joint Convention. It was revising 
and updating its national legislation on the maritime transport of radioactive material and 
hazardous waste and its nuclear regulatory authority was developing radioactive transport 
regulations which incorporated the most recent recommendations from the Agency and other 
international organizations. 
51. Mexico had requested an IRRT mission at the beginning of the year, which had 
concluded that there was a definite safety culture at the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant and 
the National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards. Safe nuclear power plant 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 13 

operation was a priority for her Government and it would, with Agency support, pursue 
activities to that end. 

52. Her delegation endorsed the recommendations of the expert group convened to examine 
the need to strengthen the nuclear material protection regime, particularly the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. Mexico was interested in participating in 
discussions on a possible amendment to that Convention. 
53. Having participated actively in the additional protocol negotiations and offered its 
territory for field trials, Mexico was eager to conclude an additional protocol without delay. It 
was now studying what legal and practical measures needed to be taken to ensure full 
compliance with it. 
54. Her delegation welcomed the AgencyÂs real-zero-growth budget. Annual salary 
increases should be calculated better beforehand to avoid any unforeseen budget adjustments 
as had happened recently. The scale of assessment applied hitherto for contributions towards 
the Regular Budget should be maintained. 
55. Finally, she appealed to Member States not to lose sight of the need to ratify the 
amendments to Article VI of the Statute. 
56. Mr. NOVKOVSKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) extended 
condolences to the American people and the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks on 
New York and Washington. Those appalling attacks had shown the need to intensify cooperation 
in the fight against terrorism. 
57. In Macedonia, legislation in the field of radiation protection was fast being brought up 
to internationally accepted standards. He was confident that, as soon as the political situation 
in his country allowed, the new law on ionizing radiation protection and the safeguards 
agreement with the Agency would complete the necessary parliamentary procedures. Once 
the safeguards agreement had been ratified, progress could be made regarding the additional 
protocol. 
58. He regretted that the unexpected crisis in his country had impeded ongoing and planned 
co-operation activities with the Agency. Stressing that inter-ethnic strife was not a problem in 
Macedonia, he said that recent events would not detract the country from its main goal of 
building a strong democracy and becoming integrated into the Euro-Atlantic structures. He 
believed that the crisis would soon be over and that activities would resume as normal. 
59. Macedonia was among the first Member States to prepare its Country Programme 
Framework, which had demonstrated that technical co-operation was more efficient when 
integrated into the national development plans. The ongoing national technical co-operation 
programme in Macedonia included projects on nuclear medicine, quality control and 
assurance in diagnostic radiology, dosimetry, and irrigation to improve nutrition. The projects 
for the forthcoming cycle would be defined with the assistance of an Agency pre-project 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 14 

formulation mission and particular attention would be given to building national capacity to 
combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. 

60. He emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs measures for strengthening regional 
co-operation. The successful completion of the regional project on study of the Prespa Lake 
phenomenon, implemented by Macedonia, Albania and Greece, was an example of close 
co-operation between neighbouring countries. 
61. With regard to training courses for radiation protection in industrial and medical 
radiography, further efforts would be made to upgrade radiation protection knowledge on a 
regular basis. Macedonia would be grateful for support from the Department of Technical 
Co-operation in that endeavour. 
62. Mr. AL-ATHEL (Saudi Arabia) expressed condolences for the thousands of 
victims of the recent terrorist attacks in the United States of America and said his country 
would help fight against terrorism. 
63. He commended the Agency on its work in the area of safeguards: the strengthening of 
supervisory mechanisms; more rigorous assessment of StatesÂ reports and initial declarations 
concerning their nuclear programmes and facilities; the use of information technology to 
organize and process data, and the establishment of a database of commercially available 
satellite imagery; expansion of the scope of safeguards inspections; the development of 
techniques relating to environmental samples and remote monitoring; increased co-operation 
with national and regional systems for the control of nuclear materials; the development of 
integrated safeguards; greater frequency of inspection of irradiated fuel and unannounced 
inspections; and continued promotion of safeguards agreements and the implementation of 
additional protocols. 
64. With regard to the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, his delegation 
shared the Director GeneralÂs regret that he had been unable to make progress towards 
ensuring the early application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear activities in the 
region and the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, or to convene a meeting to draw 
on the experience of other regions in confidence-building through the establishment of such 
zones. Israel was the only State in the region that possessed nuclear weapons and ignored 
General Conference resolutions and international decisions calling for the immediate 
application of safeguards by the States of the Middle East to all nuclear activities and for the 
serious consideration of action to rid the region of nuclear weapons. 
65. Obviously, the AgencyÂs ability to carry out its mandate depended on its financial 
situation and the volume of work assigned to it. His delegation appreciated the SecretariatÂs 
efforts to adjust to the requirements of a zero-real-growth budget, which should be 
maintained. To maintain its credibility, the Agency should keep the prevailing circumstances 
in mind when planning its programme of activities so that they could be implemented without 
supplementary funding. The current financial deficit should be absorbed, inter alia, through 
economies, cutbacks and measures to reduce the cost of programme activities. Measures 
approved, on an exceptional basis, to meet the shortfall in the human resources required for 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 15 

the technical co-operation programme should not serve as a precedent for the future. His 
delegation hoped that additional funding would be provided to purchase special monitoring 
equipment for the safeguards programme. 

66. In conclusion, he stressed the need to place the TCF and the technical co-operation 
programme on a more secure financial footing, namely by incorporating the Fund in the 
Regular Budget, so that the Agency could effectively discharge its role as a promoter of 
development. 
67. Mr. AMHA (Ethiopia) expressed sympathy to the American people and 
Government for the tragic loss of innocent lives in the recent terrorist attacks in the United 
States of America. 
68. Ethiopia was using its Country Programme Framework to focus its technical 
co-operation activities on areas identified as having the highest priority. Primary importance 
was attached to national capacity building for the application of the sterile insect technology 
to eradicate tsetse flies from the infested lowlands of Ethiopia. That vector had significantly 
influenced the settlement pattern of Ethiopian farmers and the distribution of livestock. About 
75% of the rural population, together with an estimated 30 million livestock, lived in 
EthiopiaÂs mid-altitude and highland areas, which represented only about 47% of the total 
land area. In the lowlands, productivity was extremely poor and production costs were high 
because of the large amounts of money spent annually on chemicals to combat the tsetse fly. 
Thorough eradication of the vector required an integrated area-wide approach and so the 
African countries had decided, at the 36th OAU Summit in LomÃ© in July 2000, to join 
together to tackle the problem. The vision was an African population freed from 
trypanosomosis under the Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign 
(PATTEC). 
69. In the field of isotope hydrology, Ethiopia was making efforts to transfer the technology 
for day-to-day use in the water sector. The technique had so far been used to solve problems 
related to groundwater resource assessment, lake level rise, dam leakage and geothermal 
studies. As indicated by the Director General in his introductory statement, isotopic 
techniques had contributed to the study of the Akaki groundwater field supplying water to the 
capital, Addis Ababa. Also, Ethiopia was initiating an integrated groundwater study under a 
multi-year project in co-operation with the Agency and the US Geological Survey. 
70. Ethiopia was building a sound national infrastructure for radiation protection, the safety 
of radiation sources and waste management. A well-functioning regulatory programme with 
adequate technical support services was in place and was being progressively upgraded to 
increase its effectiveness. In addition, Ethiopia had developed a national waste management 
strategy. In co-operation with the Agency, spent sealed sources had been collected, 
conditioned and safely stored in the interim storage facility which had been built for that 
purpose. In hosting the ÂFirst Africa Workshop on the Establishment of a Legal Framework 
governing Radiation Protection, the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Safe Management of 
Radioactive WasteÂ in April 2001, Ethiopia had demonstrated its commitment to the 
international safety regime. 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 16 

71. His country, which also benefited from technical co-operation in radiotherapy, nuclear 
medicine, mutation breeding and nuclear instrumentation, commended the Secretariat on its 
continuing efforts to make projects more relevant to the needs of Member States. Ethiopia 
was an active member of the AFRA, which enabled African countries to share their 
experience in a wide range of areas. 
72. Mr. de QUEIROZ DUARTE (Brazil) said that his country was profoundly 
shocked by the insane acts of terrorism perpetrated in the United States of America on 
11 September. President Cardoso of Brazil had condemned all forms of terrorism and pledged 
his countryÂs support for international co-operative efforts to eradicate such barbaric practices. 
73. By promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy and at the same time preventing the 
diversion of nuclear materials to the production of nuclear weapons, the Agency was making a 
significant contribution to the attainment of the objective of complete disarmament enshrined 
in Article VI of the NPT. 
74. At the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the five nuclear-weapon States had for the first 
time entered into an ÂunequivocalÂ undertaking to totally eliminate their nuclear arsenals. 
Brazil attached great importance to the results of the Conference and remained committed to 
all the objectives set out in the final document, particularly the practical steps to achieve 
nuclear disarmament. It would like to see the countries concerned take the steps necessary for 
the early entry into force of the CTBT. 
75. The failure in 2001 of major multilateral processes relating to disarmament and to the 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction could only add to concerns about the 
evolution of the multilateral system as a whole. Firmly believing that global co-operation was 
essential for a stable and secure international system, Brazil would like to see all nations 
intensifying their efforts to reverse the present negative trends. 
76. Nuclear safety in all its aspects was fundamental to public acceptance of the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy. Brazil therefore appreciated the SecretariatÂs efforts to establish a 
global safety regime and to assist Member States in the application of state-of-the-art safety 
standards. 
77. Because of its long coastline, Brazil remained concerned about the increasing frequency 
of maritime shipments of nuclear waste and other radioactive materials. Brazil and several 
other countries in the Latin American and Caribbean region were continuing to advocate the 
strengthening of the relevant international regime. 
78. Brazil attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. As 
both a donor and a recipient of Agency technical assistance, Brazil hoped that due priority 
would continue to be given to nuclear power generation, to the management and disposal of 
radioactive waste and to applications of radiation and isotope techniques, particularly in 
environmental studies, water resources management and medicine. Also, it believed that the 
interests of Member States should continue to be taken into account in the elaboration of 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 17 

Agency technical co-operation programmes and when approving technical co-operation 
project proposals. 

79. He acknowledged ARCALÂs valuable contribution to the development of the 
participating countries and commended the Secretariat for its managerial role in that regard. 
80. Agency safeguards were a major element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, whose 
universality Brazil strongly advocated. In addition to providing verification, the safeguards 
system was helping to enhance international security and contributing to the achievement of 
nuclear disarmament. 
81. Brazil welcomed the progress made in the process of integrating traditional and new 
safeguards measures and in streamlining safeguards implementation. In that regard, the close 
co-operation between ABACC and the Agency would continue to contribute to efficiency by, 
inter alia, avoiding unnecessary duplication. 
82. Regarding the programme for 2002-2003, Brazil, which recognized the SecretariatÂs 
efforts to accommodate the views of Member States, would like to see further efforts to 
increase cost-effectiveness in all Major Programmes. To maintain the balance between 
verification and promotional activities, care should be taken to avoid channelling most 
resources into verification and there must be no relative reduction in the importance attributed 
to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to technical co-operation. 
83. Regarding the budget for 2002, Brazil was - given the stringent fiscal adjustment 
measures currently being taken by its Government - not in a position to support any increases 
in the AgencyÂs expenses. 
84. In Brazil, commissioning of the Angra II nuclear power plant the previous year had 
meant the addition of 1300 MW(e) to BrazilÂs national power grid. Together, the Angra I and 
Angra II plants had an installed capacity of 2000 MW(e) and accounted for 50% of the power 
generation in Rio de Janeiro. A plant for the reconversion of uranium hexafluoride and for the 
fabrication of uranium dioxide pellets capable of meeting the needs of the Angra I and 
Angra II plants had recently gone into commercial operation. Also, work had started on the 
construction of a commercial plant for uranium enrichment by the centrifuge process. Brazil 
was continuing to invest in the production of radiopharmaceuticals and to develop new 
applications of nuclear techniques in industry, agriculture and environmental studies. As a 
reflection of the great importance attached by Brazil to the preservation of knowledge in the 
nuclear sciences, a postgraduate programme had recently been established at the Institute of 
Radiation Protection and Dosimetry. There were now about 400 students working for higher 
degrees in nuclear energy under that and five other programmes. 
85. Mr. FIGUEROA (Argentina) joined others in commiserating with the United 
States of America. 
86. Argentina valued Agency activities in the fields of nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear 
safety and co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy but considered that future 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 18 

programmes and budgets should maintain the principle of zero real growth. He called for 
increased efficiency on the part of the Secretariat in the use of resources. 

87. With regard to the strengthening of safeguards, real integration had to be achieved and 
not simply a combination of current measures with the measures included in the additional 
protocol. Argentina encouraged the Agency to increase its co-operation with national and 
regional safeguards systems, particularly in terms of traditional safeguards measures, so as to 
achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. While Argentina intended to sign an additional 
protocol, further consultations with the Secretariat were necessary regarding, inter alia, the 
future role of ABACC. 
88. ABACC symbolized the process of nuclear rapprochement between Argentina and 
Brazil and was a fundamental part of their more extensive commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. 
ABACCÂs experience in safeguards application had won it international 
recognition and had ensured the necessary transparency that the nuclear programmes of both 
countries were exclusively for peaceful purposes. Co-operation between ABACC and the 
Agency should be strengthened so as to prevent any duplication of effort. It was important to 
establish arrangements similar to those existing for other regional safeguards. 
89. On 14 August 2001, ArgentinaÂs Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and 
Worship, and BrazilÂs Minister of Foreign Affairs had signed a joint declaration on the setting 
up of a Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Nuclear Energy Applications (ABAEN). Its aim was 
both to strengthen co-operation between Argentina and Brazil in the field of nuclear energy 
application by identifying possible joint projects, and to establish mechanisms to facilitate 
their implementation. 
90. Nuclear achievements in Argentina over the past year included the successful 
conclusion of the changeover at the Atucha I unit from a natural uranium to a low-enriched 
uranium fuel cycle. Nuclear energy continued to make a significant contribution to the 
electricity generated in the country. ArgentinaÂs two nuclear power plants, both of which used 
domestically produced fuel elements and heavy water, accounted for about 10.5% of total 
electricity generation. 
91. Within the framework of international non-proliferation agreements, including export 
controls, Argentina remained ready to develop and strengthen ties with other countries. An 
example of that was the signing, in March 2001, of an agreement with Australia on 
co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
92. Argentina was following closely the issue of the safe maritime transport of radioactive 
material. It was important that dialogue be maintained between the countries involved with 
respect to the revision of the relevant regulations and their application. 
93. The safety of radiation sources and radioactive material had to addressed and, in that 
context, he emphasized the importance of the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Buenos Aires Conference. Also, Argentina supported the SecretariatÂs actions relating to the 
safety of research reactors. 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 19 

94. Mr. RAMAKER (Netherlands) said that his country had been shocked by the 
terrorist attacks carried out the previous week in the United States of America. Those attacks 
had shown once more that endeavours within the framework of the Agency were not taking 
place in a void. The Agency continued to be a cornerstone of efforts in the field of nuclear 
arms control and non-proliferation directed towards the achievement of a world where peace, 
freedom, democracy and justice reigned and such cowardly acts were a thing of the past. 
95. The Netherlands, which was in the process of ratifying the protocol additional to the 
safeguards agreement between the non-nuclear-weapon States of EURATOM, EURATOM 
and the Agency, considered additional protocols to be very important for strengthening the 
global system of nuclear non-proliferation. Strengthened and integrated safeguards were 
essential for an effective and credible contribution by the Agency to a safer world. His 
country was therefore disappointed that the number of States which had concluded additional 
protocols fell far short of expectations. While welcoming the action plan for increasing the 
number of additional protocols concluded, it believed that the most important ingredient for 
success was political will, which was lacking in many cases. The Netherlands would like to 
see the Secretariat and many more Member States focusing on that point. 
96. The Netherlands welcomed the idea of strengthening the physical protection regime by, 
among other things, extending the scope of the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material to cover nuclear material in national storage and transport, as recommended 
by the open-ended expert group looking into the matter. It was regrettable that, as a result of 
the opposition of a number of Member States, the effect of any amendment to the Convention 
would clearly be very limited. Nevertheless, the Netherlands would continue to strive for an 
amendment. 
97. Verification of nuclear material from dismantled nuclear weapons was an area where the 
Netherlands hoped to see the Agency expand its activities. For that reason, the Netherlands 
was following with keen interest the implementation of the agreement between the Russian 
Federation and the United States of America on the conversion to peaceful uses of weaponsgrade 
plutonium from military stocks. 
98. SAGTAC was reviewing the rules, regulations and procedures governing the provision 
of technical assistance to Member States, the aim being to increase efficiency and 
effectiveness and to reduce the workload for both the Secretariat and Member States. A major 
area being considered was the programming and budget approval cycle. SAGTAC considered 
that the present system could be enhanced and had made a number of recommendations; its 
views were endorsed by the Netherlands. 
99. Competition, energy conservation and renewable energy had been central themes of his 
GovernmentÂs energy policy for a number of years. In implementing that policy, it was trying 
to balance economic and environmental interests. Furthermore, the Netherlands had 
committed itself to ambitious targets regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; the 
pace of improvement in energy efficiency would have to increase from 1.5 to 2% a year, and 
the share of renewables in the energy mix was to grow to 5% by 2010 and 10% by 2020. 
Although the countryÂs only remaining nuclear power plant was to be closed down at the end 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 20 

of 2003, the Netherlands attached great importance to INPRO, to which it had made an 
extrabudgetary financial contribution. It continued to believe that maintaining and enhancing 
the existing levels of expertise was the best way of ensuring the future safety and efficiency of 
nuclear power generation. 

100. The Netherlands had a successful nuclear industry, especially in the field of uranium 
enrichment. Also, the high-flux reactor at Petten, which had been in operation for 40 years, 
with an exceptionally high utilization factor, was the main European nuclear facility 
producing radioisotopes for use in medicine. 
101. The Netherlands greatly appreciated all the AgencyÂs activities but viewed its financial 
situation with increasing apprehension. Was it worthwhile contributing in full to the Regular 
Budget and the TCF when nearly half of the States benefiting from the AgencyÂs activities did 
not? The balance between safeguards and technical co-operation and the principle of zero 
Regular Budget growth, neither of which was sacrosanct in his countryÂs view, were 
continuing to impede the adequate financing of the AgencyÂs verification activities. The fact 
that a large part of the verification programme was financed outside the Regular Budget was 
undesirable. It was not ideological straitjackets, but flexibility between budgets, results-based 
budgeting and a better insight into the costs of technical co-operation project management 
together with support from the Regular Budget that should ensure that the important activities 
of the Agency in all fields continued to be financed. 
102. Mr. ALLOTEY (Ghana) expressed his condolences to the people of the United 
States of America and other countries for the heavy loss of life and property on 11 September 
in New York and Washington. 
103. More than a decade after the end of the Cold War, the world community might have 
expected to be closer to adopting measures to eliminate nuclear weapons. Regrettably, they 
and other weapons of mass destruction posed as real a threat as they had done in 1945. There 
was an urgent need to harness all the opportunities provided by nuclear technology to promote 
the prosperity and survival of the human race, improving in particular the lives of those in the 
developing world, and to prevent the eruption of war. He therefore appealed to all States to 
sign and ratify the NPT, CTBT, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons 
Convention and other relevant instruments to secure a world without destructive weapons. It 
was only lack of political will that stood in the way of the exclusively peaceful use of nuclear 
power. 
104. Over the years the Agency had supported Member States through technical assistance 
and the transfer of technology. Education and adequate information on the many peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy were urgently needed, and it was up to nuclear and non-nuclear States 
alike to pool their resources and co-operate under the auspices of the Agency. Ghana was 
committed to the pursuit of the peaceful application of nuclear energy and realized that it 
could not reach that objective on its own. It appreciated the mutually beneficial relationship 
between the Agency and the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission in important projects in the 
fields of health, agriculture, industry, environment and energy. The various facilities operated 
by the Commission included: the National Nuclear Research Institute, which conducted 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 21 

elemental analysis of industrial, biomedical, geological and biological samples; a gamma 
irradiation facility with the potential to reduce post-harvest losses drastically; the National 
Radiotherapy Centre, which treated nearly 500 new cancer cases - a number that was expected 
to increase with the opening of a second Centre in Kumasi; and the Nuclear Medical Unit, 
which cared for about 1000 thyroid and prostate patients. Other activities being pursued by 
the Commission despite financial constraints and a lack of qualified personnel included 
studying the storage of spices and dried seasoning, the irradiation of smoked fish to extend 
shelf-life, the classification of starch from different cassava cultivars, and the improvement of 
GhanaÂs artificial insemination programme using progesterone radioimmunoassay. 

105. Finally, he confirmed GhanaÂs support for the work of the Agency and called on 
Member States to renew their resolve to promote peace, security, prosperity and progress. 
106. Mr. VARGAS CARREÃO (Secretary General of the Agency for the Prohibition 
of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean) expressed his condolences and 
solidarity with the Government and people of the United States of America following the 
tragic events of 11 September. 
107. OPANAL had taken its origin in the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty establishing the worldÂs 
first inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone. Most of the Latin American and Caribbean 
countries were Contracting Parties to the Treaty. Only Cuba, which had signed the Treaty 
in 1995, had not yet ratified it, but OPANAL hoped that it would do so soon. 
108. The Tlatelolco Treaty had two additional protocols which had been in force since 1992. 
The first was to apply the statute of denuclearization in territories controlled, de jure or 
de facto, by foreign powers, namely France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the 
United States of America. The aim of the second was for the nuclear powers -China, France, 
the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America - to guarantee 
the statute of denuclearization of Latin America and the Caribbean. The Treaty prevented any 
arms race in the region and thereby contributed to global non-proliferation and set an example 
to other parts of the world. The Treaty and OPANAL proscribed the use of nuclear weapons 
in Latin America and the Caribbean and controlled dual-use technologies that could be used 
for non-peaceful purposes. Thus, OPANAL had an important role to play as an international 
promoter of universal nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament, as well as peace and security. 
109. The aims of the Tlatelolco Treaty remained valid and further strengthening of OPANAL 
was desirable. It could be achieved, inter alia, through closer links with other international 
organizations, particularly the Agency. In view of the similar objectives of both 
organizations, he believed that OPANAL should be involved in co-ordination of the AgencyÂs 
technical assistance programmes in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
110. In the light of the amendments made to the Tlatelolco Treaty ten years previously for the 
full entry of Argentina, Brazil and Chile, a new agreement between OPANAL and the Agency 
to facilitate the effective operation of the control system established by the Treaty had yet to 
be negotiated. That step should be taken soon. Under the Treaty, the Agency was permitted 

GC(45)/OR.5 
page 22 

to carry out inspections to verify possible transgressions of its control system. That showed 
the trust placed by the Latin American and Caribbean countries in the Agency. 

111. Under Article 13 of the Treaty, the Contracting Parties were obliged to negotiate 
multilateral or bilateral agreements with the Agency for the application of its safeguards to 
their nuclear activities. Pursuant to that provision, 32 Latin American and Caribbean States 
had done so, many on the basis of that Article and the relevant NPT provisions. For more 
than 30 years, the Agency safeguards system had been providing assurance to the international 
community that non-nuclear-weapon parties to the NPT or treaties like the Tlatelolco Treaty 
complied with their non-proliferation obligations. Those safeguards now needed to cover the 
detection of undeclared nuclear material and activities, and considerably more information 
was required than previously. One way of strengthening safeguards was under the additional 
protocol to safeguards agreements with the Agency. OPANAL was lending its support to the 
seminar to be held in Peru later that year to promote those additional protocols. 
112. Turning to the transport of radioactive material, he referred to the recent declaration by 
the Rio Group regarding its concern about the dangers posed by the maritime transport of such 
material and urging the international community to develop appropriate international safety 
measures. Two of the three most used routes for such transport were in the OPANAL region, 
namely the Panama Canal and Cape Horn. It was important that the Agency, as well as other 
organizations and competent forums, help stop the current gaps in international law in that 
regard. The coastal StatesÂ legitimate rights with regard to safety and the prevention of 
irreparable damage to their populations needed to be reconciled with legitimate rights to 
freedom of navigation. 
113. Finally, he reiterated OPANALÂs intention to establish the closest possible links with 
the Agency. 
The meeting rose at 1.00 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 
(GC(45)/4) 

1. Mr. BORG (Malta) said that his country joined others in offering condolences to 
the Government and people of the United States of America in connection with the recent 
terrorist attacks. 
2. Malta had been a Party to the NPT since 1970 and had signed its safeguards agreement 
with the Agency in 1990. It was in full agreement with the consensus reached at the 2000 
NPT Review Conference that the only possible guarantee against the use of nuclear weapons 
was the total elimination of such weapons, and it looked forward to further progress in the 
non-proliferation field through the negotiation of a treaty for the control of fissile material, 
including material from weapons and other nuclear explosive devices. His country had 
deposited its instrument of ratification of the CTBT earlier in the current year and he appealed 
to others to do the same, especially those whose ratification of the Treaty was a prerequisite 
for its entry into force, so that the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons could be 
achieved. In spite of its size and the fact that it neither produced nor possessed nuclear 
weapons, Malta had always felt a moral and political obligation to support nuclear 
disarmament efforts. Since 1964, when it had become independent, it had not allowed vessels 
carrying nuclear weapons in its harbours. 
3. Apart from the nuclear non-proliferation field, the Agency also played a crucial role in 
such areas as medicine, agriculture and management of water resources. Those activities were 
directed in particular at assisting developing countries and small States like Malta. Not 
having a research capability of their own, such countries depended entirely on technology 
transfer in their efforts to promote sustainable development for their people who often lived in 
difficult conditions. 
4. He appealed to donor countries to make more funds available to the Agency to allow it 
to increase its very important activities in the human health field on such topics as the use of 
radiotherapy to combat cancer, control of the spreading of malaria and the creation of tissue 
banks. In the field of food and agriculture, the Agency had been working with the WHO and 
FAO on food irradiation, the SIT and biosaline agriculture. Many developing countries were 
looking forward to progress in those areas and were hoping that the Agency would make the 
new technologies that were being developed available to them in order to help them tackle 
malnutrition. The availability of adequate fresh water resources was central to sustainable 
development. The Agency was providing valuable assistance to developing countries both 
with water desalination and with the better management of underground water resources. 
5. Malta had ongoing technical assistance programmes with the Agency in the above areas. 
It was grateful to the organization for the assistance it was providing and, in particular, the 
training which Maltese personnel had received. The Agency was currently providing training 
of longer duration than had been customary and was considering offering long-term training 
courses in its areas of specialization. Such courses were of great importance to developing 
and small countries and he encouraged the Agency to increase their availability.

6. Malta supported the AgencyÂs activities, in particular in the area of non-power 
applications. Later in the year it would be hosting an international scientific conference on the 
management of radioactive waste from non-power applications, and a regional workshop on 
nuclear legislation. 
7. Mr. REZA (Bangladesh) condemned the recent terrorist attacks, which had 
claimed thousands of innocent lives, and offered condolences to the Government and people 
of the United States of America and to the bereaved families. 
8. Peaceful applications of nuclear energy and techniques could help promote sustainable 
development in countries like Bangladesh, which was applying nuclear techniques in such 
areas as agriculture, food production, water resource management and medicine, and where 
the private sector was showing a keen interest in the results of various R&D programmes. 
9. His country attached great importance to nuclear safety and radiation protection, and its 
Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control Act was consistent with the AgencyÂs Basic Safety 
Standards. It was a signatory of the Early Notification Convention, the Assistance Convention 
and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. With regard to waste and transport safety, the 
Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission had started the preliminary work for the construction 
of a radioactive waste processing and storage facility. In addition, an inventory was being 
drawn up of radiation sources in the country. Programmes were also under way to increase 
awareness of various aspects of radiation protection. The Agency had been supporting the 
activities in question very generously, and he hoped that support would continue. 
10. BangladeshÂs nuclear power programme was being implemented within the framework 
of a comprehensive nuclear power action plan, under the supervision of a committee headed 
by the Prime Minister. A site for a nuclear power plant with a capacity of about 600 MW had 
been selected, several Agency missions had gone to the site, and a site safety report was 
nearing finalization. Bangladesh was deeply committed to ensuring safety at all phases of the 
project and hoped that the Agency would extend all possible assistance to it during the 
construction of its first nuclear power plant, which would help meet its growing energy needs 
and contribute to the development of its economy. 
11. The AgencyÂs technical assistance programmes were a success story, and countries like 
his own had benefited from them in a number of areas. In the light of its experience, his 
country felt that the scope of technical assistance programmes should be expanded. The 
2000 NPT Review Conference had reconfirmed that the Agency was the principal 
international organization for nuclear technology transfer, and he hoped that it would support 
projects which met BangladeshÂs nuclear technology needs. His country would like to see the 
Agency taking a more proactive role in helping developing countries improve their scientific, 
technological, regulatory and human resource capabilities. It had been an active member of 
the RCA since its inception and was pleased with the gradual expansion of RCA activities in 
support of sustainable development. During the current year, Bangladesh had hosted the 
twenty-third meeting of national RCA representatives and a consultative meeting on enhanced 
awareness and co-ordination among international and regional organizations in Asia and the 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 7 

Pacific. Both meetings had been fruitful and timely from the point of view of consolidating 
RCA programmes, and his country hoped the RCA would be extended beyond 2002. 

12. Bangladesh believed that universal adherence to the NPT could ultimately pave the way 
to nuclear disarmament. It was a party to the NPT and the CTBT, and it had signed an 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency, thus demonstrating its 
unflinching support for the use of nuclear technology for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
13. Mr. RIMDAP (Nigeria) offered his deepest condolences to the people of the 
United States of America in connection with the recent terrorist attacks which had resulted in 
huge loss of lives and property. His country, which had lost some of its own citizens in the 
attacks, condemned all such terrorist acts and would support all efforts by the international 
community to fight such threats to international peace and security. 
14. The AgencyÂs activities in the field of peaceful nuclear techniques were aimed at 
solving socio-economic problems, in particular through the use of nuclear techniques and 
radioisotopes to increase food production, fight disease, manage water resources and protect 
the environment. He encouraged it to pursue its efforts to expand the vista of opportunities 
presented by nuclear technology. 
15. Insect pests continued to be a major obstacle to the alleviation of poverty and to 
sustainable development in Africa and developing Member States. In that connection, he 
welcomed the focus of the current yearÂs scientific forum on nuclear technology for 
sustainable development and urged the Agency to redouble its efforts to rid the affected 
countries of such pests. The SIT had been used remarkably successfully to combat tsetse flies, 
and the Agency had made a significant contribution to addressing that problem. Its support 
for the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign recently approved by 
African Heads of State and Government was also much appreciated. His country was 
submitting a draft resolution on the latter initiative which it hoped the Conference would 
support. Further R&D would be needed to develop the technology for field application of the 
SIT to control or eradicate mosquitoes, and he urged the Agency to strengthen its R&D 
activities in that area and appealed to donors to allocate sufficient financial and human 
resources. He also thanked the United States for the extrabudgetary support it was providing. 
16. Nigeria was benefiting from several national and regional projects during the current 
technical co-operation programme cycle relating to various sub-sectors of its economy. For 
instance, the isotope-based investigation in the Chad basin aquifers addressed the problem of 
groundwater recharge systems by evaluating groundwater reserves and investigating surface 
water using both conventional and nuclear techniques. The information generated by the 
project should facilitate further evaluation and national and regional capacity building to 
ensure effective aquifer management. The Agency also continued to support his countryÂs 
efforts to strengthen its nuclear technology infrastructure. In particular, a miniature neutron 
source reactor had been installed at the Centre for Energy Research and Training at the 
Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. The staff who would be managing the facility had been 
trained with Agency assistance, and a national nuclear regulatory authority had been 
established to ensure that all required safeguards and safety regulations were applied. The 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 8 

facility should enhance NigeriaÂs socio-economic development efforts in such areas as food 
production, health and nutrition, mineral exploration, industry, environmental protection, soil 
fertility mapping and education. 

17. He appealed to donor and recipient countries to support Agency activities under the 
various regional co-operation agreements which fostered the sustainable application of nuclear 
techniques through capacity building and TCDC. His own countryÂs participation in AFRA 
had declined recently, but contacts with experts from AFRA Member States had been 
re-established, affording opportunities to meet and exchange ideas, share experience and 
resources and compare notes, as well as to tackle common problems through joint action. 
18. Nigeria had demonstrated its commitment to nuclear and radiation safety by establishing 
appropriate legal instruments for the regulation and control of nuclear applications in 1995. It 
also continued to participate in the AgencyÂs Model Project on upgrading radiation protection 
infrastructure. The new democratic administration in Nigeria was also reviewing all the 
outstanding regional and international agreements which the country had yet to sign and ratify, 
including those related to Agency activities. 
19. The Agency played a leading role in the promotion of an effective international legal 
and standardization regime in the nuclear, radiation and waste safety area. A strong global 
nuclear safety culture could only be developed when those measures were fully accepted and 
applied by Member States. His country therefore welcomed the entry into force of the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. The forthcoming review process should further reinforce those international 
legal regimes, heighten public awareness, increase transparency worldwide and contribute to 
public acceptance. Nigeria also supported the various measures the Agency had undertaken 
on the safety of radiation sources, security of radioactive material and illicit trafficking. 
20. The NPT was the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system an essential instrument for ensuring compliance therewith. He urged all 
States which had made a non-proliferation commitment to fulfil their legal obligations by 
concluding all the required agreements. Universal adherence to the Model Additional 
Protocol should enhance international security. Nigeria had completed all the relevant legal 
and administrative procedures and would be signing its additional protocol during the current 
session. 
21. Technical co-operation was a mandatory activity of the Agency under the Statute, and 
nuclear technology transfer was one of the fundamental components of the NPT. It was 
therefore cause for concern that, at the current rate of payment, the rate of attainment foreseen 
for the TCF for 2001 might not be reached. Equally worrying were the increased pressure on 
the staff of the Department of Technical Co-operation owing to the growth in the programme 
and the increasing number of recipients, as well as the growing tendency to favour safeguards 
activities over technical co-operation. It was essential that the delicate balance between the 
AgencyÂs main activities be maintained. It was also important to ensure that the technical 
co-operation strategy was responsive to change and was subjected to periodic review, to 
which end intensive and transparent dialogue should be maintained between Member States 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 9 

and the Secretariat. In conclusion, he noted that Nigeria had pledged its full share of the TCF 
target for 2002 and remained committed to the ideals of the organization. 

22. Mr. LAANEMÃE (Estonia) extended condolences to the people of the United 
States of America in connection with the recent appalling terrorist attacks. Estonia 
condemned all forms of terrorism and was ready to co-operate in the fight against it. 
23. For the Agency to be able to carry out its statutory tasks, Member States had to provide 
it with the necessary resources. Estonia paid its assessed contributions to the AgencyÂs 
Regular Budget in full and on time and its assessed programme costs. It had also made its 
first voluntary contribution to the TCF in 2001, amounting to its full share of the target. 
Moreover, it intended to maintain its payment record. 
24. Nuclear energy was only being used in non-power applications in Estonia. He 
welcomed the activities of the Agency and its Member States in the area of radiation and 
waste safety and emphasized the importance of a comprehensive approach in that field. He 
also encouraged the Secretariat to implement the revised action plan for the safety and security 
of radiation sources. In that connection, a useful conference of national regulatory authorities 
had been organized by the Agency and hosted by the Government of Argentina in Buenos 
Aires in December 2000 in which the Estonian Radiation Protection Centre had participated. 
His country welcomed the entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which it had signed on 
5 January 2001. The domestic preparations for its ratification were under way. 
25. In the area of radioactive waste safety, Estonia had received a legacy from the former 
Soviet Union which it was still trying to deal with. The rehabilitation of the former Soviet 
nuclear submarine training centre in Paldiski was progressing steadily. The project on 
conditioning of solid operational radioactive waste had been completed, and one project on 
solidification of liquid operational waste and another on dismantling of the former liquid 
radioactive waste processing plant were under way. The Paldiski site was being used for 
intermediate storage of all radioactive waste from Estonia. The Government was elaborating 
a national policy and a strategy for radioactive waste management which would include an 
analysis of options for a final repository. The tailings pond rehabilitation project at the former 
Soviet uranium milling facility in SillamÃ¤e had started up in November 2000. It was the 
biggest environmental rehabilitation project in Estonian history. The tailings pond in question 
was not the largest of the 29 radioactive tailings ponds requiring rehabilitation in Central and 
Eastern Europe, but it was the most dangerous. When the project was complete by 2006, the 
SillamÃ¤e facility would be one of the first rehabilitated tailings ponds in the region. 
26. Sharing of experience and knowledge was essential for the safe use of nuclear energy 
worldwide. Estonia therefore continued to participate in the valuable activities of INIS, and to 
contribute to its project to cover the backlog of core journals. 
27. He commended the SecretariatÂs innovative and transparent approach to technical 
co-operation activities and, in particular, its presentation of the programme on the AgencyÂs 
web site and through the TC-PRIDE system. Partnership was the hallmark of successful 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 10 

co-operation. Thus, his countryÂs involvement in technical co-operation activities went 
beyond its financial contributions. Currently, it was preparing for a regional training course 
on nuclear cardiology for nuclear medicine physicians which would take place in Tallinn from 
1 to 5 October 2001, and a sub-regional course for the Baltic States on additional protocols to 
be held in Tallinn later in the year. 

28. With regard to the amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute, he said that it was 
still his GovernmentÂs understanding that the division of the AgencyÂs Member States into 
areas did not have any impact on the composition of regional groups in other specialized 
agencies or organizations of the United Nations system, and other international organizations. 
It was also essential that the views of the Member States be taken into account regarding 
which area they considered it appropriate they should belong to. That being said, Estonia was 
pleased that a solution had been found to the issue and that the ratification of the amendment 
by Member States was progressing. 
29. In conclusion, he pledged EstoniaÂs continuing support for the AgencyÂs activities. 
30. Ms. MOHAMED (Kenya) conveyed her countryÂs sympathy and condolences to 
the Government and the people of the United States of America following the recent 
horrendous acts of terrorism. 
31. The peaceful uses of nuclear technology for sustainable development were of particular 
interest to developing countries, and the Agency had made reassuring progress in its efforts to 
strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, improve 
the efficiency of the safeguard system, and strengthen its activities related to nuclear science, 
technology and applications and its technical co-operation activities. Indeed, the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference had commended the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance the effectiveness and 
efficiency of its technical co-operation programme. 
32. Kenya supported the nuclear non-proliferation regime enshrined in the NPT. It had also 
ratified the CTBT and urged other States to do likewise, particularly those whose ratification 
was required for the Treaty to enter into force. 
33. Her country was grateful for the technical assistance it received under the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme. In Kenya, 80% of the population lived in rural areas and 
depended on agriculture for their livelihood. As in many developing countries, growth in 
agriculture and food production was hampered by soil, land and biodiversity degradation, by 
drought, poor soil fertility, insect pests and plant and animal diseases. Agency technical 
co-operation activities in the country currently covered the use of nuclear techniques to 
improve sustainable food security through mutation technologies, maximization of plant 
productivity, preservation of the environment, use of isotope and other nuclear techniques to 
measure and monitor nutrients and water in the soil, improvement of the diagnosis and control 
of livestock diseases, and improvement of livestock productivity by promoting the use of 
livestock feed supplements. Kenya was also participating in a regional project on the use of 
biofertilizers by smallholders to increase crop production and soil fertility, and another on 
increasing and improving milk and meat production. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 11 

34. The Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign aimed to address 
threats to food and agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa caused by tsetse fly 
infestation and trypanosomiasis. An Agency project was already under way in Kenya to 
control tsetse flies and trypanosomiasis in the Lambwe Valley using the SIT. In view of the 
demonstrated success of the SIT, the Agency should intensify its efforts to ascertain the 
feasibility of using that technique to suppress malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. She called 
upon donors to make funds available for that purpose and thanked the United States for the 
support it already provided. 
35. Her countryÂs national health policy aimed at providing health care on a sustainable 
basis which was acceptable, affordable and accessible to the entire population. The 
Government was keen to strengthen preventive health care services, and to control and 
prevent environment- and nutrition-related diseases. The Agency was providing valuable 
support, including in the crucial area of maintenance of medical and scientific instruments, 
through the Institute of Nuclear Science at the University of Nairobi. In the preceding year, 
Kenya had hosted a project planning workshop organized by the Agency and WHO on the 
detection of drug-resistant malaria and tuberculosis. Several Kenyan staff had been trained 
through the AgencyÂs fellowship programmes in diagnostic radiology and radiography and 
others were currently receiving training. The most common form of cancer in Kenya was 
cervical cancer. The radiotherapy department at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi 
was the only public institution in the country providing cancer treatment and it lacked trained 
personnel and equipment. A national project on early diagnosis and treatment of cancer had 
been undertaken with Agency support involving both the National Hospital and the Medical 
Research Institute. That project had also encompassed the upgrading and rehabilitation of the 
radiotherapy department at the New Nyanza General Hospital in Kisumu. Her Government 
would like the Agency to continue supporting that important project. It was also seeking 
assistance with the establishment of two other radiotherapy centres to benefit the 
underprivileged in rural areas, as part of its efforts to decentralize health care provision. 
36. Nuclear techniques could play an effective and unique role in redressing water 
shortages. Kenya was involved in a regional project under AFRA on application of isotope 
hydrology in the water sector which aimed at developing the necessary expertise for water 
resources management, and at upgrading and strengthening human resources in the isotope 
hydrology field. 
37. A stronger safety culture was an indispensable component of any successful nuclear 
programme. Kenya recognized the important role the Agency continued to play in the 
promotion of nuclear safety. Her Government had set up a Radiation Protection Board to deal 
with all matters relating to nuclear, radiation and radioactive waste safety, and was currently 
revising the countryÂs radiation protection law, with the assistance of the Agency, to make it 
compliant with the Basic Safety Standards. The country was also participating in the highly 
successful Model Project on upgrading radiation protection infrastructure. The Government 
had recognized the need to establish a radiation protection laboratory at the Kenya Bureau of 
Standards in order to strengthen radiation protection in the country. It was committed to 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 12 

providing the infrastructure, staff and 50% of the required equipment, and called upon the 
Agency to supplement the local expertise and provide the necessary laboratory equipment. 

38. Like other developing countries, Kenya needed highly qualified and well-trained 
personnel if it was to integrate modern nuclear techniques into its technological development. 
It appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to provide training opportunities for scientists and 
encouraged it to intensify and widen co-operation in that area. Kenya also hoped to receive 
Agency assistance with the acquisition of a research reactor for the Institute of Nuclear 
Science at the University of Nairobi for training in nuclear energy and safety. 
39. Inadequate energy supplies and the use of energy-inefficient technologies were a major 
problem in Kenya. Wood fuel was the most important source of energy, accounting for 70% 
of all energy consumed, while petroleum and electricity accounted for 21%. Hydroelectric 
power accounted for 70% of the countryÂs installed electricity generation capacity, but 
inadequate rainfall was proving a problem. The Government wanted to shift towards modern 
forms of energy and environmentally clean technologies to ensure an adequate supply of 
energy in both the medium and long term, and to increase the proportion of the population 
with access to electricity. Nuclear power might prove a feasible option to supplement 
hydroelectric power. 
40. She urged the Director General to increase the number of staff from developing 
countries and unrepresented or under-represented Member States, particularly at the senior 
and policy-making levels. She also welcomed the measures aimed at achieving gender 
equality and improving the status of women. The Director General should take every 
opportunity to increase the proportion of women in the Secretariat, especially in the 
professional category. 
41. The Agency could only continue to perform its valuable role in the international 
community if Member States honoured their financial obligations to it. However, some, and 
particularly developing Member States, faced serious financial constraints. Kenya suffered 
from high foreign and domestic debt, and devastating weather conditions had hampered its 
economic performance. As a result it had been unable to honour some of its financial 
obligations. However, it was committed to paying its outstanding arrears soon. 
Mr. Palacios (Ecuador) took the chair. 

42. Ms. GARNETT (Australia) conveyed her countryÂs deep condolences and sense of 
outrage over the catastrophic loss of life and the injuries and destruction caused by the recent 
terrorist attacks in the United States of America. Australia would work closely with the 
United States to combat the scourge of international terrorism, and the Agency had an 
important role to play in helping prevent terrorist acts. 
43. The environment in which the Agency operated was very fluid, and it had to maintain 
the capacity to respond quickly and effectively to external developments, whether they were 
related to nuclear weapons proliferation, sustainable development or nuclear safety. The 
Agency could not fulfil its mandate operating in isolation. Wherever possible, it should foster 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 13 

co-operative partnerships with other international organizations and with relevant 
organizations in Member States, focusing on areas where it was able to add the greatest value. 
The increasing level of interaction between the three pillars of the AgencyÂs work was also 
welcome. The importance of the Director GeneralÂs one-house approach could not be 
overstated. 

44. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had recognized that Agency safeguards were an 
indispensable component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and had endorsed the 
strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. Regrettably, progress with the signing and 
ratification of additional protocols to safeguards agreements had been slow, and she urged 
countries to conclude additional protocols and called upon those States party to the NPT 
which had not yet concluded safeguards agreements to do so without further delay. Australia 
was the first Member State in which integrated safeguards were being applied, and the Agency 
was gaining practical experience there of implementing new measures such as unannounced 
inspections, complementary access and managed access. That experience would be invaluable 
as integrated safeguards were extended to other countries. Her country hoped that its 
experience would demonstrate to other countries that integrated safeguards, far from being 
burdensome, yielded benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Safeguards were also 
essential to trade and co-operation in support of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Australia 
for example, as a major uranium supplier, placed the uranium exported by it under Agency 
safeguards in order to ensure that it was used only for peaceful purposes. 
45. Nuclear disarmament could not be achieved without effective measures that ensured 
nuclear non-proliferation. The nuclear-weapon States had particular disarmament obligations 
under Article VI of the NPT. However, non-nuclear-weapon States also had a role to play, for 
example by concluding additional protocols, complying fully with their NPT safeguards 
obligations, and by helping to bring the CTBT into force and get FMCT negotiations started. 
Australia and many other CTBT supporters would continue working to bring about the early 
entry into force of the CTBT, as called for by the 2000 NPT Review Conference. With 161 
signatories and 79 ratifications, the Treaty already represented a powerful body of 
international opinion opposed to nuclear weapons testing. The 2000 NPT Review Conference 
had also identified the negotiation of an FMCT as an urgent task for the international 
community, and the Agency was to be commended for its contribution to the dialogue on 
possible FMCT verification requirements. 
46. The Agency had still not been able to verify the correctness and completeness of the 
initial declaration of nuclear material made by the DPRK, which was still not complying fully 
with its safeguards agreement with the Agency. The General Conference should again make it 
clear that the DPRK had international obligations under that agreement which it was expected 
to fulfil. Moreover, full compliance was in the DPRKÂs own interests, since it was a 
prerequisite for the supply of nuclear power reactors by KEDO and could help create the 
confidence needed for further development of relations between the DPRK and other 
countries. Six DPRK officials had participated in a safeguards training course conducted by 
Australia, in co-operation with the Agency, during August. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 14 

47. Her country was concerned that Iraq might be reactivating its nuclear weapons 
programme following the cessation of the Agency verification and monitoring activities 
mandated by the United Nations Security Council, and it welcomed the fact that the Agency 
had maintained its readiness to resume its activities in Iraq as soon as circumstances allowed. 
Iraq should allow the Agency to carry out its duties and fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by 
the Security Council. 
48. The Agency had been recognized by successive NPT Review Conferences as the 
principal agent for the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Australia 
welcomed the organizationÂs efforts to strengthen technical co-operation through thematic 
planning, the use of Country Programme Frameworks and the Model Project approach. It also 
welcomed the fact that SAGTAC had been reconstituted for a third term. 
49. During the preceding year, Australia had contributed to the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation activities through 48 expert missions, substantial extrabudgetary contributions, 
and its strong support for the RCA for Asia and the Pacific. It was developing distance 
learning materials for use by other Member States and new degree programmes, and offering 
in-house training. 
50. The AgencyÂs new activities on the use of the SIT to eradicate mosquito populations 
were currently focused on malaria control. However, if successful, they could perhaps also be 
directed towards combating other mosquito-borne diseases. In that event, Australia stood 
ready to participate. 
51. AustraliaÂs replacement research reactor project was on schedule, and the application for 
a construction licence was currently under consideration by the regulator. The Australian 
Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation was grateful to the Agency for the peer review 
of the preliminary safety analysis report submitted by it in support of its licence application. 
52. In the nuclear safety area, her country attached particular importance to improving the 
international safety regime for research reactors. It therefore welcomed the action taken by 
the Board of Governors a few days previously in relation to research reactor safety and hoped 
that the General Conference would endorse that action. The Agency could usefully focus on 
assisting Member States with the defuelling of their reactors which were no longer 
operational, the safe management of the spent fuel and, eventually, the decommissioning of 
such reactors. Australia hoped that the AgencyÂs work in developing safety standards would 
soon be extended to cover all nuclear fuel cycle facilities. It was also continuing to promote 
constructive dialogue on the safe transport of radioactive material and welcomed the 
discussions which were currently under way between representatives of the major shipping 
States and members of the Pacific Islands Forum. It also looked forward to the conference on 
the safe transport of radioactive material planned for 2003. 
53. The primary purpose of the United Nations, as reflected in Article 1 of its Charter, was 
to maintain international peace and security, and to that end to take effective collective 
measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Preventing threats to peace 
required the building of trust among nations and the development of an effective international 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 15 

security system, and the AgencyÂs safeguards system was vital in that connection. However, 
maintaining peace and security also had socio-economic dimensions and, in that context, 
Australia also valued the Agency as a technologically sophisticated body engaged in 
promoting sustainable development and the safe use of nuclear energy. 

54. Mr. NIÃO DE GUZMÃN (Bolivia) offered condolences to the Government and 
people of the United States of America for the recent terrorist attacks. Bolivia condemned all 
terrorist attacks and hoped that an end would be put to such criminal actions in the near future. 
55. His country was appreciative of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation strategy and its 
efforts to strengthen the programme, as well as of the assistance it received. The projects for 
the current biennium were making good progress, and the project on the water and 
contamination balance of the Choqueyapu river basin in the La Paz department was 86% 
complete. A laboratory was being set up to provide reference and quality control data for the 
project, and monitoring services for other national programmes. Two other important national 
projects were the one on Chagas disease, for which Bolivia itself had contributed US $80 000, 
and the one on animal health in eastern Bolivia. Although the Bolivian technical counterpart 
had been adversely affected by the serious economic crisis in the region, it continued to 
promote the various technical co-operation projects in progress enthusiastically. A law on 
science and technology had entered into force in the country that month which established 
institutional and operational mechanisms and enlarged the State budget for the national 
counterpart. 
56. Bolivia, like other countries in the region, was concerned over the growth in the Regular 
Budget for 2002-2003, which had a negative impact on the capacity of Member States to pay, 
and the growing number of unfunded core activities, which was causing an imbalance in the 
programme. 
57. A number of worthy draft resolutions were being considered by the General Conference. 
The draft resolution on safe transport of radioactive material was of vital interest not just to 
the Latin American and Caribbean region but to the whole international community. 
Document GC(45)INF/18 contained declarations of concern by members of the Rio Group, as 
well as other regional groups, regarding maritime transport of radioactive material near the 
regionÂs coasts. The fact that a transporting country had recognized the need for compliance 
with Agency standards in that area was positive and gave room to hope that others would soon 
adopt those standards, allowing discussion of the issue to reach a new level. Bolivia fully 
supported the draft resolution in question. 
58. In conclusion, he thanked those countries which had pledged contributions to the TCF 
during the current session. 
59. Mr. SHANGULA (Namibia) said that the world had recently witnessed with 
horror and disbelief the barbaric killing of innocent people and the wanton destruction of 
property in the United States of America. The Namibian people stood by the people of the 
United States during their time of grief and mourning and joined in the unequivocal 
condemnation of all forms of terrorism.

60. In April, the Director General had paid an official visit to his country during which 
fruitful discussions had been held, culminating in the signing of a Country Programme 
Framework for Namibia which was designed to link Agency technical co-operation activities 
to NamibiaÂs second national development plan and ensure projects had more impact on 
NamibiaÂs national development strategy, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and 
capacity building. Currently, five Agency technical co-operation projects were under way in 
the country: one on environmental control, auditing and safeguarding of the uranium 
industry; one on monitoring of veterinary drug residues in livestock; a project on recharge, 
groundwater quality and the flow mechanisms in the Oshivelo and Kalahari aquifers; one on 
improving nuclear medicine services in Namibia; and one on automatic tracer flow gauging 
stations in ephemeral rivers. 
61. Namibia was participating in a regional Model Project aimed at enhancing diagnosis and 
control of malaria and tuberculosis. It also greatly appreciated the assistance the Agency was 
providing through the regional Model Project on development of technical capabilities for 
sustainable radiation and waste safety infrastructure. In connection with the latter project, an 
atomic energy bill providing for the creation of an atomic energy board and a radiation 
protection regulatory authority would soon be tabled in Parliament. 
62. Namibia had assumed the chairmanship of AFRA in September 2000 over which period 
the Agency had provided more than seven million dollarsÂ worth of assistance to the region. 
Participating Member States were now involving themselves more in the design of the 
programme, and more decision-makers were aware of the need to support AFRA and of the 
importance of TCDC in Africa. Strategies had been initiated for ensuring the sustainability of 
AFRA projects. 
63. The AgencyÂs relevance to developing countries had clearly increased, as was 
demonstrated by the growing number of developing Member States. However, it was still 
experiencing financial difficulties, primarily because some Member States failed to honour 
their financial obligations to it. Namibia was not one of those Member States nor did it intend 
to become one. 
64. Developing countries were under-represented in the Secretariat, especially at the higher 
staff levels. Women were also under-represented, and especially African women. The 
Director General should adopt a more proactive approach in the field of recruitment to redress 
that problem. 
65. In conclusion, he welcomed the steps being taken to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system through the conclusion of additional protocols. Namibia remained cautiously 
optimistic that Member States, in particular those that had concluded safeguards agreements, 
would comply fully with their NPT obligations. 
66. Mr. HOANG VAN NHA (Viet Nam) expressed sympathy with the families of the 
victims of the horrific terrorist attacks in the United States of America and said that his 
country strongly condemned those attacks which had caused great suffering to innocent 
people. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 17 

67. Viet Nam greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs achievements over the preceding year in the 
areas of nuclear verification, nuclear applications and nuclear safety, and its efforts to improve 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. His country had signed the NPT, 
concluded a safeguards agreement, and was committed to non-proliferation. As the country 
chairing the Executive Committee of the Bangkok Treaty, it had also been playing an active 
role in the efforts of the ASEAN countries to induce the nuclear-weapon States to accede to 
the Protocol to that Treaty. 
68. National governments should bear the primary responsibility for the safe operation of 
their nuclear facilities. At the same time, the Agency had a vital role to play in promoting 
international co-operation in nuclear safety through the development of standards and the 
provision of education and training. Viet Nam highly valued the technical assistance provided 
by the Agency in the area of nuclear safety. It also shared the concerns which had been 
expressed regarding the safety of research reactors. It had completed a safety analysis report 
on its research reactor in accordance with Agency guidelines and was holding national 
seminars and workshops on research reactor safety with the AgencyÂs assistance. It had 
adopted a national action plan on nuclear safety and radiation protection and, in addition to 
strengthening its technical capabilities, was developing a nuclear regulatory infrastructure and 
preparing to become a party to various nuclear safety-related conventions. 
69. With regard to technical co-operation, his country hoped that the initiatives undertaken 
by the Agency together with regional and other international organizations would result in the 
AgencyÂs finding new sources of funds and manpower for its technical co-operation activities. 
Viet Nam was doing its best to maximize the benefits it derived from technical co-operation 
with the Agency and, in line with the AgencyÂs technical co-operation strategy, it was setting 
priorities in formulating project proposals relating to human health, agriculture, research 
reactor utilization and safety, water resources management, environmental protection, industry 
and manpower development. 
70. His country welcomed the establishment of INPRO and would like to see a large 
number of Member States playing an active part in it. Viet Nam viewed nuclear power as a 
possible energy supply option and was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it had 
provided with a pre-feasibility study for the introduction of nuclear power. 
71. Finally, with regard to the question of global climate change, Viet Nam was concerned 
over the difficulties faced by the Kyoto Protocol. It would like to see universal adherence to 
that instrument and stood ready to co-operate with other countries and with the relevant 
international organizations in trying to bring it into force. 
72. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) offered condolences to the Government and people of 
the United States of America for the innocent victims of the recent terrorist attacks in that 
country. All countries should redouble their efforts to eradicate terrorism in all its forms. 
73. The AgencyÂs promotion of research into nuclear energy and its applications helped 
States prepare comprehensive development plans and meet their growing demand for energy. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 18 

However, all energy sources were important, including fossil fuels, and different standards 
and rules should not be applied to different forms of energy. 

74. Kuwait fully supported the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme and the 
assistance it provided to developing countries in the fields of health care, agriculture and 
water resources, inter alia. In that connection, she stressed the importance of finding funding 
for technical training programmes for the West Asia region. 
75. Her country had almost completed the ratification formalities for its safeguards 
agreement. It was essential that safeguards be applied in all States in the Middle East, 
including Israel, as the 2000 NPT Review Conference had confirmed. Equally, it was 
important that agreement was reached as soon as possible on the establishment of a nuclearweapon-
free zone in the Middle East and a zone free of all other weapons of mass destruction, 
including chemical and biological weapons. Kuwait fully supported that objective and the 
application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the region, and was 
of the opinion that the issue should not be linked to the achievement of a comprehensive 
peace agreement. The responsibility for making the requisite arrangements should lie with the 
Agency rather than with a regional body, in order to avoid duplication of effort and waste of 
resources. Countries exporting nuclear technology should refrain from supplying countries in 
the region with technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons. Moreover, all 
countries in the Middle East should undertake to disclose all information regarding their 
nuclear facilities and programmes in order to ensure that Agency verification measures were 
comprehensive and covered both declared and undeclared sites. In that connection, she 
stressed the importance of additional protocols. 
76. Her country was deeply concerned that the Agency had been unable to carry out its 
mandate in Iraq under the relevant Security Council resolutions since December 1998, and she 
emphasized the urgency of ensuring the early return of the inspection team, as the Agency had 
been unable to investigate any illicit activities that Iraq might have been conducting since that 
point. Iraq still refused to comply with Security Council resolution 1284 (1999), which 
reaffirmed the AgencyÂs right and duty to verify IraqÂs compliance with resolution 687 (1991) 
and other relevant resolutions. It was essential for the Agency to obtain a technically coherent 
picture of IraqÂs clandestine nuclear programme. As document GC(45)/18 made clear, the 
suspension of resolution-related inspections would make it more difficult for the Agency to 
regain a level of knowledge of the status of IraqÂs nuclear-related assets comparable to that it 
had achieved in 1998, and the longer the suspension lasted the more difficult the resumption 
process would be and the more time the Agency would need to re-establish such a level of 
knowledge. Kuwait appreciated the work of the AgencyÂs Action Team in Iraq, and it 
supported continued regular contacts with UNMOVIC and co-ordinated action to implement 
Security Council resolution 1284 (1999). In conclusion, she commended the AgencyÂs work in 
co-operation with Member States and UNMOVIC - on revising the list of items and 
technology to which the export/import mechanism applied. 
77. Mr. HOFFMANN (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-
Ban Treaty Organization) expressed sympathy with the United States of America, and most 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 19 

especially with the families of the victims, following the unspeakable acts of terrorism which 
had taken place there. 

78. The CTBT, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996, 
currently had 161 signatories. Seventy-nine States, including 31 of the 44 States whose 
ratification was required for the entry into force of the Treaty, had deposited instruments of 
ratification with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The first Conference on 
Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty had been 
held in October 1999 in Vienna. The second was to be held later in 2001 in New York, and it 
was hoped that it would result in further signatures and ratifications. 
79. The CTBT provided for the establishment of a unique global verification regime 
consisting of an international monitoring system, a consultation and clarification process, onsite 
inspections and confidence-building measures. Data from monitoring system stations 
around the globe were processed and analysed by the International Data Centre in Vienna. 
The monitoring system was to consist of a global network of 321 stations, using four 
technologies, and 16 radionuclide laboratories. The facilities would be capable of registering 
vibrations underground, in the sea and in the air, and detecting traces of radionuclides released 
into the atmosphere from a nuclear explosion. The stations would transmit data via a global 
communications system to the International Data Centre, where they would be processed, 
analysed and used in detecting, locating and characterizing events. Bulletins of events would 
then be produced based on the data received. Member States had the final responsibility for 
analysing the data, and ambiguous events could be subject to consultation and clarification. 
As a final verification measure, on-site inspections might be carried out. 
80. Work on the establishment of monitoring system stations had started in the second half 
of 1997. More than 20 primary seismic stations, 75 auxiliary seismic stations, two 
hydroacoustic stations, nine infrasound stations and 14 radionuclide stations had been 
completed. With regard to on-site inspections, the Preparatory Commission was building up 
capabilities in accordance with the requirements of the CTBT. It was drafting an operational 
manual of inspection procedures, working out equipment specifications, acquiring inspection 
equipment for testing and training purposes, and developing a long-range training and exercise 
programme for the purpose of building up a staff of potential inspectors. 
81. Training was an important activity of the Provisional Technical Secretariat. The focus 
of monitoring system training was on training station operations personnel in the use of the 
four technologies. The International Data Centre provided six-month training courses 
designed to increase the traineesÂ understanding of how the Centre functioned, and to enlarge 
the pool of possible candidates for analyst positions. The Provisional Technical Secretariat 
had conducted five introductory training courses on on-site inspections for over 170 trainees 
from about 40 States. 
82. Currently, the Provisional Technical Secretariat had a staff of more than 250 people 
from nearly 70 countries. More than 27% of the Professional posts were held by women. The 
Preparatory CommissionÂs approved budget for 2001 amounted to $83.5 million. As of 
September 2001, over 84% of the assessed contributions had been received. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 20 

83. Regarding legal matters, various arrangements had been concluded with States for the 
regulation of the Preparatory CommissionÂs activities at nearly 300 monitoring system 
facilities. An agreement regulating the relationship between the Preparatory Commission and 
the United Nations had entered into force in 2000. The Preparatory Commission had 
established a liaison office at United Nations Headquarters in November 2000. 
84. In its outreach activities, the Provisional Technical Secretariat stressed the benefits 
which CTBT participation could yield both in terms of enhanced security and in civil and 
scientific applications of the verification technologies. It was endeavouring to increase 
understanding of the CTBTÂs significance and of the Preparatory CommissionÂs work with a 
view to advancing the signature and ratification process and increasing the involvement of 
States in that work. 
85. Mr. BEJAPUTRA (Thailand) offered condolences to the people and Government 
of the United States and to the bereaved families for the loss and suffering caused by the 
recent tragic incidents in that country. 
86. Thailand supported the AgencyÂs strengthened safeguard system. The current 
safeguards arrangement in his country needed to be revised to accommodate the requirements 
of the additional protocol. A national committee was being set up to formulate a new and 
more appropriate safeguards system for Thailand. Substantial progress had been made with 
regard to the establishment of the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone on matters 
relating to nuclear-weapon States. His country also welcomed the ratification of the Bangkok 
Treaty by the Government of the Philippines. 
87. In the nuclear safety area, following the nuclear accident in the preceding year 
Government authorities had agreed that the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace should be 
reorganized to become the national regulatory authority, with separate management from 
operational and R&D activities. Thailand was also participating in the Model Project on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure and had been working closely with the AgencyÂs 
regional manager to implement the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards. The Agency should 
continue to work closely with Member States to establish guidelines to prevent possible 
radioactive metal contamination in consumer products. The recently approved Action Plan 
for the Safety of Radiation Sources and the Security of Radioactive Materials and its 
associated Code of Conduct had been greatly appreciated by developing Member States in 
Asia at the regional workshop on that issue held in Bangkok on 6-10 August 2001. However, 
further guidelines and measures were needed to make them more effective. His country was 
also grateful to the Agency for the support it had given to the subsequent Southeast Asia 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone workshop held in Bangkok on 11 August 2001. In the waste 
safety area, the Agency had provided valuable assistance to Thailand with the successful 
conditioning of part of its disused radium-226 sources. 
88. The Director GeneralÂs one-house policy had a significant impact on effective delivery 
of technical co-operation since, in addition to the important role played by the Department of 
Technical Co-operation, the technical departments of the Agency also provided key support to 
the programme. Thailand had benefited substantially from Agency technical assistance in 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 21 

recent years, including under the RCA. It had also contributed to the programme by receiving 
fellows and scientific visitors for on-the-job training in agricultural and medical applications. 

89. The Agency had actively participated in the 17th International Conference of the 
International Union of Nutritional Sciences held in Vienna on 27-31 August 2001, and had 
organized an International Symposium on Isotopic Tools for Monitoring Nutritional Status in 
Nutrition and Development Programmes in conjunction with it. That event had been of great 
assistance to Member States. Nutrition was an essential factor in meeting basic human needs, 
and isotopic techniques were one of the tools that could be used to help solve malnutrition 
problems worldwide. The Agency should therefore consider expanding technical assistance to 
Member States in the nutrition research and development field, together with partners such as 
the WHO, FAO and UNICEF, interested Member States, and NGOs. 
90. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) conveyed his countryÂs condolences to the Government and 
people of the United States of America following the recent terrorism attacks in that country. 
Jordan condemned those acts, which ran counter to the traditions of Arab and Muslim society, 
and was ready to support all actions aimed at combating terrorism. 
91. Convinced as it was that the peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear techniques 
could enhance socio-economic development, his country had recently established a nuclear 
energy commission, with the assistance of the Agency, and passed legislation on nuclear 
energy and radiation protection. Serious efforts were being undertaken to acquire and develop 
the relevant knowledge and skills to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and nuclear 
techniques in the fields of food, agriculture, medicine, health, industry, the environment, water 
resource management and radiation protection, inter alia. 
92. He stressed the importance of enhancing the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, 
and developing effective programmes geared to improving the scientific and technical 
capabilities of developing countries and providing long-term assistance to sustainable 
development. The latter entailed, inter alia, focusing on strengthening national capabilities in 
the areas of nuclear equipment maintenance, upgrading and quality control, and human 
resource development. The Agency should also consider providing assistance for the 
SESAME project (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle 
East). 
93. The Agency was undertaking valuable activities aimed at strengthening international 
co-operation in the areas of nuclear safety and the development of safety standards for 
radioactive waste management. Projects should also be established on effective control and 
monitoring of illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material and radiation sources. 
Member States needed to establish well equipped border control centres capable of detecting 
such material. 
94. Nuclear energy could also make a valuable contribution to addressing the serious 
problem of water shortages. That issue was of special interest to Jordan which faced major 
water problems. His country therefore fully supported the AgencyÂs activities relating to the 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 22 

economic production of potable water, nuclear desalination of sea water, and the use of 
isotope hydrology for water resource management. 

95. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency provided valuable assistance to its Member States in 
the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. However, it was suffering from a lack of 
resources and hoped that the Agency would provide support in order to help it assume a more 
active role, particularly in the fields of socio-economic development and environmental 
protection. 
96. It was essential that all United Nations resolutions be duly respected and implemented if 
peace and security were to prevail in the world. Most countries in the Middle East supported 
the goal of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region, and all Arab countries in the 
region had signed the NPT. Israel alone refused to sign the Treaty or let the Agency monitor 
its nuclear facilities. That attitude obstructed efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East and 
posed a risk to the region. He urged the international community to exert pressure on Israel to 
sign the NPT and place its nuclear activities under Agency safeguards. 
97. Mr. CHAMMA (Lebanon) said that his country joined others in condemning the 
recent terrorist acts committed in the United States of America and offered its profound 
sympathy to the people of that country. 
98. Lebanon had been one of the first countries to join the Agency because of its firm belief 
in the peaceful objectives of the organization. It was committed to making the world a safer 
place, and the Middle East a stable region free of all weapons of mass destruction, especially 
nuclear weapons. All States in the region had acceded to the NPT except Israel, which was 
also the only State in the Middle East that possessed nuclear weapons and which refused to 
place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards and allow international inspections. The 
resulting situation constituted a permanent threat to security in the Middle East and hence to 
global security. The failure of the peace process, the ongoing violence in the region, and the 
current climate of confrontation throughout the world had made matters worse. He urged the 
international community to use its influence to compel Israel to comply with international 
treaties so that the Agency could achieve its aim of protecting the Middle East against the 
nuclear threat. 
99. It was a basic principle of Lebanese foreign policy to maintain the best possible relations 
with the United Nations and its specialized agencies. The fruits of its collaboration with the 
Agency consisted of both legal instruments and practical achievements. For example, 
Lebanon had ratified most of the AgencyÂs legal instruments and in some cases had enacted 
national legislation to apply their provisions. The Lebanese Government had recently 
submitted a bill to Parliament on protection against ionizing radiation which provided for the 
establishment of a monitoring body in accordance with the provisions of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety, which Lebanon had already signed. Information on the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy for development had been published. 
100. He urged the Agency to redouble its efforts in the area of water resources management, 
which was of vital strategic importance in the Middle East and essential to the maintenance of 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 23 

stability in the region. Assistance should also be provided with the problem of guarding 
against radioactive contamination of water. 

101. Lebanon was appreciative of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and was 
particularly grateful for the training received by Lebanese environmental and medical experts. 
It paid its financial contributions to the Agency, including its voluntary contributions to the 
TCF, and would continue to do so. However, its key contribution to the work of the Agency 
lay in the human resources area in the form of a group of Lebanese experts who were 
devotedly serving the Agency and its lofty goals. His country was also working to promote 
co-operation between the Agency and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, which operated on the 
same principles as its international counterpart. 
102. The current session was taking place at a time of world crisis which could mark a 
historical turning point. In five weeksÂ time, Lebanon would be hosting a summit of 
francophone States to be attended by heads of State and Government representing many 
different religions, creeds, customs and continents. The one factor that united them -apart 
from the French language -was their commitment to human rights and freedoms, and to world 
peace. The conference slogan, ÂDialogue among culturesÂ, underscored the need to respect 
other peopleÂs right to be different as a prerequisite for world peace. Dialogue, rather than 
confrontation and the violation of international law and customs, was the key to cultural, 
social and economic peace and security. 
103. Mr. SAN THEIN (Myanmar) said that it was essential that Agency safeguards and 
verification measures were applied in a non-discriminatory manner and in conformity with the 
relevant provisions of the NPT. 
104. The Bangkok Treaty constituted significant contribution to peace and security in South-
East Asia. Myanmar had signed that Treaty even before becoming a member of ASEAN at 
the fifth ASEAN formal summit held in December 1995. Myanmar had also been one of the 
earliest members of ASEAN to ratify the Treaty. Nuclear-weapons-free zones were effective 
in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and in contributing to nuclear disarmament. 
105. The Agency played a highly effective and useful role in mediating regional co-operation 
through the RCA, AFRA and ARCAL, which were doing very well in their respective regions. 
It had provided his own country with valuable assistance in the fields of nuclear medicine, 
radiotherapy, nuclear diagnostic techniques, agriculture, industry, education and training, 
which had had a positive impact on national development. Myanmar had embarked on a 
programme aimed at promoting and developing nuclear applications and was aware of the 
need for an adequate radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure. The efforts within 
the country to prepare regulations on the safe use of radiation and atomic energy were almost 
complete. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided in that regard through the 
interregional Model Project on upgrading radiation and waste safety infrastructure. In 
conclusion, he urged the Director General and the Secretariat to maintain and develop further 
its technical assistance activities, giving priority to projects for less developed Member States. 
Mr. Kangai (Zimbabwe) took the Chair. 



GC(45)/OR.6 
page 24 

106. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba) expressed his countryÂs deep sympathy with the 
people of the United States of America following the grievous loss of life caused by the recent 
terrorist attacks. The Cuban people, with over 40 yearsÂ exposure to terrorist attacks 
promoted from United States territory, were particularly sensitive to the sorrow caused by the 
unjustified loss of so many lives. 
107. Cuba was making tremendous development efforts under very difficult economic 
conditions exacerbated by the unjust and criminal blockade imposed on it by the United States 
Government, a blockade which had been in force for more than 40 years despite almost 
unanimous condemnation by the international community. 
108. The nuclear programme launched in Cuba in the 1980s consisted of two main parts: one 
relating to applications of nuclear techniques and another to nuclear power. The JuraguÃ¡ 
nuclear power plant project had recently been discontinued for economic reasons. Options 
which were economically more viable, given CubaÂs present circumstances, had emerged 
during the past few years. Cuba was currently meeting over 70% of its electricity demand 
using domestically produced fuel. 
109. Nevertheless, his Government recognized the role which nuclear techniques could play 
in sustainable development, and the substantial impact which they had had on CubaÂs main 
development programmes. It would therefore continue supporting CubaÂs nuclear 
programme, which was now focused on applications of nuclear techniques in various areas of 
socio-economic importance. 
110. His country remained of the opinion that an appropriate balance should be maintained 
between the promotional activities of the Agency and its verification activities. The AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme should continue to be strengthened, as it was a vital 
instrument of technology transfer in response to the urgent needs of developing countries. 
Strengthening the programme should mean not only improving organizational structures and 
management procedures, but also ensuring the availability of sufficient financial resources to 
meet the growing demand for Agency technical assistance. Steps should be taken to prevent a 
further diversion of TCF resources to the financing of technical co-operation programme 
management, which should be financed completely from the Regular Budget. 
111. Cuba had made optimum use of the resources assigned to it under the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme and excellent results had been achieved in areas such as 
human health, agriculture and industry. Consequently, despite the economic difficulties it was 
experiencing, it consistently met its financial obligations to the Agency. 
112. His country had been a consistent advocate of nuclear disarmament and continued to 
believe that the present nuclear non-proliferation regime was discriminatory. What it would 
like to see was a strengthened, effective and efficient safeguards system as part of a universal, 
equitable non-proliferation regime leading to the immediate, total and unconditional 
elimination of nuclear weapons. Consequently, despite the difficult conditions in Cuba, it had 
taken practical steps pursuant to its safeguards commitments. 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 25 

113. Mr. ABDULAATI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) offered sincere condolences to the 
people of the United States of America following the recent tragic events, and in particular to 
the families of the victims. His country stood ready to provide assistance in whatever form it 
was able, including blood donations. 
114. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya attached great importance to technical co-operation to 
promote economic and social development through the use of nuclear science and technology 
for peaceful purposes, and it greatly appreciated the assistance it had received from the 
Agency. 
115. The problem of water shortages had become life-threatening in many parts of the world 
and could lead to war unless effective action was taken. The General Conference and the 
Agency should take practical steps to implement the nuclear seawater desalination 
programme, instructing INDAG to undertake the necessary technical and economic feasibility 
studies. Priority should be given to the use of small- and medium-sized reactors for seawater 
desalination and electricity generation, since such reactors were best suited to the low demand 
in small countries. His country had implemented a major project to bring water from the 
south to the north through a complex system of pipelines and had built numerous dams for the 
storage of rainwater. The AgencyÂs isotope hydrology programme could be of great assistance 
to Member States in the water resources management field, and he trusted that his countryÂs 
request for an Agency technical co-operation project in that area would be approved. 
116. A larger proportion of the AgencyÂs financial resources should be devoted to technical 
co-operation programmes in the area of nuclear science and technology and their applications 
with a view to enhancing the capabilities of developing countries. Co-operation should not 
focus on specific sectors but serve more holistic aims, in accordance with the AgencyÂs 
Statute and relevant General Conference resolutions. 
117. He commended the steps taken by the Agency to develop international co-operation in 
the fields of radiation safety, transport safety and the processing of radioactive waste and other 
radioactive material. Having acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had established a bureau for radiation monitoring and 
nuclear safety which would start work as soon as local formalities had been completed. 
118. It was important to ensure that Agency safeguards were applied without discrimination 
to all countries. The existing system was discriminatory since as it left the nuclear-weapon 
States free to choose the manner in which and sites at which safeguards were applied, while 
other countries were required to apply the system in the manner stipulated by the Agency. 
The nuclear-weapon States should commit themselves to eliminating all weapons of mass 
destruction in their possession, particularly nuclear weapons, and he urged those countries to 
launch a time-bound programme to that end, and to scrap all programmes aimed at the 
development of such weapons. Otherwise, efforts to end the nuclear arms race would lose all 
credibility and other countries would continue to live in fear. 
119. There was still a major and dangerous security imbalance in the Middle East, since 
Israel was the only State in the region that possessed nuclear weapons and it refused to place 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 26 

its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards and allow international inspections. At the 
same time, countries from outside the region were putting pressure on some States in the 
region to sign a treaty to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. All States in the 
region except Israel were parties to the NPT, a number were also parties to the Pelindaba 
Treaty, and some had signed additional protocols. The application of double standards was 
counter-productive. Peace in the region would remain elusive as long as certain countries 
continued to support Israel and provide justification for its conduct, allowing it to ignore 
appeals for peace, and for it to accede to the NPT, sign a safeguards agreement with the 
Agency, and subject its nuclear facilities to international inspection and monitoring. He urged 
the General Conference to take urgent steps to compel Israel to submit to the will of the 
international community so that a nuclear-weapon-free zone could finally be established in the 
Middle East. 

120. Mr. KAYSER (Luxembourg) expressed sympathy with the families of the victims 
of the terrible tragedy which had recently befallen the United States of America. That incident 
affected the entire world and would of necessity influence the AgencyÂs future priorities. 
121. Combating international terrorism was a multi-faceted affair, and one aspect of it was 
the prevention of diversion and theft of nuclear material, and of nuclear sabotage. In order to 
be able to prevent a terrorist attack involving nuclear material, physical protection of such 
material and of nuclear installations had to be assured. Currently, the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was restricted in scope since it was limited to 
obligatory active and passive protection measures within the framework of international 
transport of nuclear material. It did not cover preventive measures against theft or diversion 
of nuclear material during domestic use, storage and domestic transport, or preventive 
measures to protect nuclear installations against sabotage. In November 1999, the Director 
General had convened an open-ended expert group to review the Convention and determine 
whether it needed to be revised. That group had discovered the following: by March 2000, 
168 confirmed instances of theft or diversion of nuclear material had been recorded, 19 of 
them involving highly enriched uranium and plutonium; the level of physical protection of 
nuclear material was far from being the same in all countries and there were obvious 
shortcomings; and the assistance provided by the Agency in the form of advice was limited to 
those countries which requested such advice, entire regions having received none. 
122. During the meetings of the expert group, Luxembourg had consistently maintained that 
physical protection of nuclear material should be preventive in nature, and that something 
needed to be done before a terrorist attack occurred involving nuclear material. In the nuclear 
field, as in other areas, the facts showed that international conventions were often elaborated 
after the fact. Thus, the Assistance Convention, the Early Notification Convention and the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety had all been negotiated and adopted after the Chernobyl 
accident, i.e. too late. States should not wait for an actual instance of sabotage of a nuclear 
power plant, or criminal diversion of a significant quantity of military-grade plutonium, before 
agreeing to elaborate a new convention on physical protection to prevent such acts. 
123. His country was pleased that the expert group had urged the Director General to 
convene a group of legal and technical experts to draft a proposed revision of the Convention, 

GC(45)/OR.6 
page 27 

and hoped that the recent tragic events in the United States would prompt States to reach 
agreement swiftly on that important legal instrument. 

124. Mr. TABIBIAN (Armenia) offered condolences to the American people in the 
wake of the recent tragic events which were of particular consequence to the work of the 
Agency. 
125. Sometimes events such as the Chernobyl accident were needed to ensure that 
mechanisms which should have been in place beforehand were finally put in place. The 
Agency was now faced with the problem of extending safely the operating life of nuclear 
power plants, an issue to which his country had a serious commitment. Armenia also 
welcomed the establishment of INPRO, which would be working on innovative nuclear 
reactors and fuel cycle technologies, including small- and medium-sized reactors that could 
meet the needs of developing countries. 
126. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had reconfirmed that Agency safeguards were an 
indispensable component of the non-proliferation regime and had endorsed the efforts to 
strengthen the safeguards system. Armenia attached great importance to the Model Additional 
Protocol. It was also pleased at the quickening pace of the ratification process for the CTBT. 
However, some test explosions had taken place since the TreatyÂs opening for signature, and 
he urged all States that had not already done so to sign and ratify it as soon as possible and to 
refrain from acts which would defeat its objective and purpose. It was to be hoped that the 
next Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT would advance that process. 
127. Nuclear safety would continue to be vital to the future of nuclear technology and was a 
high priority for the Armenian Government. The Armenian nuclear regulatory authority was 
currently finalizing the countryÂs national report pursuant to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, in preparation for the next review meeting of the Contracting Parties in 2002. Experts 
from six countries had given the level of nuclear safety at the Armenian nuclear power plant a 
high rating, and had proposed a new programme for further upgrading of the plantÂs safety 
which had been approved by the President of Armenia. In 2000, the dry storage facility for 
the plantÂs spent nuclear fuel, which had been built by FRAMATOME and funded through a 
loan from the French Government, had become operational. His country also appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation, transport and 
waste safety, and welcomed the entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent 
Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management which it hoped to join 
soon. 
128. Over the preceding two years, the discussions which had been held between the 
Armenian authorities and the Agency had helped focus technical co-operation programming 
on areas of high priority for the country. 
129. Although his country had given its support to AzerbaijanÂs membership of the Agency, 
it had been disappointed by the latterÂs statement earlier in the week where it had used the 
General Conference as a forum for engaging in propaganda and false accusations against 
Armenia. 

GC(45)/OR.6

130. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that the challenges facing nuclear power would be 
addressed adequately, that a tangible social and economic impact in areas of priority to 
Member States would be achieved, and that nuclear power would be given a full and fair 
hearing in the sustainable energy development debate, thanks to the continued efforts of the 
Agency. 
The meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (continued) 
(GC(45)/4) 

1. Mr. ALEXANDRIS (Greece) said that his delegationÂs thoughts were with the 
innocent victims of the horrendous attacks of 11 September on the United States of America 
and expressed his countryÂs solidarity with the American nation. The holding of the AgencyÂs 
General Conference was a sign of the international communityÂs will to move forward despite 
the blind forces of regression and hatred. 
2. Greece, always actively interested in nuclear safety, had recently joined the Incident 
Reporting System for Research Reactors and had already ratified the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety. It would welcome a study initiated by the Agency of the overall structure of its safety 
standards that would cover the whole spectrum of fuel cycle facilities. In that context, he 
noted with satisfaction the Director GeneralÂs interest in decommissioning planning as part of 
the back end of the fuel cycle and encouraged him to increase the AgencyÂs efforts in that 
regard. 
3. His delegation also appreciated the Director GeneralÂs efforts to develop a 
comprehensive approach to assessing the safety of individual StatesÂ nuclear programmes, 
taking both their legal infrastructure and overall safety culture into account, and welcomed the 
action plan for the safety and security of radioactive sources. 
4. In the field of radiation protection, Greece was pleased to announce that it had adopted 
revised regulations in harmony with European and international standards and had organized 
seminars on their application. 
5. With regard to the environmental impact of radioactive residues, his delegation 
appreciated the AgencyÂs endeavours to bring about an international consensus on radiological 
release criteria to ensure internationally acceptable levels of radioactive residues in traded 
commodities. Greece was particularly interested in the AgencyÂs studies evaluating the health 
consequences of depleted uranium applications in view of its proximity to Kosovo and Bosnia 
and the deployment of Greek peacekeeping troops there. A special mission of the Greek 
Atomic Energy Commission had collected and evaluated environmental samples from the 
areas where Greek troops were operating, with findings similar to those reported by the 
European Union countries and WHO missions. His delegation would like to see the Agency 
play a more active role in such missions. 
6. He reiterated his countryÂs strong commitment to and support of the AgencyÂs 
verification role in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. His delegation was 
pleased to note that, in 2000, the Agency had gone further than ever before in achieving its 
inspection goals despite the fact that available funds had not increased for a long time. 
7. Greece welcomed the progress made in the area of integrated safeguards, and hoped the 
conceptual framework for their implementation would be completed by the end of the year. 
The AgencyÂs role in that area should be further strengthened so that it could meet Member 
StatesÂ expectations unfettered by political, technical or financial constraints. Although the 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 6 

AgencyÂs safeguards system had experienced some hitches over the years, it was the only 
system the international community had to monitor its non-proliferation commitments, and 
the precious experience gained in 40 years of operating that system must not be lost. 

8. Universal application of the safeguards system was one of the three basic elements of 
international nuclear security, the other two being accelerated disarmament and an 
international system for physical protection and the prevention of illicit trafficking. Greece 
looked forward to amendment of the scope of the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material in line with the conclusions reached by the expert meeting on the possible 
need to revise that Convention in May 2001. Greece had reported several incidents of illicit 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material and was grateful to the Agency for the 
prompt expert assistance it had provided with the most important incident, which had 
involved plutonium plates. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission was making arrangements 
to collect and export sealed sources no longer in use, and Greece was also voluntarily 
participating in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking data system. 
9. As both a donor and a recipient of Agency technical assistance, Greece fully appreciated 
its contribution to world development, in particular through technology transfer and 
information programmes. His delegation welcomed the recent shift in strategy from 
technology-driven programmes to those based on the priorities and specific needs of Member 
States and looked forward to continued improvements. More co-operation was needed not 
only with Member States but also with the United Nations, the specialized agencies and the 
private sector. Greece would continue to assist the Agency by offering training at its 
laboratories and the services of its experts. 
10. Greece had ratified the amendments to Articles VI and XIV.A of the Statute adopted by 
the General Conference at its 43rd session and the instrument of acceptance had been 
deposited on 25 June 2001. On management and personnel matters, his delegation shared 
concerns about the declining interest in nuclear studies resulting in continuous skill reduction 
and ageing of the AgencyÂs qualified personnel. The rotation principle, which should not be 
regarded as sacrosanct, exacerbated the problem. The personal intervention of the Director 
General was needed to find a solution. Ready to assist the Director General in such efforts, 
Greece felt that much could be done by, for example, ensuring that senior officers of the 
Agency did not feel discriminated against and respecting the national personnel quota 
allocated to the Member States. 
11. In conclusion, he expressed his delegationÂs support for the Director GeneralÂs vision of 
the organizationÂs future. 
12. Mr. MÃRQUEZ MARÃN (Venezuela) expressed his countryÂs condolences and 
sorrow at the tragedy of the terrorist attacks on the United States of America. Stressing that 
peace and justice should prevail over a violent response, he said that the role of the United 
Nations as the guarantor and promoter of peace was acquiring ever greater relevance. The 
Agency should redouble its efforts to ensure that nuclear energy was used only for peaceful 
purposes. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 7 

13. Venezuela had consistently supported the Agency and its three fundamental activities: 
technology transfer, safety and verification. One of those pillars, the technical co-operation 
programme, was important for developing countries like Venezuela because it raised the 
standard of living and promoted socio-economic development. Thus, his country had 
co-sponsored the draft resolution on the drought in Central America; appropriate management 
of water resources using nuclear techniques could have prevented that problem. His 
delegation was grateful for the SecretariatÂs assistance in ensuring that future co-operation 
programmes were in line with national development goals, were sustainable and that the 
available human resources were adequate. 
14. VenezuelaÂs national priorities were to develop the health sector, improve agriculture 
and cattle-breeding, and make the industrial sector more competitive while at the same time 
protecting the environment. Given that medium-and long-term development depended on a 
balanced government strategy, co-operation should also aim to develop domestic technology 
capabilities and train human resources. 
15. VenezuelaÂs current national co-operation projects with the Agency focused on: 
sustainable animal production, which had a high socio-economic potential; upgrading nuclear 
medicine practices; quality control of technetium-99 based on radiopharmaceuticals; and 
nuclear techniques in the aluminium and oil industries and for dam safety. Under regional 
projects, it was receiving advisory assistance on radioactive waste management and radiation 
safety. It hoped to expand its technical co-operation activities, perhaps with a project on SIT 
eradication of disease-carrying mosquitoes. 
16. Turning to the AgencyÂs verification role, he said that Venezuela endorsed international 
disarmament principles and had a pacifist tradition that was enshrined in its constitution. In 
view of that, and as a party to the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, Venezuela emphasized the 
importance of strengthening bilateral and multilateral disarmament treaties to reinforce recent 
progress in disarmament and nuclear arms control and to prevent the development of a new 
nuclear arms race. 
17. Venezuela was concerned about the increasing costs of safeguards owing to the greater 
number of activities and installations to be inspected. Incorporation of the integrated 
safeguards system would have a further cost impact to be borne by Member States and the 
gradual elimination of the shielding system would aggravate the situation for the developing 
countries. Paradoxically, there seemed to be a tendency for a net transfer of resources from 
the developing to the developed countries. Admittedly, while a few countries contributed 
over 70% of the AgencyÂs budget, the contributions paid by Venezuela - and other countries seemed 
disproportionate given that its nuclear capacity was limited and it had never possessed 
nuclear weapons, nor did it have any intention to procure them. That could lead to increasing 
arrears and less participation in decision-making in the future. His delegation would approve 
the 2001 budget, whose balance had been achieved with recourse to previous budgetary 
surpluses, but it was difficult to know where additional resources might come from in future. 
Venezuela felt that consideration should be given to allocating budgetary increases in 
proportion to the increase in safeguards in countries with the most nuclear activities.

18. Mr. SAIDOV (Uzbekistan) expressed his delegationÂs deep sympathy to the 
people of the United States of America for the terrorist attacks which had taken place and its 
solidarity with them in the fight against terrorism. 
19. For centuries Uzbekistan had stood at the crossroads of trade between the East and the 
West. Unfortunately, the busy routes across Uzbekistan were now being used for the transit of 
drugs and weapons. After gaining independence, Uzbekistan had chosen the path of peaceful 
coexistence with all countries and had proposed initiatives aimed at strengthening peace and 
stability in Central Asia. One of them was the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Central Asian region. 
20. Matters relating to nuclear and radioactive material accountancy and control, and its 
export and import, were being addressed in co-operation with international NGOs. In 1994, 
Uzbekistan and the Agency had signed an agreement on the application of safeguards pursuant 
to the NPT and subsequently his Government had signed an additional protocol thereto. The 
laws and regulatory documents in Uzbekistan conformed with such international conventions 
as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, the Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy, the Early 
Notification Convention, and the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
Furthermore, work to strengthen the physical protection of the nuclear facilities subject to 
Agency safeguards was being undertaken with the help of the United States of America. 
21. UzbekistanÂs regulatory authority was the Agency for Industrial Safety and Mining 
Inspection of the Republic of Uzbekistan (the ÂSanoatkontekhnazoratÂ Agency). It was also 
the body responsible for establishing a State system of accounting for and control of nuclear 
material and for supervising the transport of dangerous goods by rail. With Agency support, 
appropriate personnel were receiving training. While national specialists had a high level of 
expertise, they had been unable to work to international standards because of a lack of 
equipment and financing. 
22. The uranium industry in Uzbekistan was in the hands of the Navoi Mining and 
Metallurgical Concern and four mining companies. Uranium was generally extracted by 
underground leaching and was exported abroad. Physical protection was ensured on-site by 
security guards. 
23. The disposal of spent nuclear waste and the recultivation of disused uranium mines were 
topical issues. Uncontrolled settlement and cattle grazing would lead to severe environmental 
and health problems. Strict compliance with the nuclear safety rules and regulations and with 
the relevant laws would prevent unforeseen accidents, ensure safe working conditions and 
preserve the environment for future generations. 
24. Uzbekistan had two nuclear reactors in operation: a 15 kilowatt pulsed neutron source 
and the 10 megawatt WWR-CM research reactor. All the installations and nuclear material in 
Uzbekistan were subject to Agency safeguards. Also, a database of all the radiation sources in 
Uzbekistan had been set up at the ÂSanoatkontekhnazoratÂ Agency. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 9 

25. After Uzbekistan had signed the Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, 
the Agency had held a meeting of donor countries in Vienna early in 1996 to provide 
assistance to Uzbekistan in setting up a system for the physical protection of nuclear material 
at the WWR-CM reactor. Finland and Sweden had offered help to Uzbekistan in setting up a 
legislative basis for the use of atomic energy, the United States of America and the United 
Kingdom help with the physical protection of nuclear material, and the Australian Safeguards 
and Non-Proliferation Office help in creating a nuclear material accountancy and control 
system. 
26. During the current year, national representatives had participated in various training 
courses, seminars, conferences and scientific visits organized by the Agency. The plan for the 
development of the radiation safety infrastructure in Uzbekistan, elaborated in conjunction 
with the Agency, included further educational activities to be carried out with Agency support 
in such areas as accountancy and control of radioactive and nuclear material, and radiation 
safety in relation to the use, storage and disposal of ionizing radiation sources. Seminars on 
current safety topics enabled experts from Uzbekistan to keep up to date with the latest 
developments in radioactive material and waste management, and with current international 
requirements. A seminar on the notification, registration and licensing of ionizing radiation 
sources had been held for the regulatory bodies. In addition, the plan provided for training 
abroad, and the supply of modern equipment for UzbekistanÂs radiation safety services. Most 
importantly, the plan provided for the establishment of a legislative basis in the country, as a 
precondition for the safe use of ionizing radiation sources. UzbekistanÂs national projects 
with the Agency dealt with, inter alia, improving the environment, increasing crop yields and 
more accurate disease diagnosis. The Agency also involved interested States in regional 
projects. All in all, the Agency had granted over US $1.5 million in assistance to Uzbekistan. 
27. Mr. TORRES ZAPATA (Ecuador) expressed solidarity with the delegation of the 
United States of America for the terrible terrorist attacks which had taken place several days 
previously in Washington and New York. 
28. He reiterated EcuadorÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs work and objectives, particularly 
in the field of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy aimed at promoting development. 
29. He informed the General Conference that EcuadorÂs President, Gustavo Noboa, had 
recently signed decrees ratifying both the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement 
under the Tlatelolco Treaty and ARCAL, and that the ratification instruments for the above 
international agreements would be deposited in the near future. 
30. Concerning radiation safety, Ecuador had passed a law to regulate and supervise the 
fabrication, use, transfer and transport of radiation equipment and sources. According to this 
law, the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission was the responsible regulatory body and it 
carried out its functions through regional radiation safety offices located in Quito, Guayaquil, 
and Cuenca. In 1978, the Government had issued the Radiation Safety Regulations which 
were fully in force in Ecuador and mandatory for users. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 10 

31. The Commission provided regular radiation protection training for radiation workers. 
The course, which was compulsory for those wishing to apply for or renew their licence, 
covered general aspects of ionizing radiation, physical dosimetry, the biological impact of 
radiation, protection measures, and the regulations in force. The Commission also carried out 
regular inspections to ensure compliance by ionizing radiation users with all the legal 
requirements including the checking of licences, authorizations for the import and export of 
radioactive material, personal physical dosimetry, radiation protection measures, source 
registration, incident recording, and calibration certificates. Sanctions for non-compliance 
were imposed by the Special Judge for Radiation Safety who was at the same time the 
Executive Director of the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission, and that work was given 
the necessary priority. To improve national regulatory control and infrastructure, the 
Commission had asked the Agency to include Ecuador in the relevant regional Model Project 
(RLA/9/041). 
32. In the field of the physical protection of radiation sources Ecuador was, through its 
annual planned inspections, monitoring such aspects as: the inventory of radiation sources, 
the physical security of facilities (storage and operational), practical and written procedures 
for work with ionizing radiation, the keeping of radiological records, and radiation monitoring 
of operational and storage facilities. Provided all the requirements were met, the Commission 
issued operating licences for work with radiation sources. 
33. EcuadorÂs current regulations made no specific provisions for the safe transport of 
radioactive material. However, the Commission was applying the AgencyÂs recommendations 
as contained in its Safety Standards Series No. ST-I. The Commission granted users 
authorizations for the long-distance transport of radiation sources and provided its own 
technicians for radiation surveillance as required. 
34. His Government was grateful to the Agency for its indispensable technical assistance. 
The Commission was carrying out several technical co-operation projects dealing with nuclear 
medicine, pesticide monitoring, and was receiving assistance in the training of human 
resources. It was also participating in an important binational project (RLA/6/047) aimed at 
strengthening the nuclear medicine services in the border region of Ecuador and Peru and it 
was an active participant in multinational projects under ARCAL. 
35. Mr. NEVES FERREIRA (Portugal), stressing the importance of the 2000 NPT 
Review Conference with regard to nuclear disarmament, strengthening the verification regime 
and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, said he hoped that the disturbing events in the United 
States of America on 11 September 2001 would not jeopardize the international communityÂs 
progress towards a safe international security system. 
36. The Agency was the only competent authority responsible for verifying and assuring 
compliance by its members of their non-proliferation commitments under Article III of the 
NPT. The importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards system had been underlined in the final 
document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Portugal fully supported the AgencyÂs 
endeavours to strengthen that system, including implementation of the additional protocol, 
which was a basic step towards establishing a credible integrated safeguards system. The gaps 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 11 

in that system which had prompted unfavourable and sometimes unfair criticism in the past 
needed to be filled. Portugal had already ratified an additional protocol and urged other 
Member States to prove their genuine commitment to non-proliferation by doing the same. In 
addition, that instrument would bring administrative, financial and technical benefits to the 
Agency. 

37. Although Portugal had rejected the option of nuclear power generation in the 1980s for 
political and economic reasons, it was open to debate on the future of nuclear power and other 
alternative forms of energy. In that regard, it welcomed the European CommissionÂs Green 
Paper on the European strategy for the security of energy supply. Technological innovation 
aimed at new proliferation-resistant and economically competitive reactor types and fuel cycle 
designs would be a focal point in such discussions and there was a clear case for considering 
nuclear energy both as an environmentally clean and also the cheapest alternative for 
mitigating the greenhouse effect. Neither the developing nor the industrialized countries 
could rule out nuclear power despite public disapproval. 
38. Turning to nuclear safety, he emphasized the importance his country attached to the 
transport of radioactive materials and waste safety. Portugal, which had one research reactor 
and made every effort to abide by the relevant international safety standards, welcomed the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the safety arrangements for research reactors. As the 
Chernobyl accident had shown, nuclear accidents knew no boundaries. The international 
community was placing increasing value on nuclear safety and international co-operation in 
the field of nuclear radiation protection. Enhanced safety was essential to eradicate fears 
about nuclear power. Portugal therefore welcomed all the AgencyÂs endeavours to create a 
world safety regime by means of international conventions, international safety standards and 
measures to help Member States implement them. 
39. Portugal was grateful for the benefits it derived from the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programme. Compared with previous years, the programme was more efficient 
and there had been improvements in project selection and evaluation. 
40. In conclusion, he said that the quality of the AgencyÂs work was the best assurance for 
support from Member States in facing the challenges that lay ahead. 
Mr. Borchard (Germany) took the Chair. 

41. Mr. BIMO (Albania) considered the barbaric terrorist attacks on the United States 
of America an attack on everyone and expressed his condolences to the United States 
Government and the victimsÂ families. 
42. Albania had been participating in national and regional projects under the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme for several years, benefiting from the provision of training, 
technical expertise and equipment in such fields as public health, water resources, radiation 
safety and new technologies. Examples of assistance were the establishment of a 
pharmaceuticals laboratory, the national project on the use of artificial tracers to study the 
hydrogeological region of Mali me Gropa, and the regional project being implemented by 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 12 

Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to study the Prespa Lake 
using nuclear and related techniques. Albania welcomed opportunities to co-operate in the 
framework of TCDC, one of the AgencyÂs most recent initiatives. Together with Agency 
experts, Albania had prepared a CPF the previous year. 

43. With a view to further adherence to conventions and agreements under Agency 
auspices, the Albanian authorities had prepared a legal package to be adopted soon which 
included the Notification Convention, the Assistance Convention and the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and intended to sign an additional protocol to its 
comprehensive safeguards agreement. 
44. In the field of radiation safety, AlbaniaÂs regulatory authority, the Radiation Protection 
Commission, had been making significant progress towards setting up radiation protection 
structures pursuant to the law on ionizing radiation protection, which was in line with the 
BSS. It was clear, however, that the Commission needed greater independence. Two national 
training courses in radiology and radiotherapy had been organized in recent years in 
co-operation with the Agency and it was hoped to hold a regional training course in the future. 
A radioactive waste management laboratory, due to be equipped within the framework of a 
future project with the Agency, had been constructed at the Institute of Nuclear Physics. 
45. Albania was co-operating with the Agency in setting up a radioactivity monitoring 
network and emergency centre to strengthen regional preparedness for nuclear and 
radiological emergencies. The use of depleted uranium bombs in the Kosovo conflict had 
raised concerns in the region. However, air, soil and plant measurements conducted by 
Albanian experts had shown radiation to be below the permissible levels. 
46. Turning to the physical protection of nuclear material, he said that while Albania had 
already created monitoring units at some customs points, a national monitoring network 
needed to be set up in co-operation with neighbouring countries to combat illicit trafficking in 
nuclear and radioactive materials successfully. 
47. AlbaniaÂs transition to a democracy and a market economy was taking place in a 
complex environment and even the institutions co-operating directly with the Agency were 
subject to continual reform. None the less, it was the will of the Albanian authorities to 
ensure continued successful co-operation and thus, despite budgetary constraints, Albania had 
paid all of its Regular Budget arrears and its contribution for 2000. It was also considering 
participating in the voluntary contributions to the TCF as soon as conditions permitted. 
48. Mr. EGLAJS (Latvia) denounced the 11 September attacks on the United States of 
America and expressed heartfelt condolences to the American people and to the families of 
the victims. 
49. Latvia had made significant progress in nuclear safety over the year, passing a new 
framework law aimed at improving its regulatory infrastructure and defining all the 
obligations for users of atomic energy. It had established a new independent regulatory 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 13 

authority, the Radiation Safety Centre, in July with the help of neighbouring countries, 
especially Sweden and Denmark. 

50. In the field of technical co-operation, Latvia had finalized its CPF during the AgencyÂs 
mission in July 2001. Its main purpose was to identify and agree on the priority areas for 
technical co-operation. In line with the agreed CPF, LatviaÂs medium-term focus was on 
developing and enhancing the safety of the medical applications of radiation sources. One 
example was the use of positron emission tomography for the timely detection of cancer. In 
view of the projectÂs complexity and scale, Latvia would welcome both financial assistance 
and expert advice from other countries. As in the past, Latvia had pledged in full its 
contribution to the TCF target and was interested in investigating the possibilities of cost 
sharing and additional voluntary contributions. 
51. Latvia welcomed the Russian FederationÂs decision to manage spent fuel in a way 
similar to the United States by taking back strategic material from research establishments, 
particularly as work was well under way to decommission its research reactor. 
52. Latvia, which attached a high priority to non-proliferation, supported the resolutions of 
the International Conference on the Security of Material hosted by Sweden in May 2001. 
Combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material was an important area for 
co-operation as it affected both developing and developed countries. Latvia was grateful for 
the assistance it had received in strengthening its border control system, particularly from 
Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United States. In that and other nuclear-related areas, 
Latvia was willing to do what it could to support international co-operation through bilateral 
and multilateral activities. 
53. Ms. SUVD (Mongolia) expressed her deep sympathy and condolences to the 
people and Government of the United States of America following the tragic event that had 
cost thousands of innocent lives. 
54. Regarding the Annual Report for 2000, her delegation appreciated the work being done 
by Agency and its Secretariat to enhance global nuclear safety and radiation protection, to 
verify compliance with the NPT, and to assist Member States in improving their capabilities 
in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
55. As a State Party to the NPT and having declared its territory as a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, Mongolia attached great importance to all international instruments aimed at nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation and believed that those issues should retain their high 
priority on the international agenda. Also, practical steps should be taken to implement the 
commitments undertaken at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. Additional protocols to 
Agency safeguards agreements were a welcome means of strengthening the verification 
regime. Her country was about to sign and ratify such a protocol. The joint statement made 
by the five nuclear-weapon States in 2000 providing Mongolia with assurances in connection 
with its nuclear-weapon-free status was an important step towards institutionalizing that status 
at the international level. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 14 

56. In July 2001, the Mongolian parliament had adopted a law on radiation protection and 
safety as part of its efforts to upgrade the relevant national infrastructure with a view to 
meeting the BSS requirements. It looked forward to further co-operation in that regard with 
the Agency. 
57. As a developing country, Mongolia was pleased that the Agency had improved the 
efficiency of its technical co-operation programme paying closer attention to the socioeconomic 
needs of the recipient country. Her delegation appreciated the end-user oriented 
approach in designing, selecting and implementing projects within both the CPF and regional 
co-operation programmes. Mongolia supported extension of the 1987 RCA for another five 
years and considered that the establishment of an RCA regional office would facilitate 
co-ordination and improve the quality of vital regional and sub-regional projects. It was in 
favour of an increasing TCDC role for the Agency and supported its efforts to forge closer 
partnerships with other international and regional organizations and donor countries to 
enhance the impact of its projects. Aware of the need for all Member States to fulfil their 
commitments under the Statute for the Agency to function successfully, Mongolia would 
make every effort to pay its amount of the TCF target for voluntary contributions in full. 
58. Finally, she said that Mongolia supported the creation of a comprehensive and legally 
binding safety regime and was considering the possibility of acceding to some relevant 
conventions. 
59. Mr. HOGBE NLEND (Cameroon) offered condolences to the United States 
delegation on the terrible loss of human life following the 11 September terrorist attacks in 
New York and Washington. 
60. The Annual Report for 2000 highlighted the AgencyÂs active role as a promoter of 
development through nuclear applications in domains ranging from agriculture to the 
environment. Cameroon welcomed the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and was 
satisfied with the SecretariatÂs efforts to improve that programme in the interests of Member 
States. 
61. He reaffirmed CameroonÂs full commitment to the AgencyÂs objectives and said it 
would make every effort to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology and to strengthen 
the non-proliferation regime. Cameroon welcomed the international communityÂs growing 
interest in peace, security, development, eradication of poverty and environmental protection. 
The Agency should play an increasingly important role in those fields, which had been given 
high priority in the United Nations Millennium Declaration. 
62. Cameroon was pleased with the agreement concluded with the OAU to carry out joint 
activities to eradicate the tsetse fly by means of the SIT. At the 36th and 37th OAU summits, 
the Assembly of Heads of State and Government had reaffirmed the priority of that goal, a 
major factor in reducing poverty and improving socio-economic development in Africa. 
63. Likewise, his Government was satisfied with the initiatives taken by the Secretariat 
pursuant to resolution GC(44)/RES/24 entitled ÂServicing immediate human needsÂ, 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 15 

particularly the introduction of a regional technical co-operation programme aimed at 
developing and assessing the SIT as a means of eradicating mosquitoes which carried malaria. 
He appealed to all States to provide support. 

64. His country had benefited from technical co-operation in the fields of human health, 
animal productivity and health, NDT, nuclear science and applications, and radiation 
protection, radiation and waste safety. He drew particular attention to the AgencyÂs 
considerable contribution to national development by transferring nuclear NDT technology 
enabling Cameroon to acquire expertise in quality control and inspection of the Chad-
Cameroon oil pipeline. Numerous fellowships had been granted for training within the 
framework of national and regional technical co-operation projects and a recent mission had 
assessed how that increased knowledge and expertise could be used to improve development 
in Cameroon. Also, Cameroon was firmly committed to establishing a legal and regulatory 
framework for radiation protection and safety as soon as possible. 
65. Like many other African countries, Cameroon was suffering from a severe deficit of 
renewable water resources in some regions. According to the World Bank, per capita 
renewable water resources would be halved by 2025. The situation was being exacerbated by 
pollution and desertification and, before long, Cameroon would be facing drinking water 
shortages. In addition, Lake Chad was drying out, jeopardizing all the socio-economic 
activities of the region. For that reason, Cameroon attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
water resources management activities. 
66. He welcomed the new regional programme on combating desertification (RAF/5/048) 
and hoped that it could be extended to include many other countries, including Cameroon, and 
that it would receive ample human and material resources. 
67. Cameroon had made the necessary arrangements to contribute to the TCF for 2002 and 
to pay off all of its APC arrears. 
68. In future, the Agency should increase its efforts to prevent the risk of radiation damage 
to the environment and to rehabilitate contaminated sites. His delegation hoped that the 
Agency would help find solutions to seismic risk management that could be applied to 
existing problems at Mount Cameroon and Lake Nyos. Also, the Agency should consider 
how isotope techniques could help combat the AIDS virus. Finally, the Agency should ensure 
that its technical assistance had the greatest impact by careful selection of projects and 
directing resources to priority national development programmes. 
Mr. GrÃ¶nberg (Finland) resumed the Chair. 

69. Mr. HÃGBERG (Sweden) expressed his delegationÂs sincere sympathy to the 
families of the victims of the recent horrific terrorist attacks on the United States of America. 
Those cowardly and deplorable attacks emphasized the great importance of the AgencyÂs 
continued efforts to prevent the terrorist abuse of nuclear technology. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 16 

70. Among the positive outcomes of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, his Government 
welcomed the acknowledgement of the need to apply increased transparency and 
irreversibility to all nuclear disarmament measures and to develop new verification 
capabilities for a nuclear-weapon-free world. The challenges facing the Agency in its 
verification tasks would require tremendous efforts by the Secretariat and also sufficient 
resources. With a view to making resources available, an analysis must be made of existing 
programmes to assess their viability, relevance and expected impact. Moreover, a more longterm 
view of where the Agency should be heading would need to be taken. As effective 
verification measures remained a chief concern for the Swedish Government, it would 
continue to support the development of more powerful tools for such treaties as the NPT, 
CTBT and FMCT, as well as Agency work in that field. 
71. When implemented, the additional protocol to the AgencyÂs safeguards agreement 
would have a very positive effect on international non-proliferation, helping to build the 
confidence that all States were complying with their commitments. Sweden had ratified the 
relevant protocol, which would enter into force once the few remaining EU countries followed 
suit. He called on all States to conclude additional protocols with the Agency, all States Party 
to the NPT to conclude their mandatory safeguards agreements immediately and all States that 
had not yet done so to accede to the NPT. 
72. Regrettably, many of the non-proliferation regimeÂs problems from the previous year 
were still present. Until the DPRK complied fully with its non-proliferation commitments, 
there would be no real progress towards lasting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. 
IraqÂs continuing refusal to implement the relevant UNSC resolutions was unacceptable and 
prevented progress towards the shared goal of a Middle East free of nuclear and other 
weapons of mass-destruction and their delivery vehicles. Although nuclear testing should be a 
thing of the past, the CTBT was still far from entering into force. His Government hoped that 
the forthcoming entry-into-force conference would yield much needed positive results. 
73. The irreversible disposal of material usable for weapons was another challenge the 
world community would have to address in the near future and one where the Agency would 
undoubtedly play a vital role, inter alia, under the Trilateral Initiative. Also, the ratification of 
a treaty banning the production of nuclear weapons material would hopefully soon be 
negotiated. 
74. Sweden strongly supported the AgencyÂs role in the fight against illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material and radioactive sources. The International Conference on the Security of 
Material held in Stockholm in May had offered an opportunity for experts in all the relevant 
fields to get together and consider ways ahead. Sweden endorsed the action plan developed 
by the Secretariat following that conference and looked forward to its timely implementation. 
75. Effective national systems for the physical protection of nuclear material were essential 
to prevent its diversion. Sweden welcomed the BoardÂs endorsement of the new ÂSecurity 
FundamentalsÂ document entitled ÂPhysical Protection Objectives and Fundamental 
PrinciplesÂ. It also looked forward to further work on possible strengthening of the 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 17 

Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and called on all States which had 
not already done so to accede to that Convention. 

76. His country was looking forward to the first review meeting under the Joint Convention 
and welcomed the report on the safety of radioactive waste management contained in 
document GC(45)/14. It attached particular importance to Action 3 therein, namely the 
development of internationally endorsed quality criteria for the geological disposal of spent 
fuel and high-level waste, and to Action 7, the development of a programme to foster 
international information exchange on the most effective ways of interacting with 
stakeholders as an essential part of the decision-making process in radioactive waste 
management. SwedenÂs own experience clearly showed that societal aspects were as 
important as technical capability when planning, siting, licensing and building waste disposal 
facilities. 
77. His delegation hoped that the second review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety in April 2002 would provide further evidence of that ConventionÂs effectiveness in 
promoting a high level of safety worldwide. It urged all Member States to accede to that -and 
to the Joint Convention -as soon as possible and to join Sweden in applying the Nuclear 
Safety Convention voluntarily to their research reactors. The AgencyÂs safety standards 
programme and the review services it provided were crucial contributions to the safety 
regime. 
78. The Swedish Government was among those that did not include nuclear fission 
technology as an eligible option for a long-term, sustainable energy supply. In view of the 
decision to exclude nuclear power from the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto 
Protocol, some of the AgencyÂs Major Programme 1 activities and related technical 
co-operation projects should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the AgencyÂs approach to the 
use of nuclear power technology in the context of long-term sustainable development was 
well-balanced. 
79. Finally, he announced that Sweden had pledged its full amount of the share of the target 
for voluntary contributions to the TCF for 2002 and urged all States to pledge and pay their 
assessed shares in full and on time. 
ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
(GC(45)/6 and 29) 

80. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a 
procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a 
particular area, no secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas 
where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the 
rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the 
Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, which provided that elections to the Board 
should be by secret ballot, be suspended in respect of those areas for which there was 
agreement. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 18 

81. He was happy to report that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their 
candidates for the vacancies to be filled. 
82. Drawing attention to document GC(45)/6, containing a list of the Agency Member 
States which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the 
ConferenceÂs present session until the end of the 46th (2002) regular session, he recalled that, 
under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the 
elective places on the Board which had to be filled. To that end, document GC(45)/29 had 
been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to elect eleven Members to the Board from 
the seven categories listed. 
83. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Chile and Colombia to the two 
vacant seats for Latin America. 
84. Chile and Colombia were duly elected. 
85. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Spain and 
Turkey to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
86. Spain and Turkey were duly elected. 
87. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Bulgaria and 
Romania to the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
88. Bulgaria and Romania were duly elected. 
89. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Burkino 
Faso and Morocco to the two vacant seats for Africa. 
90. Burkino Faso and Morocco were duly elected. 
91. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to the vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
92. The Islamic Republic of Iran was duly elected. 
93. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the 
Philippines to the vacant seat for the Far East. 
94. The Philippines was duly elected. 
95. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Kuwait to 
the floating seat for MESA/SEAP/Far East, which it was the turn of a member from MESA to 
fill. 
96. Kuwait was duly elected.

GENERAL DEBATE AND THE ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2000 (resumed) 
(GC(45)/4) 

97. Mr. FIGUEREIDO (Angola) expressed solidarity with and offered condolences to 
the people and Government of the United States of America over the tragedy which had taken 
place on 11 September. 
98. The peoples of the world were becoming increasingly interdependent and the survival of 
all species depended on maintaining global life support systems. A responsible attitude 
towards science was essential in meeting human needs, and efficient co-operation in the fields 
of natural and social sciences and engineering was desirable. Technological development and 
the use of new energy sources had eased manÂs burden and had made a broad range of 
industrial products and processes available. The AgencyÂs activities in promoting and 
disseminating information on the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology were vital 
for the North-South transfer of that technology and sustainable development. 
99. His Government attached great importance to Agency technical co-operation, from 
which it had benefited since becoming a Member State in 1999. In particular, it was grateful 
for the AgencyÂs continuing Model Project (RAF/9/1027) to strengthen the radiation safety 
infrastructure of participating countries. It had received five Agency missions under projects 
which aimed to establish a radiation protection infrastructure, control the regulatory system, 
and install a laboratory for teaching nuclear physics. Also, Angolan professionals had had the 
opportunity to participate in nine training courses, six seminars and two scientific visits, 
organized in co-operation with Member States. 
100. Angola had considerable natural resources, including oil, diamonds, solar and 
hydropower, and radioactive minerals had been found in several locations. In that connection, 
he underlined his countryÂs commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and 
non-proliferation. 
101. Despite the great difficulties it was facing, Angola had met its financial obligations visÃ -
vis the Agency in full. He reiterated his countryÂs support for AFRA in the areas of 
radiation protection, human health, agriculture, and industrial radiation. Finally, Angola 
endorsed the resolutions put forward by the African group aimed at SIT eradication of the 
tsetse fly and the malaria mosquito, and the diseases they transmitted in the sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
102. Mr. NGÂWANDU (United Republic of Tanzania) extended condolences to the 
United States of America and to the victims of the tragic terrorist attack of 11 September. 
Tanzania - like Kenya - had suffered similar acts of terrorism in August 1998 and fully 
endorsed global efforts to curb international terrorism. 
103. He thanked the Agency for the urgently needed technical assistance it continued to 
provide to Tanzania and other LDCs, especially in Africa. Results included eradication of the 
tsetse fly on Zanzibar and subsequent initiatives to improve agriculture and livestock in the 
tsetse free areas. On Unguja Island the calf mortality rate had been reduced to less than 20% 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 20 

while milk yields had increased from an average of 7 to 11.2 litre/cow/day since 1998. Tsetse 
eradication was continuing with great success on Mafia Island and in northern Tanzania. His 
country expected to take a leading role in tsetse eradication work and was making efforts to 
maintain the tsetse eradication infrastructure for its own and AfricaÂs benefit. 

104. Another area where assistance had brought tangible results to Tanzania was nuclear 
medicine and radiation therapy. The services offered by the Ocean Road Cancer Institute, 
which currently served more than 12 000 radiotherapy patients and 4000 nuclear medicine 
patients a year had been greatly improved. 
105. Tanzania urged the Secretariat to examine ways of further maximizing the contribution 
of Agency technical assistance to sustainable development. The current focus on Model 
Projects, regional co-operation, including support for AFRA, and on the promotion of the 
transfer of technology through the TCDC was the right way forward. 
106. Unfortunately, contributions to the TCF had levelled off at a time when the demand for 
it was growing rapidly, especially in Africa. He therefore appealed to all Member States to 
contribute to the TCF in a timely manner and settle their obligations. 
107. The United Republic of Tanzania was following developments in the nuclear power 
field with interest and welcomed the recent initiatives for R&D, particularly the development 
of new reactor designs that would be economic, safe, proliferation-resistant and that would 
minimize nuclear waste production. Tanzania subscribed to the view that nuclear energy had 
to be part of the global energy mix. However, concerns about safety and cost competitiveness 
needed to be addressed. 
108. TanzaniaÂs radiation protection law was undergoing revision to ensure a healthy 
environment and the safe utilization of nuclear energy. Nuclear technology and, in particular 
the nuclear power option had a pivotal role to play in economic and social development and 
LDCs needed assistance to ensure the safe operation of nuclear reactors. The advanced 
countries seemed to be concerned that the promotion of nuclear power reactors would increase 
the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. For LDCs which saw the nuclear option as their 
only viable alternative, maximum co-operation and transparency were required to spread the 
benefits of the technology and avoid serious technological mistakes. 
109. Mr. ZAMBEZI (Zambia) expressed condolences to the United States over the loss 
of thousands of lives during the inhuman terrorist attacks of 11 September. The Zambian 
people had been deeply moved by the tragedy. 
110. His delegation would continue to monitor with great interest the measures being taken 
by the Secretariat to strengthen the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, which it 
considered very important for developing Member States. 
111. Progress in the areas of radiation protection and radioactive waste management was 
essential for building public confidence in applications of nuclear science and technology. 
The Zambian authorities, drawing on Agency standards documents, were continuing to hold 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 21 

workshops designed to raise the awareness of people working in industry and also the general 
public of radiation protection and radioactive waste management issues. 

112. Zambia was continuing to make progress in the use of the infrastructure which had been 
set up through technical co-operation with the Agency. For example, gamma radiationsterilized 
tissue grafts for the treatment of burns were being applied to patients at ZambiaÂs 
University Teaching Hospital, and there were plans for carrying out clinical trials with such 
tissue grafts at other hospitals. Also, ZambiaÂs plant tissue culture facility was continuing to 
be a major supplier of virus-resistant seed potatoes to farmers. 
113. Zambia was taking stock of its research products with a view to identifying those which 
could be commercialized - in line with his GovernmentÂs policy of encouraging publicly 
funded research institutions to take such steps. 
114. His country was grateful to the Agency for providing equipment for monitoring 
occupational exposures to heavy metals and natural radionuclides in the metallurgical and 
mining industries. Although ZambiaÂs mines were now in private hands, the occupational 
health of miners was the responsibility of the Government and it was therefore making 
arrangements for the start of the underground and surface measurement of industrial aerosols. 
115. Currently there were 12 AFRA projects being implemented at Zambian research 
institutions, and Zambia intended to participate in research aimed at controlling mosquito 
populations through use of the SIT. A number of Zambian professionals had received training 
or participated in workshops and seminars organized through AFRA during 2001. His 
delegation would like to see all co-operating partners continuing to support AFRA. 
116. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his delegation was still deeply shocked by the 
terrible loss of life caused by the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States of 
America. On behalf of the people and Government of Israel, he expressed condolences and 
solidarity with the American people and leaders. Human tragedy of such dimensions should 
have a sobering effect and cause paradigm shifts at both the political and the individual level. 
117. The time had come to return to basics and devote all efforts to the goals of the Agency 
in accordance with its Statute. The most effective way of achieving those goals was to move 
away from politicization and to seek better understanding and co-operation through 
moderation and restraint. The General ConferenceÂs tradition of trying to arrive at decisions 
by consensus was highly commendable; indeed, it was the only way of dealing constructively 
with complicated issues. 
118. While regretting the fact that several delegations chose to abide by old habits and to defy 
the spirit of consensus despite recent events, Israel itself could not display the spirit of 
consensus necessary under one agenda item and at the same time submit to attempts at 
political harassment under another. 
119. The agenda included important items relating to grave non-compliance with 
international undertakings. In that connection, his delegation believed that strengthening 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 22 

safeguards required more resources and the fostering of a Âno trustÂ culture. Recent events 
should galvanize all relevant international bodies into fighting terrorism in all its aspects, and 
the agenda items dealing with the physical protection of and combating illicit trafficking in 
nuclear materials were very important in that regard. 

120. The deliberations and resolutions of the General Conference should sustain the 
reputation of the Agency as a technical organization with high professional credibility. In that 
connection, the Director General and the Secretariat were to be commended for continuing the 
Scientific Forum tradition and for their latest choice of theme: ÂServing Human Needs: 
Nuclear Technology for Sustainable DevelopmentÂ. All attempts to impair the AgencyÂs 
professional competence and its impartiality should be resisted and it should be shielded from 
the debilitating effects of politicization. Political initiatives and energies should be channelled 
into further regional co-operation in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
121. Regional technical co-operation projects aimed at solving common problems 
contributed both to improving the quality of life in the regions concerned and to building the 
confidence necessary for reconciliation between nations. An excellent example was a regional 
project for eradicating the Mediterranean fruit fly by means of the SIT, the success of which, 
his delegation hoped, would lead to further useful collaboration. 
122. As in the past, Israel was looking forward to working with the Director General and the 
Secretariat on regional and international co-operation in the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy, a domain where the Agency had both the necessary technical competence and an 
impressive track record. That was the way to move ahead -building on the AgencyÂs 
strengths in order to promote co-operation, stability and prosperity in those regions which had 
so far not been fortunate enough to benefit from them. 
123. It was his countryÂs hope that reason and moderation would prevail in the General 
Conference and elsewhere and that true reconciliation, mutual security, regional co-operation 
and economic growth would overcome old fears, animosities and suspicions. 
124. Mr. FEU ALVIM (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials) expressed horror at the loss of innocent lives which had occurred the 
previous week in the United States of America. Humanity must find a way to control and, if 
possible, banish the threat of terrorism in the world. 
125. The bilateral agreement between Brazil and Argentina for the exclusively peaceful use 
of nuclear energy was now ten years old. Thus ABACC, which had been created by that 
agreement and which had an impressive record of effective implementation of comprehensive 
safeguards to all nuclear materials and nuclear facilities in both countries, would be ten years 
old before the General ConferenceÂs next session. Moreover, December 2001 would see the 
tenth anniversary of the signing of the Quadripartite Agreement, which had been in force 
since 1994. The elimination of each countryÂs suspicions about the nuclear programme of the 
other had facilitated the establishment of MERCOSUR, in which Paraguay and Uruguay were 
also participating. 

GC(45)/OR.7 
page 23 

126. Argentina and Brazil were complying with the Quadripartite Agreement, the Tlatelolco 
Treaty and the NPT, and they had acceded to all agreements aimed at eliminating weapons of 
mass destruction. Although regional disagreements often triggered worldwide conflicts, the 
silent construction of peace at the regional level often went unnoticed at the international 
level. The remarkable achievements in the relations between Argentina and Brazil and other 
countries in that part of the world deserved greater international recognition and appreciation. 
127. ABACC, which was part of a set of integration mechanisms that had in a few years 
produced a fourfold increase in trade between Argentina and Brazil, welcomed the recent 
creation of the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Nuclear Energy Applications (ABAEN) for the 
purpose of increasing technical co-operation in the nuclear field between the two countries. 
128. In recent years, ABACC had been applying safeguards to all 67 nuclear facilities and 
other locations and to all nuclear materials in Brazil and Argentina, drawing on the services of 
66 inspectors, 39 technical consultants and 14 laboratories in both countries. That involved 
each year about 400 inspector-days in the field plus 350 inspector-days for post-and 
pre-inspection activities. 
129. The financial support received by ABACC each year amounted to about $3 million from 
the two countries, despite the economic crises which they had been experiencing as 
developing countries. It was investing each year about $250 000 in equipment, in order to be 
independent as regards NDT and C/S. Its equipment was being increasingly shared with the 
Agency, due account being taken of the need for each organization to draw independent 
conclusions. 
130. Besides sharing equipment, ABACC and the Agency were working together on the 
co-ordination of inspection activities, on the development and improvement of safeguards 
approaches and techniques, and on the utilization of modern communication techniques. 
131. ABACC and the other parties to the Quadripartite Agreement had been participating in 
informal discussions with a view to the signing of an additional protocol under which its 
present role would be maintained. 
132. ABACC was co-operating not only with the Agency, but also with EURATOM and 
OPANAL and with safeguards organizations in France, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the 
United States of America. The experience of ABACC as a regional safeguards organization 
had been analysed with a view to its being applied in other parts of the world. 
The meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.

RESTORATION OF IRAQÂS VOTING RIGHTS 

1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that IraqÂs 
voting rights not be restored because, in the CommitteeÂs opinion, IraqÂs failure to pay the 
amount necessary in order to avoid the application of Article XIX of the Statute had not been 
due to conditions beyond its control. Some delegations had expressed reservations regarding 
that recommendation. 
2. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) pointed out that, since the AgencyÂs establishment 
in 1957, his country had consistently supported all its activities and had always met its 
financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the organization. However, since August 1990, when the cruel 
sanctions had been imposed on Iraq and its assets in international banks had been frozen 
pursuant to the unjust resolutions of the Security Council, it had been unable to transfer any 
amounts in hard currency to pay its contributions to the United Nations and other international 
organizations, including the Agency. Those sanctions were still in force and constituted 
conditions beyond his countryÂs control which prevented it from meeting its financial 
obligations to the Agency. As the Director of the AgencyÂs Division of Budget and Finance 
had confirmed in a letter dated 16 February 2001, under Article XIX.A of the Statute the 
General Conference could permit a member of the Agency in arrears with its financial 
contribution to vote, if it was satisfied that the failure to pay was due to conditions beyond its 
control. 
3. Since its right to vote had been suspended, Iraq had repeatedly requested the Agency 
and the General Conference to restore that right. The real causes preventing it from 
discharging its financial obligations to the Agency and other international organizations, 
i.e. the sanctions, had been clearly stated in the Iraqi Foreign MinisterÂs letters of 
2 September 1999 and 30 March 2000 to the Director General, and at the forty-third regular 
session of the General Conference. As the aforementioned letters made clear, Iraq met the 
conditions stipulated in the criteria and guidelines for the restoration of voting rights adopted 
by the General Conference at its forty-second regular session in resolution GC(42)/RES/4. 
4. The United States, the United Kingdom and some of their allies were attempting to 
place obstacles in the way of the restoration of IraqÂs voting rights for political reasons. He 
hoped that his countryÂs request would be approved and that the General Conference would 
treat the matter in an objective and neutral manner, avoiding the application of double 
standards. 
5. Mr. DEDUSHKIN (Russian Federation) said that his country supported IraqÂs 
request for the restoration of its voting rights, which met the criteria adopted at the 
forty-second regular session of the General Conference. Iraq was willing to pay its 
contributions to international organizations but was prevented from doing so by circumstances 
beyond its control, namely the maintenance of the sanctions against it. 
6. The Russian Federation was in favour of the full implementation of all relevant Security 
Council resolutions on Iraq, and felt that that objective could be achieved by restoring 
international monitoring in Iraq while at the same time relaxing or lifting sanctions. 

GC(45)/OR.8 
page 4 

7. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India), supported by Mr. DEDUSHKIN (Russian 
Federation) said that, since the General CommitteeÂs recommendation had only been issued 
that day, discussion of it should be postponed to the following day, in line with the Rules of 
Procedure of the General Conference 
8. It was so decided. 
EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS 

9. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met earlier in the day to 
examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. 
The report of the Committee was contained in document GC(45)/32 and Corr.1. After 
discussion, the Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft 
resolution contained in paragraph 8 of its report, with the reservations and position expressed 
in the report. Since the Committee had met, he had been informed that credentials in proper 
form had been received from 95 Member States, and documents that did not constitute formal 
credentials from 26 Member States. 
10. He took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 8 of document GC(45)/32. 
11. It was so decided. 
The meeting rose at 3.50 p.m.

REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC FORUM 

1. The PRESIDENT invited the Rapporteur, Mr. Kabayo, to present the report of the 
Scientific Forum. 
2. Mr. Kabayo presented the report which is reproduced in the Annex. 
3. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Kabayo for his most interesting report and the 
Secretariat for their excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum 
4. Mr. BUTT (Pakistan) said that his delegation had been looking forward to 
the 2001 Scientific Forum in view of the relevance of its theme to the developing countries. 
He commended the Secretariat and the Department of Technical Co-operation for organizing 
such a high-level scientific debate, which he felt had been the best since the inception of the 
Scientific Forum. 
5. Mr. ARAMRATTANA (Thailand) congratulated the Secretariat and the 
Department of Technical Co-operation on the theme they had chosen for the Scientific Forum 
and the successful outcome thereof. The Forum had addressed key development issues. The 
Secretariat should continue to organize such events in future, and should consider organizing 
a similar scientific forum at regional level. 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NPT SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
AGENCY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLEÂS REPUBLIC OF KOREA 
(GC(45)/26, GC(45)/L.3/Rev.1 and Add.1 and 2) 

6. Mr. MORGAN (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(45)/L.3/Rev.1, said that the resolution urged the DPRK to comply fully with its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency, and to respond positively and promptly to the proposal 
put forward by the Agency at the technical discussions held in May 2001 for the verification 
of the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs initial declaration. Despite the overall 
lack of progress, there had been some encouraging developments both in the broader context 
of the region, and with regard to the participation by the DPRK in recent Agency events. That 
pointed to a constructive, albeit slow move in the right direction, giving reason to hope that 
the DPRK would comply with its obligations under its safeguards agreement in the near 
future. 
7. Mr. KVOK (Russian Federation) said that the draft resolution under discussion 
differed considerably from that adopted by the forty-fourth regular session of the General 
Conference. Despite references to positive developments in the preambular paragraphs, it was 
on the whole harsher in tone. 
8. Moreover, preambular paragraph (i) and operative paragraph 6 referred to the AgencyÂs 
detailed proposal for the first concrete steps needed for the implementation of the generic 
requirements for the verification of the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs initial 
declaration. That proposal had not been officially circulated to Member States, or at least not 

GC(45)/OR.9 
page 4 

to the Russian Federation. When drafting such resolutions, a more objective assessment of 
existing agreements was required. If the resolution was put to the vote, the Russian 
Federation would abstain; it would not, however, block its adoption by consensus. 

9. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China) said that he looked forward to the resolution of the 
DPRK problem as soon as possible. Denuclearization and the restoration of peace and 
stability in the region were clearly in the common good. The main obstacle to finding a 
solution was the inconsistent policy of one Member State towards the DPRK. The basic 
conditions required for improvement of the political situation on the Korean Peninsula, the 
establishment of KEDO, and the implementation of the Agreed Framework were already in 
place. In order not to lose momentum, he encouraged all parties concerned to pursue their 
efforts in a spirit of dialogue and co-operation and, above all, to comply strictly with the 
Agreed Framework. 
10. Mr Sang-duk CHOI (Republic of Korea) said that, despite the AgencyÂs strenuous 
efforts of recent years, no progress had been made with the implementation of the DPRKÂs 
safeguards agreement. That situation posed a major challenge to the safeguards system and to 
the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. His country therefore welcomed the AgencyÂs 
latest proposal regarding verification of the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs 
initial declaration. Since that process was likely to take three to four years, he urged 
the DPRK to respond positively and promptly to it so that work could begin without delay. 
11. The Agreed Framework had played an important role in containing the DPRKÂs nuclear 
programme, and his Government had made every effort to meet its commitments to KEDO 
activities. It would continue to involve itself closely in the building of light-water reactors in 
the DPRK, for which the construction work was proceeding on schedule. It was to be hoped 
that the recent positive developments in the region would pave the way for full 
implementation of the relevant agreements. The draft resolution reflected that hope, and the 
concerns expressed by the Director General and the Board of Governors. He therefore 
proposed it be adopted without a vote. 
12. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(45)/L.3/Rev.1. 
13. It was so decided. 
14. Mr. ZHANG Yishan (China), said that the Chinese GovernmentÂs position 
vis-Ã -vis the problem in the DPRK remained unchanged: it was in favour of the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the maintenance of peace and stability there. 
The problem should be solved through constructive dialogue and co-operation between the 
parties concerned, and through strict observance of the relevant agreements. If the resolution 
had been put to the vote, his delegation would have abstained. 
15. Mr. WULF (United States of America) said that his Government supported the 
AgencyÂs efforts to implement safeguards in the DPRK and to monitor the freeze on the 
latterÂs nuclear facilities pursuant to the Agreed Framework. The Agreed Framework had 

GC(45)/OR.9 
page 5 

provided an additional basis for monitoring of the DPRKÂs known nuclear programme, and 
the continuous presence of IAEA inspectors in the DPRK was essential to preserve its 
credibility. Implementation of the Agreed Framework was proceeding on all fronts in cooperation 
with KEDO partners. Excavation of the power block for the light-water reactor 
project was scheduled to begin shortly. Negotiations on the few remaining protocols 
continued, as did the delivery of heavy fuel oil. Spent fuel from the DPRKÂs frozen reactor 
was stored safely under Agency seals. 

16. The United States continued to attach great importance to close co-operation with Japan 
and the Republic of Korea on DPRK issues. The United States supported the efforts of the 
President of the Republic of Korea to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Following 
President BushÂs announcement in June 2001 of his decision to undertake talks with the 
DPRK, the United States had stated its willingness to hold discussions on a number of 
occasions. 
17. Notwithstanding such political advances, his country was increasingly concerned over 
the continuing lack of progress on outstanding safeguards issues. He urged the DPRK to 
begin co-operating with the Agency on the first concrete steps to verify the correctness and 
completeness of its initial declaration without further delay. Such co-operation was essential 
for the future implementation of the Agreed Framework and the timely completion of the 
light-water reactor project. 
18. Mr. ENDO (Japan) pointed out that the Agency safeguards agreement with the 
DPRK remained in force and binding. As a State party to the NPT, the DPRK had to abide by 
that agreement and comply fully with its obligations. His Government was concerned that the 
Agency had still not been able to verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs 
initial declaration of nuclear material, owing to the DPRKÂs continued refusal to co-operate 
fully with it. Consequently, the Agency was not yet able to give credible assurances that 
undeclared activities had not been carried out in the DPRK. 
19. The provision of key nuclear components to the DPRK for the KEDO light-water 
reactor project was contingent upon that countryÂs full compliance with its safeguards 
agreement. In order to ensure that those components were delivered in good time, the DPRK 
should take steps without delay to improve its relationship with the Agency. In that 
connection, his Government was pleased that the DPRK had decided to dispatch 
representatives to participate in the Agency seminars held in Hanoi and Canberra. He called 
upon the DPRK to normalize its relations with the Agency surely and steadily with a view to 
rejoining the organization in due course. 
20. The AgencyÂs expertise in such areas as nuclear safety had an important role to play in 
ensuring the safe operation of the KEDO light-water reactors. Japan commended the 
SecretariatÂs efforts, in particular the technical consultations it had held with the DPRK in 
May 2001, and the detailed first-step proposal it had presented for verifying the correctness of 
the DPRKÂs initial declaration. He urged the DPRK to make a positive response to that 
proposal as soon as possible.

Report to the forty-fifth General Conference of the IAEA 
from the fourth Scientific Forum 
Nuclear Technology for Sustainable Development: Serving Human Needs 


1. The principal objective of the Scientific Forum was to increase Member StatesÂ 
awareness that technical co-operation in non-power nuclear applications can produce costeffective 
solutions to high-priority problems of sustainable development and create positive 
socio-economic impact. The Forum was well attended and was greatly enriched by the 
participation of eminent experts and an audience that covered a broad range of experience and 
perspectives including development specialists, economists, public information specialists and 
policy makers. 
2. Experts in the field of sustainable development analysed the interconnections between 
science, technology and development. Discussions were held in the context of the need to 
develop mechanisms that will enhance the role of technical co-operation in mobilizing science 
and technology activities in response to the growing challenge of serving human needs in 
Member States in a sustainable manner. Two keynote addresses by internationally prominent 
experts on science and development identified four impediments to the successful transfer of 
technology to, and its utilization by, developing countries. These included (i) the small 
ÂmarketplaceÂ that exists for technological innovations in poor countries; (ii) the difficulties 
of achieving and maintaining in these countries a critical mass of scientists and engineers; (iii) 
the basic ecological differences that often render temperate-zone technology inapplicable to 
the tropics, where most of the worldÂs poor live; and (iv) the disproportionate impact of 
anthropogenic climate change on poor, tropical countries. It is noteworthy that, while the first 
factor is largely beyond the AgencyÂs power to influence, the IAEAÂs technical co-operation 
efforts do address the other three by, first, helping to create and maintain cadres of welltrained 
scientists and engineers through human resource development activities that reach 
more than 4000 persons each year; second, by assisting in the development and transfer of 
technology that focuses on solving poor countriesÂ real problems; and third, by helping to 
keep open the option of energy sources that do not involve greenhouse gas emissions. 
3. The Forum focused on three areas of nuclear applications. Successful cases of 
technology transfer in the application of non-power nuclear technologies for the promotion of 
food security, management of water resources and improving human health, were reviewed by 
specialists in those areas. 
4. The first area of focus was improving food security covering the key roles of isotopes 
and radiation in enhancing food security through overcoming basic ecological constraints on 
agricultural productivity as well as their use in promoting more efficient use of land, water 
and biological resources. 
5. Presentations highlighted the Sterile Insect Technique as a highly successful 
intervention tool against a variety of insect pests and vectors of disease. The use and cost

GC(45)/OR.9 
Annex 
page 2 

benefit attributes of the Sterile Insect Technique as a tool for the control or eradication of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly in different countries were reviewed and their impact assessed. 

6. One of Africa's most serious constraints in agricultural production is trypanosomosis, a 
severe disease affecting human beings and domestic animals, which is transmitted by the 
tsetse fly. The problem of the tsetse fly has, in recent times, reached unprecedented levels 
with increased tsetse fly infestation and record high disease incidence, a situation that has 
been greatly exacerbated by the unavailability of effective or sustainable methods of 
eliminating the tsetse fly vector or treating the disease. IAEA and FAO developed the Sterile 
Insect Technique against tsetse flies and demonstrated its effectiveness in a model project 
conducted in co-operation with the United Republic of Tanzania on the island of Zanzibar. 
This success has fuelled the hopes of affected African countries in the possibility of 
eliminating the scourge of tsetse-transmitted diseases from Africa and led to the adoption of a 
decision by the African Heads of State and Government, urging countries to embark on a Pan 
African Tsetse Eradication Campaign (PATTEC). 
7. Another presentation illustrated the important role of radiation in plant breeding. 
Exposing seeds and other plant tissues to radiation enhances the mutation rate and increases 
the overall genetic variability to create new cultivars. Examples of large economic gains 
resulting from the use of improved mutant cultivars were given. The new advances in 
molecular biology will enhance the role and importance of induced mutations as a tool for 
identifying genes and understanding their function. 
8. The second area of focus was water resource management where the discussion was on 
the role of isotope hydrology in enabling a sustainable management of water resources. The 
earth's limited freshwater resources are under increasing stress from a growing population and 
over one billion people still lack access to safe drinking water. Lack of adequate knowledge of 
the processes governing the hydrological cycle and poor management practices constrain our 
ability to provide sufficient water for sustaining human development. The needs for improved 
hydrological information and integrated approaches to water resource development and 
management were highlighted in this session. One of the presentations focused on the status 
of water resource assessment and development in Ethiopia, where only about 5% of the total 
water resource potential has been exploited so far while significant shortfalls remain in 
fulfilling the domestic and agricultural water demands. The second presentation discussed 
one of the major public health crises of our times resulting from arsenic poisoning of 
groundwater used for drinking in Bangladesh. Over a hundred million people are affected by 
this and there is an urgent need to find alternative sources of safe drinking water for the rural 
population. Both presentations noted the crucial role of isotope applications in developing the 
hydrological knowledge base for management decisions. The panel members for this session 
provided a more in-depth discussion of the critical nature of the water resources and the 
potential benefits of the use of isotope hydrology.

9. The session on improving human health discussed the use of isotopes in a variety of 
areas Â disease diagnosis, human nutrition and cancer treatment. One presentation dealt with 
a programme for neonatal screening for congenital hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria in 
Thailand. Over 1.4 million babies have so far been screened under the programme and it is 
expected that by the year 2002 all newborns will be provided with screening services resulting 
in a better quality life for the next generation. The presentation on radiotherapy for cancer 
treatment outlined the programme in Costa Rica, emphasizing the growing problem of cancer 
in developing countries as a function of improvement in life expectancy of the populations. 
During panel discussion the success story of the establishment of radiotherapy facilities in 
Ghana through technical co-operation with the Agency were highlighted. The critical 
importance of well-trained personnel and a quality control system for ensuring administration 
of effective and safe treatment were emphasized. 
10. Isotopic methods provide sensitive measurements of biological effects and are faster 
than conventional methods for detecting changes in growth and body composition. Aspects of 
micronutrient malnutrition, such as the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals, breast milk 
volume and intake, energy expenditure and balance, etc. are easier to evaluate with isotopic 
than biochemical methods. Stable isotopes have been used, to good effect, to evaluate 
nutritional intervention schemes, such as mineral supplementation programmes, to guide the 
design and optimization of the refinement necessary to correct particular disorders. 
11. A number of generic issues were addressed in the lively panel discussions that included 
active participation from the floor. 
Â· 
There are many nuclear techniques that can be used to address some major agricultural, 
health and climate issues of importance to the socio-economic development of Member 
States Â issues that market forces do not necessarily drive Â but these have not been fully 
exploited. It was recognized that there is a need to get to users Â growers, patients etc. 
The following questions were asked. Which of these techniques are applied? Do current 
procedures actually make this happen? It was recognized that the process of technology 
transfer was not simple; it is a shared responsibility between Member States and the 
Secretariat. It was also acknowledged that some technologies sell themselves while others 
need working through. One important factor for success is to identify clients or customers 
for the technology and make sure that they are talked to. 

Â· 
Government commitment is crucial for successful technology transfer and application. In 
this respect the role of the Country Programme Frameworks (CPFs) that are developed 
jointly by Member States and the Secretariat are crucial. To ensure that CPFs effectively 
serve the purpose they are intended for, ownership must be with Member States. 

Â· 
Comparative technology assessment: It is acknowledged that nuclear technology alone 
may not be able to address certain problems and a package involving both nuclear and 
non-nuclear technologies may be needed. Moreover, the nuclear component of a 
technological package varies in importance. Thus, a comparative technology assessment 


GC(45)/OR.9 
Annex 
page 4 

is always needed before investments are made by Member States. An effective blend of 
nuclear and non-nuclear technologies is one that incorporates the knowledge available on 
the ground and adapts to local conditions. Thus, this assessment should be done by 
Member States themselves and the role of the Agency is to provide advice and information 
to support the assessment and decision-making. A number of factors such as direct and 
indirect benefits, cost, environmental impact, and public opinion need to be considered. 
Successful programmes are often complex because they link all the factors during 
planning and implementation. 

Â· 
The Technical Co-operation Strategy is based on the concept of ÂPartnership in 
DevelopmentÂ. Partnership with other organizations such as FAO, WHO, UNEP and 
NGOs is important because nuclear technology is not a stand-alone technology at problem 
solving level and needs to be part of a package. A number of factors essential for effective 
partnership were discussed. 

Â· 
Related to the issue of partnership is the involvement of the private sector. The private 
sector is needed not only as consumers of the technology but also as a source of funds for 
technology transfer programmes. It was, however, stressed that even under the 
environment of free-market economy the public sector is needed for guaranteeing funding 
and for offsetting private sector losses. 

Â· 
Sustainability and self-reliance are considered essential elements of technical 
co-operation. Sustainability and self-reliance considerations should be built into the 
Country Programme Frameworks and, since the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programmes are implemented through individual projects, the design of each of these 
projects should include relevant elements where applicable. 

Â· 
Human capacity building is central in technology transfer to address developmental 
needs. The Forum noted that the Agency is playing an important role in this area and 
needs to enhance this function. 

Â· 
Public information is crucial for promoting the use of nuclear technology and for 
attracting Government commitment. It is important for the public to understand how 
science and technology works because it is they who will finally determine whether or not 
a certain technology is adopted. 

12. The Forum provided an excellent opportunity not only to highlight the important role 
that non-power nuclear technologies can play in assisting Member States in their efforts to 
meet basic needs Â related to food security, health, water and environment, but also provided 
an opportunity for Member States, the Agency and other partners to discuss how they can 
work together to further enhance sustainable technology transfers.
