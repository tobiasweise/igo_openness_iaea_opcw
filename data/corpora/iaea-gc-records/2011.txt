Â Opening of the session 
1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the 55th regular session of the General 
Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he invited the 
delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 
3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that, at its previous session, the General Conference had 
adopted many forward-looking decisions as a result of constructive consultations among delegates, 
with expert input from the Secretariat. As President of the General Conference during that session, he 
was grateful for the support which he had received, and he had no doubt that the same constructive 
spirit would prevail during the current session. 
4. Since the previous General Conference session, a number of events that would have a great 
impact on the Agency and the international community as a whole had taken place. First and foremost, 
the Fukushima accident had demonstrated how devastating Mother NatureÂs powers could be. The 
accident had been a wake-up call, for there was no guarantee that such a mega-disaster would not be 
repeated. 
5. The Director General and the Secretariat were to be commended for assisting the Government 
of Japan and keeping the AgencyÂs membership abreast of the evolving situation at and around the 
Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. 
6. Despite the accident, the projections of future use of nuclear power remained high, since the 
interest in pursuing the nuclear power option remained high Â especially in nuclear power newcomer 
countries Â owing to the increasing global demand for energy for development and to the 
environmental challenges of climate change. 
7. The Action Plan on Nuclear Safety prepared by the Director General at the request of the 
Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June, which was before the General Conference for 
endorsement, envisaged important measures whose implementation would no doubt help greatly to 
strengthening safety at nuclear facilities worldwide. 
8. Through its activities relating to nuclear science, technology and applications, the Agency was 
doing much to Â inter alia Â help in combating cancer and trypanosomosis and promote the use of 
nuclear techniques in hydrology. It could do still more if the resources of the TCF were greater. In that 
connection, the support being provided through the Peaceful Uses Initiative was very welcome. 
9. The Agency had an important role to play in promoting nuclear non-proliferation and 
disarmament, as reflected in decisions and resolutions of other United Nations bodies, the General 
Conference and the NPT Review Conferences. At its current session, the General Conference could 
take decisions that would help to create favourable political conditions for convening an international 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other 
weapons of mass destruction. In that connection, the understanding reached by the Director General 
with the States concerned on the holding of a forum in November on experience of possible relevance 
to the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East was to be welcomed. 
GC(55)/OR.1

10. He looked forward both to a successful General Conference session and to a successful forum. 
1. Election of officers and appointment of the General 
Committee 
11. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President of the 
Conference. 
12. Mr DAVIDOVIC (Bosnia and Herzegovina), speaking on behalf of the Eastern Europe Group, 
proposed Mr Feruta (Romania). 
13. Mr Feruta (Romania) was elected President by acclamation. 
14. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr Feruta on his election and wished him 
every success in his task. 
Mr Feruta (Romania) took the Chair. 
15. The PRESIDENT said he viewed his election as President of the General Conference at its fiftyfifth 
regular session as a reflection of appreciation for RomaniaÂs contribution to the AgencyÂs work 
over the years. In fulfilling his important task, he would work closely with Member States, regional 
groups, the Director General and the Secretariat. 
16. As Governor from Romania on the Board he had been involved in the successful efforts to put 
together, under tight financial constraints, an ambitious programme for 2010Â2011 and to formulate 
the Medium Term Strategy for 2012Â2017. In the course of those exercises, he had gained a profound 
insight into the activities of the Agency and had enjoyed a rewarding interaction with the SecretariatÂs 
dedicated staff. Thanks to that experience, he could testify to the fact that the confidence placed by 
Member States in the Agency, with its ÂAtoms for PeaceÂ mandate, was well justified. 
17. The Agency was helping to create the foundations for Member StatesÂ nuclear power 
programmes, playing a key role in ensuring that the highest safety, security and non-proliferation 
standards were met. Also, it was playing an increasingly important role in areas such as food security 
(for example, through the FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture), 
human health (for example, through PACT) and water resources management. 
18. The current session of the General Conference was taking place in a changed environment 
following the natural disaster and nuclear accident in Japan. He sympathized deeply with the people 
and Government of Japan and greatly admired the determination that they had displayed in very 
difficult circumstances. 
19. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station had highlighted the need to 
strengthen the nuclear safety framework. A timely extraordinary conference convened by the Director 
General in June had paved the way for a vigorous reaction by Agency Member States. At its current 
session, the General Conference was asked to endorse an Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. That 
document by no means marked the end of the process of acting upon the lessons learned from the 
Fukushima accident; it represented the first decisive step of an what would be a long-continuing effort. 
The Agency had the expertise necessary in order to reassure the international community that all 
nuclear activities were being conducted in a safe and secure manner. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 3 
20. Later in the week, at the initiative of the UN Secretary-General, Member States would meet in 
New York, in the margins of the General Assembly, to address issues pertaining to nuclear safety from 
a somewhat political perspective. In his view, the General Conference had a responsibility to 
complement the political discussions that would be taking place in New York with a report on the 
result of the deliberations that had been taking place during the past eight months within the Agency 
framework, and he therefore expected the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety to be endorsed by the 
General Conference in time for it to contribute to the meeting in New York. He believed that, by 
endorsing the Action Plan in time, the General Conference would increase the prominence of nuclear 
safety on the agenda of the international community. 
21. At the present important juncture, the AgencyÂs Member States must demonstrate that the 
Agency could continue making a solid contribution to international peace and security. He was 
confident that that would be the message at the end of the current session of the General Conference, 
and he would spare no effort in seeking consensus on all the issues before the Conference. In doing so, 
he counted on the support of Member States in recapturing the ÂSpirit of ViennaÂ. 
22. Pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect eight Vice- 
Presidents, a Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole and five additional members of the General 
Committee, resulting in a General Committee of 15 with himself as its Chairperson. However, since at 
the current session the Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole was to be from the Far East group, 
which customarily had one representative on the General Committee, as Vice-President, it would be 
necessary to suspend Rules 34 and 40 in order to have seven Vice-Presidents and six additional 
members in a Committee of 15. 
23. He took it that the General Conference wished to suspend Rules 34 and 40. 
24. It was so agreed. 
25. The PRESIDENT proposed that the delegates of Australia, Costa Rica, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, Malta, Nigeria, the Russian Federation and the United States of America be elected as Vice- 
Presidents, that Ms Yparraguirre (Philippines) be elected as Chairperson of the Committee of the 
Whole, and that the delegates of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Germany, Lebanon, Sudan and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela be elected as additional members of the General Committee. 
26. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
27. The PRESIDENT further proposed that the General Conference take up items 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of 
its provisional agenda, in that order, pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation on 
the agenda. 
28. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
2. Applications for membership of the Agency 
(GC(55)/10, GC(55)/12 and GC(55)/13) 
29. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(55)/10, GC(55)/12 and GC(55)/13 
containing applications for membership by the Commonwealth of Dominica, the Lao PeopleÂs 
Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of Tonga, respectively. The applications had been endorsed by 
the Board of Governors, which had also submitted, in the same documents, three draft resolutions for 
adoption by the General Conference. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 4 
30. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt the three draft resolutions by acclamation. 
31. It was so decided. 
32. The PRESIDENT congratulated the Commonwealth of Dominica, the Lao PeopleÂs Democratic 
Republic and the Kingdom of Tonga on being approved for membership of the Agency. 
33. Mr BOUNTEUM (Lao PeopleÂs Democratic Republic), speaking under Rule 30, expressed 
gratitude to the Director General, the Board of Governors and the delegates to the General Conference 
for accepting his countryÂs application to become a member of the Agency. The Lao PeopleÂs 
Democratic Republic, an LDC, was committed to the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, especially 
in the areas of public health, agriculture and environmental protection, an it looked forward to 
receiving support from the Agency as it pursued its aim of overcoming its LDC status by 2020. 
34. Mr MONTEJO (Philippines), speaking on behalf of the delegates of ASEAN countries, 
congratulated the Lao PeopleÂs Democratic Republic on being accepted for membership of the 
Agency. 
3. Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
35. Mr DUARTE (United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs) read out the 
following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send greetings to all the participants in this IAEA General Conference. 
ÂYour meeting comes at an important time. Since March, the international community has been 
focused on responding to the horrendous tragedy at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant 
in Japan. At the UN, I commissioned a system-wide study on the accidentÂs implications. Later 
this week, I will convene a High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security in New York to 
consider that study and all related issues. I hope this will be an occasion to build political 
support and momentum at the highest level for ongoing international initiatives in this area. 
ÂI had the moving experience of personally travelling to Japan last month to show my solidarity 
with the people of Fukushima. I met with high-level officials and high school students, 
government ministers and displaced families. I saw the devastation and sensed the continuing 
fear. At the same time, I was deeply impressed by the resourcefulness, resilience and resolve of 
the Japanese people, who are already planning for a better future. 
ÂThe situation in Fukushima demonstrated all too clearly that major nuclear accidents do not 
respect national boundaries; they are a matter of international concern and global public interest. 
ÂI remain grateful to Director General Amano and the entire IAEA staff for their swift and 
professional response to the accident, their follow-up efforts and their valuable contribution to 
the UN system-wide study. I welcome the outcome of the IAEA Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety and the development of an Action Plan. 
ÂI hope this General Conference can adopt that forward-looking Plan so that it can serve as a 
basis for international efforts to improve nuclear safety. I also welcome JapanÂs initiative, in 
cooperation with the IAEA, to convene a high-level meeting on the issue in late 2012. 
ÂFor my part, I am determined to exert all possible efforts to prevent any future tragedies at a 
nuclear facility. I am seeking new ways to enhance cooperation among international 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 5 
organizations, particularly in the areas of emergency response and information sharing. I have 
also emphasized the need to strengthen the capacity of the IAEA to promote nuclear safety and 
nuclear security. 
ÂYour discussions can maintain the political momentum, which should build at this weekÂs 
High-Level Meeting and gain further strength through future events, including the Nuclear 
Security Summit in Seoul next year. 
ÂYou have a broad range of issues on your agenda, including the all-important challenges of 
strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime, enhancing the safeguards system and 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, while also furthering the goal of global nuclear 
disarmament as mandated in the IAEA Statute. 
ÂIn 2011, initial steps were taken to carry out the measures agreed to at last yearÂs Review 
Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, including 
the action plan on the Middle East. 1 welcomed the Second Conference of the Nuclear-Weapon 
States on Confidence Building Measures towards Nuclear Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, 
as well as measures by non-nuclear-weapon States to achieve the goal of a world free of nuclear 
weapons. 
ÂI wish you great success in your work to advance progress on these issues, which are critical to 
the safety and security of generations to come.Â 
4. Statement by the Director General 
36. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that the most important single item on the AgencyÂs agenda 
since the previous General Conference session had been the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Station in Japan, which had caused deep public anxiety throughout the world and 
damaged confidence in nuclear power. 
37. The accident had been caused by an earthquake and tsunami of unprecedented severity, which 
had struck the east of Japan on 11 March 2011. The AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre had 
gone into action immediately, working around the clock to advise Japan and to share information with 
all Member States. A few days after the accident, he had travelled to Japan and offered the then Prime 
Minister, Naoto Kan, the SecretariatÂs full support, stressing that Japan needed to demonstrate the 
highest transparency in its handling of the accident. 
38. In June 2011, he had convened a Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety, which had adopted 
a Ministerial Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear safety, emergency preparedness, and the 
radiation protection of people and the environment worldwide. The Ministerial Conference had been 
chaired by the Resident Representative of Brazil, Ambassador Antonio Guerreiro, who had skilfully 
steered the work that had led to the adoption of the Ministerial Declaration. 
39. The Ministerial Declaration had formed the basis of the AgencyÂs first-ever Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety, which had just been approved by consensus by the Board of Governors and was 
before the General Conference for endorsement. Compared to the arrangements that had been in place 
before the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the Action Plan represented a significant step forward in 
strengthening nuclear safety. The Secretariat would immediately start to fulfil its responsibilities under 
the Action Plan, and he hoped that all Member States would do likewise. The most important thing 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 6 
was to ensure transparency, build confidence and meet the high expectations of the public. It was 
actions not words that counted. 
40. The AgencyÂs present assessment of the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power 
Station was that the reactors were essentially stable. The expectation was that the cold shutdown of all 
the reactors would be achieved as planned. The Secretariat would continue to provide every possible 
assistance to Japan. Continuing full transparency on JapanÂs part would also be important. 
41. The tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States had been marked the 
previous week. In the wake of the attacks, the Agency had significantly expanded its nuclear security 
programme to help States protect nuclear and other radioactive material and associated facilities 
against malicious acts. 
42. As the Nuclear Security Report 2011 showed, the number of States participating in the 
AgencyÂs Illicit Trafficking Database (ITDB) programme was continuing to grow. It now stood at 113. 
In the year to 30 June 2011, 172 incidents had been reported to the ITDB. Fourteen had involved 
activities such as unauthorized possession and/or attempts to sell or smuggle nuclear material or 
radioactive sources. A further 32 incidents had involved the theft or loss of nuclear or other 
radioactive material. Incidents of that nature demonstrated that security weaknesses continued to exist 
and must be addressed. 
43. Member States needed to be reminded once again that, six years after its adoption, progress 
towards the entry into force of the Amendment to the CPPNM remained slow. As adherence to the 
Amendment could significantly reduce the risk of nuclear material falling into the wrong hands, he 
would like to see the parties to the CPPNM accelerating its entry into force. A Treaty Event would be 
held that week to promote universal adherence to, and support for, multilateral treaties for which the 
Agency was depositary, including the Amendment to the CPPNM. 
44. Following the Fukushima Daiichi accident, there had been speculation that the expansion of 
interest in nuclear power observed in recent years could come to an end. However, it was now clear 
that there would actually be continuous and significant growth in the use of nuclear power in the next 
two decades, although at a slower rate than previously projected. The number of operating nuclear 
reactors in the world was expected to increase by about 90 by 2030 according to the AgencyÂs low 
projection, or by about 350 according to its high projection, from the current total of 432 reactors. 
Most of the growth would occur in countries that already had operating nuclear power plants, such as 
China and India. 
45. In countries that were considering introducing nuclear power, interest remained strong despite 
the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Most of those countries were proceeding with plans to add nuclear 
power to their energy mix, with the AgencyÂs assistance; a few countries had cancelled or revised their 
plans, while others had adopted a Âwait and seeÂ approach. The factors that had contributed to the 
growing interest in nuclear power before the Fukushima Daiichi accident had not changed; they 
included the increasing global demand for energy, concerns about climate change, volatile fossil fuel 
prices and the desire for energy supply security. 
46. In December 2010, the Board had approved the establishment of an IAEA Low Enriched 
Uranium Bank, to be funded by voluntary contributions from Member States. In July 2011, 
Kazakhstan had submitted a proposal for hosting the LEU bank and offered two sites for 
consideration. Discussions were under way with the Government of Kazakhstan with a view to 
finalizing a decision on a site. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 7 
47. In March 2011, the Board had approved the request of a number of Member States for a 
mechanism that would provide assurances of supply of enrichment services and of LEU for use in 
nuclear power plants. 
48. A guaranteed LEU reserve had been created by the Russian Federation at the International 
Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk and had been available for Member States since February 
2011. 
49. In the area of food and agriculture, one major success story deserved special mention: the 
elimination of the deadly cattle disease rinderpest, the first animal disease ever to be eliminated. It was 
a momentous achievement of enormous economic benefit to many developing countries; the net 
benefit in Africa alone was estimated at more than one billion US dollars a year. Together with FAO, 
the World Organisation for Animal Health, the African Union and other partners, the Agency had 
played an important part in eliminating the highly contagious viral disease. Its role had included 
making available affordable diagnostic techniques and training veterinary staff. All delegations were 
invited to attend the AgencyÂs Rinderpest Freedom Celebration to be held the following day. 
50. The biennial progress report on PACT was before the Conference for review. PACT, now in its 
sixth year, remained among the AgencyÂs most successful programmes and was receiving extensive 
support from Member States. Between September 2009 and September 2011, US $21.6 million had 
been mobilized to improve cancer control in developing countries. 
51. The 2011 Scientific Forum, starting the following day, would focus on the use of nuclear 
techniques in the management of water resources. Ministers and officials from a number of countries 
and renowned international experts would discuss key water-related issues facing the world today. 
52. The 50th anniversary of the IAEA Environment Laboratories in Monaco would be celebrated at 
the end of that month. The Laboratories had made an outstanding contribution to the protection of the 
oceans and seas by developing advanced analytical methods and reference materials for assessing 
marine radioactivity and pollution. 
53. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme provided essential support to Member States in 
every region. New resources for the programme had risen to $127.7 million in 2010 from 
$112.2 million in 2009. Nuclear safety was the largest area of activity within the programme, followed 
by human health, and food and agriculture. About $20 million had so far been received under the 
Peaceful Uses Initiative (PUI) launched the previous year; he was grateful to all the countries that had 
contributed to the PUI and would like to see other countries in a position to do so contributing. 
54. Through the technical cooperation programme, Member States were addressing national 
development priorities in fields where nuclear techniques offered advantages over other techniques or 
could usefully supplement them. For example, Agency technical cooperation projects were helping to 
combat child malnutrition, to support breastfeeding programmes and to address child mortality from 
preventable water-borne diseases. 
55. As the 2011 Scientific Forum was focusing on water-related issues, he wished to give two 
examples of important projects concerned with water. In Latin America, unique information on seven 
coastal aquifers was being obtained through a regional isotope hydrology project; thanks to the 
project, Argentina and Uruguay, for example, had identified zones that were appropriate for 
developing wells and zones where further exploitation should be discontinued. In Africa, a regional 
project involving the use of small-scale irrigation technology and the application of sound criteria for 
the better use of water and fertilizer had shown that drip irrigation increased crop yields while 
economizing on irrigation water by up to 30% compared to traditional methods; there was tremendous 
interest on the part of smallholder farmers eager to adopt the technology. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 8 
56. With regard to nuclear verification, the fact that 110 countries now had additional protocols in 
force was very encouraging. The additional protocol was essential for enabling the Agency to provide 
credible assurances not only that declared nuclear material was not being diverted from peaceful uses, 
but also that there were no undeclared nuclear material and activities in a country. He strongly hoped 
that the remaining States being called upon to conclude an additional protocol would conclude one 
soon. 
57. The efforts of the Agency to improve the analytical capabilities and the security of its 
laboratories had made excellent progress. 
58. The Clean Laboratory Extension had been operational for several months, having been 
completed on time and slightly under budget; it greatly increased the AgencyÂs ability to 
independently analyse environmental samples for safeguards purposes and made the Agency a leader 
in the field of particle analysis. 
59. Recently, the ground-breaking ceremony had taken place for a new Nuclear Material Laboratory 
which, when completed in 2014, would provide the Agency with a modern capability for the analysis 
of samples collected from all points along the nuclear fuel cycle. However, for the new Nuclear 
Material Laboratory to have a minimum core capability, a further 22 million euros were required, in 
addition to the generous extrabudgetary contributions already received from several Member States. 
He would like to see other Member States in a position to do so making extrabudgetary contributions. 
60. He had continued to report regularly to the Board of Governors on the implementation of 
Agency safeguards, including in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic. 
61. As far as the safeguards issues on the agenda for the current session of the General Conference 
were concerned, his report on the application of safeguards in the DPRK provided a historical 
overview and an update on recent developments of direct relevance to the Agency. As the Agency had 
not been able to implement any safeguards measures in the DPRK since April 2009, its knowledge of 
the present status of that countryÂs nuclear programme was very limited. The DPRKÂs nuclear 
programme remained a matter of serious concern, and recent reports about the construction of a new 
uranium enrichment facility and an LWR in the DPRK were deeply troubling. It was important that 
the DPRK comply fully with its obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions, come into 
full compliance with the NPT and cooperate promptly and fully with the Agency, which had an 
essential role to play in verifying the DPRKÂs nuclear programme. 
62. In September 2000, the General Conference had tasked the Director General with making 
arrangements to convene a forum in which participants from the Middle East and other interested 
parties could learn from the experience with NWFZs already established in other regions. As 
consultations with Member States had shown that conditions were now favourable for the holding of 
such a forum, he had invited all Member States to one that would be held in Vienna on 21 and 
22 November 2011. He was pleased to announce that the Resident Representative of Norway, 
Ambassador Jan Petersen, had accepted his invitation to serve as Chairperson. 
63. The accounts of the Agency for 2010 had received an unqualified audit opinion, and it was 
expected that the accounts for 2011 would also receive one. That would be a noteworthy 
accomplishment in view of the simultaneous implementation in 2011 of IPSAS and of phase I of 
AIPS. 
64. Considerable time and effort had gone into the preparation of the programme and budget for 
2012Â2013. It had not been business as usual; securing proper funding for the Agency at a time of 
Member StatesÂ growing demands for its services and tight constraints on Member State finances had 
required careful balancing. The Secretariat had worked hard to identify and eliminate lower-priority 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 9 
activities and to improve efficiency. However, a reasonable increase in resources would clearly be 
needed in the coming years in order to meet new and expanding demands for assistance from Member 
States in nuclear safety and other areas. 
65. Earlier that year, he had established a Director GeneralÂs Office for Policy (DGOP). The DGOP 
was carrying out functions previously carried out by the former Office of the Director General and the 
former Office of External Relations and Policy Coordination, and a high-level strategic planning 
function had been added. The change had helped to ensure a sharper focus on implementing the policy 
set by the Board of Governors and the General Conference and on the general management of the 
Secretariat. 
66. Mr David Waller, Deputy Director General for Management, would shortly retire after nearly 
19 years in that key position. He had already had a distinguished career in the United States of 
America as Legal Counsel to President Ronald Reagan and Assistant Secretary for International 
Affairs at the Department of Energy before coming to the Agency in January 1993. Since then, he had 
served three Agency Directors General with distinction. He had greatly valued Mr WallerÂs loyalty, 
wisdom and profound institutional memory, was extremely grateful to him and wished him continued 
good health and success in future. 
67. The Government of Austria had continued to be an exemplary host to the Agency. He was 
particularly grateful for the excellent facilities provided by Austria and for its strong support, most 
recently in refurbishing the AgencyÂs laboratories at Seibersdorf. 
6. Contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2012 
(GC(55)/22) 
68. The PRESIDENT said that on 7 June 2011 the Board of Governors had recommended a figure 
of $88 750 000 as the target for voluntary contributions to the TCF for the year 2012. The table in 
document GC(55)/22 showed the contributions that each Member State would need to make in order 
to meet its share of that target. 
69. The early pledging and payment of contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in 
planning the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes, and all delegations that were in a position 
to do so, but had not done so yet, were urged to notify the Secretariat during the current session of the 
contributions that their governments would be making to the TCF for 2012. 
70. He would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions that 
had been pledged up to that time. He hoped to be able to report favourably on the percentage of the 
2012 target figure already pledged. 
7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 
(GC(55)/2) 
71. Mr CHU (United States of America), having thanked the Director General for his outstanding 
leadership, read out the following message from President Obama: 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 10 
ÂOn behalf of the United States, please accept my best wishes for a successful IAEA General 
Conference. This yearÂs meeting takes place against the backdrop of the severe earthquake and 
tsunami that struck Japan in March and the devastating accident at the Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Station that followed. Along with the international community, the United States 
will continue to stand by and support our Japanese friends as they recover from this crisis. 
ÂThe tragic events at Fukushima make clear that nuclear energy, which holds great promise for 
global development and as a carbon-free source of power, also brings significant challenges to 
our collective safety and security. Going forward, we must rededicate ourselves to the principle 
that, when pursuing nuclear energy, safety and security must be our highest priority. The United 
States supports the efforts of Director General Amano to enhance nuclear safety worldwide and 
to elevate the vital role of the IAEA on this front. We also support strengthening the IAEAÂs 
role in increasing nuclear security around the world. 
ÂWe must aim for a future in which peaceful nuclear energy is not only safe, but also accessible 
by all nations that abide by their obligations. We must safeguard against any possible diversion 
or misuse of nuclear energy, whether by nations or terrorists, and ensure nations that violate 
their obligations face consequences. For those that play by the rules, we are committed to 
building new frameworks for cooperation that accelerate nuclear energy assistance and lower 
the risks of proliferation. The approval of an IAEA nuclear fuel bank, to which the United 
States has committed $50 million, and the launch of the IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative, to which 
the United States has committed another $50 million, will strengthen the foundation of the 
international non-proliferation regime. 
ÂNext year in Seoul, the Republic of Korea will host the Nuclear Security Summit, building on 
the summit I convened last year to secure the worldÂs vulnerable nuclear materials. Sharpening 
the focus on nuclear security is essential to prevent nuclear terrorism. As a further step, we must 
ensure a robust dialogue among safety and security experts and work to build on the synergies 
between the two. 
ÂThrough these efforts, and many others that involve the IAEA and its Member States, we will 
succeed in shaping a future where nuclear energy is both safe and secure. Thank you and best 
wishes for a successful meeting.Â 
72. Harnessing the energy of the atom for peaceful and productive uses while guarding against the 
most destructive weapons ever known presented a crucial challenge that no nation could face alone, 
and the Agency was central to international efforts in meeting that challenge. The four priorities of 
President ObamaÂs nuclear agenda were: the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy; strengthening 
the non-proliferation regime; nuclear disarmament; and nuclear security. 
73. Nuclear power would continue to be an important part of the energy mix of the United States 
and many other countries. In fact, its importance was growing in the face of a changing climate, 
increasing energy demand and a struggling global economy. At the same time, the Fukushima disaster 
was a reminder that nuclear safety and security required continued vigilance. 
74. All nations had a responsibility to learn from JapanÂs experience. In the United States, a Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission task force had completed an initial 90-day review of the CommissionÂs 
regulatory oversight and safety standards, provided insights from the Fukushima accident and made 
recommendations for enhancing reactor safety; the recommendations were being considered by the 
Commission. 
75. In June, Member States had pledged to re-examine nuclear safety standards, emergency 
preparedness plans and incident response capabilities Â activities in which the Agency had a critical 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 11 
role to play. At the same time, his country, which looked forward to implementation of the Action 
Plan on Nuclear Safety, considered that the central role of national regulators and of plant operators in 
achieving safety objectives should continue to be recognized. 
76. The Fukushima accident had highlighted the need for a global nuclear liability regime to 
compensate accident victims and for a stable legal environment in support of nuclear powerÂs 
expansion. In other words, it was time that the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for 
Nuclear Damage entered into force. 
77. In addition, further Member States should become parties to international instruments such as 
the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention. 
78. His country, which was encouraging discussion within the International Framework for Nuclear 
Energy Cooperation on Â inter alia Â the issue of nuclear fuel services, favoured expanded and 
reliable access to fuel supplies, through the commercial marketplace and public-private partnerships, 
for peaceful nuclear programmes. The IAEA LEU Fuel Bank, the United Kingdom mechanism for 
assured supply and the Russian fuel reserve at Angarsk were important fuel supply mechanisms. 
79. The United States had recently announced the availability, for countries pursuing peaceful 
nuclear programmes, of a reserve of LEU created by the downblending of 17.4 metric tons of surplus 
HEU from its nuclear weapons stockpile. The initiative in question would help to promote nuclear 
power generation in a manner consistent with his countryÂs non-proliferation and disarmament 
commitments. 
80. The adopted measures fell within the new international framework that President Obama had 
called for in Prague in 2009. Next, the United States would encourage commercial nuclear industry 
companies to join together, subject to appropriate laws and regulations, in providing reliable access to 
both front- and back-end fuel cycle services to any country with nuclear reactors Â an arrangement 
that would dramatically reduce the need for countries to develop indigenous enrichment and 
reprocessing technologies. 
81. Also, in order to ensure that many Member States had access to the peaceful benefits of the 
atom, his country had in 2010 pledged $50 million for the IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative, and with 
Japan as a partner it was seeking further pledges. It was grateful to those other countries which had 
already made pledges. 
82. Promoting the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy must go hand in hand with strengthening 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime through more efficient and more effective international 
safeguards. However, the Secretariat could not strengthen that regime without adequate resources and 
the support of the AgencyÂs Member States. 
83. That was why the United States was making a voluntary contribution of more than $85 million, 
over and above its contribution towards the 2011 Regular Budget, in support of technical cooperation, 
safeguards, nuclear safety, nuclear security and non-power peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
84. That was why his country, through its Next Generation Safeguards Initiative and its safeguards 
support programme, was helping to modernize Agency safeguards and encouraging the transition to a 
robust, information-driven system. 
85. That was why his country would like to see all States bringing into force and fully 
implementing comprehensive safeguards agreements along with additional protocols. Only if they did 
would the Agency have the authority necessary in order to fully meet its verification responsibilities. 
In that connection, the eight States that had brought additional protocols into force since the previous 
session of the General Conference were to be congratulated. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 12 
86. To maintain the credibility and effectiveness of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, all States 
should honour their Agency safeguards obligations. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran was 
continuing, in violation of its Agency safeguards obligations, to engage in denial, deceit and evasion. 
Time and again it had refused to satisfy legitimate concerns about the nature of its nuclear programme, 
selectively rejecting Agency requests for access to and information about its nuclear facilities. A 
manifestation of its provocative behaviour had been its recent decision to begin installing centrifuges 
at an underground facility near Qom. Iran had initiated the construction of that facility secretly, 
notifying the Agency only because it had been discovered Â two years previously Â to be 
constructing the facility. It had stated that the facility would be used for enriching uranium to near 
20%, claiming that the enriched uranium was needed in order to fuel its existing research reactor or 
future reactors for which the ground had yet to be broken. Expanding its enrichment capacity to such 
an extent and moving underground constituted a significant provocation, and brought Iran still closer 
to being able to produce weapons-grade uranium Â raising serious doubts about the peacefulness of 
its intentions and about its willingness to build trust and confidence. 
87. IranÂs Government had a choice: it could comply with its obligations and restore international 
confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear activities, or it could face deepening 
isolation and growing international censure. 
88. The Board of Governors had been right to report the Syrian Arab Republic to the Security 
Council for safeguards violations. Syria should now cooperate fully with the Agency. Also it should 
sign and promptly bring into force an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. 
89. As to the DPRK, the path would be open to the resumption of talks, to improved relations with 
the United States and to greater regional stability if it demonstrated, through actions, that it was 
committed to being a constructive partner. The DPRK needed to take meaningful and irreversible 
steps towards denuclearization, honouring its international obligations, returning to the NPT fold and 
re-accepting Agency safeguards. 
90. The Board of Governors had taken strong action by reporting non-compliance by the DPRK, 
Iran and Syria to the Security Council. Unless the international community now sent a strong message 
that violations of nuclear non-proliferation obligations would not be tolerated, regional and global 
stability and the non-proliferation regime would be undermined. 
91. A key element of the non-proliferation regime was his countryÂs shared commitment to 
fulfilling its NPT Article VI nuclear disarmament obligations. Since the General conferenceÂs previous 
session, the United States had taken bold steps towards fulfilling those obligations. Under the New 
START Treaty, which had entered into force in February, Russia and the United States would reduce 
the number of deployed warheads to the lowest level since the 1950s Â a reduction of about 85% 
from the dark days of the Cold War. The United States was committed to reducing, in a step-by-step 
process, the overall number of nuclear weapons and to pursuing a future agreement with Russia for 
broad reductions in all nuclear weapons Â strategic, non-strategic, deployed and non-deployed. 
92. In addition, Russia and the United States had brought into force a landmark agreement to each 
dispose of at least 34 metric tons of surplus weapons-grade plutonium. The Agency had a unique role 
to play in helping to implement the agreementÂs verification regime, and was working closely with the 
Secretariat on defining that role. 
93. Furthermore, his country and the other NPT nuclear-weapon States were continuing to discuss 
nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation, transparency and verification. 
94. His country, which shared a commitment to bringing the CTBT into force by strengthening its 
verification regime, was committed to ratifying the CTBT. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 13 
95. The United States, which was aggressively pursuing a disarmament agenda, would like to see 
others doing the same. A start could be made with the launching of long-delayed negotiations on a 
fissile material cut-off treaty Â a treaty crucial for the achievement of shared disarmament and nonproliferation 
objectives. 
96. The international community must continue to cooperate in preventing nuclear terrorism, one of 
the most immediate and extreme threats to global security. The United States was grateful to the many 
countries that had participated in the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and were living up to their 
commitments. 
97. Since that historic event, tremendous progress had been made. For example, many States had 
undertaken to establish centres of excellence for training and capacity-building in the field of nuclear 
security, and the United States had: removed approximately 400 kilograms of HEU and plutonium Â 
enough material to make more than 15 nuclear weapons Â from several other countries; downblended 
700 kilograms of HEU from civil nuclear programmes to LEU, making it unsuitable for use in nuclear 
weapons; and, in cooperation with its partners, deployed radiation detection systems to 19 transit sites 
worldwide, continued to improve security at nuclear facilities, and worked on increasing informationsharing 
among police and security services to counter nuclear smuggling. 
98. The United States, which welcomed the revision of the AgencyÂs nuclear security guidance 
document ÂThe physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilitiesÂ and the strengthening of 
the recommendations made in it, looked forward to cooperating with other Member States and the 
Secretariat in implementing the recommendations. His country also looked forward to the Nuclear 
Security Summit that was to be held in the Republic of Korea in 2012. 
99. Nuclear energy lay at the intersection of two of the worldÂs most pressing issues: the energy and 
climate challenge and the nuclear proliferation and terrorism threat. Mindful that immediate action 
was vital, two and a half years previously President Obama had laid out an ambitious agenda for 
securing vulnerable nuclear material around the world and moving towards a world without nuclear 
weapons while promoting peaceful nuclear power. Albert Einstein had once said, ÂThrough the release 
of atomic energy, our generation has brought into the world the most revolutionary force since 
prehistoric manÂs discovery of fire.Â By working together, the international community could ensure 
that the revolutionary force was used for peace and prosperity, not death and destruction Â for 
bringing about a brighter and more secure future for the present generation and future generations. 
100. Mr HOSONO (Japan) said that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, 
operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), had been triggered by the Great East Japan 
Earthquake and the resulting tsunami, gravely harming his country. 
101. Japan, a nation lacking rich energy resources, had embarked on nuclear power generation in 
1963. Since then, it had made great R&D efforts in the areas of nuclear power safety and security, had 
developed advanced nuclear technologies and had established a large nuclear industry. The accident 
had therefore come as a severe shock to the Japanese people. 
102. Japan was now engaged in the process of restoration following the accident, and it was 
profoundly grateful for the assistance provided and the solidarity shown by other Member States and 
by the Secretariat and other organizations. 
103. His country greatly appreciated the leadership being demonstrated by Director General Amano, 
who had himself visited the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station following the accident, in 
steering the SecretariatÂs efforts to ensure that lessons learned from the accident were drawn upon in 
the enhancement of nuclear power safety and security. Those efforts included the dissemination of 
information about the accident, the dispatching of radiation monitoring teams, the organization of an 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 14 
international fact-finding mission and the preparation of a draft Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that had 
been approved by the Board of Governors during the previous week. 
104. Japan, which would do all in its power to help implement the Action Plan, was committed to 
overcoming the consequences of the accident as early as possible, investigating the causes of the 
accident, and sharing the lessons learned with the rest of the international community. The lessons 
learned would no doubt be useful to the Agency in its future efforts to further strengthen nuclear 
safety. 
105. In the Declaration adopted at the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June, it had been 
stressed that Japan should continue to provide information about the accident. Japan itself considered 
it important that such information be accurate and be provided swiftly. Accordingly, his Government 
had the previous week submitted to the Agency a report on progress since June, when it had submitted 
an initial report. Participants in the General ConferenceÂs current session were invited to attend a 
briefing session on that report later in the day. 
106. The sustained efforts to stabilize the reactors and the spent fuel pools at the Fukushima Daiichi 
Nuclear Power Station were proof of the dedication of the on-site workers, who were every day 
carrying out emergency tasks under exacting conditions. At the same time, those efforts were being 
greatly supported by international assistance, including the provision of advice and of equipment such 
as radioactive water treatment systems and remotely controlled robots. 
107. Thanks to such invaluable assistance, the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power 
Station was steadily improving. His Government and TEPCO were doing their utmost to complete 
step 2 of their roadmap and bring the release of radioactive materials under control and significantly 
lower the radiation dose level. The aim was to achieve cold shutdown by the end of 2011. 
108. The reactors were moving towards cold shutdown thanks largely to the installation of a 
circulating water injection cooling system that was recycling the processed highly radioactive water. 
Stable cooling conditions had already been achieved in the case of the spent fuel pools. 
109. His Government had assumed responsibility for improving the situation of the on-site workers 
through better radiation exposure management and health care arrangements. 
110. With a view to addressing mid- and long-term challenges such as the removal of spent fuel, his 
Government was engaging in the training of experts in conjunction with the facility operators. 
111. Further difficult challenges, unforeseeable at present, would no doubt arise, but he was 
convinced that Japan would overcome them thanks to the efforts of the on-site workers and the support 
being provided by the international community. 
112. In its initial report to the Agency, submitted in June, his Government had made it clear that one 
of the lessons learned from the accident was that there was a need to upgrade JapanÂs administrative 
structure for nuclear safety regulation. Mindful of the reference in the Declaration of the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety to further strengthening the authority of nuclear regulatory bodies and 
the reference in the Action Plan to the effective independence of such bodies, his Government had 
decided to separate the regulatory function from the promotional function in the nuclear field by 
creating, with effect from April 2012, a Nuclear Safety and Security Agency as part of the Ministry for 
the Environment; the new agency would result from the integration of the Nuclear Safety Commission 
into the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, which would be separated from the Ministry of 
Economy, Trade and Industry. It was hoped that the creation of the new agency, with sole 
responsibility for nuclear regulation, would boost safety culture in the nuclear field. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 15 
113. In addition, his Government intended to establish a stronger crisis management system and to 
tighten up JapanÂs nuclear safety regulations. 
114. Against that background, Japan was looking forward to hosting an IRRS mission in 2012. 
115. As its name indicated, the new agency would be in charge not only of nuclear safety but also of 
nuclear security. Through it, Japan would continue to made improvements in the area of nuclear 
security, taking account of the relevant Agency documents and of lessons learned from the accident. 
Further arrangements designed to prevent and counter terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities would be 
introduced and terrorism-related information exchange with security authorities in other countries 
would be promoted. Capacity-building at JapanÂs Integrated Support Center for Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation and Nuclear Security would continue. 
116. Against that background, Japan believed that it would be able to contribute to the success of the 
Nuclear Security Summit to be held in March 2012. 
117. In October, Japan would host an Agency decontamination mission, and decontamination work 
would be carried out by Japanese experts in cooperation with experts from abroad. Another high 
priority was the carrying out of health checks on local residents. 
118. In the course of discussions on the Action Plan, Japan had proposed strengthening and 
promoting the AgencyÂs safety standards and expanding the role of Agency safety assessment 
missions, including peer reviews. Its proposals were reflected in the 12 main actions that were 
envisaged in the Action Plan and that Japan would make every effort to implement. 
119. In 2012, at the high-level conference to be organized by his Government and the Secretariat, 
Japan would present the results of a comprehensive review of the safety situation at its nuclear power 
plants and describe the nuclear safety measures being taken. 
120. The Agency was the sole international organization with expertise relevant to all issues 
associated with nuclear energy, not only nuclear safety and security. Those issues included nuclear 
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, in which Japan was extremely interested. 
121. In conjunction with the 66th session of the General Assembly, Japan would convene a third 
meeting of foreign ministers within the framework of the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament 
Initiative, the aim being to further promote the implementation of the action plan agreed upon at the 
2010 NPT Review Conference. Japan would continue to lead international efforts to bring about Âa 
world without nuclear weaponsÂ. 
122. Japan welcomed the fact that the United States and Russia had agreed to irreversibly subject 
certain weapons-grade plutonium no longer needed for military purposes to Agency verification, and it 
hoped that the other nuclear-weapon States would follow suit. 
123. The DPRK nuclear issue was a threat to peace and security in East Asia and in the world as a 
whole. Also, it presented a serious challenge to the NPT regime. The DPRKÂs uranium enrichment 
programme constituted a clear violation of Security Council resolutions and ran counter to the Joint 
Statement of 19 September 2005 emanating from the Six-Party Talks. It was important that the 
international community continue to strongly urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons as called 
for in resolutions of the Security Council. In that connection, Japan greatly appreciated the 
comprehensive report on the issue submitted earlier in the month to the Board by the Director General. 
124. With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, it was indispensable for the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
allay all the suspicions of the international community and win its confidence. Japan would continue 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 16 
to act in concert with the rest of the international community in seeking a peaceful, diplomatic 
settlement of the issue. 
125. With regard to the Syrian nuclear issue, Japan hoped very much that the Syrian Arab Republic 
would cooperate fully with the Agency and that the relevant facts would be clarified. 
126. Japan greatly appreciated the convening by Director General Amano of a forum on experience 
of possible relevance to the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East, scheduled for November 2011. It 
hoped that the forum would facilitate the convening of a conference to be held in 2012, on the 
establishment of a Middle East zone free of all weapons of mass destruction. 
127. Japan welcomed the increase during the previous year in the number of States with additional 
protocols in force and the fact that a safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol was 
becoming the international safeguards standard. 
128. Japan, which had been hosting sessions of the Asian Senior-Level Talks on Non-Proliferation, 
was helping the AgencyÂs Secretariat to promote the entry into force of additional protocols and also 
helping to enhance analytical capabilities at Agency laboratories. 
129. Japan welcomed the activities of the Agency in tackling issues such as water shortages and 
cancer therapy delays in developing countries. It would be sending hydrology experts to attend the 
2011 Scientific Forum (ÂWater Matters: Making a Difference with Nuclear TechniquesÂ), and it was 
coordinating regional cooperation in Asia in the area of radiology. 
130. For 2011, besides its contribution to the TCF, Japan would be making special contributions to 
the Agency totalling more than $12 million, including $ 3.5 million for the Peaceful Uses Initiative. 
Through those special contributions it would be extending its support for Agency projects relating 
both to nuclear power generation and to non-power applications of nuclear energy. 
131. For a safer nuclear future, it was essential to train nuclear experts. Accordingly, Japan had in 
November 2010 established a nuclear human resource development network, and it was thinking of 
establishing an international nuclear safety training academy that would Â inter alia Âupgrade 
expertsÂ skills and foster international cooperation in making the most of the lessons learned from the 
Fukushima accident. 
132. Japan would overcome the challenges created by the Fukushima accident and move on towards 
a safer nuclear future, benefiting from the lessons learned and the wisdom of the world at large. In 
cooperation with other Member States of the Agency, it would fulfil its responsibilities as regards the 
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. 
133. Mr KIRIENKO (Russian Federation) said that strengthening nuclear safety in the light of the 
lessons learned from the Fukushima accident was the predominant issue before the General 
Conference at its current session, at which the dialogue begun in June, at the Ministerial Conference 
on Nuclear Safety held at the initiative of Director General Amano, would no doubt continue. The 
Director General and the Secretariat had played an important role in coordinating international efforts 
in response to the accident, and the Declaration adopted at the Ministerial Conference was regarded by 
Russia as a long-term strategy for strengthening nuclear safety. 
134. During the preceding week, the Board had adopted the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety called for 
at the Ministerial Conference. The Action Plan reflected proposals for strengthening nuclear safety 
made by the President of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, and put forward officially at the 
Ministerial Conference. Those proposals related to Â inter alia Â the amending of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and the Early Notification Convention and the enhancing of the AgencyÂs safety 
standards. Russia was grateful to all those who had supported the proposals. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 17 
135. It was for each country to decide for itself whether or not to develop nuclear power, and the 
international community should respect the decisions taken by individual countries in the matter. 
136. The position of RussiaÂs leadership was clear Â Russia would continue to develop nuclear 
power, while taking into account the lessons of Fukushima. 
137. Sustained economic growth was impossible without nuclear power, and that was well 
understood by many countries Â including developing ones Â concerned about energy supply 
security. After a pause immediately following the Fukushima accident, further countries were opting 
to embark upon or continue with nuclear power programmes, with the necessary priority assigned to 
ensuring safety. 
138. The most important immediate task was to made sure that nuclear power in its present state was 
safe. In Russia, additional safety assessments had been carried out in the light of the lessons of 
Fukushima, with stress tests conducted at all operating nuclear power plants in order to determine how 
resistant they were to the impact of extreme natural events with Â inter alia Âloss of external power 
and loss of ultimate heat sink. The assessments had shown that the requirements laid down in RussiaÂs 
nuclear safety legislation were being met. 
139. However, such stress tests should not be a one-off measure. Nuclear power plant safety should 
be checked regularly, and Russia stood ready to cooperate in an international effort to improve stress 
test methods and in the exchanging of results. It had already agreed on such cooperation with a 
number of other countries and with the European Union, and it believed that the activities in question 
should be conducted as openly and transparently as possible in the interests of ensuring confidence in 
the results. 
140. In August, Rosenergoatom, the Russian nuclear power plant operator, had proposed the 
establishment, at its crisis centre, of a regional crisis centre for the WWER operators in 14 countries. 
One task of the regional crisis centre would be to conduct joint analyses of stress test results. 
141. Nuclear power plant safety could be strengthened considerably through technical improvements 
such as the combining of active and passive safety systems, an approach already being followed in the 
case of Generation III+ nuclear power plants. In Russian III+ designs, particular attention was being 
paid to ensuring safety even in the event of beyond-design-basis accidents through the inclusion of Â 
for example Â passive heat removal systems, core melt capture and cooling systems, and double 
reactor containments. Such design solutions were a feature of all nuclear power plants now being built 
in Russia Â and of the plant that was being built at Kudankulam, India, with Russian assistance and 
was due to be completed before the end of the year. 
142. Further design solutions needed to be found, and they were being sought within the framework 
of the Agency. With innovative technologies based on the principles of inherent safety, reactors and 
their fuel could, without large amounts of cumbersome equipment and elaborate automation, ensure 
safe operation and also meet the demands of sustainability and non-proliferation. 
143. Accordingly, Russia was collaborating with China, France, Japan and the United States on the 
development of fast reactors and closing of the nuclear fuel cycle. An effective instrument in that 
connection was INPRO, and Russia advocated further strengthening of the interaction between INPRO 
and the GIF. 
144. At the 2010 session of the General Conference, he had proposed the establishment Â within the 
INPRO framework Â of an international programme for multilateral cooperation in the field of fast 
reactors. Russia was prepared to make its Multifunctional Fast Research Reactor available in support 
of the proposed programme. Interested parties were welcome to attend an international seminar on the 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 18 
proposed programme to be held at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors, Dimitrovgrad, in 
October 2011. 
145. In 2010, Russia had announced its intention to establish an assured reserve of LEU under 
Agency management. The reserve, 120 tons of LEU, had now been established in full accordance with 
the agreement concluded between Russia and the Agency. It was located at the International Uranium 
Enrichment Centre in Angarsk and was subject to Agency safeguards. Russia was responsible for all 
expenses relating to maintenance of the reserve and to the applications of safeguards. 
146. Russia, which welcomed the initiative of the United States and a number of other Member 
States relating to the establishment of an IAEA fuel bank, had proposed that the International Uranium 
Enrichment Centre supply material of the required enrichment and quality or provide natural uranium 
conversion and enrichment services. In its view, such a joint approach would facilitate the 
establishment, under Agency auspices, of a reliable system for the assured supply of nuclear fuel to 
interested Member States. 
147. In its dealings with countries interested in embarking on a nuclear power programme, Russia 
emphasized the importance of safety and hence the need to establish a sound nuclear safety 
infrastructure with licensing and monitoring arrangements based on laws and regulations that were in 
accordance with Agency requirements and recommendations. Vietnam and Belarus were two such 
countries, and since the General ConferenceÂs 2010 session Russia had concluded agreements with 
them for the construction of power reactors of Russian design. Similar agreements were in the process 
of being negotiated with Bangladesh and Nigeria, and his country was also involved in bidding for the 
construction of a nuclear power plant in Jordan. In each case, Russia was ready to provide a complete 
service, covering the entire life cycle of the facility. 
148. On 12 September 2011, the Bushehr nuclear power plant Â the first nuclear power plant in the 
Islamic Republic of Iran Â had started supplying electricity to the Iranian grid. The plant, which was 
the result of cooperation between Iran and Russia, conformed to the highest operational safety 
standards, and it was under Agency safeguards. 
149. In 2010, Russia had proposed a new build-own-operate model for cooperation in nuclear power 
plant construction, and the first agreement based on that model had already been concluded between 
Russia and Turkey. 
150. The training of nuclear power plant operating personnel was an issue of particular importance 
for countries embarking on nuclear power programmes. Accordingly, Russia was establishing an 
international centre for such training at its Central Institute for Advanced Training (CIAT), in 
Obninsk. In that connection, an agreement on collaboration between the Agency, the CIAT and 
Rosenergoatom was to be signed that very day. 
151. Russia welcomed the establishment of the Regulatory Cooperation Forum, whose aim was to 
promote communication between, on one hand, nuclear regulators in countries just embarking on 
nuclear power programmes and, on the other, nuclear regulators in countries where such programmes 
had been under way for some time. 
152. Russia would continue to contribute to the TCF. Also, during the period 2012Â2014 it would 
continue to finance its safeguards support programme. In addition, it would continue to provide 
financial support for INPRO until 2015. Overall, its expenditures under those headings would increase 
as from 2012. 
153. To assist Ukraine in making the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant environmentally safe 
and stable, Russia had decided to make additional contributions in the amount of 50 million euros to 
the EBRDÂS Chernobyl Shelter Fund and Nuclear Safety Account.

19 September 2011, Page 19 
154. Russia, which believed that the Agency could and should help in solving global problems in the 
security area, welcomed its involvement in the international efforts to make the Middle East a zone 
free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. It looked forward to the forum, 
convened by the Director General for 21Â22 November 2011, on the experience with NWFZs in other 
parts of the world and the relevance of that experience to the Middle East. 
155. Mr ABBASI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that 31 years previously the army of Saddam 
HusseinÂs regime had mounted a full-scale air, land and sea attack on his country. What was the 
connection between that military aggression and IranÂs Ânuclear dossierÂ? 
156. The victory of the Islamic revolution had completely undermined the military, economic and 
political position of certain nuclear-weapon States in a strategically important region and had led to 
the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. At that time, those who had fabricated the Zionist 
regime were dreaming that the Zionists would achieve their aims in the region by killing innocent 
Palestinians and occupying their land. In 1979, however, the prayers of all noble people who aspired 
to heal the wounds of the Palestinians had been heard, and the Iranians, by the grace of God and 
thanks to their boundless determination, had assumed power based on the freedom-seeking principles 
of Islam, which promised peace, friendship and defence of the oppressed people of Palestine within 
the region and throughout the world. 
157. The resulting defeat of the Zionists and their supporters and the thwarting of their hegemonic 
plans had prompted them to set about suppressing the popular revolution in Iran. They had begun 
organizing media campaigns and military coups, but their plans had been defeated with the help of 
God and thanks to the wisdom of the founder and leader of IranÂs Islamic Revolution. 
158. The losers had resorted to war and division of the country as their last weapon, but they had 
failed yet again, and Iran Â even stronger than before Â had preserved its territorial integrity. The 
animosity of certain devious totalitarian countries had manifested itself in different forms, such as the 
planning of coups, the imposing of war and, more recently, the inventing of a Ânuclear dossierÂ with a 
view to undermining IranÂs peaceful nuclear activities. 
159. Where were the international bodies mandated to uphold laws during the tough times of IranÂs 
resistance to the attack from outside? Why had nobody opposed the use of chemical weapons and 
weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein? Why had the media failed to rouse the worldÂs 
conscience in support of action to prevent the martyrdom and wounding of almost 100 000 people? 
Iran had been subject to sanctions during the period of resistance. Allies of its enemy, acting like 
pirates, had closed off IranÂs vital routes, but numerous independent freedom-loving countries had 
greatly respected the staunch resistance put up by Iran and had sought to assist it. 
160. Since then, political stability in the Islamic Republic of Iran had paved the way for scientific 
endeavour and industrial growth, and a pioneering country logically sought to diversify its energy 
sources. 
161. The peaceful utilization of nuclear energy could yield vast benefits as regards Â for example Â 
electricity generation, ionizing radiation applications in medicine, the promotion of scientific research 
in many areas and enhancement of the capacity of countries to provide specialized services. The 
leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran were well aware of those benefits. 
162. Member States of the Agency and the Director General should not to be influenced by certain 
countries that possessed and were spreading nuclear weapons and were seeking to prevent other 
countries from exercising their inalienable rights. Owing to the hostile positions and actions of a few 
Member States, other Member States, wishing to exercise those rights, were compelled to conduct 
their peaceful nuclear activities in secret. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 20 
163. In an era of shortages in less developed countries, the Agency should act in accordance with its 
statutory duty to help countries exercise their inalienable rights in the nuclear field by fighting 
imposed restraints, halting the fabrication of Ânuclear dossiersÂ and sharing acquired knowledge. 
164. The trust of the international community in the Agency must be restored and the Agency must 
not be converted into a centre for preserving the interests of nuclear-weapon States and for imposing 
restrictions on countries that wished to benefit from peaceful nuclear technology. 
165. During the 1970s, the Agency had promoted the manufacture of nuclear explosive devices for 
peaceful purposes, thereby justifying the killing of thousands of innocent people in Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki and the radioactive pollution that had resulted from the testing of nuclear weapons by the 
countries involved in the nuclear arms race. The relevant Agency documents and publications were 
well worth reading. 
166. Some nuclear-weapon States were trying to control the Agency as they wished to conduct 
highly polluting tests that would enable them to acquire data paving the way to software hegemony. 
Thanks to the Agency, they were able to present their nuclear arsenals in their movies and media as 
the saviour of humanity Â its protector against natural and terrestrial attacks. 
167. The Agency claimed to be neutral, but, if it was neutral, why had it failed to report on probable 
clandestine activities on the part of some European countries, or on the deployment of several hundred 
nuclear warheads jeopardizing the health of the people in Europe or in occupied countries? Why was 
the Agency silent about the lost nuclear material in the United States? The security and health of 
Americans and of people in the rest of the world was at risk. A thorough and precise report on that 
issue should be made available without further delay. 
168. The AgencyÂs selective attitude, especially towards certain developing countries, had paved the 
way for economic sanctions followed by military attacks on those countries. Three Western countries 
were the source of such undue interference. Having lost influence in Iran after its Islamic Revolution, 
they had pioneered the fabrication of IranÂs Ânuclear dossierÂ. 
169. The Agency should, pursuant to its mandate, focus on controlling war-mongering by nuclearweapon 
States that, whenever they wished, used force or threatened to use it. 
170. The Agency should confront the country which, faced with a minor threat, had gunned down a 
defenceless passenger plane over the Persian Gulf and honoured the commander of the operation with 
a medal for bravery. The conduct of a country that possessed nuclear weapons and had not fulfilled its 
obligations under an international chemical convention undoubtedly posed a serious threat to global 
peace and security and called for urgent action by the international community. 
171. The Islamic Republic of Iran had achieved self-sufficiency in terms of expertise in many 
scientific areas. The intelligence agencies of some countries had therefore, like terrorists, focused on 
assassinating Iranian experts. Dr Masoud Allimohammadi, Dr Majid Shahryari and Daryoosh 
Rezaeinejad had already been martyred, and others on the assassination list were experts whose names 
and addresses were contained, for instance, in United Nations Security Council and European Union 
sanctions lists. The Agency should clear its name by ceasing to act in a manner that prepared the 
ground for such terrorist measures. Member States and the Director General should condemn them and 
thereby prove their goodwill Â and they should display courage and take steps to close the Iranian 
Ânuclear dossierÂ. 
172. The Bushehr nuclear power plant was a unique achievement, and it should prompt people 
elsewhere to show their determination to realize the idea of Ânuclear energy for all and nuclear 
weapons for noneÂ. The Agency, which had supervised the construction and commissioning of the 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 21 
Bushehr nuclear power plant, now had an opportunity, thanks to that experience, to persuade public 
opinion of the benefits of safe nuclear energy. 
173. Iran expected the Agency to behave more responsibly towards it as regards the Bushehr nuclear 
power plant and the construction of further nuclear power plants and to increase its scientific and 
technical cooperation with Iran. 
174. Despite all the obstacles placed in its way by certain countries, the Islamic Republic of Iran had 
mastered the technology of the nuclear fuel cycle and could produce fuel assemblies for research 
reactors and power reactors. It stood ready to share its know-how with other countries under Agency 
supervision. 
175. The Agency had recently prevented Iranian experts from participating in nuclear safety training 
workshops under the pretext of restrictions imposed by the Security Council. Such unprofessional 
conduct could jeopardize health everywhere. Scientific apartheid and the imposition of restrictions on 
efforts to improve nuclear safety would pave the way for accidents and was incompatible with the 
aims of the recent Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety. The Agency should not allow political 
considerations to affect what ought to be technical decisions. 
176. His country stood ready to cooperate with the Agency as it had before. It hoped that the Agency 
would recover its independent identity in the near future and that the Director General and his 
colleagues would earn credit for the Agency as a non-discriminatory body by taking principled 
decisions. 
177. The Islamic Republic of Iran would use the nuclear capabilities acquired by it solely in order to 
increase the well-being of Iranians and other peoples. To that end, Iranian specialists could cooperate 
with Agency teams in controlling and destroying nuclear weapons. 
178. If countries wished to negotiate with Iran on nuclear issues, they should examine the 
performance of the Agency in recent decades. Its decision- and policy-making structure seriously 
needed to be reformed. The composition, size and authority of the Board reflected the fact that the 
Statute had been drawn up during the Cold War, and the Statute was not compatible with the present 
situation in the world. That would be a key issue in IranÂs future talks with the Secretariat. 
179. Other issues would be how to ensure that all countries could, without discrimination, benefit 
from the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and to reassure countries as regards the non-existence 
of undeclared nuclear material and facilities in nuclear-weapon States. 
180. Iran hoped that other Member States would support its approach, with a view to making the 
world a safer place Â a peaceful world without discrimination, where hidden talents might flourish, 
science advance and prosperity spread. 
181. His country was grateful to the Agency staff members Â and especially the Agency inspectors 
Â who followed their consciences and reported professionally the real situation with regard to IranÂs 
nuclear programme. Their wise approach was important, as the Agency should be independent in its 
analyses, reporting and decision-making. 
182. Ms KAMAR (Kenya) said that her country deeply sympathized with the people of Japan, who 
were still suffering from the devastating effects of the earthquake and tsunami that had occurred there. 
Also, it admired the courage shown by those who were putting their lives at risk in order to stabilize 
the situation at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. 
183. The Government of Japan and the Secretariat were to be commended on the rapid and wellcoordinated 
interventions in response to the nuclear crisis and on the frequent information updates 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 22 
issued by them. Her country hoped that the world would continue to be kept up to date regarding the 
situation and that the lessons learned from the accident would be drawn upon in enhancing the safety 
of nuclear power plants. 
184. Her country welcomed the Director GeneralÂs report on the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety and the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, and it would like to see all Member States participating 
in the implementation of the Action Plan. 
185. Kenya attached great importance to the AgencyÂs activities in areas such as food and 
agriculture, human health, water resources management, industrial development, and environmental 
protection. It also attached great importance to the AgencyÂs safeguards activities. 
186. The AgencyÂs role in the energy sector had assumed greater significance with the escalation of 
fossil fuel prices and the unprecedented challenges of climate change. More and more Member States 
were showing an interest in adding nuclear power to their energy mix in order to meet their 
development needs. 
187. Against that background, Kenya was continuing to meet its financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the 
Agency Â including the payment of NPCs Â on time and in full. 
188. Kenya, which attached great importance to the universalization of NPT safeguards agreements 
and of additional protocols to such agreements, would like to see them concluded and implemented by 
all States. 
189. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation with Kenya was making a significant contribution to its 
efforts to establish a nuclear science and technology infrastructure. KenyaÂs CPF for the period 2011Â 
2016 reflected priorities set out in a national development policy document entitled Vision 2030, the 
highest priority being the introduction of nuclear power into KenyaÂs energy mix. Her Government 
had established a Nuclear Electricity Project Committee in order to expedite the process, and 
comprehensive legislation relating to nuclear science and technology was being developed. Kenya 
hoped that the Agency and other development partners would assist it in the area of nuclear power 
human capacity-building. 
190. In order to detect illicit movements of nuclear and other radioactive materials, radiation portal 
monitors had been installed at Mombasa Sea Port and a training programme for border personnel had 
been set up. 
191. As regards the safety of radioactive waste, KenyaÂs accession to the Joint Convention was 
imminent, and her Government was fully funding the construction of a central radioactive waste 
processing facility, which was due for completion in 2013. 
192. Kenya, which attached great importance to PACT, had recently adopted a cancer control and 
prevention strategy for 2011Â2016, and it looked forward to assistance in its implementation being 
provided through the Agency. 
193. Kenya was continuing to take a keen interest in the radiation protection of patients and medical 
staff. In that connection, it was introducing quality assurance controls with a view to improving image 
quality in diagnostic and interventional radiology. 
194. Kenya greatly appreciated the high priority assigned by the Agency to livestock rearing and the 
support provided by some Member States in that area. At the same time, it considered that there was a 
need for closer cooperation between the Agency and other development partners in helping to plan and 
implement sound national and sub-regional AU-PATTEC projects. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 23 
195. Kenya, which had been certified by the World Organization for Animal Health in May 2009 as 
being free of rinderpest, welcomed the global eradication of that disease, which had been due in no 
small measure to efforts of the Joint Division. Her delegation was looking forward to the Rinderpest 
Freedom Celebration to be held during the General ConferenceÂs current session. 
196. Mutation breeding was being tested with bananas and cassava in Kenya within the framework 
of technical cooperation projects. Farm trials were to be carried out with three cassava mutant clones 
as of October 2011, with a view to the release of at least one by the end of 2012. Banana mutant 
clones had been undergoing testing for several years for resistance and tolerance to banana streak, 
bacterial wilt and nematodes at one of KenyaÂs public research institutes. 
197. As to the use of mutation breeding techniques with wheat, mutant varieties selected for drought 
tolerance and resistance to wheat stem rust U99 would start undergoing performance trials in 2012; the 
first mutant variety resistant to wheat stem rust U99 was expected to be released in 2013. 
198. Over 100 students had so far been trained in mutation breeding and related disciplines in 
Kenyan laboratories equipped by the Agency, and Kenya has so far hosted four regional meetings for 
persons working in the mutation breeding area Â meetings attended by persons from over 
20 countries. 
199. Kenya, which was participating in the regional project ÂEnhancing the Productivity of High 
Value Crops and Income Generation with Small-Scale Irrigation TechnologiesÂ (RAF/5/058), had, 
thanks to that project, developed a capability for using nuclear techniques in quantifying water and 
nutrient use in major cropping systems. It hoped that the project would continue to receive strong 
support. 
200. Kenya, which was currently chairing the AFRA Programme Management Committee, would 
like to see more being done to support AFRA activities. The University of Nairobi had initiated a 
Master of Science programme in line with the AFRA harmonized syllabus, and Kenya would welcome 
Agency support for the programme. 
201. The arid and semi-arid climatic conditions in most parts of Kenya, coupled with climate change 
effects, had led to a decline in surface water resources. Extensive groundwater exploration and 
exploitation activities were under way in arid and semi-arid areas, and Kenya would welcome support, 
through the Agency, for enhancement of the isotope hydrology capabilities that it had already acquired 
thanks to participation in two regional projects. 
202. Kenya, which had benefited greatly from participation in the regional project ÂPromoting Selfreliance 
and Sustainability of Non-destructive Testing FacilitiesÂ (RAF/8/043), aimed to establish a 
non-destructive testing certification body by 2013. 
203. For 2012, Kenya would pay its full TCF target share and make an additional contribution of 
$20 000 in support of Agency technical cooperation activities. 
204. Mr BESSON (France) said that he would focus on three major challenges currently facing the 
Agency. The first challenge was to learn the necessary lessons from the accident at the Fukushima 
Daiichi Nuclear Power Station and to draw on them in ensuring that the world enjoyed the highest 
possible nuclear safety standards. 
205. France welcomed the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which constituted a complete road map for 
the responsible development of nuclear power through: frequent nuclear power plant safety audits; the 
broader pooling of national resources in times of emergency; sound nuclear safety arrangements 
entrusted in each country to an independent authority with the necessary powers and resources; a 
robust universal legal framework; a commitment on the part of all stakeholders to cooperation, 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 24 
transparency and information-sharing; and peer reviews of plant designs and operation and of national 
safety and crisis management structures, with enhancement of the AgencyÂs capacity to assist. 
206. Implementation of the Action Plan should start immediately, and there should be no let-up. For 
complete implementation by mid-2012, the focus should be on: the stress-testing of all existing power 
reactors, through peer reviews and with systematic publication of the results under the AgencyÂs 
supervision; optimizing crisis response capabilities, with off-site resources such as an international 
rapid action team, and establishing an international crisis management training centre; undertaking to 
export only technologies that met the highest existing safety standards and only to those countries 
which fully satisfied the relevant Agency criteria; and internationally certified conformity to the 
AgencyÂs safety standards before the beginning of construction work. 
207. The Director General, who had called on all Member States to move from the Action Plan to 
actual actions, could count on the full support of France. In its view, the creation of a new system of 
nuclear governance could not wait until the General ConferenceÂs next session. 
208. The second challenge was to ensure that full advantage was taken of nuclear power generation 
complying with the highest safety standards. 
209. Every State had the right to make its own energy choices, but a civilian nuclear power 
programme was Â and would remain Â a formidable asset in the effort to Â at one and the same 
time Â achieve energy security, maintain the purchasing power of individuals and enterprises, create 
innovative industries and combat global warming. Reducing its carbon dependency and that of Europe 
as a whole was a categorical imperative for France, which was why it had reaffirmed the position of 
nuclear power in its energy mix. 
210. All States should be able to benefit from nuclear power in the same way as France, which would 
continue to respond to all requests for cooperation in the nuclear field from States that complied 
scrupulously with the non-proliferation rules. To that end, it had established the International Institute 
for Nuclear Energy, which was now fully operational. 
211. The third challenge was to fight tirelessly against all attempts to misuse nuclear energy. 
212. The proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery constituted a major threat to 
peace and security in the world, and it was vital that the international community respond resolutely to 
proliferation crises. 
213. The Iranian nuclear programme posed an unacceptable threat to the non-proliferation regime 
and to regional stability. The enrichment activities of Iran and its failure to cooperate fully with the 
Agency were causes of profound concern regarding the real purpose of its nuclear programme. 
214. The Director GeneralÂs latest report on ÂImplementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement and 
relevant provisions of Security Council resolutions in the Islamic Republic of IranÂ had referred to the 
AgencyÂs concerns, based on extensive and comprehensive information, about possible military 
dimensions to IranÂs programme. France was looking forward to considering a follow-up report by the 
Director General in November. 
215. France was convinced that a negotiated solution was still possible, but for Iran the cost of not 
changing direction quickly would only grow. 
216. The DPRK, which was also acting in flagrant violation of its international obligations, should, 
without delay, permit the return of Agency inspectors and give them access to all its nuclear facilities. 
GC(55)/OR.1 
19 September 2011, Page 25 
217. The Agency report relating to the Syrian Arab Republic published in June 2011 clearly 
established that Syria had violated its international obligations. The Syrian Government should 
cooperate without further delay with the Agency in clarifying its nuclear activities Â past and present. 
218. France was supporting the actions being taken to strengthen and universalize the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system, and within the Nuclear Suppliers Group it was pressing for nuclear trade to be 
subject to rigorous and universal controls. 
219. As regards the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism, coordination of the international 
efforts being made to strengthen nuclear security was essential for the future peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy and should therefore be a top priority for the international community. 
220. A strengthened Agency would have a major role to play in the new system of nuclear 
governance, and France would be steadfast in its support for the Agency in that role.

5. Arrangements for the Conference 
(a) Adoption of the agenda and allocation of items for initial discussion 
1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the agenda for the 
current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in documents GC(55)/1 and 
Add.1. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, it had recommended that the items 
be taken up for discussion as indicated in those documents. It had also recommended that the order of 
items be as set out in those documents. 
2. The General CommitteeÂs recommendations were accepted. 
(b) Closing date of the session and opening date of the next session 
3. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the Conference 
set Friday, 23 September 2011, as the closing date of the fifty-fifth regular session, and Monday, 
17 September 2012, as the opening date of the fifty-sixth regular session. 
4. The General CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 (resumed) 
(GC(55)/2) 
5. Mr MONTEJO (Philippines) said that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power 
plant had shaken the international communityÂs perceptions of nuclear power, including with respect 
to the safety of existing and proposed new nuclear power plants, had demonstrated the immense effect 
of natural disasters on the overall safety of nuclear power plants and had compelled a number of 
countries, including his own, to rethink their national positions on nuclear power. However, as oil 
prices continued to soar and concerns over climate change persisted, countries continued to turn to the 
Agency for assistance with the development or expansion of their national nuclear power programmes. 
Although the Fukushima accident had posed challenges, it had also provided opportunities for 
Member States to discuss ways of improving the AgencyÂs work in the area of nuclear safety. The 
Agency was uniquely placed to assist Member States with the development of safety infrastructure, 
and to promote international cooperation in nuclear safety. It should continue to provide assistance to 
countries like his own that were still considering the inclusion of nuclear power in their national 
energy mix. 
6. The Philippines appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in response to the Fukushima accident, in 
particular the convening of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety. However, events had 
highlighted the need to enhance the role of the Agency in providing Member States and the general 
public with timely, objective and accurate information on nuclear emergencies, and in performing an 
integrated analysis of all available data to facilitate the planning by countries of possible emergency 
protective measures. The Philippines looked forward to working with the Agency in improving the 
organizationÂs nuclear and radiological incident and emergency preparedness and response systems. 
His country supported the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety developed pursuant to the Ministerial 
Conference, which would serve as a building block for the development of more specific measures to 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 2 
strengthen nuclear safety. It called on all Member States to enhance their political and financial 
support in order to facilitate the planÂs early implementation. 
7. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme continued to help countries achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals, and the Philippines acknowledged the significant contribution made 
by Agency technical cooperation projects, in particular in the areas of health and nutrition, 
environmental resource management and agricultural and industrial productivity. In October 2010, his 
country had signed its CPF with the Agency. 
8. With regard to human health, the imPACT mission undertaken in March 2011 had enabled his 
countryÂs health authorities to assess the national cancer action plan and identify areas for 
improvement. The inclusion of the Philippines in a network of regional training centres on cancer 
control and radiotherapy would give a major boost to the countryÂs national programme for cancer 
control and treatment, particularly in rural areas. 
9. In the field of nuclear medicine, the radioisotope laboratory established with Agency assistance 
was now ready to receive the technetium-99m generator, and researchers had received training in 
various aspects of the production process. It was hoped that the production facility would reduce the 
costs of nuclear medicine procedures using technetium-99m. 
10. Turning to the environment, he welcomed the AgencyÂs current focus on water. As a pilot 
country for the AgencyÂs water availability enhancement project, the Philippines was undertaking 
activities aimed at developing sustainable and socially responsible water resource management plans. 
It hoped that the Agency would continue its work to assist Member States in strengthening their 
national capacities to conduct comprehensive water resource assessments, in which field it had hosted 
a national workshop in April 2011. In 2010, the Philippines had been re-designated as an IAEA 
collaborating centre for the application of nuclear techniques in harmful algal bloom studies. 
11. The Peaceful Uses Initiative was a useful mechanism to enhance the AgencyÂs role in promoting 
the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and to assist States committed to their non-proliferation 
obligations in realizing their development goals. His country urged those States in a position to do so 
to contribute to that worthwhile mechanism, and it acknowledged the extrabudgetary contributions 
received from the United States and Japan through the Initiative to finance the PhilippinesÂ footnote-a/ 
project on the establishment of an electron beam facility. 
12. His countryÂs commitment to preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material 
was embodied in its national nuclear security plan finalized in cooperation with the Agency. The 
commissioning of the Megaports facilities at the port of Manila had marked a milestone in bilateral 
cooperation with the United States in the field of nuclear security. The Philippines was also working 
closely with Australia, the United States and fellow members of the ASEAN through the Global 
Threat Reduction Initiative to secure radioactive sources in the region. 
13. In view of the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation, it was essential to strengthen the 
AgencyÂs nuclear verification capabilities and establish confidence in the peaceful nature of nuclear 
activities. The conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, and the 
provision of the Agency with the tools and resources to implement a credible verification system 
effectively, would go a long way towards reducing the risk of nuclear proliferation and maintaining 
international peace and security. 
14. With regard to the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, his country had consistently advocated a 
peaceful and just solution to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and it was committed to 
helping create an environment of trust and confidence conducive to the DPRKÂs engagement with the 
international community.

15. The Philippines shared the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and strongly supported the 
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a way to contribute to international peace and security. 
ASEAN had established the Southeast Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone, and the Philippines 
welcomed the progress made in recent discussions with nuclear-weapon States regarding their possible 
accession to the treaty establishing that zone. It also welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to 
convene a forum to discuss experience of possible relevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East. His country was committed to contributing to the success of that forum, 
which would serve as an important confidence-building measure and should contribute to the planned 
2012 conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other 
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, as called for in final document of the 
2010 NPT Review Conference. 
16. The AgencyÂs roadmap for the coming months would not be easy to achieve in the light of 
political realities and financial constraints. It was time for Member States to set aside their differences 
with a view to advancing common objectives. His country remained committed to working with other 
Member States in a spirit of mutual respect and constructive dialogue, and to participating actively in 
all efforts to enhance the AgencyÂs work. 
17. Mr ALBORNOZ (Ecuador) stressed his countryÂs commitment to the Agency, which was the 
only intergovernmental organization with the expertise and mandate to manage the technical aspects 
of nuclear safety and security. Given the democratic nature of the Agency, all countries, and especially 
developing countries, should be able to exercise without discrimination their inalienable and sovereign 
right to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. However, the 
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi facility had brought home some important lessons, in particular the 
lesson that, while nuclear safety and security were primarily the responsibility of each sovereign 
country, there was a need to take account of transboundary consequences and the consequent need for 
inclusive, strong and binding multilateral agreements. Nuclear safety and security were essential in the 
use and development of nuclear energy and standards of control needed to be continually strengthened 
at international level. 
18. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety provided a solid basis for following up on the results 
of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011. The Fukushima accident had 
marked a turning point in the history of nuclear energy and it was incumbent on the Agency to work 
together with Member States to ensure that there was absolute transparency in the nuclear safety area 
in order to rebuild confidence in the use of nuclear technology. Ecuador would continue to support all 
efforts in that direction within the Board of Governors. 
19. The AgencyÂs mandate went beyond control; indeed its primary role, especially vis-Ã -vis 
developing States, was to collaborate actively in building capacity and infrastructure to ensure the safe 
development and use of nuclear material and radioactive sources, and to transfer nuclear technology 
and expertise through the education and training of both nuclear regulators and operators. 
20. In that connection, he highlighted the importance of the support provided by the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme. In Ecuador, efforts had been made to strengthen operational 
capabilities for maintaining and upgrading laboratory equipment and nuclear instrumentation. The 
Government planned to mobilize resources to that end and had succeeded in raising awareness in 
various sectors, and among students, of the benefits of nuclear techniques and applications. 
21. Optimizing water use was another pressing issue which would be discussed at the Scientific 
Forum that was taking place in parallel with the General Conference. Ecuador was working on 
enhancing management of irrigation, in order to improve agricultural productivity, by determining the 
water balance, taking measurements of soil moisture to improve its use, and determining an 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 4 
appropriate irrigation schedule, thus promoting farming in rural areas, which had a highly beneficial 
social impact. 
22. His country was grateful to the Agency for supporting one of its flagship projects which should 
help solve innumerable public health problems caused by a lack of domestic supplies of biological 
tissues needed to treat patients with, inter alia, second- and third-degree burns, tumours and bone 
fractures. The countryÂs Ministry of Public Health was implementing the necessary actions to ensure 
the projectÂs sustainability in the medium and long term. 
23. Ecuador had high hopes for the upcoming technical cooperation cycle. The projects it had 
submitted fell within the main areas of Agency cooperation and EcuadorÂs CPF. They were also in line 
with the Millennium Development Goals, with an emphasis on food security and health. 
24. Strengthening overall security of disused radioactive sources and radioactive waste was highly 
important and his country would be making efforts to that end during the next cycle. 
25. The Director GeneralÂs visit to Ecuador had been some indication of the momentum achieved in 
the nuclear energy applications area in his country and should serve to strengthen the countryÂs ties 
with the Agency. As the Director General had found, the seed that the Agency had sown in Ecuador 
had borne fruit. The Government was investing heavily in health programmes in which nuclear energy 
played a leading role. In addition, an ambitious programme was under way which would see four new 
electron accelerators and two cyclotrons installed in public hospitals in three of the countryÂs main 
cities in the near future. 
26. Mr WANG Yiren (China) said that, over the preceding year, the Agency had provided guidance 
and support through its technical cooperation programme to countries launching nuclear programmes, 
and had actively promoted the application of nuclear technologies in such areas as human health, food 
and agriculture, water resources management and the environment. It had also made ongoing efforts to 
promote the universal application of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols 
and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the safeguards regime. In addition, Member States 
had been given strong support with nuclear security and capacity building. 
27. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March had caused alarm in the 
international community and placed nuclear safety issues in the spotlight. China welcomed the 
AgencyÂs response to the accident. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June had 
helped foster international cooperation and enhance nuclear safety and emergency response at global 
level. In the immediate aftermath of the accident, the Chinese government had activated its nuclear 
emergency coordination mechanism and had acted in accordance with its nuclear emergency response 
plan. It had made every effort to mitigate the impact of the accident, offering assistance to the 
Japanese authorities and dispatching experts to Japan. 
28. Despite the implications of the Fukushima accident for the momentum of global nuclear energy 
development, nuclear energy still remained one of the main options in the light of climate change 
concerns and the shortage of alternative energy sources, and its development should not cease. The 
international community should use the accident as an opportunity to review the experience gained 
and lessons learned, to strengthen nuclear safety and to promote the safe development of nuclear 
energy. 
29. China consistently followed the principle of Âsafety firstÂ in its nuclear energy development. 
Following the Fukushima accident, it had performed safety audits of all its nuclear facilities, had taken 
steps to strengthen the safe management of operating nuclear installations, and had comprehensively 
reviewed the safety of nuclear power plants under construction. Approval of new projects had been 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 5 
suspended pending the adoption of a new safety plan, and investment in R&D on new safety-related 
technologies had been increased. 
30. China continued to make progress in the area of nuclear energy. The China Experimental Fast 
Reactor had commenced grid power generation in July 2011, and Unit 2 of the Ling Ao II power plant 
had started commercial operation in August, bringing the total number of operating nuclear power 
generating units to 14. His country was firmly committed to the further safe and efficient development 
of nuclear energy and was willing to share its experience in that field with other countries. 
31. China continued to meet its international obligations concerning nuclear security Â an area that 
also deserved priority attention. It had ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the amendment to the CPPNM. It was currently working with other 
countries to establish a nuclear security demonstration centre and appreciated the assistance it had 
received in that regard from the Agency. His Government had decided to contribute US $200 000 to 
the Nuclear Security Fund to enhance the nuclear security capacity of the Asia-Pacific region. 
32. Nuclear energy was a mature, clean and competitive source of energy and played an important 
role in meeting energy demand and addressing climate change. The Agency, in addition to its dual role 
of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, 
should play a leading role in helping to rebuild the international communityÂs confidence in nuclear 
energy development. To that end, it should give priority to the following areas in its future work. 
Firstly, it should review the positive experience gained and lessons learned from the Fukushima 
accident and implement the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. It should promote the universal 
application of safety standards and enhance the ability of nuclear power installations to withstand 
multiple natural disasters. It should also review existing safety-related international conventions with a 
view to strengthening communication and sharing of information, improving the nuclear accident 
notification mechanism and enhancing the effectiveness of nuclear safety and emergency assessment. 
China would also welcome closer collaboration between Member States and the Agency to enhance 
nuclear safety capabilities. Secondly, the Agency should strengthen the technical assistance provided 
to developing countries, particularly in connection with the establishment and enhancement of national 
nuclear infrastructures. It should also assist newcomer countries to develop their nuclear energy 
policies and nuclear safety legislation and regulatory regimes, and to build a safety culture. Thirdly, 
the Agency should strengthen the safeguards regime and continue to promote the universal application 
of comprehensive safeguards agreements and the additional protocol. 
33. The Agency must maintain its objectivity and impartiality on sensitive and topical nuclear 
issues and continue to play a constructive role in settling such issues through diplomacy. China, for its 
part, would continue its efforts to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the 
settlement of the Iranian nuclear issue. 
34. Mr BADIA (Monaco) expressed his countryÂs sympathy to the people of Japan following the 
tsunami and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. The AgencyÂs 
role in establishing a global nuclear safety framework should be strengthened, including protection 
against extreme natural disasters and emergency response. 
35. Despite its limited resources, his country was committed to playing its part in the international 
communityÂs efforts to increase nuclear safety and security and develop the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. At national level, the Government had taken all necessary measures to assess radiation and 
chemical risks and protect the population. At international level, it had concluded a partnership 
agreement with the Agency under PACT. Cancer was a major cause of death, especially in developing 
countries, and radiotherapy was a proven treatment technique which benefited over 50% of patients. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 6 
36. His country was proud to host the IAEA Environment Laboratories, which were celebrating 
their 50th anniversary in 2011 and, since the preceding year, had extended their range of activities to 
deal with land as well as marine pollution. The Marine Environmental Studies Laboratory, in 
collaboration with the Monaco Scientific Center, had been conducting major research into radioactive 
marine pollution and developing pollution prevention and control techniques. 
37. His country was willing to provide financial support for selected initiatives and host specialist 
conferences to promote scientific progress and cooperation. On 29 September, Monaco and the 
Agency were due to sign a bilateral collaboration agreement and the supplementary agreement to the 
headquarters agreement for the IAEA Environment Laboratories, which would further strengthen his 
countryÂs links with the organization. 
38. Mr HOGAN (Ireland) said that his country greatly appreciated the vital and unique role the 
Agency played in promoting safe, secure and peaceful nuclear technologies. Though Ireland 
maintained a policy not to use nuclear energy for power generation, it valued its membership of the 
Agency. 
39. His country had always been committed to effective multilateralism as the best way of 
upholding the rule of law, ensuring international peace and security and advancing international 
cooperation. It considered the Agency an example of multilateralism at its best. Its programmes played 
an essential role in advancing the Millennium Development Goals in such areas as health, agriculture, 
water management and environmental monitoring, while its work in cancer treatment, in which the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme played a valuable role, showed nuclear science being 
applied to bring real and significant benefits in the lives of real people. 
40. With regard to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi facility, he expressed his GovernmentÂs 
deepest sympathies to the people of Japan and paid tribute to the courage and determination of the 
workers at the plant. 
41. Responding to the accident had obviously, and rightly, been a priority for the Agency and the 
international community, focusing global attention on the importance of an effective international 
framework to ensure global implementation of the highest nuclear safety standards. The Agency 
should, and did, form the centre and focus of that work. 
42. The urgency and commitment of the Director General in responding to the accident had been 
commendable. The IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011 had begun the 
process of ensuring that lessons were learned from Fukushima, while the IAEA Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety, to be endorsed at the 55th session of the General Conference, should significantly 
advance that work. It was important that the plan be implemented by Member States with commitment 
and ambition. 
43. The events at Fukushima had powerfully reminded the world that, while specific safety 
provisions remained a matter for each country to decide upon, the potential transboundary impact of a 
nuclear accident, and the risks to human health and the environment, meant that nuclear safety in any 
one country was a matter of concern to all others, whether or not they had chosen to develop a nuclear 
energy industry of their own. International cooperation was essential in order to provide assurances, 
including to the public, that the right measures were in place and that they were being effectively 
implemented. The AgencyÂs safety standards should form the basis of each countryÂs regulations. 
Safety standards and practices were also best supported and enhanced by international peer reviews 
and knowledge sharing, both of which were well served by Agency programmes and mechanisms, and 
the organizationÂs practical assistance to Member States. His country encouraged States to make full 
use of those services. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 7 
44. Transparency and effective communications were an essential part of nuclear safety and 
emergency response, one aspect which was effective communication among governments in relation 
to the marine transport of nuclear material, a matter to which Ireland attached great importance. With 
the involvement of the Agency, his country continued to seek to advance the ongoing dialogue 
between coastal and shipping States on that matter. 
45. His country had significant stakeholder interest in the issue of nuclear reprocessing and it had 
long held the view that that activity gave rise to real and substantial safety and environmental 
concerns. A particular concern for his country was radioactive discharges from reprocessing 
operations into a shared marine environment. It therefore welcomed the ongoing work of the Agency 
and the OSPAR Commission for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic 
and would continue to work with them to try to minimize the risk and environmental impact of such 
activities. 
46. The Agency played a significant role in implementing and advancing the objectives of the NPT. 
Ireland welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to organize a forum on experience of possible 
relevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in November 2011, which 
was an important contribution to work on the organization of a conference in 2012 on the 
establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. 
47. His Government hoped that discussion of Middle East issues at the General Conference would 
advance efforts to implement the resolution on the Middle East adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and 
Extension Conference. Any actions that might undermine those efforts must be avoided. 
48. The AgencyÂs work on safeguards and verification underpinned international confidence and 
cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It was vital that States met their obligations in that 
regard and that the Agency had the tools and authority to act effectively and decisively. A 
comprehensive safeguards agreement along with an additional protocol constituted the essential 
verification standard and Ireland encouraged States yet to adopt those measures to do so without delay. 
49. It was important to bring cases of non-compliance swiftly to resolution and his country called 
on Iran to cooperate proactively with the Agency to clarify its nuclear activities, in particular those 
that appeared to have a military dimension. Iran must meet unequivocally its commitments under its 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and Subsidiary Arrangements, and must act upon the relevant 
resolutions of the Board of Governors and the United Nations Security Council. 
50. The DPRK must comply unconditionally and without delay with its international obligations 
and resume full cooperation with the Agency. Ireland urged the DPRK to abandon and dismantle 
completely its nuclear weapons-related programme in a transparent and irreversible manner. 
51. Equally, Ireland called on Syria to cooperate fully with the Agency to resolve issues 
surrounding the likely nuclear facility at Dair Alzour that had been destroyed in 2008. 
52. For more than fifty years the Agency had played an important role in helping to maintain 
international peace and security and promote a culture of safety and security in the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. It was incumbent on Member States to ensure the organization had the political, 
technical and financial support it needed to meet its responsibilities effectively. Equally it was 
incumbent on the Agency to advance the efficiency, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and transparency of 
its structures and practices. In the coming years, nuclear technology would impact on peopleÂs daily 
lives in ever more sophisticated ways, which would increase the range of roles of the Agency and the 
complexity of the challenges facing it, including in the areas of safety and security. Ireland remained 
committed to working with the Agency and other Member States to attain their common goals. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 8 
53. Mr OUANE (Mali) said that the current session of the General Conference was taking place at a 
time when the international community was facing a multitude of threats, including terrorism, 
proliferation of weapons, climate change, pandemics and food insecurity. Individual States were 
powerless to control the situation. A global system for security management was needed. To meet 
those challenges, the Agency must establish a new, robust verification system that took into account 
the changes experienced in recent years. Now, more than ever, all Member States must support the 
Agency in its efforts to meet the new challenges. 
54. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had highlighted the challenges to be 
met in the field of nuclear governance at national and global level. The rapid response of the Agency 
and the international community had helped mitigate the consequences of the accident, and his country 
was confident that useful lessons would be learned and safety standards strengthened, so that nuclear 
energy could continue to contribute to peace, health and prosperity all over the world. Africa should 
adopt a coherent and proactive approach to take advantage of the potential opportunities. 
55. Non-proliferation of nuclear weapons remained a challenge for the whole world. All States 
should comply strictly with the provisions of the NPT and accede to the CTBT. Mali welcomed the 
progress made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference and the recent international initiatives to facilitate 
the entry into force of the CTBT. It was particularly appreciative of the fact that the United States and 
the Russian Federation had signed the New START. 
56. Almost all countries in Africa had acceded to the Pelindaba Treaty, and the African 
Commission on Nuclear Energy had been established at the first conference of the State Parties to the 
Treaty. He called upon the international community to provide support to enable Africa to build on 
that achievement and utilize its resources for sustainable development. 
57. His country attached considerable importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme, from which it derived great benefit in such key socio-economic sectors as radiation safety 
and security, human and animal health, agriculture, food, and water resources management. His 
Government was particularly grateful for the sustained technical and financial assistance it had 
received with the establishment of a national nuclear regulatory authority, a nuclear medicine service 
in the main hospital in the capital, and several laboratories. It had also benefited from training and 
expert missions in connection with the construction of its first radiotherapy centre. It was involved in a 
model project on use of the SIT for area-wide tsetse and trypanosomosis control which had been 
expanded and strengthened since the advent of PATTEC. In addition, Agency assistance had enabled 
Mali to acquire considerable expertise in infant nutrition and malaria control. 
58. The establishment of a legal framework for the safe management of all nuclear technologies 
used at national level posed a major challenge for Mali. The multifaceted support of the Agency would 
help strengthen its fledgling national regulatory infrastructure. 
59. The 2012Â2013 programming cycle, which was in the process of preparation, would be based 
on MaliÂs second CPF and would focus on such areas as radiation safety and security, human health, 
control of malaria and malnutrition, evaluation of erosion and sedimentation and exploration of 
groundwater, and energy planning. 
60. Mr YAMANI (Saudi Arabia) commended the Agency on its efforts to realize the vision of 
atoms for peace and enhance the role of nuclear energy in meeting increasing global energy needs, 
while promoting an international security and safety regime that protected humankind from the spectre 
of a nuclear disaster. 
61. While his country appreciated the AgencyÂs technical assistance to Member States, it looked 
forward to more effective management of the programme and, in particular, a speedier response to the 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 9 
needs of Member States, and it hoped that its recent experience in that regard was not indicative of the 
efficiency of the programme. 
62. He stressed the importance of water resources management and of the Scientific Forum on 
water that was being held concurrently with the General Conference. The fact that greater attention 
was being paid to such a vital issue was a welcome development. 
63. The establishment by the Saudi Arabian Government of the King Abdullah City for Atomic and 
Renewable Energy, to develop peaceful uses of nuclear energy, set national targets in accordance with 
a specific schedule and draw up a national strategy, reflected the sound approach that was being 
adopted in his country with respect to the use of nuclear energy. The existing institutions guaranteed 
transparency and the avoidance of conflicts of interests. They pursued R&D strategies and strategies 
aimed at the local production of nuclear technology, and built effective partnerships with other 
countries. 
64. Saudi Arabia had participated in the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety and in 
subsequent meetings to draft the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety recommended by the 
Ministerial Conference. While the draft action plan fell short of his countryÂs aspirations and those of 
many other Member States, it should be adopted as a first step that would hopefully be reinforced in 
the future. The Agency should conduct detailed assessments of the results achieved under the action 
plan and turn the lessons learned to good account in improving global nuclear safety, radiation 
protection and emergency preparedness. 
65. His country had paid its contribution to the 2011 Regular Budget in full, as well as its voluntary 
contribution to the technical cooperation programme, despite its reservations concerning the manner in 
which the TCF was financed. It would continue to meet its financial obligations, although the reduced 
efficiency and speed of the AgencyÂs response to his countryÂs needs, especially in light of its 
large-scale nuclear programme for the years ahead, had undermined its former trust. He expressed the 
hope that his country would reach an understanding and find arrangements that would restore its faith 
in the importance of supporting the TCF. 
66. Saudi Arabia supported the Regulatory Cooperation Forum, in which countries with advanced 
nuclear programmes provided assistance to those with less developed programmes and offered 
guidance on nuclear safety. It also supported the establishment of advisory committees on safety in all 
geographical regions to spread knowledge and experience of sound safety practices, and the dispatch 
of missions to review and develop the capacities of national institutions responsible for emergency 
preparedness and response. 
67. An in-depth study of the issue of assurance of nuclear fuel supplies for peaceful nuclear 
programmes should be undertaken by all Member States of the Agency in order to reach a consensus 
on how to address the technical, legal, economic and political aspects thereof in a manner consistent 
with the Statute. No restrictions whatsoever should be imposed on the right of all States to develop 
nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes, including the right to develop national nuclear 
fuel cycle capacities. An open-ended working group would be the best forum in which to discuss the 
issue. 
68. The Agency was the sole body mandated to verify StatesÂ compliance with their safeguards 
obligations and prevent proliferation. His country supported the AgencyÂs endeavours to consolidate 
the safeguards regime. 
69. Saudi Arabia emphasized the importance of serious and ongoing action to achieve universality 
of the NPT in order to strengthen international and regional security and stability, especially in the 
Middle East where Israel still remained outside the non-proliferation regime. In that context, his 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 10 
country trusted that the Agency would play an effective role in preparing the planned 2012 conference 
on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East region, and it hoped that the forum on nuclear-weapon-free zones to be held in 
November 2011 would provide a useful source of international experience in that regard. 
70. Mr BASHARI (Sudan) thanked the Agency for the support it gave to the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy in developing countries and emphasized the importance of ensuring balance between 
safeguards and verification activities and the technical cooperation programme. The Agency had an 
important role to play not only in supporting the safeguards regime and promoting the establishment 
of nuclear-weapon-free zones, but also in taking resolute steps to ensure that all Member States had 
access to nuclear energy as a viable option for achieving peaceful goals such as food security, disease 
control, medical treatment, the eradication of poverty and the development of human resources. His 
country appreciated the AgencyÂs action to achieve socio-economic progress in developing countries. 
It commended in particular PACT and the efforts to apply nuclear technology in the area of water 
resources. 
71. Sudan expressed its solidarity with the people of Japan in the aftermath of the disaster that had 
afflicted that country earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there was no alternative to the use of clean and 
safe nuclear energy for economic development, preservation of the environment and prevention of the 
pollution caused by other types of energy. The Sudanese Government would therefore continue to 
implement its national nuclear programme and it looked forward to receiving further Agency support. 
72. Sudan had participated in the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety and would spare no 
effort to implement its recommendations and the resulting IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
73. He was pleased to announce that his country had submitted its nuclear legislation to the Council 
of Ministers and subsequently to parliament for enactment. An independent regulatory authority had 
been established to oversee all nuclear and radiation-related activities. 
74. As human resources were the mainstay of all development projects, Sudan had taken steps, in 
cooperation with the Agency and other organizations, to train human resources in all fields of 
specialization of relevance to the implementation of its nuclear programme. Such training was 
required to operate the countryÂs first research reactor. Sudan continued to rely on Agency technical 
support and oversight for that vital project. 
75. His country was deeply grateful to the Agency for its assistance in preparing technical 
cooperation projects for the 2012Â2013 cycle in the areas of nuclear power, food security, human 
health, water resources, animal health and nuclear reactors. Sudan had begun implementing a key 
project involving use of the SIT to combat malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. With Agency assistance, 
Sudan had succeeded in obtaining funds from the Islamic Development Bank to implement the project 
and it had established all the necessary administrative and technical structures. It looked forward to 
further Agency support and oversight during all stages of the project. 
76. Sudan was also closely involved in the planning and implementation of AFRA projects, which 
had proved highly successful. The AFRA Network for Education in Nuclear Science and Technology 
would be featured in a side event during the General Conference. Sudan had hosted two AFRA 
regional events, as well as receiving a number of experts involved in regional projects. 
77. Sudan complied fully with all its obligations under relevant international instruments that it had 
ratified and it urged all States that had not yet done so to ratify those instruments at the earliest 
opportunity in the interests of peace and sustainable development. It commended the Agency on its 
organization of a review of the legal instruments deposited with it during the General Conference and 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 11 
encouraged it to continue doing so in the future. Sudan had established a committee to study existing 
legal instruments aimed at organizing and coordinating peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
78. Everyone was aware of the risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. All States in the 
region had acceded to the NPT and demonstrated their resolve to take practical steps towards the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone except Israel, which continued to challenge the 
international community by its refusal to accede to the Treaty and to place all its nuclear facilities 
under comprehensive Agency safeguards, and by its rejection of all international initiatives in that 
connection. Its conduct in that regard was impeding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
Sudan called for immediate action to compel Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency oversight. The Arab Group was convinced of the need to maintain the item on 
Israeli nuclear capabilities on the agenda of the General Conference, since the Agency was the 
technical body responsible for nuclear verification. 
79. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had underscored the importance of IsraelÂs accession to the 
NPT and the placement of its nuclear activities under comprehensive Agency safeguards and, to that 
end, had decided to organize an international conference in 2012 on the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The Agency had been tasked with preparing the 
reference documents for the conference. His country stressed the need to take urgent practical steps to 
prepare for that conference and it urged all parties concerned to take speedy action to ensure its 
success. A successful outcome would boost the non-proliferation regime and thus promote 
international peace and security. 
80. Mr YOUNIS (Egypt) said that his country had had an interest in nuclear energy and its 
applications for more than half a century because of the potential contribution they could make, if 
properly used, to the socio-economic development of humankind. Throughout that period it had 
cooperated closely with the Agency in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the country by 
developing scientific and operational capacities and actively participating in all the AgencyÂs 
activities. His country was also committed to the application of global nuclear safety standards and 
those adopted by the Agency. 
81. Egypt had adopted implementing regulations for its law on the organization of nuclear and 
radiation-related activities that had been enacted the preceding year and it hoped to promulgate them 
shortly. The law provided for the establishment of an independent nuclear and radiation safety 
authority which would be subject to the control of the Prime Minister, in order to ensure the complete 
independence of the regulatory authority from the parties involved in nuclear and radiation-related 
activities. 
82. Projects under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme included assistance with 
optimum use of research laboratories and training of human resources in the design and operation of 
such laboratories and associated facilities. 
83. The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident had cast a shadow over the use of nuclear energy 
throughout the world. He thanked the Director General for convening the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety to study the accident and draw useful lessons from it. The most important lesson 
learned related to the need to support nuclear safety standards in the nuclear industry and ensure close 
cooperation among all stakeholders in order to protect humankind from the potential consequences of 
similar accidents in the future. Egypt had reviewed the specifications for its first nuclear power plant 
in coordination with a group of Agency experts and was determined to apply the key lessons learned 
from the accident, as well as any further lessons learned in due course. 
84. Owing to the new political situation in Egypt following the revolution of 25 January, the 
Cabinet of Ministers had deferred submission of the specifications for the first nuclear power plant so 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 12 
that the draft could be presented to parliament for adoption. A further aim was to reaffirm support for 
an important and essential programme: an energy option for the future that would meet the 
requirements of sustainable development. 
85. Calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons and the threat they posed to humankind had 
intensified in recent years and the State Parties to the NPT had agreed on an action plan to achieve 
nuclear disarmament. However, that trend had not been accompanied by action to boost the AgencyÂs 
activities in support of nuclear disarmament, even though one of the objectives under the Medium 
Term Strategy 2006Â2011 was to contribute, as appropriate, to effective verification of nuclear arms 
control and reduction agreements, including nuclear disarmament, in accordance with Article II of the 
Statute. Egypt urged all Member States to take serious steps to achieve that goal. 
86. The Middle East remained a special case in efforts to rid the world of nuclear weapons, as 
demonstrated by the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review Conference on the convening of a 
conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in that region. The Agency had been tasked with preparing the basic documents for that 
conference and his country welcomed that positive development. The AgencyÂs credibility depended 
to a large extent on the seriousness with which its Member States addressed the issue of nuclear 
disarmament in the Middle East and the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear 
facilities in the region. Their action should reflect a consensus on the importance of the goal to be 
attained. 
87. Although 19 years had elapsed since the adoption by the General Conference of a resolution 
calling on all States in the Middle East to apply comprehensive safeguards, Israel had taken no steps to 
achieve that objective. The Agency should fulfil the mandate assigned to it under the resolutions 
adopted at previous sessions of the General Conference and disclose whatever information it 
possessed concerning Israeli nuclear facilities that should be placed under Agency safeguards. 
88. The General Conference should reaffirm the responsibility of the Agency, as the executive arm 
of the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime, to take serious action to address the nuclear 
threat in the Middle East region by dealing with resolutions under relevant agenda items in a manner 
that guaranteed respect for the NPT regime and promoted regional and international peace and 
security. To that end, Egypt was again submitting to the current session a draft resolution on the 
application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, an issue of increasing importance in view of the 
international consensus that had emerged at the latest NPT Review Conference in support of serious 
practical steps to achieve universality of the NPT in the Middle East through IsraelÂs accession to the 
Treaty and the placement of all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
89. Egypt urged the Agency to act on its mandate to prepare reference documents for the planned 
2012 conference on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, including a document on the 
scope, and options for the application of measures to verify the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the 
region, and a draft model agreement on the establishment of such a zone, based on its previous work in 
the Middle East and its experience with other nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
90. The verification regime applied by the Agency, which had been accepted by the 
non-nuclear-weapon States in the region as parties to the NPT, was based on the assessment of 
material evidence and not on politicization, selectivity and the application of double standards. It was 
also based on respect for the principle of non-interference in countriesÂ internal affairs. 
91. His country also supported the convening by the Agency in November 2011 of a preparatory 
forum, to be attended by the Arab States and Israel, on experience in the establishment of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones and the relevance thereof for the Middle East. It also reaffirmed the right 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 13 
of the peoples of the Middle East to freedom from the threat to their security posed by nuclear 
weapons. Serious action must be taken to achieve equal security for all States in the region. 
92. Mr AHMED GAAS (Ethiopia) said that the Agency continued to support, through technical 
cooperation activities, his GovernmentÂs efforts to develop national nuclear science and technology 
infrastructure. The countryÂs CPF for the period 2012Â2017 had been prepared via intensive 
consultations with Agency staff and reflected the agreement between the Agency and his Government 
on nuclear science and technology that could contribute directly and cost-effectively to national 
development, as envisaged in EthiopiaÂs 2010Â2015 Growth and Transformation Plan. 
93. With regard to nuclear science and technology applications, Ethiopia urged the Agency to 
assign high priority to agricultural and livestock development in Africa. It welcomed the steps taken 
by the Agency to formalize the collaborative framework in support of PATTEC. The tsetse fly 
continued to pose a threat to lives and livelihoods in Ethiopia and was a constraint on livestock 
production in Africa. African animal trypanosomosis was prevalent in the fertile lowlands in the 
western and southern part of the country, where some 240 000 km2 were infested by five different 
species of tsetse fly. Since 1997, Ethiopia had committed substantial resources under the Southern 
Tsetse Eradication Project to adapting technologies and testing them locally in the Southern Rift 
Valley, prior to setting up a large-scale national programme. That project had been launched with the 
objective of building national capacity in pest management, including the SIT, and eradicating tsetse 
from an isolated valley with a total area of 25 000 km2. With the support of a number of national and 
international organizations, including the African Development Bank, efforts to eradicate tsetse and 
trypanosomosis through area-wide integrated pest management had been harmonized. To date, 
remarkable progress had been made and a substantial number of communities had benefited. That 
trend needed to be intensified through integrated development, with proper land use planning and land 
management. Ethiopia counted on the support of the international community and donor organizations 
in tackling tsetse and trypanosomosis. He expressed his countryÂs appreciation for the assistance 
provided by the Agency, the African Development Bank and the FAO. 
94. Cooperation with the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had been fine-tuned to ensure 
that EthiopiaÂs national developmental objectives were synchronized with Agency programming, thus 
ensuring sustainability. He expressed his countryÂs appreciation to the Agency for its support for 
national, regional and interregional programmes. Agency assistance was still required in other key 
areas of the countryÂs socio-economic development. 
95. Ethiopia regarded peaceful nuclear applications as an important component of its sustainable 
development goals. Nuclear applications had a significant impact in a number of areas, not least in 
human health. A project was being designed for the 2012Â2017 cycle to consolidate the existing 
radiotherapy and nuclear medicine facilities at Addis Ababa University and establish radiotherapy and 
nuclear medicine facilities in five regional State university hospitals for the diagnosis, therapy, 
palliative treatment and management of cancer and other diseases. 
96. His country needed to continue to develop its national capacities in the water sector to enable it 
to acquire new techniques to address its problems. Water resources management was a high priority. 
His Government was deeply concerned at declining groundwater levels and increasing pollution 
caused by industrial and public activities and salt water intrusion. His Government held the view that 
the isotope hydrology laboratory established at Addis Ababa University with Agency support should 
become the national laboratory supporting all persons involved in water resources studies requiring 
isotopic analysis. The laboratory would focus on building up a track record in conventional chemical 
and isotopic analysis of samples. His Government was seeking to make the laboratory and the 
department a regional centre of excellence in isotope hydrology and hydrochemistry. It expected the 
Agency to play a leading role in making that objective a reality. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 14 
97. Together with the Agency, the Ethiopian Government would strengthen the Metal Product 
Development Institute, with a view to its being globally recognized, by upgrading national capability 
to provide training to NDT personnel in order to enable NDT centres to provide quality services to 
private and public enterprises. Agency assistance was sought in the form of technical expertise, 
training of key personnel and, possibly, essential equipment. 
98. Ethiopia supported the AgencyÂs efforts to maintain a high level of nuclear safety worldwide 
and was committed to strengthening its national nuclear and radiation safety and security 
infrastructure to ensure the safe operation of equipment using radiation sources. The Ethiopian 
radiation protection authority would continue to work towards full implementation of regulatory 
control systems in all safety areas. 
99. His Government had invested in a central radioactive waste management facility for 
intermediate-level waste. Collected and conditioned sources would be transferred to a new installation 
once construction was complete. The AgencyÂs technical support was vital to make the facility 
operational. State-of-the-art physical security arrangements had been put in place under bilateral 
agreements with the United States Department of Energy. 
100. He reaffirmed his countryÂs commitment to the Pelindaba Treaty. EthiopiaÂs nuclear science and 
technology programmes were purely for peaceful purposes and were aimed at enhancing the living 
standards of the Ethiopian people. 
101. In conclusion, he expressed deep appreciation for the assistance and support his country had 
received from the Agency and reaffirmed EthiopiaÂs steadfast commitment to the AgencyÂs goals. 
102. Mr KIM Chang-Kyung (Republic of Korea) offered his countryÂs condolences to the people of 
Japan in connection with the natural disasters that had occurred there and the ensuing Fukushima 
accident. Although that unprecedented event had led to great loss of life, livelihood and property, it 
had also prompted the international community to rededicate itself to improving the safety of nuclear 
power plants worldwide, based on the valuable lessons learned from the accident. In accordance with 
the mandate he had received from the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011, the 
Director General had prepared an IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety outlining practical measures to 
strengthen the global nuclear safety framework. 
103. The Republic of Korea had been actively involved in international efforts to improve nuclear 
safety and had immediately conducted a safety and emergency preparedness review of its 21 nuclear 
power plants in operation, and had identified short- and long-term measures for their improvement. In 
July 2011, it had been the first country to host an IRRS mission after the Fukushima accident, which 
had found the overall national regulatory framework for nuclear safety in his country to be excellent. 
The mission findings should be instrumental in strengthening national regulatory frameworks for 
nuclear safety and his country looked forward to seeing increased IRRS activities in the future. To 
strengthen the countryÂs national regulatory framework, his Government planned to establish a nuclear 
safety and security commission in October 2011 that would report directly to the President and would 
be a fully independent regulatory body. 
104. His country would contribute, in several stages, a total of $2 million to the AgencyÂs 
extrabudgetary programme in the field of nuclear safety. As public concerns mounted over safety 
issues in the wake of the Fukushima accident, an increasing number of countries were temporarily 
suspending their nuclear power plant operations, while others were even considering permanently 
scrapping plans to construct new nuclear power plants. However, the world still needed nuclear power 
to meet the increasing demand for energy. Enhanced safety should play an indispensable and leading 
role in the plans to raise the share of nuclear power in his countryÂs national energy portfolio to 59% 
by 2030. The Republic of Korea had developed a System Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor for 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 15 
electricity generation and seawater desalination which was currently undergoing design certification 
by the countryÂs regulatory body, which process should be complete by the end of 2011. It was also 
developing next-generation nuclear energy systems, including a sodium-cooled fast reactor and 
pyroprocessing technologies. 
105. Despite significant advances in nuclear technology, developing countries had yet to benefit fully 
from nuclear energy. In fact, there was an ever widening technological gap between developed and 
developing countries. To reduce that gap, his country had developed the Integrated Regulatory 
Infrastructure Support System programme and had decided to participate in the Peaceful Uses 
Initiative, with a view to expanding personnel training and education programmes. It encouraged other 
Member States to join the Initiative. 
106. His country would continue to seek ways to leverage its experience in transitioning from being a 
recipient of nuclear technology to being a provider. The benefits to be derived from the wider 
application of nuclear technology in such areas as health care, the environment, water resources 
management, nutrition and food security should be shared worldwide. Medical applications such as 
cancer treatment illustrated how nuclear techniques could improve the quality of life. His country truly 
appreciated the Director GeneralÂs leadership in that regard and fully supported the AgencyÂs work in 
that area. The Republic of Korea had contributed $200 000 to PACT to allow more medical 
professionals from developing countries to come for training, while also sending more of its experts to 
those countries. In addition, in the field of nuclear medicine, there was a severe global shortage of 
medical isotopes. The construction of a new research reactor in his country, due to begin isotope 
production in 2016, should help relieve that shortage. 
107. It was generally agreed that the peaceful uses of nuclear energy must be promoted within the 
framework of nuclear safeguards, security and safety. While faithfully implementing its 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol, his country would continue to do all it 
could to strengthen the legal and institutional framework for a comprehensive national nuclear control 
system. The Agency had been applying integrated safeguards in the Republic of Korea since 
July 2008. 
108. His country was also participating in international efforts to strengthen nuclear security. In June, 
it had hosted the plenary meeting of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, and in March 
2012 it would host the second Nuclear Security Summit, hoping to build upon the momentum of the 
first such summit and to strengthen the international communityÂs concerted efforts to combat the 
threat of nuclear terrorism. The 2012 Nuclear Security Summit was expected to discuss how to 
amplify the synergy between nuclear security and safety. His country would do its utmost to join the 
international cooperative efforts to strengthen capacity building in the area of nuclear security. It was 
working on the establishment of an international nuclear security training centre, scheduled to open by 
2013, to offer opportunities for training in the prevention of nuclear terrorism. He requested the 
support of Member States to ensure the success of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit. 
109. The DPRKÂs pursuit of nuclear programmes had been undermining the very foundation of the 
international non-proliferation regime and posed a serious threat to peace and stability in north-east 
Asia and beyond. The DPRK had conducted its second nuclear test in 2009 and had revealed a 
uranium enrichment facility in 2010, which was a flagrant violation of the relevant United Nations 
Security Council resolutions and had generated concern in the international community. As the sole 
authority for ensuring the application of safeguards agreements, the Agency should not tolerate the 
DPRKÂs illegitimate action and should convey the international communityÂs determination that the 
DPRK must comply with applicable Security Council resolutions. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 16 
110. In the context of the international efforts to deal responsibly with the DPRK nuclear issue, his 
country appreciated the comprehensive report on the application of safeguards in that country recently 
released by the Director General. The report had promoted interest in and understanding of the DPRK 
nuclear issue, including the latterÂs uranium enrichment programme. However, the report should not 
only provide information regarding the past and present status of the DPRKÂs nuclear programme, it 
should also underscore the need for prompt and effective action Â including the resumption of 
Agency monitoring and verification activities Â to avoid undermining the international nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 
111. The DPRK must abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, 
verifiable and irreversible manner, in accordance with its obligations under Security Council 
resolutions, and must fully comply with its NPT and Agency safeguards obligations. It must 
demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization by acting to create the right circumstances for a 
resumption of the six-party talks. 
112. Throughout the DPRK denuclearization process, the Republic of Korea had taken a principled 
approach, faithfully implementing sanctions under Security Council resolutions while keeping the 
door open for dialogue, as demonstrated by the inter-Korean dialogue in July 2011. It would continue 
to cooperate closely with the international community to achieve the common goal of the 
denuclearization of the DPRK and it looked forward to the unwavering support of other Member 
States. 
113. When nuclear power had become a reality in the 1950s, the world had faced the great challenge 
of realizing the vision of atoms for peace for all. After decades of technological development and 
transfer, the world faced another challenge: that of ensuring nuclear safety at every nuclear facility 
around the world. His country was committed to playing its part in the collective endeavours to meet 
that global challenge and it hoped that the Agency would continue to play a central role in the 
establishment of a global network for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Further investment should 
be made to advance nuclear technology and make nuclear energy a safer and more reliable energy 
source. 
114. Mr SPINDELEGGER (Austria) said that the Agency had a mandate to prevent the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and to enhance health and prosperity throughout the world through the peaceful 
use of nuclear science and technology, one aspect of which would be highlighted during the current 
session of the General Conference at the Scientific Forum on water. To fulfil its mandate, the Agency 
required the support of Member States. His own country would do its utmost to fulfil its obligations 
and continue to pay its assessed contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF in full and on time, 
despite budgetary and economic uncertainties. As the host country to the Agency, it would also 
continue to provide the infrastructure the Agency required, both at headquarters and at the AgencyÂs 
laboratories at Seibersdorf, to the best of its ability. 
115. He offered his countryÂs sympathies to all those who had suffered from the Fukushima Daiichi 
nuclear power plant accident. Clearly, the AgencyÂs nuclear safety mandate and its overall nuclear 
safety profile needed to be strengthened. He welcomed the convening of the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety in June 2011 and the preparation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. At the 
Board of Governors meetings in the preceding week, Austria and other countries had pointed out a 
number of shortcomings in the action plan. What was required was a strong commitment by Member 
States to submit to peer review, a clear assignment of priorities and definition of time frames for 
implementation of the measures in the plan, transparency in all aspects of nuclear safety, and a strong 
nuclear liability regime that victims could rely upon to compensate them fully for their losses. As part 
of the follow-up to the Fukushima accident, his country would be participating in the United Nations 
High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security to be held in New York on 22 September. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 17 
116. Although Austria respected the sovereign right of every State to decide upon its national energy 
mix, his Government would use all legal means to protect its own safety interests in cases where 
nuclear installations would have, or were likely to have a negative impact on the Austrian people or on 
the countryÂs environment or infrastructure. Its decision not to use nuclear power was based upon the 
express wish of the Austrian people. He called upon all States considering the development of a 
nuclear power programme to base their final decision on a wide-ranging and intensive 
opinion-building process, taking into account all the risks and relevant international responsibilities. 
117. Owing to the failure to resolve regional tensions in the Middle East, there was still no universal 
nuclear non-proliferation regime and little hope of the swift elimination of nuclear weapons. 
Nevertheless, the Agency could provide a forum and the necessary expertise for discussion of 
technical aspects, which might contribute to the broader political debate in other forums. He expressed 
the hope that the Agency forum to be held in Vienna on 21-22 November 2011 would allow for 
constructive discussions in preparation for the planned 2012 international conference on the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
118. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had generated new momentum in the field of nuclear 
disarmament and non-proliferation which should be used to move that agenda forwards. At the 
Conference, his country had announced support for the establishment of a permanent office of the 
United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs in Vienna, which was due to commence operations 
soon. It also supported relevant think tanks, and the new Vienna Centre for Disarmament and 
Non-Proliferation had already put on a number of seminars and events. 
119. Mr BURT (United Kingdom) said that only six months had elapsed since the unprecedented 
scenes created by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the developments that had followed at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. The people of Japan were rebuilding their lives and communities 
admirably in the face of such adversity. Inevitably, the events at Fukushima had subjected nuclear 
energy worldwide, and the work of the Agency, to intense scrutiny. His country commended the 
leadership of the Director General and the Secretariat in securing and publicizing accurate and detailed 
facts from Fukushima, engaging with key figures and coordinating debate. 
120. In the context of the heightened interest in nuclear safety in the wake of the accident, the United 
Kingdom had launched a review of the implications of Fukushima for its own nuclear facilities led by 
the Chief Nuclear Inspector of the United Kingdom who, in his interim report, had concluded that, 
while the United KingdomÂs nuclear facilities were not at the same sort of risk, there were no grounds 
for complacency. Several actions identified in the interim report were now being implemented. A final 
report with detailed findings would be issued in October 2011 and made available online in 
accordance with his countryÂs commitment to sharing such information. The Chief Nuclear Inspector 
had also led the Agency task force to Japan to investigate and report on the lessons to be learned from 
the accident. The United Kingdom warmly commended the initiative of the Director General to hold 
the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011, and it fully supported the aims of the 
IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety deriving from that important event as a positive and pragmatic 
step to ensure and improve continuously nuclear safety standards. Not least, his country urged all 
Member States, and especially those that were planning to embark on nuclear activities, to adhere to 
the relevant conventions, in particular the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, and the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. 
121. With the debate on energy security and climate change intensifying, and faced with the growing 
global energy demand and rising fossil fuel prices, the role of nuclear power in providing reliable 
low-carbon energy remained vital for many Member States. His country remained committed to safe 
nuclear power as part of its energy mix both now and in the future. As it was essential to provide 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 18 
long-term certainty about commitment in order to ensure long-term investment, his Government had 
issued a national policy statement on nuclear power generation in July 2011, which had included a list 
of eight potential sites for new nuclear builds. Energy companies were already showing significant 
interest in investing and progress was being made on plans for development at one potential site. 
122. His country was anxious to ensure that other States had the information they needed to take 
important decisions on whether or not to introduce nuclear power programmes or expand existing 
programmes, in line with the commitments made at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. It was timely 
to consider how those commitments had progressed. 
123. In connection with strengthening the Agency, the events following the Fukushima accident had 
demonstrated to the world at large that the Agency played a central role in ensuring a safe, secure and 
proliferation-free nuclear future. Despite the intense pressure on national budgets, the budget agreed 
for the Agency would ensure that it continued to have the resources it needed to do its job effectively 
and efficiently. The varying and increasing demands on the Secretariat, and the challenges that lay 
ahead had also been acknowledged. 
124. The NPT Review Conference had underscored the need for an enduring commitment to 
safeguards, security and safety. The AgencyÂs safeguards system needed to be effective and efficient 
to meet the increasing demands placed on it. In that connection, he commended those States that had 
brought into force comprehensive safeguards agreements and/or additional protocols since the 
preceding session of the General Conference and urged those non-nuclear-weapon States that had still 
to do so to conclude and bring into force safeguards agreements and additional protocols and, 
wherever relevant, to amend their SQPs. His country also welcomed the continuing efforts, both 
within the Secretariat and Member States, to develop new and improved safeguards tools and 
techniques, and it strongly encouraged the evolution of safeguards towards a system that was fully 
information-driven and utilized a State-level concept to determine the optimal set of safeguards 
activities to be conducted in any State. 
125. The threat posed by those who sought to acquire and use nuclear devices for terrorist and other 
non-peaceful purposes was real and a growing concern. The United Kingdom welcomed the new 
publications in the IAEA Nuclear Security Series in 2011, in particular the new recommendations on 
the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities (INFCIRC/225/Revision 5). It also 
looked forward to the AgencyÂs continuing implementation of its Nuclear Security Plan. As part of its 
ongoing commitment to nuclear security, his Government had contributed a further Â£4 million to the 
Nuclear Security Fund in 2011. 
126. Significant progress had been made in the area of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel 
cycle, in line with commitments made at the NPT Review Conference. The United Kingdom had 
strongly supported the resolution adopted by the Board of Governors in December 
2010 (GOV/2010/70) on the establishment of an IAEA LEU bank which, alongside the LEU reserve 
that was being established in the Russian Federation, would constitute an important 
confidence-building measure. It acknowledged the efforts of the Secretariat to turn the LEU bank 
concept into a reality and looked forward to learning about the full modalities of operation in due 
course. The United KingdomÂs proposal for a virtual nuclear fuel assurance mechanism, submitted to 
the Board in March 2011, was simple, straightforward and incurred almost no costs, offering the 
potential to underpin contracts for enrichment services and provide further assurances to those 
countries that did not wish to establish their own nuclear fuel cycle. His country was grateful for the 
constructive comments made on it and for the BoardÂs endorsement, and it looked forward to 
exploring implementation of the assurance mechanism with interested States in due course. None of 
the proposed measures would affect a StateÂs rights under the NPT; on the other hand, not all States 
would find fuel assurance mechanisms useful. The aim was to ensure that the potential for such 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 19 
mechanisms to assist with the economic and safe expansion of nuclear energy was not ignored, and 
that full and open discussions took place to examine the possibilities available. 
127. The Director GeneralÂs latest report on Iran reminded Member States that that country was 
continuing to defy United Nations resolutions and was failing to cooperate fully with the Agency. In 
addition to outstanding concerns, the recent announcements by Iran regarding the tripling of its 
production of LEU enriched up to 20%, and the transfer of facilities to the Fordow nuclear site, 
showed that IranÂs programme continued to develop in a direction that offered no assurance of that 
countryÂs peaceful intentions. Once again, the report flagged the possible military dimensions of IranÂs 
nuclear programme. The United Kingdom fully supported the Director General and his staff in the 
work they were doing in connection with current or past undisclosed activities related to the 
development of a nuclear payload for a missile. The Director GeneralÂs report had made it clear that 
Iran had not provided the necessary cooperation to permit the Agency to confirm that all nuclear 
material in the country was in peaceful activities. The steps that Iran needed to take to restore 
confidence were clearly set out in Agency reports and United Nations Security Council resolutions. 
The United Kingdom was committed to working with China, France, Germany, the Russian 
Federation, the United States and the European Union High Representative on a negotiated solution, 
but Iran must show that it was prepared to negotiate seriously without preconditions. 
128. Following the adoption by the Board of Governors of the resolution finding Syria in 
non-compliance with its obligations under its safeguards agreement (GOV/2011/41), the United 
Kingdom urged Syria to give the Agency the full disclosure and cooperation that it had promised. 
129. Finally, he expressed his countryÂs deep concern at the DPRKÂs continued lack of cooperation 
with the Agency and called on that country to resume cooperation with the organization, comply 
immediately with all relevant Security Council resolutions, and refrain from any further provocative 
actions. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was vital for peace and stability in that region 
and beyond. 
130. Mr MBARAWA (United Republic of Tanzania) offered his countryÂs sympathies and 
condolences to the Government and people of Japan for the loss of life and destruction of 
infrastructure following the earthquake and tsunami which had caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant accident. 
131. In 2011, his country had signed its new CPF for 2012Â2017 which should enhance coordination 
between the countryÂs development and management priorities and the resource limitations of the 
Agency. The projects to be funded under the technical cooperation programme were an integral part of 
the sectoral priorities established by Tanzania for socio-economic development. The resources 
provided would contribute to meeting the objectives of the technical cooperation programme between 
Tanzania and the Agency in the new technical cooperation cycle, which would continue to focus on 
end-user oriented activities with visible socio-economic impact. 
132. His country welcomed the focus of the 2011 Scientific Forum on water, as millions of people in 
the world still lacked access to adequate, clean drinking water. The AgencyÂs cooperation with 
Member States, international organizations and other partners would help in assessing water resources 
and improving water productivity and efficient water use in agriculture. Tanzania reaffirmed its 
commitment to and support for AFRA and urged other Member States to support that initiative and 
increase funding mobilization. 
133. There had been a notable increase in the number of new cancer cases and deaths in Tanzania 
over the years, and treatment capabilities were still inadequate for a population of around 43 million 
people. There were gaps and shortages in cancer prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, 
palliative care, human resources development, training, research and mobilization of resources, which 
GC(55)/OR.2

had resulted in inequitable access to services, late-stage presentations and poor treatment outcomes, 
leading to a significant number of cancer patients dying unnecessarily. Continued support from PACT 
and other partners would help Tanzania in that regard. 
134. PACT had provided valuable assistance with strengthening of the capacity of the Ocean Road 
Cancer Institute by providing additional therapy machines and treatment simulation machines, 
establishing training programmes for radiation therapy and choosing Tanzania as a model 
demonstration centre for cancer therapy. The Agency had also been assisting with the establishment of 
radiotherapy services at the Bugando Medical Centre. His country welcomed the opportunity to be 
among the pilot countries in the Virtual University for Cancer Control and Regional Training Network 
in Africa. 
135. The utilization of nuclear techniques had been hampered by a lack of personnel with the 
requisite knowledge and skills. Given the urgent need to implement the countryÂs obligations as a 
Member State of the United Nations and the Agency, and in particular under Agency agreements and 
conventions, his Government was committed to building capacity for effective project 
implementation, to continued compliance with Agency agreements and conventions, and to 
developing the human resources of the Tanzania Atomic Energy Commission and other stakeholders. 
He thanked the Agency for the support his country had received to date with human resources 
development and expressed the hope that it would continue to grow. 
136. Energy was essential for development and his country needed a reliable electricity supply in 
order to achieve its planned economic growth and development. Traditional sources of energy were 
not sufficient to sustain industrial growth and thus to support the countryÂs anticipated economic 
growth. To address the countryÂs energy shortage, his Government needed Agency assistance to 
devise appropriate plans for electricity generation based on sound energy planning, which would 
include projections of electricity demand and the development of supply strategies. 
137. His country valued the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, remained committed to 
implementing relevant international nuclear safeguards and to ensuring safety and security, and would 
endeavour to ratify all relevant international legal instruments. 
138. In closing, he reaffirmed his GovernmentÂs commitment to meeting its obligations and to 
supporting the AgencyÂs efforts to realize its mandated objectives. Tanzania had complied with its 
obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency by contributing its share of the organizationÂs budget in a timely 
manner. It also pledged its full share of the TCF target. 
139. Mr STEINMANN (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, offered condolences 
to the people of Japan in connection with the earthquake and tsunami that had struck that country. 
140. The encouraging developments at the 2010 NPT Review Conference had not yet yielded 
concrete results. In the nuclear disarmament field, the momentum achieved through the ratification of 
the New START seemed to have petered out and new negotiations on nuclear disarmament were not 
on the agenda, either between the United States and Russia or within the framework of the Conference 
on Disarmament. The preceding year had not brought any developments in regional proliferation 
issues that would allow the files in question to be closed. The Agency had recently submitted a report 
on the DPRK which offered no prospect of a way out of the current stalemate. Nor had there been any 
prospect of progress with regard to Syria. In that connection, he expressed the hope that the meeting 
between the Syrian authorities and the Agency scheduled for October would bring some advance. 
Recent developments had given some cause for optimism with regard to the nuclear file of Iran, but 
they were still to be confirmed. 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 21 
141. Switzerland and Liechtenstein saw no way out of regional proliferation issues other than a 
diplomatic approach. They supported any approach that fully involved the Agency, in order to reaffirm 
the AgencyÂs unique role in verification. 
142. Switzerland fully supported the organization by the Agency of a forum on nuclear-weapons-free 
zones in November for States in the Middle East, which should help prepare the ground for future 
developments. 
143. The Fukushima accident should serve as a lesson. After analysing the accident, practical 
conclusions would need to be drawn and measures implemented to ensure such an incident never 
happened again. Following the earthquake and tsunami, Switzerland had endeavoured to gather 
information in order to assess as quickly as possible what was happening. In March, the Swiss safety 
authority had asked Swiss power plants to establish an off-site emergency resources centre and to 
re-evaluate plant behaviour in the event of an earthquake, a flood, and both in combination. On 
25 March, by agreement with the Swiss government, the safety authority had supported the request of 
the European Union to carry out stress tests and had decided to participate. 
144. Switzerland had joined international efforts launched within the framework of the G8/G20 to 
strengthen nuclear safety and had been participating actively in the discussions on the IAEA Action 
Plan on Nuclear Safety adopted by the Board of Governors the preceding week. None of his countryÂs 
objectives with respect to the action plan had been achieved. It had hoped for more binding 
commitments and viewed the action plan only as a first step. It hoped the plan would be updated and 
strengthened at the extraordinary meeting of the parties to the Convention of Nuclear Safety, based on 
the conclusions drawn from the Fukushima accident. In the meantime, Switzerland would continue the 
efforts initiated in collaboration with its neighbouring nuclear countries and within the Western 
European Nuclear RegulatorsÂ Association. 
145. Following the Fukushima accident, the Swiss government had immediately frozen requests to 
authorize the construction of three new nuclear power plants in Switzerland. It had also requested a 
review, in the light of the disaster, of the energy scenarios developed in 2006. In May, it had decided 
that existing nuclear power plants would not be replaced at the end of their lifetime and that the Swiss 
electricity supply strategy should be adapted accordingly. 
146. Switzerland wished to embark on a more sustainable energy policy whose central elements 
would be increased energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy. Increased energy efficiency 
should enable the country to keep its CO2 commitments, despite the fact that, initially, it would have to 
have recourse to gas power plants. The new energy policy would provide an opportunity to promote 
clean technologies, which would have a positive effect on economic growth and the environment. His 
countryÂs nuclear policy had changed radically since the Fukushima accident. 
147. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, Switzerland had proposed looking into how safeguards 
efforts and costs could be reduced in States with an additional protocol in force. It had held a seminar 
in the spring which had led to the publication of a study on optimizing the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system. That study would be presented during the General Conference and his country intended to 
look into that subject in greater depth in the coming months. It hoped to make the additional protocol 
even more attractive to the States which were hesitant to adopt it, by reducing the costs of the 
safeguards system and the burden of inspections. It was convinced that States with comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and an additional protocol in force would see their visibility and political 
credibility increase owing to their transparency in their nuclear field. 
148. His country had a strong interest in financial and budgetary questions, especially in the face of 
the current global financial crisis. It believed that the Agency had sufficient funds to fulfil its statutory 
tasks and it reiterated its request that, for any proposal with financial and administrative implications, 
GC(55)/OR.2 
19 September 2011, Page 22 
the Director General should submit a report to ensure that Member States could take a decision in full 
knowledge of the facts. He thanked the chairperson of the working group on financing of the AgencyÂs 
activities which had been tasked with proposing a budget for 2012. That task had not been easy and 
discussions had, unfortunately, clearly shown once again that the agreement reached was not 
satisfactory. The Regular Budget still did not take into account investment expenditure. 
149. While it did not wish to minimize the importance of safety, non-proliferation, security, or 
technological or scientific development, Switzerland would like to see the technical cooperation 
budget integrated into the Regular Budget, for both Switzerland and Liechtenstein believed that 
Article II of the Statute was the main reason why the vast majority of States became members of the 
Agency. 
150. Turning to SwitzerlandÂs nuclear waste disposal sites, he said that the Swiss Government had 
adopted a sectoral plan for deep geological repositories in 2008 which should, in time, enable the 
country to select disposal sites for low-, intermediate- and high-level radioactive waste. To date, six 
geological sites had been selected and declared technically suitable to store nuclear waste. Extensive 
consultations were being held with the public in the areas concerned, and with cantonal authorities and 
neighbouring countries. The evaluation of those consultations was ongoing. 
151. In conclusion, he thanked the Secretariat and the Director General for the high quality of their 
work, and in particular for their dedication in responding to the expectations of the international 
community during the months following the major earthquake in Japan.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 (continued) 
(GC(55)/2) 
1. Mr YASEEN (Iraq) said that the current session of the General Conference was particularly 
important for Iraq since it was taking place after the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 
1957 (2010), which lifted the restrictions imposed on Iraq pursuant to resolutions 687 (1991) and 
707 (1991). Those resolutions had prevented Iraq from using nuclear technology for peaceful purposes 
for two decades. 
2. Since 2003 the Government of Iraq had been cooperating closely with the international 
community and rebuilding confidence through the implementation of its obligations under 
Article 9.I.E of the 2005 Constitution, which required the Iraqi Government to respect and implement 
IraqÂs international obligations regarding the non-proliferation, non-development, non-production and 
non-use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and to prohibit associated equipment, material, 
technologies and delivery systems for use in the development, manufacture, production and use of 
such weapons. 
3. Iraq had taken many important steps, including: the signing of an additional protocol to its 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and application of the protocol on a voluntary basis since early 
2010 pending its ratification; the signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which the 
parliament was expected to ratify by the end of 2011; the signing of the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material and its submission to the parliament for ratification; and the signing of 
the Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. In addition, the parliament was 
enacting legislation on a national regulatory authority with a view to ensuring IraqÂs compliance with 
its obligations under treaties concerning disarmament, non-proliferation and control of dual-use 
materials and equipment. 
4. The Iraqi Government had also adopted numerous measures aimed at ensuring maximum use of 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and at organizing relevant regulatory activities. They 
included: the establishment of the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission, which was attached to the 
Ministry of Science and Technology; the establishment of a radiation monitoring authority attached to 
the Ministry of the Environment; establishment of the Higher Disaster Management Authority, 
composed of representatives of all relevant ministries and institutions; finalization of the national 
radiation and nuclear emergency plan in light of Agency guidelines and with the participation of 
governmental bodies and civil society organizations responsible for response; the establishment by the 
Ministry of the Environment of a national early warning and radiation monitoring network; the 
establishment of a national data centre in line with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty; and 
the adoption by the Council of Ministers of a paper setting out a vision for future peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. 
5. Iraq had drawn up a comprehensive plan for the decontamination of destroyed Iraqi nuclear 
installations in cooperation with the Agency. It was currently devising a strategy for the management 
and treatment of radioactive waste resulting from the process, including the training of human 
resources in cooperation with the Agency, the United States of America and the EU. 
6. Iraq stood in need of Agency support under PACT for the early detection and treatment of 
cancerous tumours in order to reduce mortality rates, especially among children. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 2 
7. Iraq also required assistance under the technical cooperation programme for the management of 
water resources, agriculture and the environment. In particular, it required greater support for the 
elimination from the environment of all destructive radioactive contaminants and for the use of nuclear 
technology to detect landmines, which prevented the cultivation of a large proportion of the countryÂs 
agricultural land and took a heavy human toll each year. Also, Iraq was introducing nuclear 
technology such as electron and ion accelerators for use in scientific research and for medical, 
environmental and agricultural applications. During the past two years, the Government had been 
training specialists in those fields in cooperation with the Agency and the Arab Atomic Energy 
Agency. It hoped to receive increased support for such activities from the Agency in the future. 
8. The establishment of NWFZs was a necessary step towards the achievement and maintenance of 
international peace and security. Iraq therefore strongly supported all efforts to establish an NWFZ in 
the Middle East. Israel must first, however, get rid of its nuclear weapons, accede to the NPT and 
place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. In addition, all States in the region should subject 
all their nuclear installations to Agency control and comply with the provisions of the United Nations 
resolutions concerning the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East, with Security Council 
resolution 487 (1981) and with paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991). All States, 
including the five nuclear-weapon States, should comply with the decisions of the 1995 and 2000 NPT 
Review Conferences and take practical steps to ensure the success of the 2012 conference. Iraq urged 
the Agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and other relevant 
organizations to prepare background documents concerning the establishment of a zone free of nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems for that conference. 
9. The Fukushima accident in Japan and other similar accidents in the past had undermined 
confidence in the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to meet the growing energy demand. 
It was therefore essential to adopt additional preventive measures to protect nuclear installations and 
power plants that were at risk of being affected by natural disasters, especially those in coastal areas 
and close to earthquake fault lines. National radiation and nuclear emergency response plans should be 
updated, and international and regional cooperation should be enhanced by means of exchanges of 
information through early warning networks and radiation and nuclear monitoring networks. Staff 
employed in nuclear facilities should receive training in nuclear safety and security, and monitoring 
centres should be provided with the equipment and expertise required to predict natural phenomena 
and ensure that appropriate measures were taken as speedily as possible. 
10. Mr VEJONIS (Latvia) said that events in Fukushima and the discussions that had followed had 
demonstrated the importance of nuclear safety for all Member States. Latvia fully agreed with the 
Director General that public confidence in the safety of nuclear power had been badly shaken. 
However, in light of the fact that nuclear power would remain important for many countries, it was 
imperative that the most stringent safety measures be implemented everywhere. The issue of public 
anxiety was particularly pertinent for his country as several nuclear power plants were at the planning 
or commissioning stage near its borders. 
11. The Fukushima accident had proven that the nuclear renaissance should go hand in hand with a 
long-term commitment to improving nuclear safety; unfortunately, that was not an area where 
Âlearning by doingÂ was an acceptable approach. Therefore, Latvia urged all Member States to pay 
greater attention to nuclear safety, bearing in mind its transboundary implications. In that connection, 
a commitment by Member States to apply the AgencyÂs safety standards was vital. 
12. Having underlined the importance of technical cooperation, he said that cooperation was the 
only way to find the best solutions, ensure the exchange of experience and provide optimal assistance 
to those who needed it. Latvia commended the AgencyÂs Department of Technical Cooperation for the 
support it provided to Member States and its efforts to make constant improvements. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 3 
13. In 2011, Latvia had defined four national mid-term priorities for technical cooperation, namely: 
radioactive waste management; strengthening regulatory infrastructure via knowledge management; 
improving radiation security; and developing a safety culture among operators. His Government was 
aware that there was a need for improvement in the aforementioned areas and the priorities identified 
had been approved by its Radiation Safety Board. Regarding safety culture, more emphasis needed to 
be placed on stakeholder involvement in order to ensure effective, instead of one-way, 
communication. 
14. As regards radioactive waste management, he said that a new EU directive had been adopted in 
2011 establishing a Community framework for the responsible and safe management of spent fuel and 
radioactive waste (Council Directive 2011/70/Euratom), which set up a legal framework based on 
acknowledged safety principles. Its adoption meant that the AgencyÂs Fundamental Safety Principles 
had been brought into law, thereby preventing any interpretations at the national legislative level. The 
directive emphasized the importance the EU attached to radioactive waste management. Latvia urged 
every Member State to follow suit for the sake of future generations. 
15. The discourse surrounding nuclear safety had seen a shift in emphasis since the previous 
General Conference. Whereas in 2010 there had been enthusiastic rhetoric about the nuclear 
renaissance and knowledge management, 2011 had brought the realization that safety and emergency 
preparedness and response were crucial. As indicated at the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety in June 2011, several Member States had decided to stop their nuclear programmes and seek 
alternative energy sources. The Fukushima accident had highlighted the fact that even countries with a 
high level of nuclear safety and a well developed infrastructure were vulnerable. The paradigm shift 
that had taken place had resulted in calls for stress tests and a review of safety standards and 
emergency preparedness systems. 
16. In closing, he emphasized the crucial role played by the Agency in ensuring the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy. 
17. Mr SHOOGUFAN (Afghanistan) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs continued efforts to 
increase its technical cooperation activities at the bilateral, regional and international levels with a 
view to enhancing the living conditions of its Member States. Those activities were particularly 
important for his country, which had nine ongoing projects and eight new projects for the 2012Â2013 
biennium. AfghanistanÂs draft Country Programme Framework, drawn up in 2010, was still under 
review and its Country Programme Note would shortly be entered into the Programme Cycle 
Management Framework. 
18. An Atomic Energy High Commission had now been established in Afghanistan. 
Notwithstanding certain technical and financial difficulties, the Commission had, with the assistance 
of Agency legal experts, drafted a national nuclear law that was now before parliament. The 
Commission was currently drafting regulations on radiation protection, transport of nuclear materials, 
and waste management. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs continued and important efforts to 
strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. 
19. Recent events, including the catastrophe in Japan and major terrorist attacks in various parts of 
the world, had highlighted the need for specific measures to enhance the safety and security of nuclear 
technology, materials and installations. Since nuclear safety had implications that extended beyond 
national boundaries, developing Member States commissioning new nuclear facilities should seek 
cooperation with the Agency, and all Member States utilizing nuclear technology must apply the 
highest safety standards and address issues related to disaster management such as secure containment 
structures and rapid response capacities. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 4 
20. Afghanistan welcomed the outcome of the June 2011 IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety and believed that the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety would significantly strengthen global 
nuclear safety. Afghanistan encouraged all Member States to work towards the swift implementation 
of the recommended measures. His country also welcomed the cooperation between the Government 
of Japan and the Agency to assess the Fukushima accident and the Japanese GovernmentÂs intention to 
organize, in cooperation with the Agency, an international conference on nuclear safety in 2012. 
21. In the area of nuclear security, all Member States should continue to implement the enhanced 
international legal regime and identify any new measures required. He commended the SecretariatÂs 
efforts in developing Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plans and emphasized the importance of the 
Nuclear Security Summit to be held in the Republic of Korea in 2012. 
22. Afghanistan attached great importance to the fight against terrorism and his Government 
supported all measures aimed at preventing terrorists and other criminals from acquiring nuclear, 
radiological, biological or chemical weapons. As global demand for nuclear technologies increased, it 
was essential to ensure that the nuclear material supplied could not be diverted to non-peaceful 
purposes. 
23. Afghanistan appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States in enhancing the physical 
protection of nuclear facilities and preventing illicit trafficking. The highest possible levels of nuclear 
safety, security and safeguards must be assured for all nuclear and radiological applications. 
24. Agency safeguards were critical to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and Afghanistan 
commended the AgencyÂs verification activities. To fulfil its tasks in that area, the Agency needed 
administrative, technical and political assistance, and he called on all Member States to support and 
cooperate with Agency inspectors. His Government fully endorsed the AgencyÂs activities aimed at 
resolving outstanding issues relating to the nature and scope of Member StatesÂ nuclear programmes. 
25. Turning to nuclear disarmament, he said that the Government of Afghanistan supported the 
dismantling of strategic warheads and the vision of a world free of nuclear dangers. In that context, it 
commended the efforts of the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of 
America concerning plutonium disposal. 
26. Lastly, he emphasized that the Agency must have sufficient financial and human resources to 
carry out its statutory functions. Afghanistan, for its part, would continue to cooperate fully with the 
Agency in addressing the challenges that lay ahead. 
27. Mr NAMBURETE (Mozambique) said that an environment of political stability and a 
worldwide commitment to peace and welfare were preconditions for mutual trust and the peaceful use 
of nuclear technology. Mozambique joined those who defended the right of all countries to develop 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for social and economic development. It was opposed to 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the use of nuclear technology for military purposes by any 
Member State of the Agency or any other country. 
28. Mozambique had joined the Agency in 2006, had established its National Atomic Energy 
Agency in 2009 and had brought the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA into 
force in 2011. It had signed an NPT safeguards agreement and an additional protocol thereto in 2010. 
He appealed to those Member States that had not done so to accede to that important instrument. 
29. Mozambique was strongly committed to working closely with the Agency with a view to 
achieving national development. Although not yet the case for Mozambique, there was considerable 
evidence that technical cooperation in the field of nuclear technology was making a difference in the 
lives of many people the world over. Technical cooperation was helping to change the widespread 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 5 
perception of the Agency as simply the worldÂs Ânuclear watchdogÂ and promoted an awareness of its 
extensive activities in such fields as nuclear energy and nuclear science and applications. 
30. Mozambique welcomed Agency assistance through coordinated research projects and technical 
cooperation in the areas of radiotherapy, nuclear medicine, agriculture, mineral resources, and animal 
health and production, including the fight against the tsetse fly and trypanosomosis. Mozambique was 
now finalizing its Country Programme Framework for the period 2012Â2017, to be signed by the end 
of the year. The programme set priorities in areas where technical cooperation could make a 
substantial contribution, including energy planning, water resources, environmental management, 
industrial applications, radioactive waste management and radiation protection. 
31. His delegation congratulated the Director General on the PACT programme, which had proven 
to be one of the AgencyÂs most successful activities. Also, it was encouraging to note that, in response 
to the UN focus on the need for better water management, the Agency was assigning priority to 
technical cooperation projects in that area. His delegation would like to see the Agency play an active 
role in efforts to combat malaria, which continued to take millions of lives, particularly in Africa. 
32. Training helped to build professional capacity in developing countries. The ultimate goal would 
be to assist developing countries in establishing and fostering a sustainable, highly trained human 
resource base in all activities related to nuclear science and applications. 
33. The Fukushima accident had posed a serious challenge to nuclear technology. The manner in 
which the Government of Japan, with the support of the international community, had dealt with the 
accident highlighted the need for transparency, collaboration and further strengthening of safety 
measures at nuclear power plants. Only then would nuclear technology continue to be a preferred 
option for power supply. Mozambique expressed its appreciation to the Agency for immediately 
providing assistance and mobilizing support in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident. Close 
cooperation among the Member States was essential to rise to the challenge of ensuring safe nuclear 
power. 
34. Mozambique was concerned about the illegal practice of dumping radioactive waste in 
developing countries, in particular in Africa, because of the serious risk to public health it posed. It 
appealed for greater assistance in order to bring that practice, which was an obstacle to social and 
economic development and constituted a flagrant violation of human rights, to a halt. 
35. Mozambique much appreciated the continuing support that it had been receiving from the 
Agency under the technical cooperation programme and reiterated its commitment to supporting the 
Agency in its efforts to promote nuclear safety and the peaceful use of nuclear technology. 
36. Mr OTTO (Germany) said that events in the field of nuclear energy in recent months had been 
dominated by the incident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011. One 
consequence of the incident had been an invitation to Member States from the Director General to 
attend the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June, which had focused on lessons 
learned for the Agency in both structural and legal matters. It would, of course, take more time to fully 
assess the impact of the accident. 
37. In the aftermath of that accident, Germany had reconsidered the role of nuclear energy in the 
context of its national energy policy. The legal framework in its Atomic Energy Act had been 
amended and electricity generation at German nuclear power plants would be completely phased out 
by the end of 2022. That meant an acceleration of nuclear plant shutdown and of restructuring of the 
countryÂs energy system. The challenge ahead encompassed more innovation and faster progress 
towards energy efficiency and renewable energy. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 6 
38. Germany assured its neighbours and partners, who were wondering what effect that decision 
would have on European electricity markets and grids, that it would organize the necessary changes in 
full transparency and close dialogue. It remained committed to the highest safety and security 
standards for nuclear power plants and would continue to be an active partner in all relevant forums 
and institutions. 
39. Together with its EU partners, Germany had repeatedly confirmed its commitment to full 
implementation of the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 NPT Review and Extension 
Conference. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had underlined the importance of moving ahead in 
that regard. Progress had been made in the seminar organized by the EU in Brussels in July 2011. 
Also, the Agency had planned a forum on experience of possible relevance to the creation of an 
NWFZ in the Middle East in November 2011. The international community should now refrain from 
doing anything that could jeopardize the planned 2012 Conference. 
40. After long and difficult negotiations, the Board of Governors had reached a decision at its June 
2011 session on the AgencyÂs Regular Budget for 2012. The 4% increase did not reflect his countryÂs 
well-known position but, in the spirit of Vienna, it had not blocked consensus. 
41. Continuing global and financial uncertainties and additional burdens on national budgets, in 
combination with across-the-board austerity measures, required a zero growth policy in all 
international organizations, including the Agency. The Secretariat and Member States must therefore 
continue to find additional mechanisms to increase the AgencyÂs efficiency and effectiveness. The 
system of integrated safeguards within the framework of the additional protocol was one way of 
streamlining costs. Germany would welcome initiatives from the Secretariat that could lead to cost 
savings for the Secretariat, Member States and the private sector. 
42. In that context, he emphasized GermanyÂs continued general intention to support the Agency 
when specific needs arose. Germany was in the process of donating Â5 million to the Nuclear Security 
Fund for various projects that had been selected in close cooperation with the Office of Nuclear 
Security. It had already contributed Â3.4 million in 2011 to the project on Enhancing Capabilities of 
the Safeguards Analytical Services (ECAS) at Seibersdorf and would give a further Â1.6 million to 
that project by the end of the year. 
43. Germany was gravely concerned about the nature of the Iranian nuclear programme. Iran had 
not taken the necessary steps to dispel international doubts as to whether its programme was 
exclusively for peaceful purposes. On the contrary, installing centrifuges in the underground Fordow 
facility and announcing the tripling of its 20% enrichment production only served to increase 
concerns. The AgencyÂs latest report again stated that it was unable to verify the absence of 
undeclared activities and that questions concerning possible military dimensions to IranÂs nuclear 
programme remained unanswered. 
44. Full implementation by Iran of its international obligations was not only mandatory; it was in 
IranÂs own best interests if it really wanted to re-establish confidence in the exclusively peaceful 
nature of its nuclear programme. Germany reaffirmed the offer made in 2008 by China, France, 
Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with the proposals made in 
Istanbul in January 2011. It expected Iran to demonstrate a constructive attitude and to respond 
positively to those proposals and to the six countriesÂ openness to dialogue and negotiation. 
45. Germany was also gravely concerned about the DPRK nuclear weapons programme. The 
complete and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was his countryÂs goal. 
Unfortunately, the latest events had only increased doubts about whether the DPRK was truly willing 
to renounce its nuclear weapons programme. It would be a positive sign if the DPRK readmitted 
Agency inspectors. Preventing nuclear proliferation to and from the DPRK remained a priority and he 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 7 
called upon all States to comply strictly with their obligations under Security Council resolution 
1874 (2009). 
46. In June 2011, the Board of Governors had found the Syrian Arab Republic to be in 
non-compliance with its safeguards agreement and the Security Council had taken up the issue on 
14 July 2011. Germany called on the Syrian Arab Republic to cooperate fully with the Agency in 
order to clarify all open questions concerning its nuclear programme. 
47. The aforementioned developments underlined the need for an effective and efficient safeguards 
regime. Germany considered a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an additional 
protocol to be the verification standard. 
48. The Board of Governors had recently approved three different models for multilateral 
approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. Such efforts strengthened the reliability of the already 
well-functioning nuclear fuel market. Germany had submitted its own model, the Multilateral 
Enrichment Sanctuary Project (MESP). While it had not yet sought Board approval, Germany 
remained in bilateral contact with interested Member States and would submit the project to the Board 
in due course. 
49. Since the accident at Fukushima in March 2011, nuclear safety had been the subject of 
numerous national and international meetings. In June, the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety had requested that the Secretariat prepare and present a draft action plan on nuclear safety, 
building on the Ministerial Declaration and the conclusions and recommendations of its working 
sessions. 
50. He expressed appreciation for the action plan the Secretariat had prepared, which reflected the 
various views on nuclear safety held by Member States, but said that Germany would have preferred 
one that defined priorities and time frames for implementing the measures it set out. Furthermore, 
transparency in all aspects of nuclear safety, in particular with regard to the sharing of information, 
had not been sufficiently taken into account. Germany understood the action plan to be a living 
document that would require further development. It provided a framework; the crucial questions were 
what it would contain and how effectively it would be implemented. In that context, safety research 
was of key importance within the framework of international cooperation. 
51. The Agency and all its Member States must live up to their joint responsibility to ensure that 
nuclear technology was used safely and securely. It was incumbent on all countries using nuclear 
energy to be aware of their responsibilities, which did not end at national borders. The continuous 
improvement of safety to ensure the highest standards must be a universal goal. Countries planning to 
build new nuclear power plants should apply the best available safety technologies from the outset and 
be capable of managing core meltdown and preventing major releases with respect to any new nuclear 
power plant. 
52. Germany greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs valuable technical cooperation. Such cooperation 
with the countries concerned and with other international organizations was leading to noticeable 
improvements in important areas like health, especially cancer treatment, water management, 
agriculture and environmental protection. Germany would continue to support the AgencyÂs efforts in 
that regard to the fullest extent possible. 
53. Germany, a founding member of INPRO, established under the auspices of the Agency more 
than ten years previously, commended the INPRO team for its work over the past year. In coordination 
with other international initiatives, it was a crucial forum for discussions on innovative approaches to 
nuclear infrastructure. Germany would continue to support its efforts towards ensuring the safe and 
secure use of nuclear energy. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 8 
54. Germany supported the topic of water management chosen for the 2011 IAEA Scientific Forum 
as it was a truly global challenge. Access to clean water had been declared a human right by the 
General Assembly in 2010 and his Government, together with the German research community and 
industry, stood ready to play an active and constructive role in tackling the issue. 
55. Nuclear energy and related technologies required intensive international collaboration and the 
Agency played a central role in that regard. Maintaining the AgencyÂs ability to do so remained an 
issue of the highest priority for his country. Germany looked forward to continued constructive 
cooperation with the Agency and all its Member States. 
56. Mr TOUKAN (Jordan) expressed his GovernmentÂs sincere condolences to the people of Japan 
over the loss of life and destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami. He also commended the 
Japanese Government and institutions on the action they had taken to address the consequences of the 
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. 
57. He thanked the Agency for organizing the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in 
June 2011 and involving the international community in efforts to meet the challenge presented by the 
Fukushima accident, which had created an entirely new situation and undermined the confidence of 
the general public in the safety of nuclear energy. Countries must now join forces in laying the basis 
for a new nuclear safety regime, guided by the lessons learned from the accident and building on 
relevant international standards. At the same time, emphasis should be placed on national 
responsibility to promote a culture of nuclear safety and corresponding practical action. The Agency 
should also move ahead with its Action Plan on Nuclear Safety covering all major aspects of nuclear 
safety as well as the protection of public health and the environment. 
58. The Jordanian Government and the institutions involved in implementation of the countryÂs 
nuclear programme hoped to ensure strict compliance with nuclear safety standards by opting for safe 
modern technology. Jordan was in the final stages of the process of selecting nuclear reactor 
technology. The Atomic Energy Commission was currently assessing competing bids from the 
Russian Federation (AES-92 WWER-1000), Canada (Enhanced CANDU-6), and France and Japan 
(ATMEA1). The Commission planned to apply Agency standards and rigorous selection criteria in 
choosing technology that was appropriate and safe for Jordan. 
59. Also, the Commission was completing site selection studies for the construction of a nuclear 
power plant, which it hoped would be in operation by the end of 2012. The two candidate sites were 
close to water sources, one being treated waste water. 
60. Jordan possessed natural uranium ore reserves and had signed agreements on exploration, 
drilling and mining and on the creation of joint investment ventures with specialized companies, 
including the French AREVA company. It was hoped to complete the economic feasibility studies in 
the central region of the country in 2012. Uranium exploration work was also proceeding in other parts 
of the country. 
61. Jordan was aware of the importance of ensuring public acceptance of nuclear energy as a 
prerequisite for the success of the nuclear programme and so the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission 
was devising a strategy aimed at disseminating a sound nuclear culture. For instance, it had published 
a white paper on nuclear energy in Jordan in order to inform public opinion in a transparent and 
scientific manner about all aspects of the nuclear programme. 
62. The use of nuclear energy called for a highly qualified work force and Jordan had taken 
successful action to that end. The first group of students attending the nuclear engineering course at 
the Jordan University of Science and Technology had graduated in 2011. In November 2010, King 
Abdullah II had laid the foundation stone of the Jordan Nuclear Research Centre to be built on the 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 9 
University campus. Work on the Centre, which would be equipped with a 5 MW nuclear research 
reactor, was being conducted by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI)/Daewoo 
consortium. The reactor would be used to train future generations of nuclear researchers, scientists and 
engineers, and also to produce the radioisotopes required by the Jordanian medical, agricultural and 
industrial sectors. The reactor would begin operating in 2015. 
63. Plans for the creation of a centre of excellence in Jordan specializing in nuclear energy and 
major projects were being drawn up in cooperation with the French Government. The centre would 
provide training courses in basic and advanced science to meet the needs of the Jordanian nuclear 
programme and would also offer regional training courses. Courses in nuclear energy project 
management and nuclear safety as well as advanced courses focusing on specialized work in nuclear 
power plants would be inaugurated in autumn 2012. 
64. Jordan attached special importance to bilateral cooperation and had signed 12 nuclear 
cooperation agreements with States that ranked among the worldÂs leading nuclear suppliers. Jordan 
had also taken advantage of 37 opportunities offered under nuclear cooperation agreements with 
France, China, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea and Japan for higher studies in nuclear 
science and engineering. He warmly thanked the Governments concerned for offering such 
opportunities to Jordanian students. 
65. Jordan had benefited from numerous national, regional and interregional projects under the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. The visit to Jordan by the Deputy Director General for 
Technical Cooperation in May 2011 had provided an opportunity to obtain advice about potential 
Agency support in areas such as health, education and the nuclear energy infrastructure. Jordan was 
also looking forward to a visit by the Director General in October 2011, which would further 
consolidate the countryÂs cooperation with the Agency and confirm the transparency of its nuclear 
programme and its ongoing compliance with international standards. 
66. Jordan appreciated the technical advice offered in the context of the 2009 INIR mission to 
review and assess its nuclear energy infrastructure. It looked forward to a second mission during the 
last quarter of 2011. As a member of INPRO, Jordan would benefit from long-term strategic planning 
of nuclear power generation. 
67. Jordan welcomed the proposals to establish a mechanism for the assurance of nuclear fuel 
supply. It would be appropriate to engage in a constructive and substantive dialogue in that regard to 
assist States that were endeavouring to implement sustainable civil nuclear programmes and to 
broaden the options available for an assured nuclear fuel supply covering the complete nuclear fuel 
cycle. Jordan therefore encouraged positive discussion of the proposals and emphasized the need for 
an in-depth study of all the relevant legal, political and technical implications. 
68. Jordan had reaffirmed its resolve to expand its options by purchasing nuclear fuel from global 
markets without prejudice to its rights under Article IV of the NPT to develop research, production 
and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with 
Articles I and II of the Treaty. 
69. Jordan attached great importance to the safeguards regime and considered it to be a basic 
element of international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to limit nuclear 
energy to peaceful applications for the benefit of States and peoples. In accordance with its obligations 
under the NPT, Jordan had signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency and an 
additional protocol thereto to strengthen the comprehensive safeguards regime. 
70. Jordan was firmly convinced that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction posed 
a threat to global peace and security and especially to peace and stability in the Middle East region, 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 10 
which continued to suffer from the failure to implement resolutions aimed at ridding it of nuclear 
weapons. 
71. Jordan stressed the need for Israel to accede to the NPT and to place all its nuclear installations 
under Agency safeguards, thereby achieving universality of the Treaty in the region. That would not 
only pave the way for the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East and help to achieve international 
peace and security, but also act as an incentive to States in the region to focus on socio-economic 
development instead of an arms race, which hindered development and confidence-building and 
exacerbated tensions. 
72. In that connection, Jordan supported the decision to convene an international forum in 
November 2011 to be attended by the States of the region and other interested parties with a view to 
taking advantage of the experience of existing NWFZs. It was to be hoped that the forum would 
contribute to the success of the international conference to be held in 2012 on the establishment of a 
zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, on the basis 
of arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region, and with the full support and engagement 
of the nuclear-weapon States. 
73. Jordan reaffirmed its confidence in the AgencyÂs effective role in supporting the contribution of 
nuclear technology to socio-economic prosperity through the provision of technical assistance to 
Member States and in promoting international peace and security through its action in the areas of 
nuclear safety and non-proliferation. 
74. Ms HAINGURA (Namibia) said that her countryÂs Vision 2030 set forth the countryÂs 
long-term strategies for development and served as a vehicle to bring about meaningful results to its 
ideas. Although the country had made steady progress, enormous challenges remained, which could 
nevertheless be overcome with the selfless collaboration from all partners and Agency support. The 
Agency provided important contributions to NamibiaÂs priority goals, which included productive 
utilization of the countryÂs natural resources, environmental sustainability, development of productive 
and competitive human resources and institutions, improving quality of life, and promoting peace and 
security. The General Conference provided an opportunity to enhance cooperation, strengthen existing 
relations and find common ground on contentious issues. 
75. The AgencyÂs safeguards regime was an important tool in ensuring international peace and 
security. Namibia was firmly committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and was about to bring 
into force the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and also to ratify the Pelindaba Treaty. 
She called on all Member States to adhere fully and unconditionally to the NPT and facilitate equitable 
access to nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. 
76. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was an important means of advancing national 
developmental goals. The agricultural sector was crucial to food security and employment creation. 
The Agency provided excellent support to the sector, especially in the areas of crop production and the 
management of livestock diseases. Its commendable support in the water sector had facilitated a better 
understanding of groundwater resources and improved management systems. Namibia was pleased 
that the 2011 Scientific Forum was dedicated to the application of nuclear techniques for water 
management, which would add value to ongoing technical cooperation initiatives. 
77. The AgencyÂs PACT programme had been instrumental in creating the necessary awareness and 
operational capabilities in developing countries for cancer control. Welcoming the emphasis placed on 
PACT, she said that significant resources should be committed for the development of nuclear 
medicine and radiation therapy capabilities. The Agency should take an integrated approach to the 
various issues involved in cancer control when working with Member States. Namibia currently 
sought to strengthen and expand its nuclear medicine and radiotherapy services, with Agency 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 11 
assistance. Namibia appreciated the support provided by the Agency and partners, including the 
Government of India, in the past and looked forward to even greater support in future. 
78. Nuclear energy played a vital and meaningful role in socio-economic development. Namibia 
continued to aspire to develop a nuclear power programme as an important contribution to meeting its 
national energy needs. Each State had the sovereign right, and should be provided access, to 
development and use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Namibia, as a major player in the 
uranium production industry, must ensure that its people benefited equally from that resource. The 
Government was therefore seeking to create the necessary conditions for encouraging value addition 
or full participation in the nuclear fuel cycle. That would help meet national energy demands, 
stimulate industrial development and create much needed jobs and skills. Namibia welcomed 
cooperative arrangements at the multilateral and bilateral levels in developing a policy and an enabling 
framework for full exploitation of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
79. She extended her countryÂs sincere sympathy to the people of Japan and commended that 
country and the Agency for their management of the Fukushima accident. Despite its desire to pursue 
a nuclear power programme, Namibia was mindful of the risks associated with the use of nuclear 
energy and the need for a rigorous national regulatory framework to ensure high levels of safety and 
security at nuclear installations. Technology providers should collaborate closely with the Agency to 
ensure that the available technology offered a high standard of performance and a high level of safety. 
80. NamibiaÂs regulations for protection against ionizing radiation and for the safety of radiation 
sources had been finalized, paving the way for the full implementation of the Atomic Energy and 
Radiation Protection Act, which provided the regulatory framework for the safe and secure use of 
radioactive and nuclear material. The current legislation and regulations conformed to Agency 
standards and recommendations. Namibia was committed to regular self-assessment of the regulatory 
infrastructure to ensure best practices. It was a strong proponent of regional networks and encouraged 
the strengthening of bilateral partnerships within regional frameworks. Her Government supported the 
Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa and looked forward to reinforcement of that approach 
at the subregional level, with the support of the Agency. 
81. Human resources were vital to the successful development of her countryÂs priority initiatives 
and her Government greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs support in building teaching and research 
capabilities at higher education institutions in Namibia. The Agency had been instrumental in 
supporting the development of expertise in specialized areas of nuclear technology and her delegation 
looked forward to such support continuing. 
82. The challenges ahead were not insurmountable and a multilateral approach in which all parties 
enjoyed equal status and mutual benefit would help secure a good future for all people around the 
world. 
Mr Berdennikov (Russian Federation) took the Chair. 
83. Mr MOVSISYAN (Armenia) thanked the Agency for its constant support, particularly in the 
fields of nuclear power and nuclear medicine. 
84. In the aftermath of the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan, there was 
a need for strengthened and more in-depth safety analysis of existing and planned power plants and it 
was essential to develop new and more conservative approaches to nuclear power plant safety criteria. 
At the same time, it was vital that NPT safeguards be ensured through international agreements and 
strengthened domestic legislation. 
85. Armenia, for its part, was continually upgrading its national legislation and conscientiously 
complied with its international responsibilities, including the regular submission to the Agency of 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 12 
reports under its additional protocol. It was grateful for the valuable assistance of the Department of 
Safeguards in that respect. 
86. Nuclear power was a key element of ArmeniaÂs energy strategy since it was essential if the 
country was to be self-sufficient in energy. An international conference, scheduled for April 2011, on 
investment in the proposed new Armenian nuclear power unit had been postponed following the 
earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima. The delay had enabled Armenia, together with the international 
nuclear community, to consider possible changes to the design safety requirements for the new unit. 
87. From 2008 to 2010, a re-assessment of the seismic, volcanic and geophysical situation of the 
site had been conducted and the results submitted to Agency experts in 2010. The final report, 
incorporating those expertsÂ recommendations, had been sent to the Agency for evaluation in early 
July 2011. The AgencyÂs advisory assistance had been invaluable in ensuring the seismic safety of the 
existing unit and for the future development of nuclear power in Armenia. Modelling of various types 
of incidents and emergencies had shown that the reactor met the design standards for seismic 
resistance. 
88. An assessment of the environmental impact of the new unit, available on the website of the 
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, had been completed and transmitted to the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection for evaluation. The latter Ministry had organized public hearings in a 
number of Armenian cities and the final expert evaluation would soon be forthcoming. Armenia met 
all its obligations under the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary 
Context (Espoo Convention), and the environmental impact study for the new unit had been conducted 
in strict compliance with the procedures foreseen in that instrument. 
89. Armenia had declared its readiness to conduct stress tests on the operating unit of the Armenia 
nuclear power plant with the assistance of the EU and had already begun relevant preparations. 
90. Every year, Armenia welcomed up to ten Agency safety missions, as well as seismological and 
operational safety missions. The OSART mission conducted in May 2011 had made a thorough review 
of operational safety and had submitted recommendations and proposals in many areas. The mission 
had also recorded examples of good practice which would be disseminated to all countries which used 
nuclear power for their possible application. All the missionÂs recommendations would be 
implemented in Armenia as soon as possible. He expressed thanks to the Department of Nuclear 
Safety and Security for assisting his country in its efforts to enhance the level of safety at the 
Armenian nuclear power plant. 
91. In 2010, his Government had adopted a concept for the management of radioactive waste and 
spent nuclear fuel, which would be used as the basis for developing a strategy on the same subject in 
the near future with the assistance of EU experts. It was important to have such a strategy in place 
before ArmeniaÂs operating reactor was decommissioned. 
92. He expressed regret at the repeated attempts of Azerbaijan to use the Agency as a platform to 
pursue its unscrupulous political aims. Azerbaijan regularly contacted the Secretariat with absurd 
claims that Armenia was disposing of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel on the territory of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia had always declared its readiness to welcome an Agency expert group, 
including experts from Azerbaijan, to investigate the allegations in situ. 
93. At the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011, Azerbaijan had claimed 
that Armenia had refused to publish the report on its OSART mission, showing that it knew nothing 
about the Agency rules of document management. Armenia, which had always behaved correctly and 
with restraint, considered it unacceptable that the Agency should be used for such unprofessional 
exchanges. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 13 
94. His Government kept a close eye on the safety of its operating nuclear power unit. The 
12th meeting of ArmeniaÂs Nuclear Energy Safety Council comprising internationally recognized 
experts and scientists, would be held on 6 December 2011. The Agency, for its part, coordinated 
international assistance to raise safety levels at the Armenian nuclear power plant. The fifth Technical 
Meeting on that topic was scheduled to take place in Vienna on 13-14 October 2011. He thanked the 
Department of Technical Cooperation for its technical assistance in that regard. 
95. He reiterated his countryÂs interest in participating in INPRO projects, particularly those related 
to the development of nuclear power in small countries and the development of small and medium 
sized reactors. Also, Armenia was ready to enter into discussions on its possible accession to the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management and had informed the Secretariat accordingly. 
96. In closing, he expressed ArmeniaÂs support for the Peaceful Uses Initiative proposed by the 
United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, at the NPT Review Conference in May 2010. 
97. Mr BA (Senegal) conveyed the sympathy and solidarity of the Senegalese people to the 
Government and people of Japan for their courageous, disciplined and responsible management of the 
Fukushima accidentÂs dire consequences. 
98. The IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in Vienna in June 2011 had made 
considerable progress towards strengthening safety and security and the management of radiological 
and nuclear information. He was convinced that the Agency would take its conclusions and decisions 
into account and support their efficient and rapid implementation in order to minimize the potential 
risks that could undermine the major benefits of peaceful nuclear applications. 
99. He expressed his countryÂs satisfaction with the AgencyÂs commitment to peaceful nuclear 
technology, nuclear safety and security, and strengthened safeguards. By way of demonstration of its 
commitment to the transparent, safe and sustainable use of nuclear energy, Senegal had ratified and 
was implementing the principal international legal instruments on nuclear safety and non-proliferation 
under the AgencyÂs auspices. Also, it had adhered to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources and intended to strengthen its cooperation as regards international security to 
monitor transport and to combat nuclear terrorism and illicit trafficking involving nuclear and other 
radioactive materials. 
100. In the interests of nuclear safety, the President of Senegal had decided to abandon nuclear power 
in favour of using innovative and renewable energy in its energy diversification policy. Since no 
nuclear power project was viable without a proper safety policy, Senegal had strengthened the 
independence of the National Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority. 
101. Senegal appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation, which covered such essential areas as 
training, technology transfer, expert exchanges, the provision of modern medical and nuclear safety 
equipment, as well as support for research into water resource management, improved agricultural and 
livestock productivity, radiation protection and malnutrition. Senegal would do all it could to enhance 
its excellent cooperation with the Agency and use nuclear science and technology for socio-economic 
development. 
102. Reaffirming SenegalÂs full adherence to the AgencyÂs peace and development ideals, he said 
that his country would do its utmost to promote the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
strengthen the AgencyÂs non-proliferation and verification regime. Accordingly, Senegal supported 
and would take part in the second Executive Committee meeting of the International Framework for 
Nuclear Energy Cooperation (IFNEC) in Warsaw, on 29 September 2011. It hoped that agreement 
could be reached on IFNECÂs future activities to reduce proliferation risks, on comprehensive nuclear 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 14 
fuel services, on financing civilian nuclear power projects and the development of robust 
infrastructures. His country was fully committed to working with the international community for 
peace and global stability. 
103. Senegal hoped for the adoption and extensive application of the AgencyÂs safety standards, the 
fundamental safety and security conventions and agreements, and safeguards. His delegation expected 
the General Conference to reach positive and constructive conclusions by consensus on the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy for sustainable development. 
104. Mr POTTS (Australia) expressed sympathy to the people of Japan as they continued to cope 
with the aftermath of the disasters of March 2011. The courage of the emergency workers striving to 
overcome the effects of the Fukushima Daiichi accident was humbling. 
105. The accident, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, had reminded the 
world of the importance of nuclear safety. Welcoming the Director GeneralÂs prompt action and 
initiatives in that regard, he said his country had been pleased to participate in the IAEA Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011 and to have some of its proposals for improving nuclear 
safety and securing public confidence reflected in the Ministerial Declaration and the resulting draft 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. Australia welcomed the consensus approval of that action plan by the 
Board of Governors the previous week and urged the General Conference to endorse it, thereby 
sending a message of unity and purpose concerning the priority the Agency attached to achieving the 
highest possible standards of nuclear safety. 
106. The events of 2011 had demonstrated that more must be done to improve nuclear safety. His 
country looked forward to reports on the effective implementation of the Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety by the Secretariat and Member States and to further opportunities to reach agreement on 
measures for enhancing safety and ensuring transparency. While Australia strongly supported the 
Action Plan, it did not consider it an exhaustive list of actions on nuclear safety. Thus, he encouraged 
States to be proactive in undertaking additional measures relevant to their own circumstances and to 
ensure that adequate resources were made available. 
107. Use of the range of international peer review missions available to Member States through the 
Agency, including the IRRS, OSART and SCART, should be promoted. Also, Australia emphasized 
the need for the international community to support international fact-finding missions and asked the 
Agency to develop mechanisms by which such missions could be deployed rapidly and efficiently. 
108. The AgencyÂs role and capacity to fulfil its obligations in regard to emergency preparedness and 
response must also continue to be strengthened. 
109. Noting that the Agency safety standards were being reviewed, he stressed the importance of the 
IAEA Safety Series in guiding efforts to improve nuclear, transport, radiation and waste safety 
worldwide. 
110. Australia supported close cooperation between the Agency and UNSCEAR in assessing the 
consequences of the Fukushima accident. Australia was pleased to coordinate the assessment of public 
health and environmental effects through its safety regulator, the Australian Radiation Protection and 
Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA). 
111. Noting that safety measures were not the only elements required to protect people and the 
environment properly, he emphasized the close connection between safety and security related 
measures. 
112. Turning to the issue of safeguards and verification, he said that all Member States must work to 
ensure an effective safeguards system that provided assurances of the correctness and completeness of 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 15 
a StateÂs declarations concerning the peaceful nature of its nuclear activities Â a system in which all 
could continue to have confidence. Such a system provided the basic foundation for nuclear trade and 
cooperation, security, and a basis for continuing progress on nuclear disarmament. 
113. To be effective, a safeguards system must have universal coverage. He called upon all those 
NPT States which had yet to fulfil their obligation under the Treaty to conclude a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement to do so without delay. To achieve the important goal of universalization, all 
States that had not signed and ratified the Treaty should do so as soon as possible. Full compliance 
with safeguards on all peaceful nuclear activities was an essential step towards a world free of nuclear 
weapons. 
114. Australia was honoured by the nomination of Ambassador Peter Woolcott to chair the first 
session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 NPT Review Conference, to be held in 2012, and 
looked forward to working with all States party to the NPT to ensure that the meeting was a success. 
115. Australia welcomed the efforts to promote Agency safeguards and would continue to work with 
the Secretariat in using regional and bilateral opportunities to encourage all countries to implement 
effective safeguards. 
116. The Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network (APSN), of which Australia was chair, had held its 
second plenary meeting in the Republic of Korea in July 2011. He thanked the Agency for 
contributing to the meeting. To improve and strengthen safeguards implementation and the overall 
non-proliferation regime in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia was working with the APSN to draft a 
paper on fundamentals and good practices for State systems of accounting for and control of nuclear 
material. It would include lessons learnt by the community of Asia-Pacific nations that made up the 
Network and would complement the work of the Agency on safeguards implementation guidelines. 
The APSNÂs Statement of Principles had been published as document INFCIRC/769/Rev.1. 
117. Safeguards support programmes were an important means whereby Member States could 
support the Agency in developing safeguards techniques and approaches. The Australian programme, 
which had been in place since 1980, had made valuable contributions to such areas as analytical 
services for environmental sampling, remote monitoring, training, and analytical and concepts work. A 
new task that Australia had recently taken on under that programme was qualification of the 
University of Western AustraliaÂs large-geometry ion microprobe for isotopic analysis of 
uranium-bearing particles in order for it to become a member of the AgencyÂs Network of Analytical 
Laboratories. 
118. The major technical challenge facing the safeguards system was the need to ensure credible 
verification, thus providing confidence that safeguards were effective in detecting both the misuse of 
declared facilities and the existence of undeclared facilities. 
119. Australia had been the first State to sign and ratify an additional protocol. The combination of a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol assisted States in assuring others of 
the peaceful intent of their nuclear activities. Every State stood to benefit from a safeguards system 
that was as effective as possible, and the additional protocol was an essential component in ensuring 
the maximum effectiveness of that system. Australia strongly encouraged those States that had yet to 
sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol to do so as soon as possible. 
120. Further, States must comply with their safeguards obligations. Agency safeguards obligations 
were not voluntary. Such obligations included those under the NPT, whereby non-nuclear-weapon 
States had made a commitment to each other to use nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes. 
That commitment must be kept and States must be held accountable for any violations. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 16 
121. It was a matter of continuing regret that certain States continued to be in breach of their 
safeguards obligations. The Islamic Republic of Iran continued to defy binding Security Council 
resolutions and the requirements of the Board of Governors. Australia shared increasingly serious 
concerns about the mounting evidence regarding possible military dimensions to IranÂs nuclear 
programme. Australia looked forward to the Director General setting out in greater detail the basis for 
the AgencyÂs concerns in that regard and, once again, encouraged Iran to comply with the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, engage with the Agency to resolve all issues and demonstrate 
conclusively the peaceful intent of its nuclear programme. 
122. Australia urged the Syrian Arab Republic to act quickly to implement the resolution adopted by 
the Board on 9 June 2011 (GOV/2011/41). It welcomed SyriaÂs offer to cooperate with the Agency to 
resolve all outstanding safeguards issues and asked it to engage positively and substantively with the 
Agency on those matters. Australia requested that the Director General continue reporting to the Board 
as appropriate. 
123. The DPRK continued to be in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations and to act in 
defiance of Security Council resolutions. Australia urged the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons 
and its nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and to comply with its 
obligations under the NPT and Agency safeguards. His country supported the Agency in maintaining 
its readiness to play an essential role in verifying the DPRKÂs nuclear programme. 
124. Australia had long supported the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Full compliance by all States in the Middle East with 
their non-proliferation obligations was critical to building mutual confidence and security in the 
region. It was important to continue to build on NPT Review Conference outcomes, including the 
agreement to convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 
125. In addition, Australia welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a Middle East 
forum on the issue in November 2011. Australia would work with others both to ensure the success of 
the forum by sharing its experiences relating to the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and to 
ensure that the forum was a positive step towards the broader goal of such a zone in the Middle East. 
In the meantime, Australia encouraged all States to avoid any actions that might disrupt progress 
towards reaching that important goal. 
126. Australia continued to work closely with the Agency and its regional neighbours with regard to 
nuclear safety and security. As a major producer and exporter of uranium, holding around one third of 
the worldÂs uranium resources, it was committed to the safe and environmentally sound mining, 
processing and transport of uranium and had a strong record in those areas. To that end, Australia had 
established an informal Vienna-based contact group for existing and prospective uranium mining 
countries, the Friends of Responsible Uranium Mining (FoRUM), as a means of exchanging views and 
experience with regard to best practices in mining uranium. For the fourth successive year, Australia 
had hosted a side event during the General Conference on integrated approaches to effective controls 
for uranium mining by government and industry. 
127. Australia valued its cooperation with the Agency in the Radiological Security Partnership for 
South-East Asia. Over the past eight years, the Partnership had strengthened the security of radioactive 
sources in the region. Australia was looking forward to the biennial review meeting to be held in the 
Philippines in January 2012. 
128. His country, which attached great importance to capacity development in nuclear security Â 
particularly nuclear forensic science, would continue to support international efforts in method 
standardization, the development of nuclear forensic libraries, a common lexicon, and training. In that 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 17 
regard, it looked forward to hosting an Asia-Pacific training workshop on radiological crime scene 
management and nuclear forensics in February 2012. 
129. Australia also continued to attach great importance to the safe, timely and reliable transport of 
radioactive materials that were essential to industry and to medical, scientific and industrial 
applications. That was a key issue and Australia continued to support international efforts to address it. 
It was looking forward to the October 2011 International Conference on the Safe and Secure Transport 
of Radioactive Material. 
130. Through the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Australia 
continued to expand production of molybdenum-99 for nuclear medicine through its fully lowenriched 
uranium based Open Pool Australian Light Water (OPAL) Reactor fuel and targets. In so 
doing, Australia was contributing to the worldwide supply of radiopharmaceuticals while, at the same 
time, promoting global nuclear non-proliferation efforts through practical advances towards 
minimizing the civilian use of high-enriched uranium. 
131. In relation to nuclear applications, Australia underscored the right of Member States to enjoy 
the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in accordance with their international obligations. 
Through ANSTO, Australia shared its scientific research base with other Member States and 
facilitated the use and exchange of equipment and personnel in relevant fields. In that regard, he noted 
that the state-of-the-art neutron beam facilities at the ANSTO OPAL Reactor were a designated IAEA 
Collaborating Centre for neutron scattering applications. 
132. In addition to sharing skills and materials, Australia consistently ranked among the top 
contributors to the TCF and it continued to play a leading role in the RCA, including on projects 
covering radiation protection and health care. 
133. In that context, and in the spirit of the Peaceful Uses Initiative, Australia had contributed 
100 000 Australian dollars to the Agency for the marine benchmark study on the possible impact of 
the Fukushima radioactive releases in the Asia-Pacific region, approved by the Board in June 2011, 
and had recently hosted the initial project meeting for the study. 
134. The General Conference provided an annual opportunity to take stock of the AgencyÂs work and 
to evaluate its contribution to maintaining international peace and security. The Agency would be 
facing many challenges over the coming year, including the Fukushima aftermath, and Australia was 
confident that it had the capacity and resilience to meet its statutory objectives. 
135. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco) said that the Fukushima accident had again raised serious questions 
about nuclear safety. His delegation commended the Director General for convening the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety, which had underscored the AgencyÂs fundamental role concerning the 
safety of nuclear installations and activities. Morocco welcomed the efforts to elaborate an action plan, 
which would launch a process of strengthening the global nuclear safety framework. Also, Morocco 
was pleased that the question of nuclear safety was being addressed at a high-level meeting in New 
York on nuclear security and safety convened by the UN Secretary-General, which was being held in 
parallel with the General Conference. Morocco, convinced of the importance of nuclear safety and 
security, was participating in both events. His Government had taken steps to put an effective 
regulatory capacity in place in Morocco in the fields of nuclear and radiological safety and security. 
136. Although nuclear safety and security were a national responsibility, their transboundary nature 
meant that there was also a collective responsibility. Morocco had always encouraged international 
efforts to strengthen safety and security systems worldwide. As a partner State in the Global Initiative 
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, it had participated actively in activities in that context. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 18 
137. Through its engagement in that international effort, Morocco understood the importance of the 
exchange of information. An international exercise on rapid response to malicious acts involving 
radioactive materials, attended by many experts and scientists from partner States, had been organized 
in March in Rabat. MoroccoÂs National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology had been 
the central body responsible for the simulation exercises Â a practical reflection of the principles of 
the Initiative. He expressed his GovernmentÂs appreciation to all countries as well as to the Agency for 
the support they had given to Morocco in that exercise. 
138. As part of preparations for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Morocco had been 
asked to chair the working group on management of and response to radiological and nuclear 
emergencies, in recognition of its active leadership role in that sphere. In that connection, Morocco 
would host a coordinating meeting in early 2012 and would organize an outreach activity before the 
end of 2011 for the benefit of African countries. 
139. By verifying compliance with NPT non-proliferation obligations, the Agency played a unique 
role in maintaining international peace and security. His delegation reiterated its support for the 
AgencyÂs verification activities in that context and commended it for the impartiality and 
professionalism it had shown in fulfilling its verification mandate. 
140. Morocco, which had consistently called for a strengthening of the AgencyÂs verification 
capacities, had once again demonstrated commitment to its verification obligations by bringing its 
additional protocol into force in April. He called on all Member States to help strengthen the AgencyÂs 
verification system so that the Agency could conduct its activities in that area in conformity with its 
mandate under the NPT. 
141. The credibility of the verification system was vitiated by continuing resistance. The Middle East 
continued to be a source of concern because of the failure of one country in the region, Israel, to 
accede to the NPT and submit its installations to Agency verification. In that connection, Morocco 
welcomed the convening by the Director General of a forum on the establishment of an NWFZ in the 
Middle East, which was a tangible contribution to the holding of the 2012 conference on the 
establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East decided upon at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. 
142. As a developing country, Morocco attached particular importance to the role of the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme in transferring nuclear technology and sharing expertise in order to 
promote socio-economic development. Morocco always paid its contribution to the TCF target and its 
national participation costs in full and on time. The technical cooperation programme had enabled 
Morocco to put into place major infrastructure and to develop human capacities. Morocco had 
benefited in particular from nuclear applications in the fields of agriculture, health, water resources 
management, the environment and nutrition. 
143. The African dimension had an important place in MoroccoÂs foreign policy. His country sought 
to make its human resources and expertise available to African experts and scientists by hosting 
training courses on various nuclear technology disciplines at its institutions. 
144. As a party to AFRA, Morocco contributed to activities in the field of nuclear science and 
technology. It had recently been selected to serve as a regional designated centre in the area of isotope 
hydrology and was in the process of being selected as a centre for training and education in radiation 
protection. 
145. Morocco welcomed the decision to devote the 2011 Scientific Forum to the topic of water. The 
continuing rapid growth in the developing world and the inevitable impact of global warming made 
the question of water a major international concern. As a semi-arid country, Morocco was alive to the 
need for long-term planning in the area of water resources management. Thus, it had diversified its 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 19 
approaches and solutions to each specific case. That had been reflected by the publication in 2010, in 
cooperation with the Agency and the National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology, 
of a national isotope hydrology atlas, which had been prepared in response to the need for rational 
assessment and management of that increasingly scarce resource. He expressed appreciation for the 
work of the Agency and national experts in that regard and said that Morocco was prepared to share its 
experience in that area. 
146. The Agency played an important role in promoting international cooperation by endorsing the 
priorities of Member States while respecting the diversity of their needs and in so doing strengthened 
the bonds of belonging and ownership of all Member States. To that end, the Agency should 
democratize its governing bodies, in particular the Board of Governors, to reflect a balanced 
representation of its Member States. 
147. Mr DUJANGA (Uganda) expressed condolences and sympathy to the people and Government 
of Japan for the great losses suffered as a consequence of the natural disaster compounded by the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident. He commended Japan and the Agency for their rapid and well 
coordinated interventions aimed at minimizing the impact of the nuclear crisis. The lessons learnt 
should be implemented effectively to enhance global nuclear safety. 
148. Uganda was grateful for the continuing support from the Agency in the health, water, 
agriculture and industrial sectors, where the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology 
were vital. 
149. In view of the increasing incidence of cancer, especially cervical cancer, his country welcomed 
the AgencyÂs assistance as regards radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services. The selection of 
Uganda as a PACT pilot country would make an important contribution to building human resource 
capacity in comprehensive cancer control in the African region. 
150. Access to drinking water remained a major problem in many developing countries, including his 
own. He commended the Agency for its support in use of the isotope hydrology technique for 
assessing groundwater resources, which facilitated the development and implementation of 
comprehensive water supply plans and strategies in rural and urbanization areas. Uganda was pleased 
that water had been made the theme of the 2011 Scientific Forum and looked forward to continuing its 
cooperation with the Agency in that area. 
151. The research conducted by the Joint Division with a view to developing disease and drought 
resistant crop varieties and improving animal production had greatly improved the food basket in 
developing countries. Improved crop varieties could also help in addressing population growth and 
climate change. 
152. Despite the tremendous impact of the Fukushima accident on the future of the nuclear industry, 
nuclear power remained one of the cleanest sources of energy and would be needed to drive the 
economic engines of the world. As a growing economy, Uganda needed a sustainable energy system 
to meet its development needs. In 2006, it had therefore decided to develop a nuclear power 
programme. The accident at Fukushima would not deter it from that goal, but had shown the need for 
correct implementation from the outset. Uganda would seek out highly experienced suppliers, ensure 
that it followed robust international nuclear and radiation safety standards, and would learn from 
States with significant operating experience. 
153. Stronger, more independent national nuclear regulatory authorities were needed and his 
delegation welcomed the recommendations of the recent IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety in that regard. Having recognized the importance of an effective regulatory infrastructure, 
Uganda had established its Atomic Energy Council in 2009 and developed atomic energy regulations 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 20 
which had been approved and were ready for publication in its official gazette. The Atomic Energy 
Council had procured and commissioned land in April 2011 for the construction of a facility that 
would house a storage bunker for spent and orphan sources, laboratories, offices for its secretariat and 
a new training centre. It had received 500 thermoluminescent dosimeter badges from the Agency, 
which were currently being distributed to workers exposed to radiation. An additional 1000 badges 
would be procured in 2012. 
154. In addition to the capacity building programme implemented in the framework of the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, the Ugandan Government had sponsored young graduates in the 
Nuclear Energy Unit and the Atomic Energy Council to obtain masterÂs degrees in a range of nuclear 
fields. 
155. As the peaceful uses of nuclear energy expanded worldwide, so did the challenges to ensure 
security and safety. The main concern for developing countries was illicit trafficking of nuclear and 
radiological materials, which put the lives of many people at risk. He thanked the AgencyÂs Office of 
Nuclear Security and the United States Global Threat Reduction Initiative for their efforts to ensure 
nuclear security in Uganda. 
156. Atomic energy was vital to global development and the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme played an important role in that regard. His Government would continue to support the 
Agency and its activities to enable it to fulfil its mission and contribute to achieving global prosperity. 
157. Mr OSAISAI (Nigeria) commended the Director General for taking decisive and positive steps 
in the aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident and for his timely action in convening the 
IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011. His delegation expected the outcome of 
the Conference to lead to the development of appropriate mechanisms to assess and strengthen 
national, regional and international emergency preparedness and response capabilities. 
158. Although there had been initial concerns about the potentially dampening effect of the accident 
on global nuclear power development, global commitment to continuing with the safe utilization of 
nuclear power had not waned. Notwithstanding the safety questions raised by the accident, the factors 
which influenced the decisions by individual countries to embark on a new nuclear power programme 
or expand an existing one had not changed. 
159. Emphasizing the need to strengthen nuclear security, he said the Agency had a key role to play 
in working for a world free of all nuclear weapons. The AgencyÂs current effort to establish an NWFZ 
in the Middle East was a welcome initiative and Nigeria would continue to support the attainment of 
that objective. 
160. Nuclear safety and nuclear security were inextricably linked and so the development of a 
stronger global nuclear safety framework might also entail a tighter nuclear security regime. An 
international commitment to the enforcement of an effective nuclear safety and security regime could 
be achieved through effective national legislation and the enhancement of bilateral, regional and 
multilateral cooperation among Member States. 
161. Nigeria was committed to full compliance with its international obligations in ensuring and 
enforcing nuclear safety, security and safeguards and had acceded to and ratified the relevant treaties 
and conventions in preparation for bringing nuclear power plants into operation. Noting that the 
Pelindaba Treaty had entered into force in July 2009, he said Nigeria expected that more African 
States would be invited to attend the second Nuclear Security Summit to be held in the Republic of 
Korea in 2012. 
162. As a newcomer country, Nigeria had started implementing a nuclear power programme as part 
of its strategy to diversify its power generation base and ensure long-term energy self-sufficiency and 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 21 
security to meet the energy needs of its large population. The decision to introduce nuclear power into 
the national energy mix had been taken after a long and meticulous process over several years using 
analytical and planning tools with Agency assistance. The Fukushima Daiichi accident would pose 
additional obstacles to NigeriaÂs efforts to implement its nuclear power programme, but in the medium 
and long term, nuclear energy would play an important role in ensuring national energy 
self-sufficiency and security. 
163. It was necessary to have an adequate and skilled human resource base to sustain a nuclear power 
programme over time and ensure an effective nuclear safety regime. Accordingly, the implementation 
strategy for NigeriaÂs nuclear programme envisaged comprehensive manpower training, capacity 
building and research infrastructure development. 
164. The Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission and participating national universities were 
cooperating closely on organizing degree and professional programmes in nuclear technology and 
nuclear security. The facilities at the five university nuclear research centres and at the central training 
facility in Sheda-Abuja were being upgraded to ensure high standards of education and training in 
nuclear science and engineering. Nigeria was counting on support through the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme and the assistance of other development partners to build the necessary human 
resource base. 
165. The existence of strong national institutions was critical to the planning and successful 
implementation of a nuclear power programme. Thus, Nigeria had decided to strengthen its national 
institutions in the sector so that they could implement their mandates effectively. The Nigeria Atomic 
Energy Commission (NAEC), the national focal agency for atomic energy development, had been 
reconstituted as an independent and self-accounting agency. 
166. Continued cooperation and support from the international community for the sustainable 
implementation of NigeriaÂs nuclear power programme must be based on adherence to the culture of 
nuclear safety. For a newcomer like Nigeria, the establishment of an effective regulatory regime was 
essential and entailed the adoption and enforcement of internationally accepted safety standards by an 
independent regulatory body. Appropriate practical steps had been taken in that regard to strengthen 
the Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA). 
167. Planning for the effective management of nuclear waste was a precondition for the success of 
any national nuclear power programme, particularly with regard to public acceptance. The attendant 
technology, methods and processes must be learned over time. Consequently, Nigeria had embarked 
on the development of facilities for the management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste at 
the Nuclear Technology Centre in Sheda-Abuja. The Agency was providing a wide range of technical 
support for project design and delivery. 
168. Nigeria was currently implementing Milestone 2 activities in the development of a national 
infrastructure for nuclear power. It looked forward to fruitful partnerships to advance its national 
programme, including with other Member States that had the necessary technological base, such as the 
Russian Federation. 
169. The theme of the Scientific Forum of the Conference, ÂWater Matters Â Making a Difference 
with Nuclear TechniquesÂ, was of particular interest to Nigeria in view of the worldÂs diminishing 
water resources and the role nuclear techniques could play in ameliorating the problem. The 
discussion came at a time when drought had brought untold hardship to the Horn of Africa. Nigeria 
hoped that the Forum would identify appropriate scientific tools and opportunities for effective water 
resources exploitation and management. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 22 
170. The Agency had provided welcome support in the assessment of NigeriaÂs water resources, in 
particular studies of the hydrodynamics, origin and recharge of aquifers in the Chad and Iullemeden 
basins in the Benue Trough and south-eastern parts of the country using isotope hydrology techniques. 
It was planned that the isotope hydrology facility at Zaria, for which the Agency had donated critical 
analytical infrastructure, including a mass spectrometer, would become fully operational by the end of 
2011. 
171. In the health sector, cooperation between the Agency and Nigeria was being stepped up in order 
to make use of modern techniques in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy as effective tools for cancer 
control. Modern nuclear medicine facilities were being developed under a memorandum of 
understanding between Nigeria and the Agency. Ten nuclear medicine facilities were being built and 
equipped in tertiary hospitals across the country, with a national cost sharing of $37 million over eight 
years starting from 2010. To date, $9 million had been paid to speed up programme implementation. 
172. In addition to enhancing early cancer detection and management, the technical cooperation 
projects with the Agency aimed to promote human capacity development and infrastructure expansion 
in nuclear medicine facilities and radiotherapy centres. Upon completion, scheduled for 2016, those 
activities would significantly enhance the integration of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine into the 
national cancer plan and further broaden the practice of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine for cancer 
management. 
173. To consolidate those achievements, Nigeria would like to continue working with the Agency to 
develop such areas as: human capacity building in palliative care, oncology nursing, cancer screening 
and colposcopy; management of a cancer registry and training of radiologists for interventional 
radiotherapy; improvement of information technology facilities to enhance participation in the 
VUCCnet programme; and technical assistance for monitoring and evaluation of the national cancer 
control plan under PACT. His delegation hoped that NigeriaÂs national programmes would continue to 
benefit from PACT. 
174. His delegation welcomed the significant gains achieved under various nuclear technology 
application projects in Nigeria through partnership with the Agency and other Member States. Nigeria 
appreciated the AgencyÂs technical support in finalization of the 2012-2015 integrated work plan for 
the national nuclear power infrastructure development programme and for the funding provided by the 
Agency through the United States Peaceful Uses Initiative. 
175. Nigeria reaffirmed its commitment to the basic tenets of the NPT. Its nuclear power programme 
was consistent with the countryÂs established position that its nuclear science and technology activities 
were purely for peaceful purposes and would remain within the safeguards framework. 
176. Nigeria expressed its deep appreciation for the assistance it continued to receive from the 
Agency and reiterated its commitment to the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear science and 
technology for sustainable development. 
177. Mr HAMER (Netherlands) said that the past year had been overshadowed by the tragic 
consequences of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on 11 March 2011 and the tragic accident at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. He expressed the deeply felt sympathy and support of the 
Netherlands for the people of Japan and paid tribute to the courage and fortitude of the personnel at 
Fukushima, as well as the Japanese authorities, in handling the crisis. 
178. With consensus having been reached among the NPT parties for the first time in many years at 
the 2010 Review Conference, there had been significant progress on non-proliferation, arms control 
and disarmament over the past year. The result had been a bold new action plan, which would be a 
road map towards the next Review Conference in 2015. What was now needed was initiatives to 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 23 
continue in the spirit of the 2010 Review Conference and to remove the nuclear shadow under which 
the world still lived. 
179. Times were challenging for the non-proliferation regime. The continuing defiance of the 
international community by the DPRK regarding its nuclear weapons programme, IranÂs lack of 
cooperation in allowing the Agency to verify the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme, 
outstanding questions about SyriaÂs nuclear programme, and the danger of nuclear material falling into 
the hands of terrorists and other non-State actors were all matters of grave concern. 
180. The Netherlands would continue to make innovative, practical proposals to implement the 
2010 action plan. Non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control had always been and would remain 
cornerstones of the Netherlands foreign policy, with the NPT as its basis and the action plan as its road 
map. That was an essential part of the commitment of the Netherlands to strengthen international law 
and security. For the Netherlands, non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control were all facets of 
the same diamond. 
181. The Netherlands was one of ten countries that had launched the Non-Proliferation and 
Disarmament Initiative (NPDI), which linked those issues. At the NPDI ministerial meeting held in 
Berlin on 30 April 2011 the decision had been taken to press for greater transparency in the way 
nuclear-weapon States reported their disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation efforts. At the 
same time, efforts had been stepped up for universal accession to the AgencyÂs additional protocol, 
which was vital in order to ensure that nuclear activities remained peaceful. 
182. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was a fundamental component of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and as such played an indispensable role in the implementation of the NPT. The Netherlands 
greatly appreciated the way in which the Secretariat was implementing its mandate. Safeguards were 
being evaluated and improved with a view to making them more effective and efficient through, for 
example, the introduction of novel technologies and the State-level approach. The Netherlands 
supported safeguards on a bilateral basis through its Member State Support Programme (MSSP). 
Recently its Foreign Minister had announced a new voluntary contribution of Â100 000 towards the 
AgencyÂs efforts to universalize the additional protocol. 
183. The AgencyÂs reporting on situations in countries had, as expected, been technical and factual. 
The situations that were cause for grave concern had rightly been referred to the Security Council. The 
Netherlands had noted with deep concern the latest report on Iran by the Director General, which 
confirmed that that country was in violation of its obligations and continued to expand its enrichment 
activities, including by increasing its enrichment capacity to 20%. The Agency was increasingly 
concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear related activities 
involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear 
payload for a missile, about which the Agency continued to receive new information. IranÂs 
cooperation was still insufficient for the Agency to provide credible assurance about the absence of 
undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in 
Iran was in peaceful activities. The Netherlands urged Iran to address all the AgencyÂs outstanding 
concerns and to respond positively and through concrete actions to the AgencyÂs request for 
engagement and by granting prompt access to relevant locations, equipment, documentation and 
persons. 
184. The Netherlands thanked the Director General for his comprehensive report on the situation in 
the DPRK, which also remained of great concern. 
185. Recalling the BoardÂs resolution of 9 June 2011 (GOV/2011/41) urging Syria to remedy 
urgently its non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, he said the Netherlands hoped that Syria 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 24 
would respond positively and without delay to the Director GeneralÂs request, resolve all outstanding 
questions and bring into force an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
186. He commended the Secretariat for its energetic approach to nuclear security. That was a very 
important albeit relatively new field, which his country was helping to promote through various 
forums, such as the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) and the nuclear security 
summit process. The AgencyÂs role remained pivotal and, for that reason, the Netherlands had pledged 
a new contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund of Â750 000 at the end of 2010. Those funds were not 
earmarked. The Netherlands believed that the AgencyÂs nuclear security work should not be dependent 
on extrabudgetary contributions; it should be fully funded through the Regular Budget. In addition, the 
Netherlands supported the Agency by hosting events such as training courses for physical protection. 
For its part, the Netherlands had recently ratified the amendment to the Convention on Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Materials (CPPNM) and had received IPPAS missions in all its nuclear 
installations. It strongly encouraged other Member States to do likewise. 
187. The Netherlands was a strong believer in peer review because it held up a mirror to national 
review mechanisms and provided assurances to the international community. That was especially true 
in the area of safety, which was why in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident the Netherlands had 
so strongly advocated the mandatory nature of safety peer review missions in the Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety. The Netherlands considered that document to be a starting point for the process of 
enhancing nuclear safety worldwide. The Netherlands had taken good note of the Director GeneralÂs 
words that further lessons remained to be learned and that the Action Plan would be updated 
accordingly. The Netherlands hoped that the Action Plan would be the starting point for a process 
whereby future lessons learned would be incorporated and actions expanded. For now, it was 
important for the Agency, as well as those Member States with nuclear power plants or embarking on 
a nuclear power programme, to do their utmost to promote prompt and effective implementation. The 
Netherlands would follow those issues closely in the lead-up to the extraordinary meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in August 2012. 
188. His Government believed that nuclear energy had an important role to play within the 
NetherlandsÂ energy mix because of security of supply and carbon dioxide reduction. It was a major 
bridging technology to a future with more renewable energy. The disaster in Japan had strengthened 
the countryÂs resolve that safety must come first. In the Netherlands, the electricity market had been 
liberalized and the Government would not itself invest in new power generation facilities. Instead it 
would set conditions and leave it to the private sector to decide whether or not to invest in nuclear 
power. Two private companies had so far submitted a notification of intent to build a new nuclear 
power plant. 
189. The events at Fukushima had occurred after the conditions imposed on new nuclear power 
plants had been presented to the Netherlands parliament, and lessons learned would be included in his 
countryÂs nuclear policy. The European decision concerning the application of a stress test to nuclear 
power plants affected, in the case of the Netherlands, the plant in Borssele. The Government had 
decided to subject the research reactors in Petten and Delft to a stress test also. 
190. The AgencyÂs role in strengthening nuclear non-proliferation, in guaranteeing the safety and 
security of nuclear energy and in advancing nuclear technology for the benefit of all could not be 
overstated. It was crucial for the Agency to be equipped with the resources required to fulfil its 
mandate. In that regard, the Netherlands welcomed the agreement on the new budget for 2012Â2013 
and the adoption of the new Medium Term Strategy. The latter addressed the AgencyÂs challenges and 
priorities and contained a clear commitment to carry out the AgencyÂs tasks effectively and efficiently 
in the years ahead. 
GC(55)/OR.3

191. The Netherlands remained a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme 
and had pledged its full target share to the TCF for 2012. Through its technical cooperation 
programme the Agency could make a unique contribution to sustainable national and international 
development, including the Millennium Development Goals. He stressed, however, the importance of 
rigorous implementation of safety, security and safeguards measures in the technical cooperation 
programme to prevent any unnecessary risk to the health of citizens, workers, patients or the 
environment or the possibility that nuclear materials might end up in the hands of terrorists or other 
malicious individuals and organizations. The Netherlands welcomed the AgencyÂs clear commitment 
in that regard. 
192. The Netherlands would, as a member of the Board of Governors, continue to take an active part 
in shaping the future of the Agency and how it dealt with the challenges and opportunities before it. 
193. Ms TUTWILER (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) said that the 
eradication of rinderpest was an exceptional accomplishment. Rinderpest was only the second disease 
worldwide, after the human disease smallpox, to be eradicated and elimination of the rinderpest virus 
marked the first time in history that an animal disease had been successfully eradicated. It was the end 
of a scourge which, over the course of a thousand years, had spread from Asia to Africa and Europe, 
with two incursions into the Americas and Australia in the 1920s. Rinderpest had destroyed millions 
of animals, taken a heavy toll on biodiversity and undermined the livelihoods of people. It had had a 
devastating effect on food security, nutrition and agricultural development. 
194. Many Agency Member States had benefited directly from the global rinderpest eradication 
programme and the technical cooperation projects in which the Agency, FAO and the World 
Organisation for Animal Health (OlE) had invested. All countries across the globe had benefited from 
the fact that rinderpest no longer posed a daily threat to peopleÂs livelihoods and the survival of 
millions of head of cattle and wildlife. 
195. That success in leadership and cooperation should serve as a lesson to make inroads into other 
animal diseases that affected production or were threats to human health and food security. The means 
and commitment existed and, with the support of Member States, great things could be accomplished. 
The basis for action established during the rinderpest campaign should be used to address other animal 
and human health threats. 
196. FAOÂs efforts in rinderpest control dated from its creation in 1945. Starting in the early 1990s, 
FAO had overseen the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP), working in close 
cooperation with partners such as the Agency, OIE, governments, NGOs and regional institutions like 
the African UnionÂs Interafrican Bureau for Animal Resources. The global efforts had leveraged 
regional programmes involving people, countries, institutions and donors and had resulted in a 
winning combination of technical excellence, partnerships and collaboration. 
197. FAO and its partners had fostered the concept of coordinated regional programmes, such as the 
Somali Ecosystem Rinderpest Eradication Coordination Unit, where the rinderpest virus had last been 
reported in circulation. Veterinary services, laboratories, researchers and donors had also contributed. 
The support of all partners and donors had been indispensable. 
198. The GREP had worked closely with the AgencyÂs Joint Division. Critical to its success had 
been the availability of tested and proven diagnostic and surveillance tools and access to an effective 
heat-stable rinderpest vaccine that had been developed in partnership with the Joint Division. 
Particular recognition should be given to the FAO/OIE World Reference Laboratory for Rinderpest in 
the United Kingdom, the International Cooperation Centre of Agricultural Research for Development- 
Department of Livestock and Veterinary Medicine in Tropical Countries (CIRAD-EMVT) in France, 
the United States Department of Agriculture and Tufts University, among others. 
GC(55)/OR.3 
20 September 2011, Page 26 
199. The international community had learned some important institutional and operational lessons 
from the campaign. Open dialogue, good coordination and trust between partners were indispensable. 
The partnerships had translated into networks of experts and country clusters working towards the 
same goal. The partnerships with countries, scientists, individual community leaders and donors had 
been crucial. 
200. With rinderpest eradicated, the battle had been won but not the war. The new priority was 
rinderpest sequestration and the safekeeping of rinderpest viruses in 20 laboratories to prevent possible 
escape or re-emergence of the disease. The Joint Division laboratory at Seibersdorf would be an 
indispensable source of knowledge and expertise in that regard. 
201. Further investments were needed to ensure that: laboratories holding the virus kept it safe or 
destroyed it; generations of veterinarians had the knowledge to recognise rinderpest and act 
accordingly if they encountered an unexpected outbreak; laboratories had the capability to test for 
suspect cases; and governments and industry had contingency plans if rinderpest or other high impact 
livestock diseases threatened livelihoods. The lessons learnt during the rinderpest campaign should 
inform efforts to tackle other livestock diseases, and Member States should maintain their support for 
the Joint Division. 
202. She commended all those countries which had taken action, invested and involved their 
institutions and communities in the eradication programme. FAO, working in partnership, would 
continue to ensure that the success achieved through collective efforts to eradicate rinderpest would 
result in lasting benefit to all.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 (continued) 
(GC(55)/2) 
1. Mr DZHAKSALIYEV (Kazakhstan) said that his country spared no effort to strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime. It had been 20 years since the closure of the Semipalatinsk test site, and the 
United Nations had declared 29 August Â the anniversary of the closure Â the International Day 
against Nuclear Tests. 
2. As a party to the NPT, Kazakhstan was playing an active role in strengthening the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. It had declared its readiness to host the Agency LEU bank, in support of the 
AgencyÂs initiative on assurance of supply of nuclear fuel. The Agency had sent a technical mission to 
Kazakhstan to examine the proposed sites for the LEU bank. 
3. The establishment of international mechanisms for assurance of supply would not infringe upon 
the right of Member States to develop their own nuclear fuel cycle capacities. Any such mechanism 
should not be politicized or discriminatory in nature but should be accessible to all States that were in 
compliance with their safeguards agreements. Any transfer of nuclear material should take place in 
accordance with non-political criteria in an objective and consistent manner. 
4. His country called on all States to work towards the universalization of safeguards agreements 
and the additional protocol, and it called on those countries that had not yet concluded safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols to do so without delay. 
5. Kazakhstan had played a major role in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
Central Asia and it trusted that that example could be of use to other regions of the world. It supported 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and welcomed the Director 
GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum on the issue in November. His country would be pleased to 
share its experience in that field and continued to strive for a peaceful and secure world. 
6. His country had ratified the CTBT and it called upon those States that had not yet done so to do 
likewise without delay, since the TreatyÂs entry into force was essential for the effective functioning of 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
7. Kazakhstan was implementing the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism and encouraged those countries that had not yet done so to accede to that 
Convention. 
8. The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit, in which his country had participated, had reconfirmed the 
desire of the majority of States to strengthen global nuclear security. The principles set out in the 
Summit communiquÃ© were supported by the majority of the Member States of the Agency, and 
Kazakhstan itself was making every effort to implement the SummitÂs work plan. 
9. The transfer of spent fuel from the BN-350 reactor to a long-term storage facility had been 
completed. With the support of the United States Department of Energy, a project was being 
implemented to convert the WWR-K research reactor at the Institute of Nuclear Physics to LEU fuel. 
Technology for the production of radioisotopes using LEU was also being developed. 
10. His country was implementing fully the provisions of United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1540 (2004) and was taking steps to improve further its system for preventing illicit 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 2 
the Zangger Committee, Kazakhstan made every effort to maintain tight control over nuclear exports, 
including facilities and equipment that could be used for uranium enrichment and spent fuel 
reprocessing. 
11. Kazakhstan appreciated the AgencyÂs work to strengthen the nuclear safety regime, since any 
large-scale nuclear accident could have serious transboundary consequences. His country had 
participated in the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in the wake of the Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power plant accident and it supported the AgencyÂs efforts to develop a stricter 
approach to ensuring safety in nuclear power. It welcomed the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
12. As the Agency was the leading global forum in the field of scientific and technical cooperation 
on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, it was important that States support its activities for 
transferring and developing technologies and knowledge related to peaceful nuclear applications, 
including nuclear power and the nuclear fuel cycle. The AgencyÂs efforts relating to human resources 
development in the field of nuclear science and technology were particularly important to Kazakhstan. 
13. He drew attention to his countryÂs work in collaboration with the Agency in the field of nuclear 
medicine, and in assessing contamination at part of the Semipalatinsk test site with a view to its 
economic use. 
14. Kazakhstan intended to develop further its technical cooperation with the Agency. It paid its 
contributions to the AgencyÂs budget regularly and its voluntary contributions to the TCF, and it 
intended to meet its financial obligations in the future in full and without conditions. 
15. His country was a leading producer of uranium ore, had the capacity to produce nuclear fuel and 
intended to expand its involvement in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy within the framework of the 
NPT. The Kazatomprom company was establishing a vertically integrated company with a full nuclear 
fuel cycle. The company was being integrated with a Russian isotope separation enterprise, and it was 
planned that joint conversion and fuel fabrication operations would be undertaken. 
16. In conclusion, his country remained fully committed to the AgencyÂs efforts to expand the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy for the good of humankind, strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and increase levels of nuclear safety worldwide. 
17. Ms ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia), recalling the tragic earthquake and tsunami that had occurred in 
March 2011 in Japan and had led to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, 
expressed her countryÂs deep-felt sympathy and support for the people of Japan and paid tribute to the 
workers at Fukushima and to the Japanese authorities for their courage in handling the crisis. 
18. Despite that tragic event, nuclear energy continued to play an important role in meeting the 
worldÂs energy needs. In Slovakia, over 50 % of electricity was produced by nuclear power plants. 
Safety was a top priority. All Slovak nuclear installations complied fully with international standards 
and were subject to regular safety assessments. 
19. Her country welcomed the convening of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in 
June 2011 following the Fukushima accident, the subsequent adoption of the IAEA Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety, the announcement by Government of Japan of its intention to organize an international 
conference on nuclear safety in 2012 in cooperation with the Agency, and the decision to hold an 
extraordinary meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 2012 to 
review measures to strengthen the provisions and implementation of the Convention. 
20. At the fifth review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 
April 2011, Slovakia had given an overview of its progress since the preceding meeting, including 
measures taken to implement its national action plan. The so-called Âstress testsÂ agreed upon in the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 3 
European Union had been performed successfully in Slovakia and some specific measures had been 
adopted following them. They had confirmed the high safety standards of Slovak nuclear power 
plants. The measures to be implemented would improve plant safety further. In May 2011, the Slovak 
Government had decided to prepare and implement a national emergency exercise simulating an 
accident at a nuclear power plant in Slovakia. 
21. The role of international safety review missions should be strengthened. Slovakia had hosted 
several such missions in the past and would be hosting an IRRS mission in 2012. 
22. While nuclear safety was a national responsibility, the existing framework of international legal 
instruments in that area provided an adequate basis for preserving and enhancing nuclear safety at both 
national and international level. Slovakia encouraged countries developing nuclear power programmes 
to accede to all relevant international instruments, in particular the Convention on Nuclear Safety and 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. 
23. In the nuclear security field, she commended the Agency for its activities aimed at preventing 
and combating nuclear terrorism. The recent NPT Review Conference and Nuclear Security Summit 
had emphasized the key role of the Agency in helping Member States, at their request, to enhance 
nuclear security. The responsibility for nuclear security too rested with individual States and all States 
had the responsibility to establish appropriate systems and take the necessary measures to prevent, 
detect and respond to malicious acts involving nuclear material. 
24. Her country welcomed the DirectorÂs General decision to host a forum in which States from the 
Middle East and other interested parties could learn from the experience of nuclear-weapon-free zones 
established in other regions. The forum could make an important contribution to the planned 
2012 conference on the establishment of a zone in the Middle East free of nuclear weapons and all 
other weapons of mass destruction. 
25. While Slovakia was grateful to the Director General for his efforts to cope with existing 
challenges to the non-proliferation regime, it noted with concern that the AgencyÂs most recent 
verification reports confirmed that those challenges continued to grow. 
26. Her country deeply regretted the fact that, owing to insufficient cooperation by Iran, the Agency 
had been unable to provide credible assurances regarding the absence of undeclared material and 
activities in that country and thus conclude that all its nuclear material was in peaceful activities. Iran 
should respond to outstanding concerns and fulfil its obligations under relevant United Nations 
Security Council resolutions. 
27. Slovakia was also gravely concerned at the lack of any progress on the Syria file. The 
conclusion in the DirectorÂs General report to the Board in June (GOV/2011/30) that the destroyed 
building at the Dair Alzour site had very likely been a nuclear reactor and should have been declared 
by Syria pursuant to its safeguards agreement lent a strong sense of urgency to the overall situation. 
Syria must remedy the situation and cooperate with the Agency to resolve all outstanding issues. 
28. The DPRKÂs nuclear and missile programmes also remained a matter of grave concern. Recent 
information about the construction of a new uranium enrichment facility and a light water reactor in 
the DPRK seriously aggravated the situation. The DPRK must comply with its international 
obligations and abandon its nuclear programme. 
29. Agency safeguards were a key element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and were central 
to implementation of the NPT. Her country continued to view a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
plus an additional protocol as the current Agency verification standard. It actively supported the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 4 
safeguards system by cooperating with Member State safeguards support programmes, and by 
supporting the safeguards resolutions adopted by the General Conference. 
30. Technical cooperation with the Agency remained an important part of SlovakiaÂs international 
cooperation activities. It had been cooperating with the Agency within the framework of national, 
regional and interregional technical cooperation projects. In the 2012Â2013 cycle, national projects 
would focus on nuclear regulation, decommissioning, human health, and nuclear science applications. 
31. The Europe region played a double role in Agency technical cooperation activities: some 
countries provided know-how and financial support, and others were beneficiaries, participating in 
regional and national projects, attending meetings and training events, and receiving expert missions. 
The Europe region had adopted a strategy for the technical cooperation programme in the region in 
February 2010. The planning and design of regional projects had been conducted in a commendably 
transparent and open manner, which contributed to the high quality of projects. 
32. The Agency should step up efforts to develop appropriate partnerships with other United 
Nations organizations and international organizations in order to improve the coherence and efficiency 
of its technical cooperation programme. Intensified cooperation with other organisations could help 
increase the socio-economic impact of technical cooperation initiatives, enhance synergies with other 
programmes and avoid duplication. As in previous years, Slovakia was ready to contribute to those 
efforts by providing experts and training facilities, and it would continue to pursue a general policy of 
accepting fellows and scientific visitors sponsored by the Agency. 
33. Mr SCOTTI (Italy), offering his countryÂs condolences to the people and Government of Japan, 
said that the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had highlighted the need 
for further enhancement of international cooperation on nuclear safety. Safety standards had to be 
improved and effectively implemented at national and international level, which called for a tougher 
international nuclear safety regime and an even stronger role for the Agency. Italy therefore looked 
forward to the adoption during the General Conference of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety 
developed pursuant to the declaration adopted at the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in 
June 2011. Member States should promptly carry out assessments of the capacity of their nuclear 
power plants to resist extreme natural hazards and submit the results to the AgencyÂs peer review 
services. Such Âstress testsÂ had already begun in the European Union and Italy was firmly committed 
to their success and fully supported their implementation through the active participation of its 
national nuclear safety authority. 
34. Achieving a high level of safety and security of radioactive sources also remained an important 
goal, to ensure adequate protection of the population and the environment from any loss of control of 
radioactive sources during their use. His country fully endorsed the Guidance on the Import and 
Export of Radioactive Sources which supplemented the AgencyÂs Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources, and it encouraged Member States to implement both. 
35. Reducing the risk of access to and malicious use of nuclear material by non-State actors had 
become a common goal of the international community. Italy was fully committed to the success of 
the process started at the Washington Nuclear Security Summit and it strongly supported an enhanced 
role for the Agency and its nuclear security programme. It was particularly interested in strengthening 
national capacities through advanced training and the development of a nuclear security culture. In 
view of the positive evaluation of its first course, Italy intended to develop further the International 
School on Nuclear Security organized in Trieste in cooperation with the Agency and the Abdus Salam 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics. 
36. Reinforcing the international safeguards regime remained one of Member StatesÂ shared goals 
and his country strongly supported the AgencyÂs role in verifying, in accordance with comprehensive 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 5 
safeguards agreements, that States were complying fully with their non-proliferation obligations. It 
supported the universal adoption of the additional protocol and urged all those countries which had not 
done so to conclude an additional protocol to their safeguard agreements. 
37. While acknowledging the right to the peaceful use of the nuclear energy granted by the NPT, 
Italy continued to be concerned at the developments in some countries. 
38. The Director GeneralÂs latest report on Iran to the Board of Governors (GOV/2011/54) 
confirmed that that country was neither complying with United Nations Security Council resolutions 
nor providing the necessary cooperation to the Agency. Iran must engage in negotiations in good faith 
in order to establish international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear 
programme. 
39. Mindful of the adoption in June of a resolution by the Board of Governors finding the Syrian 
Arab Republic in non-compliance with its safeguards obligations (GOV/2011/41), Italy called on 
Syria to engage constructively and without further delay with the Agency and to cooperate fully with 
the organizationÂs inspectors on all outstanding issues. 
40. The nuclear programme of the DPRK continued to be a source of great concern. The recent 
contacts in Bali between the delegations of the DPRK and the Republic of Korea were encouraging, 
however, and his country hoped that the six-party talks would resume as soon as possible. 
41. Italy strongly believed that the goals set at the 2010 NPT Review Conference were achievable 
and it continued to support the international communityÂs efforts to convene in 2012 an international 
conference on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass 
destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East. It commended the Director General on his 
support for that process and looked forward to taking part in the related Agency forum planned for the 
autumn in Vienna. 
42. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy continued to be one of the AgencyÂs main goals and his 
country supported its activities related to the development of nuclear applications in the areas of 
human health, food and agriculture, water resources and environmental protection, which helped to 
address global challenges and promote achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. In that 
connection, Italy was greatly interested in the discussions expected to take place during the Scientific 
Forum on the theme of water and water resources development. It encouraged the Secretariat and 
Member States to make the best use of the resources allocated to the IAEA Environment Laboratories 
in Monaco. 
43. Despite the current international financial situation, he confirmed his countryÂs support for the 
TCF and the activities promoted by the Agency under it. In view of the importance of promoting 
higher standards of nuclear safety worldwide, his country hoped that a larger part of the TCF would be 
devoted to activities in that area. Both donor and recipient countries, and the Secretariat needed to 
work harder to ensure that technical cooperation funds were spent as efficiently, effectively and 
transparently as possible. 
44. Italy continued to support training activities, in particular those aimed at developing a stronger 
nuclear culture. In that connection, he drew attention to the activities promoted by the Abdus Salam 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics, which was funded to a large extent by the Italian 
Government. 
45. Welcoming the agreement on the budget for 2012Â2013, he pointed out that, to fulfil its 
important mandate successfully, the Agency needed stable and adequate funding. At the same time, 
the current financial and economic difficulties required strict budgetary discipline throughout the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 6 
United Nations system. Italy therefore called on the Director General and his staff to improve the 
AgencyÂs efficiency, effectiveness and accountability. 
46. Based on the results of a public consultation in June 2011, Italy had decided to discontinue its 
existing nuclear programme and all activities related to the development of new nuclear plants for 
power generation. Its commitment to promoting and upholding nuclear safety, security and safeguards, 
and cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology, remained firm and it would 
continue to support Agency activities in those areas. Its concern for the responsible use of nuclear 
energy, in full compliance with the AgencyÂs international regime, required it to maintain its full 
commitment in the international arena. At national level, it would continue to allocate enough 
resources to maintain adequate competencies and to manage the heritage of its past nuclear 
programme. It was committed to ensuring the highest level of safety in decommissioning and waste 
management activities, and the highest standards of security when dealing with nuclear and 
radiological material. 
47. Bilateral cooperation on nuclear issues, in particular with neighbouring countries in the 
Mediterranean and the western Balkans, would continue. During the General Conference, the 
Albanian National Nuclear Agency and the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy 
and Sustainable Economic Development would be signing a cooperation agreement under which Italy 
would provide technical assistance with the updating of Albanian legislation with a view to the setting 
up of a nuclear energy programme. 
48. Mr VAICIUNAS (Lithuania) said that the events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant 
had demonstrated the transboundary implications of nuclear accidents and the need for the 
international community to take action and be prepared for future threats and challenges, however 
hypothetical. Nuclear safety had therefore become a top priority for the European Union and the 
world. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011 had been a welcome and 
timely initiative. The Agency played a vital role in enhancing nuclear safety and security and its 
efforts must be strengthened and supported by all Member States. 
49. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety constituted an initial step towards strengthening 
nuclear safety worldwide, but its real value depended on the common political will to implement it. 
50. As the Director General had stated in his report on the Ministerial Conference (GC(55)/INF/10), 
safety in the operation of a nuclear power plant was an element of foremost importance for the 
protection of people, society and the environment in all States, including those considering embarking 
on a nuclear power programme as well as those considering extending an existing programme. 
Member States should consider conducting periodic and comprehensive safety reviews of both 
existing and projected plants, giving prior consent to the Agency to perform systematic, regular peer 
reviews of regulatory effectiveness, operational safety, design review, site evaluation and emergency 
preparedness, along with follow-up reviews. Transparency, public information, obligatory 
implementation of Agency safety standards, adherence to safety conventions, and regular requests for 
specialized Agency missions for the whole nuclear fuel cycle, including site safety, should become an 
integral part of any nuclear power programme. 
51. Given that nuclear accidents did not respect national borders, States should develop their 
nuclear energy projects with due consideration for the safety not only of their own population but also 
of other potentially affected countries, by holding consultations and settling transnational disputes 
constructively, ensuring full transparency of projects, and information sharing. It was particularly 
important to pay attention to the safety of new nuclear power plants. In that regard, Lithuania and 
other States in the region were concerned over nuclear power plant projects in the Russian Federation 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 7 
and Belarus which lacked transparency and thus failed to comply with international practice and the 
current focus on improving nuclear safety and security. 
52. Decommissioning activities continued at the Ignalina nuclear power plant, including monitoring 
of the safety of the units following shutdown, unloading of fuel from the second reactor, dismantling 
and decontamination of process equipment, completion of the construction of a buffer storage facility 
for very low-level radioactive waste, design of a near-surface repository for low- and 
intermediate-level radioactive waste, and construction of a new dry spent fuel storage facility and of a 
solid waste management and storage facility. Lithuania was also participating in the initiative to 
establish a European Repository Development Organization to develop a concept for multinational 
geological disposal of spent fuel. The decommissioning of the Ignalina plant represented an 
exceptional financial burden for Lithuania and adequate financial assistance was needed from the 
European Union to ensure safety. His country was doing pioneering work on the management of 
radioactive graphite from the RBMK reactors and would be happy to share its accumulated knowledge 
and experience with other countries. It was expected that all the facilities and infrastructure to support 
decommissioning would be in place by 2016 and that the whole decommissioning process would be 
finished by 2029. 
53. In response to the Fukushima accident, and in view of the spent nuclear fuel located at the 
Ignalina site, Lithuania was participating in the European Union safety review based on 
comprehensive and transparent risk assessment. Stress tests had been performed at the Ignalina plant 
and the final report on the results would be provided to the national nuclear regulator soon. His 
country called on all countries outside the European Union to conduct similar stress tests at existing or 
planned nuclear facilities. Taking into account the recommendations of WANO, a detailed inspection 
of emergency preparedness had been conducted at Ignalina. As a result, a new version of the 
emergency preparedness plan had been produced that included additional corrective measures to meet 
new challenges. 
54. The events at Fukushima had not dissuaded his country from pursuing the new Visaginas 
nuclear power plant project with its regional partners Estonia, Latvia and Poland. Some key milestones 
had been achieved in 2011 in that regard. Following intensive negotiations with nuclear infrastructure 
developers, Hitachi had been selected as the strategic investor. The signing of a concession agreement 
and other project-related agreements was envisaged by the end of the year. Comprehensive efforts had 
been made by his Government to reform nuclear and radiation safety regulatory infrastructure and 
create a more efficient, transparent and streamlined process for construction of the plant. A new law 
on nuclear safety had been adopted and numerous related existing laws and other legal acts had been 
amended. The regulatory environment now conformed to Agency recommendations and international 
best practice. All preparatory work for the nuclear power plant project, including an environmental 
impact assessment, a transport study, a detailed plan of the construction sites and assessments of two 
potential sites, had been completed. He thanked the Agency for organizing an expert mission to 
evaluate the site assessments. Both sites had proved suitable. 
55. Coherent multinational efforts were needed to promote and strengthen the effectiveness of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. An additional protocol and a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
constituted the current verification standard, which needed to be further strengthened, universalized 
and applied as a condition for the supply of nuclear material and technology worldwide. Lithuania 
encouraged all States with operational nuclear power plants, or plans to construct such facilities, to 
bring into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
56. Lithuania paid close attention to physical protection both during decommissioning and at new 
facilities under construction. National experts shared their experience by participating in Agency 
workshops and technical meetings. They were also involved in the preparation of the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 8 
recommendations on the physical protection of nuclear facilities and nuclear and other radioactive 
material, and the guidelines for implementation of those recommendations. 
57. His country assigned priority to continued participation in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme and its involvement would, in future, focus on strengthening nuclear regulatory 
capabilities, nuclear knowledge management, improvement of radioactive waste management, 
reduction of public, occupational and medical exposure, and improving preparedness for radiological 
and nuclear accidents. 
58. Nuclear energy could be climate-friendly and safe if used responsibly in compliance with the 
highest international safety and security standards. The AgencyÂs role in ensuring nuclear safety 
worldwide should be strengthened and the use of its services made more obligatory in nature. All 
States should take concrete actions to improve the global nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation 
regimes and ensure they were universally applied. 
59. Mr CHOREV (Israel) said that, following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident, the safety of 
nuclear power and the future of the nuclear industry had become pressing issues in many countries. 
Public anxiety over the accident had forced governments to confirm their long-term commitment to 
improving nuclear safety. Nuclear accidents respected no borders and the wider implications of the 
Fukushima crisis had led the Director General to convene a high-level conference in June with a view 
to learning lessons from the accident and raising awareness of the need for high standards of nuclear 
safety. His country commended the Director General on his initiative and efforts and supported the 
endorsement of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety by the General Conference. Among other 
things, the action plan emphasized the need for all countries to ensure that their regulatory authorities 
were effective and fully independent, and to strengthen the global emergency preparedness and 
response system. 
60. IsraelÂs two nuclear centres operated in accordance with high safety standards compatible with 
those of the Agency, and under the supervision of the countryÂs independent nuclear licensing and 
safety office. At the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June, Israel had stressed the merit of 
a regional emergency preparedness and response system, proposing a joint study in the Middle East of 
the lessons learned from Fukushima, and the promotion of regional cooperation. His country looked 
forward to a constructive dialogue with neighbouring countries on nuclear safety and security. 
61. At national level, his country had long since put in place all the necessary emergency response 
procedures. Although it considered the probability of leakage or emission of radioactivity from its 
nuclear research centres to be very low, it had a contingency plan for such emergencies. It also 
conducted periodic national preparedness exercises, the most recent having been carried out 
successfully that very month. 
62. Profound changes had taken place in many States in the Middle East and the positive 
implications of the democratization process in the region might help to build trust and confidence. 
IsraelÂs approach and policy in the field of regional security and arms control had always been 
responsible and prudent and was rooted in the belief that the security concerns of all should be 
realistically addressed within the regional context. The prerequisites for turning the Middle East into a 
mutually verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems were a 
comprehensive and lasting regional peace together with full compliance by all States in the region 
with their arms control and non-proliferation obligations. International experience had shown that the 
initiative to establish such a zone could only emanate from within a region through direct negotiations. 
The Middle East was no exception. No majority vote in international forums could replace 
region-wide consent and cooperation. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 9 
63. Guided by its conviction, his country had participated in a European Union seminar to promote 
confidence building in support of a process aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East held in Brussels in July 2011. It had also 
cooperated with the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum to learn from the experience of 
other regions in that regard, in spite of the current disturbing events in the Middle East and IsraelÂs 
reservations over the resolution adopted by the General Conference in 2010 on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East (GC(54)/RES/13). IsraelÂs approach to the planned forum and 
related events could not be separated from the evolving circumstances in the region and the attitude 
manifested towards his country in international forums, including the General Conference. Israel 
therefore hoped that the Arab States would display a similar positive attitude and use the opportunity 
to foster sincere dialogue among States in the region. In that respect, the continued denial of IsraelÂs 
membership in the MESA group by the Arab States was counterproductive, negating any dialogue or 
political accommodation. 
64. Unlike the Fukushima nuclear accident, which had been nature-induced, the negative 
developments in the nuclear domain in the Middle East region were entirely man-made. They were 
reflected in the Director GeneralÂs reports on Iran and Syria, and in the resolutions of the Board of 
Governors and United Nations Security Council. It was hardly surprising that regimes that brutally 
oppressed their own citizens and did not hesitate before bloodshed should have no qualms about 
non-compliance with their legally binding obligations under international law. Al QaddafiÂs Libya, for 
example, had signed the Pelindaba Treaty in 1996 but had continued its clandestine nuclear 
programme until mid-2003. Regrettably, the lesson had not yet been learned and the international 
community had failed to convey a decisive message to such rulers who saw non-compliance as 
low-risk. The international community should prove them wrong and punish violators. 
65. In its May 2011 report on Syria (GOV/2011/30), a nominal party to the NPT, the Agency had 
assessed that it was very likely that the building destroyed at the Dair Alzour site had been a nuclear 
reactor which should have been declared. Yet Syria continued to deny the Agency access to any of its 
nuclear activities and sites. 
66. The Iranian regime persisted in refusing to comply with its international obligations. The 
Agency had stated in its September 2011 report on that country (GOV/2011/54) that it was 
increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran of past or current undisclosed 
nuclear-related activities involving military-related organizations, including activities related to the 
development of a nuclear payload for a missile, about which it continued to receive new information. 
It had added that the information available to it in connection with those issues was extensive and 
comprehensive. Israel had no doubt that Iran was pursuing nuclear weapons behind the facade of its 
NPT membership. Not only was that country continuing its enrichment-related activities in defiance of 
Security Council resolutions, it was also engaging in activities directly related to the design and testing 
of nuclear weapons. In the absence of an effective response by the international community, Iran 
might become the first country to acquire nuclear weapons while a member of the NPT. Carefully 
worded diplomatic phrases only obscured ominous realities and obstructed an effective concerted 
response. 
67. The 2010 Nuclear Security Summit hosted by the United States had recognized the close 
association between the threat of nuclear proliferation and that of nuclear terrorism sponsored and 
supported by rogue States. With the collapse of Al QaddafiÂs regime in Libya, and in the face of the 
volatile situation in Syria, the international community should direct its efforts towards urgent 
counter-proliferation issues in both those countries. 
68. The 2010 General Conference had rejected an Arab-sponsored resolution on Israeli nuclear 
capabilities, sending a clear message to the sponsors that it wished to address constructive issues 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 10 
drawn from the AgencyÂs mission statement. Nevertheless, in June 2011 the Arab States had requested 
inclusion of the same ill-motivated item in the agenda of the General Conference and had recently 
been mobilizing support in the worldÂs capitals. If the Arab States were truly committed to building 
trust and confidence among regional parties, they would not repeatedly impose an anti-Israeli agenda 
item on the General Conference with the aim of diverting attention from their own domestic problems 
and from serial non-compliance by some of them with the NPT and their safeguards agreements. 
Short-term tactics by the Arab States at the 2011 General Conference would not advance genuine 
regional arms control measures. If the Arab States were sincere, they would find in Israel a true 
partner for a positive transformation of the General Conference, but differing viewpoints among 
regional parties could not be resolved by imposing a majority vote in that forum. The Arab States 
should abandon their annual political ritual. 
69. In an era of critical challenges, Israel looked forward to helping the Agency fulfil its mandate 
relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear 
safety and security, while confronting the major threats posed to global and regional peace and 
security by a few rogue States that were grossly violating international norms and obligations, 
challenging the world order and brutally oppressing their citizens. 
70. 2011 had so far been a difficult year for many Member States and their people, who had faced 
natural disasters, negative economic developments and swift and unexpected political changes. The 
international community and its institutions were also affected. It was therefore incumbent upon all 
Member States to support the Agency in fulfilling its mission and to reject efforts by a few to hijack it 
for a narrow political agenda driven by extraneous considerations. 
71. Mr PARVEZ (Pakistan) said that, having been established at about the same time more than 
five decades ago, the Agency and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission could be said to be 
growing together. Cooperation between the two organizations that had been mutually beneficial. 
Today, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was actively engaged in the application of nuclear 
technology for the socio-economic development of the country in such areas as cancer diagnosis and 
treatment, agriculture, food preservation, water management and industry. The most important task, 
however, was harnessing nuclear energy for the generation of electricity. 
72. His country currently faced a severe electricity shortage which was seriously hampering its 
economic growth. Its accessible conventional energy resources were acutely limited and its people, 
whose lives had been affected by frequent and long power outages, looked to the Pakistan Atomic 
Energy Commission to provide relief by building more nuclear power plants and operating the 
countryÂs plants successfully and safely. 
73. PakistanÂs association with nuclear power dated back to a time when nuclear energy had just 
started to be introduced as a viable energy source. Its first commercial nuclear power plant had come 
on line in 1972, was located in Karachi and was still licensed to operate following refurbishments and 
safety retrofits. In addition, Pakistan now had two 325 MW(e) units at its second nuclear power plant 
at the Chashma site, which had been operating safely, and another two units at the same site were 
under construction and due to be commissioned by 2016. All its plants had been built with the 
assistance of China, with an increasing degree of localization under a long-term agreement between 
the two countries. That bilateral cooperation, under Agency safeguards, was a practical manifestation 
of the peaceful application of nuclear energy for the common good. 
74. His country needed international assistance in building and safely operating more nuclear power 
plants to meet its energy needs. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission had already been tasked 
with installing 8800 MW(e) of nuclear power by the year 2030. The restrictions and embargoes that 
had historically impeded the growth of nuclear power in Pakistan had long lost any justification they 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 11 
might have had. His country called for equitable and non-discriminatory policies in the area of nuclear 
power generation and other peaceful applications of nuclear energy. All of its civil nuclear power 
plants had always been under Agency safeguards, and that would continue to be the countryÂs practice 
in the future. 
75. The Fukushima accident, which the Japanese people had faced so bravely, had brought the 
nuclear community closer together. Pakistan supported the AgencyÂs leading role in global efforts to 
analyse and institutionalize the lessons learned from the accident. It acknowledged the AgencyÂs 
timely efforts in that regard, including the holding of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety. 
While Fukushima pointed to the need to be more vigilant and safety-conscious, it must not obstruct the 
future of the nuclear industry and his country was pleased to note that most Member States with a 
nuclear power programme had indicated their commitment to continue with it, albeit more cautiously; 
and several Member States wishing to embark on a new nuclear power programme continued to 
maintain their interest, but with greater emphasis on developing the necessary know-how and 
regulatory infrastructure. 
76. Pakistan had kept abreast of the various studies on the lessons learned from Fukushima and had 
been actively engaged in thoroughly revisiting, in that new perspective, the safety and emergency 
preparedness of its own nuclear power plants, fully recognizing that that had to be a continuing 
process with no room for complacency. Its longstanding focus on developing a strong safety and 
regulatory infrastructure had been strengthened by the establishment in 2001 of an independent 
regulatory and licensing body, the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority, which had grown rapidly in 
the preceding decade to establish itself as a strong and credible oversight body with close links with 
the Agency. 
77. His country attached great importance to nuclear security as a national responsibility. It was 
party to several international regimes related to nuclear safety and security and participated in related 
Agency activities and programmes, including the Nuclear Security Plan. The Agency had the mandate, 
the technical expertise and the broad membership to lead the policy, implementation and assistance 
aspects of the nuclear security agenda. It played an important role in assisting Member States, upon 
request, in strengthening their national nuclear security infrastructure, including in the areas of 
awareness, education and training. Pakistan shared the views expressed in the AgencyÂs Nuclear 
Security Report 2011 (GC(55)/21) concerning duplication and overlap between Agency activities and 
other nuclear security-related initiatives. The Agency must retain the central role in elaborating 
guidelines and guidance documents. Competing or parallel efforts and activities might ultimately 
prove counterproductive. 
78. The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission was currently operating 14 nuclear medicine and 
oncology hospitals across the country, and another four were under construction. That was still not 
enough to meet the needs of his countryÂs population and his Government planned to continue to 
expand capabilities in the public sector. Pakistan produced most of the radiopharmaceuticals it 
required and it had recently installed a facility for the production of molybdenum-99 and was now in a 
position to export it. Its agricultural and biotechnology centres were making a valuable contribution to 
the countryÂs agriculture and livestock sectors. 
79. The Commission had developed a sound infrastructure for addressing problems related to water 
resources management using isotopic techniques. Pakistan was taking part in the AgencyÂs programme 
of intercalibration of standards and was providing expert and analytical services in that field to 
Agency Member States in the region. It had a network of educational and training institutes that 
encompassed all major facets of nuclear science and technology. Besides meeting the needs of 
PakistanÂs own programmes, those institutes were ready to welcome persons from other Member 
States. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 12 
80. His country appreciated the assistance the Agency had provided in terms of expert services, 
equipment and human resources development in helping Pakistan to establish and improve all those 
facilities. That was an area where the Agency was duty-bound to foster growth in other countries as 
well and, with its experience, his country could also make a contribution. 
81. The Agency had an important role to play in assisting Member States in their national efforts to 
promote nuclear security. The AgencyÂs responsibilities in the safeguards and verification field were 
equally important. However, in the post-Fukushima nuclear world, greater emphasis must also be 
placed on nuclear safety. The Agency should help ensure a free flow of safety-related technological 
information and equipment between Member States as an intrinsic part of its focus on nuclear safety. 
At the same time, more resources should be devoted to safety assurance. Striking the right balance 
between its different activities would be a challenge for the organization, but that challenge could be 
met by rationalizing priorities. 
82. It was his countryÂs firm belief that the Agency would continue to maintain its vital role in areas 
relating to safety, security and safeguards, and in providing assistance to Member States on an 
equitable and non-discriminatory basis in line with its mission statement, which explicitly protected 
the right of every State to the development of peaceful applications of nuclear technology, including 
for the generation of electricity. 
83. Pakistan had had very productive technical cooperation with the Agency for more than half a 
century. It had greatly benefited from that cooperation and, for its part, had made a modest 
contribution towards the AgencyÂs activities by sharing its experience and providing expert services in 
the areas of energy planning, water management, nuclear site studies and the development of 
regulatory infrastructure. With its sizeable nuclear power programme, well trained pool of experts and 
decades of experience in the fields of power generation, health, agriculture and industrial applications, 
it hoped to be able to contribute even more effectively in the future. 
84. Mr LE Dinh Tien (Vietnam) said that his country highly appreciated the AgencyÂs remarkable 
achievements over the preceding year in the performance of its mandate, in particular the initiative to 
organize the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety to identify lessons learned from the Fukushima 
accident and propose measures for establishing a realistic and enhanced post-Fukushima nuclear safety 
framework. In that connection, he emphasized the need to implement the joint statement from the 
Conference, and the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety to be adopted at the General Conference. 
85. His country was maintaining its policy of developing nuclear power to meet national energy 
demand. The construction of two nuclear power plants was planned to start in 2014Â2015, with the 
first unit due to be commissioned by 2020. As the nuclear power programme was implemented, 
nuclear powerÂs share of total national electricity production would increase from 1.5% in 2020 to 
6.2% and 7.8% in 2025 and 2030 respectively. 
86. Nuclear safety should remain the responsibility of States, with the Agency playing a leading 
role in shaping a safer nuclear future throughout the world. Vietnam was developing and using nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes in a responsible manner, ensuring the highest level of nuclear safety as 
its top priority. His Government was focusing on investment in developing and improving nuclear 
infrastructures, including the legal and regulatory system, strengthening the capacity of the nuclear 
regulatory body, developing technical support organizations and enhancing international cooperation 
on nuclear safety. 
87. Vietnam attached great importance to effective and efficient cooperation with the Agency in all 
areas related to nuclear energy. In February 2011, it had concluded its CPF for the period 2011Â2015 
under which the Agency would continue to assist the country in seven priority areas through national, 
regional and interregional projects. In particular, in collaboration with relevant Vietnamese agencies, 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 13 
an integrated master plan was to be elaborated for building national infrastructure for nuclear power. 
Cooperation with the Agency had been productive in the area of human resources, improvement of 
national infrastructure for nuclear power, and increased use of radiation applications in many 
socio-economic spheres. Vietnam highly appreciated the AgencyÂs role in assisting Member States in 
the field of nuclear power as well as in non-power applications such as cancer prevention, food, 
agriculture and water resources management. 
88. His country had responsibly fulfilled its obligations and commitments to the Agency while 
supporting and participating in international initiatives and efforts related to the safe, secure and 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and non-proliferation. It supported and participated in the activities of 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism and had worked on the preparations for the second 
Nuclear Security Summit to be held in the Republic of Korea in 2012. It was considering acceding to 
the CPPNM and the amendment thereto. It was cooperating with the Agency, the United States of 
America and the Russian Federation to implement the full core conversion of the Dalat nuclear 
research reactor from HEU to LEU fuel, and with the Agency, the European Union and other countries 
on a number of projects related to nuclear safety and security. 
89. In conclusion, he commended all the staff of the Agency for their dedicated and effective work 
and reaffirmed VietnamÂs full support for the activities of the organization. 
90. Mr BAYER (Turkey) said that electricity demand in his country had increased particularly 
rapidly in the preceding two decades and the country lacked sufficient indigenous energy resources. 
Ensuring secure, sustainable and competitive energy supplies was central to its energy policy. Its 
long-term plans required diversification of its energy sources. Currently, the country was over 
50% dependent on imported fossil fuels. According to projections, it would require an additional 
100 000 MW(e) installed capacity by 2030. Consequently, nuclear power had become one of the most 
feasible options. Thus, Turkey had concluded an agreement with the Russian Federation for the 
construction of four WWER-1200 units at the already licensed Akkuyu nuclear site by 2020. In 
addition, it was planning to construct a nuclear power plant with a total capacity of 5000 MW(e) at the 
Sinop nuclear site and was therefore expected to have an installed nuclear capacity of at least 
10 000 MW(e) within the coming 10-15 years. 
91. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to promote and maintain high levels of nuclear 
safety worldwide and it encouraged the Secretariat to continue to strengthen its efforts related to 
nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, particularly in areas that were vital for Member States. 
The Fukushima accident had drawn the worldÂs attention once again to the significance of nuclear 
safety. The lessons learned from Fukushima must be applied to prevent the recurrence of such an 
incident. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011 had made an important 
contribution to the AgencyÂs efforts to foster a global nuclear safety regime, and the IAEA Action 
Plan on Nuclear Safety should help promote higher nuclear safety standards worldwide. He 
encouraged the Agency to continue its efforts to provide guidance, support and assistance to Member 
States in establishing and maintaining adequate safety regulations and infrastructure, with due regard 
for the needs of Member States considering introducing nuclear power. 
92. The safety of old nuclear power plants in particular needed to be thoroughly reviewed. The 
Metsamor nuclear power plant located in an earthquake zone in Armenia lacked protective structures, 
which remained a concern for Turkey and other countries in the region. All necessary measures must 
be taken to eliminate the risks associated with that plant. Turkey also attached importance to the 
European Union stress test programme for nuclear power plants in which it had volunteered to 
participate. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 14 
93. Promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was one of the main missions of the Agency 
and one of the fundamental objectives of the NPT. The organizationÂs activities in that area 
contributed both to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and to the maintenance of 
international peace and security, for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and non-proliferation were 
complementary. Agency assistance to developing countries in the area of nuclear applications both 
made a direct contribution to human well-being and helped build broad support for the Agency and its 
energy, safety, security, and verification functions. For Member States with no nuclear power reactors, 
i.e. the majority, technical cooperation in applications of nuclear techniques in agriculture, human 
health, industry, environment, hydrology, or biological and physical research was a prime benefit of 
membership in the Agency. 
94. Turkey had always strongly supported the AgencyÂs promotional activities and its technical 
cooperation programme, the funding of which it considered to be the shared responsibility of all 
Member States. The Agency should also continue to be provided with adequate resources through the 
Regular Budget to enable it to conduct its statutory functions properly and effectively. Turkey would 
thus continue to support all reasonable, balanced and affordable budget increases. 
95. The NPT, based on the three mutually reinforcing pillars of non-proliferation, disarmament and 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, constituted a unique and irreplaceable framework 
for maintaining and strengthening international peace, security and stability. Universalization of the 
Treaty, strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system, including universalization of the additional 
protocol, reinforcement of export controls and the early entry into force of the CTBT were important 
for the sustainability of the NPT. Other priorities were the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones 
and reduction of nuclear weapon stockpiles, particularly in the face of the terrorist threat. 
96. Universalization of the additional protocol would strengthen the non-proliferation regime, 
enhance security throughout the world and, most importantly, significantly increase confidence, 
allowing international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy to reach its full potential. 
97. Turkey was concerned that a considerable number of States still had no additional protocol and 
that 15 States had still not brought into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency 
pursuant to their NPT obligations. It called upon those States to sign, ratify and implement 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols without delay. 
98. The NPT did not assign responsibilities only to non-nuclear-weapon States; it also placed 
important obligations (e.g. under Article VI) on nuclear-weapon States. Without a genuine 
commitment to the elimination of nuclear arsenals the objectives of the NPT must fail to be fulfilled 
and determined efforts were required on the part of the nuclear-weapon States. In that connection, his 
country welcomed the recent entry into force of the New START and looked forward to rapid progress 
in implementing it, and to continued negotiations on further reductions in nuclear arsenals, including 
non-strategic nuclear weapons. Also, in his countryÂs view, the Agency should be given a mandate for 
the verification of disarmament activities. Furthermore, the existence of non-NPT States with nuclear 
weapons programmes was dangerously undermining the global safeguards system and the NPT and 
Turkey called on those States to sign the NPT and eliminate totally their nuclear capabilities and 
programmes as soon as possible. 
99. Turkey supported the establishment of zones free from nuclear weapons and other weapons of 
mass destruction wherever feasible, and in particular the establishment of an effectively verifiable 
zone free of such weapons and their means of delivery in the Middle East. It encouraged all efforts 
aimed at developing a common regional understanding to that end, with the participation of all parties 
concerned. It strongly believed that all countries in the region should become party to all international 
arrangements for the prevention of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in particular the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 15 
NPT. Possession of weapons of mass destruction did not provide additional security, but rather further 
increased instability. Moreover, IsraelÂs non-accession to the NPT and its widely acknowledged 
possession of weapons of mass destruction undermined international efforts to foster a regional 
environment conducive to the achievement of lasting peace and security. His country therefore 
welcomed the adoption of the decision in the final document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference to 
convene a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other 
weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. It also welcomed the convening of the related 
Agency forum in November, which should pave the way for the planned conference. 
100. All States that complied with their NPT obligations had the undisputed right to benefit from 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under Article IV of the Treaty. At the same time, all necessary 
steps needed to be taken to ensure that there was no increased risk of proliferation associated with the 
expansion of nuclear energy. The AgencyÂs international safeguards system was an essential part of 
the global nuclear non-proliferation regime and Turkey attached great importance to its effectiveness 
and appreciated the meticulous manner in which the Secretariat approached verification activities 
under its mandate. 
101. The recent meetings between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Agency had provided both 
sides with the opportunity to discuss directly issues related to the implementation of IranÂs safeguards 
agreement. Turkey encouraged further dialogue and cooperation between Iran and the Agency to help 
clarify the outstanding issues with a view to reaching a common understanding and building 
confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of that countryÂs nuclear activities. His country remained 
fully committed to a diplomatic solution to that problem. Only through a gradual process, including 
exploratory talks on a set of parallel actions aimed at overcoming the current impasse, could a 
mutually satisfactory settlement be achieved. As always, Turkey stood ready to contribute to all 
constructive efforts that would ease the way for dialogue and cooperation. 
102. On the issue of the implementation of SyriaÂs safeguards agreement, Turkey trusted that 
continued engagement by and with Syria would help the Agency clarify ambiguities and eventually 
close that file. 
103. His country reiterated its grave concern at the decision by the Government of the DPRK to 
cease all cooperation with the Agency in April 2009, and at other actions of the DPRK, in particular 
the testing of two nuclear explosive devices, the resumption of operations at the reprocessing facility 
in Yongbyon, and the recently discovered uranium enrichment activities. Those acts posed a severe 
threat to international peace and security and undermined the stability of the Korean Peninsula and the 
region. Turkey therefore called on the DPRK to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear 
programmes in a complete and irreversible manner under Agency verification, to act strictly in 
accordance with its international obligations and to return immediately to the six-party talks. 
104. Finally, Turkey fully supported the activities organized by the Agency both during and after the 
General Conference related to water management and the utilization of nuclear science and techniques 
to enhance water resources. 
105. Ms MYKOLAICHUK (Ukraine) said that 26 April 2011 had been the 25th anniversary of the 
Chernobyl accident, which had dispelled any illusions about peaceful nuclear energy being completely 
safe. A quarter of a century later it was obvious that a responsible and holistic approach to the peaceful 
use of the atom was the prerequisite for a safer world in the future. Her countryÂs strategy in 
addressing the after-effects of the accident had focused on fostering the regionÂs long-term 
development and providing people with the support they needed to lead safe and healthy lives. For the 
anniversary, Ukraine had hosted two international events: a summit on safe and innovative use of 
nuclear energy and a scientific conference on nuclear safety for the future. All participants in the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 16 
summit had acknowledged the need to ensure adequate safety levels at every stage of nuclear energy 
production. She thanked the Agency and its Director General for participating in both events, and for 
the untiring support Ukraine had received in its efforts to mitigate the consequences of the accident. 
106. The Chernobyl accident had triggered not only the revision of international nuclear safety 
standards but also the creation of numerous international instruments to ensure both the highest levels 
of nuclear, waste and radiation safety worldwide and the establishment of an adequate emergency 
preparedness and response system. In 2011 those instruments had been put to test in the response to 
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Given its unique capabilities and expertise, the 
Agency had a leading role to play in any nuclear-related accident or emergency and its on-site 
involvement was vital in addressing situations like that at Fukushima. 
107. Based on the lessons learned to date from that accident, Ukraine had conducted targeted safety 
assessments at all its nuclear power units in operation, it had reinforced the independence of its 
national nuclear regulatory authority and, as a top priority, had launched a comprehensive review of its 
national nuclear regulatory framework. Her country had also participated in the European Union stress 
tests and the related peer review process. 
108. While it welcomed the outcome of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in Vienna 
in June 2011, Ukraine had expected the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety to be more ambitious in 
terms of peer review missions and transparency; however, it recognized that the plan represented a 
common denominator of StatesÂ positions. Of particular practical value were the important steps 
envisaged in the plan that might strengthen peer review services and mechanisms in the future. 
109. Although the responsibility for nuclear safety lay with each Member State, the AgencyÂs Safety 
Fundamentals and Safety Requirements should constitute a minimum obligatory basis for States with 
active civil nuclear programmes and operating nuclear power plants and research reactors. The 
existing international treaty framework relating to response to nuclear accidents clearly needed 
improving and the various proposals made by States to improve the Convention on Nuclear Safety and 
other relevant instruments deserved further consideration. 
110. The events in Japan had raised widespread concern about the safety of nuclear power plants 
worldwide and had led to a discussion of the viability of nuclear power. There were clearly many 
lessons still to be learned from the Fukushima accident and her country therefore welcomed the plan 
of the Government of Japan to hold in 2012, in cooperation with the IAEA, an international 
conference on nuclear safety. 
111. Ukraine fully supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at improving nuclear, radiation, transport 
and waste safety worldwide. Each country had the right to decide on its own energy strategy and 
energy mix. The Agency had a key role to play in helping countries ensure that nuclear power was 
used under the most stringent legal, operational, safety, security and non-proliferation conditions. 
International cooperation was crucial to promoting the global nuclear safety regime. Her country was 
strongly committed to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management; being party to those 
instruments was in the best interest of any country that had, or planned to have its own nuclear power 
programme. She called on all Member States, especially any State planning to introduce nuclear 
technologies for the first time, to adhere to those conventions without delay. 
112. She also called on Member States to use the AgencyÂs safety review services, which were an 
indispensable instrument for comprehensively and comparably evaluating facilities and activities. Her 
country had benefited, in particular, from IRRS, design safety, waste safety and OSART missions at 
all its nuclear power plants over the preceding three years. She encouraged countries with both mature 
and emerging nuclear power programmes to follow UkraineÂs example. Moreover, her country had 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 17 
taken a close interest in the ongoing discussions on the feasibility of developing appropriate links 
between the IAEAÂs Safety Standards Series and Nuclear Security Series, as both areas were closely 
interlinked and mutually reinforcing. 
113. Turning to nuclear security, she commended the Agency on its activities aimed at helping States 
prevent and combat nuclear terrorism, emphasizing the important role of the Agency in fostering 
international cooperation in nuclear security, establishing a comprehensive set of guidelines, and 
assisting Member States, on their request, to enhance nuclear security. The responsibility for nuclear 
security lay with each individual State, but all States were responsible for establishing appropriate 
systems and taking the necessary measures to prevent, detect and respond to malicious acts involving 
nuclear material. 
114. In 2010, Ukraine had announced its decision to get rid of all HEU stocks by the next Nuclear 
Security Summit, its partners providing the necessary technical and financial assistance to support that 
effort. The preparations for transporting the last designated HEU stocks from Ukrainian research 
reactors had already begun. UkraineÂs voluntary step sent a clear message that Ukraine took 
non-proliferation seriously. 
115. Her country noted with concern that, six years after the amendment to the CPPNM had been 
adopted by consensus, only 49 of the 145 parties to the Convention had adhered to it. Adherence to the 
international legal instruments related to nuclear security was increasing, but at a slow pace. Ukraine 
called on all States that had not yet done so to adhere to the CPPNM amendment as soon as possible, 
and to act in accordance with the object and purpose of the amendment pending its entry into force. 
116. With regard to nuclear security competence development, she announced the graduation of 
another 14 nuclear security engineers from the Sevastopol National University of Nuclear Energy and 
Industry, commending the Agency for its invaluable support for the development of training and 
education facilities for nuclear security at the University, the AgencyÂs earliest partner in nuclear 
security education. She confirmed her countryÂs readiness to contribute to the AgencyÂs nuclear 
security education programmes. 
117. Her country also appreciated the considerable activities of the Agency related to strengthening 
of nuclear security measures at major public events, in particular the support that was being provided 
to Poland and Ukraine in preparation for the 2012 European football championship. 
118. Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs role in verifying StatesÂ compliance with their safeguards 
obligations under the NPT. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was a fundamental component of the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime, and a comprehensive safeguards agreement together with an 
additional protocol constituted the current highest verification standard. Universal adherence to both 
instruments would strengthen the non-proliferation regime and contribute to global security. The 
Âsafeguards by designÂ concept was an important step for addressing future verification challenges and 
Ukraine welcomed the move towards integrated safeguards and, in particular, the emphasis on an 
information-driven safeguards system, in the interests of strengthening the effectiveness and 
improving the efficiency of the safeguards system. 
119. Her country had had a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in force 
since January 2006. The Safeguards Implementation Report for 2010 had acknowledged its efforts 
regarding safeguards implementation and that year, for the first time, the broad safeguards conclusions 
had been drawn with respect to its compliance with its obligations. Ukraine appreciated the efforts of 
the AgencyÂs inspectors involved in safeguards activities in the country, in particular with respect to 
the resolution of problems and complications related to the Chernobyl site. At the latest meeting of the 
Ukraine-IAEA high-level safeguards implementation review group in Kiev, discussions had begun on 
the introduction of a State-level integrated safeguards approach for Ukraine and her country would 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 18 
continue to work with the Agency to establish the necessary conditions for the application of 
integrated safeguards. 
120. Over the preceding year, the Agency had continued to make a significant contribution to global 
development objectives in accordance with its Statute. The 2011 Scientific Forum on water scarcity 
was another major step towards establishing a clear vision of how radiation technologies could serve 
human health goals without posing unnecessary risks. She commended the Agency and the Director 
General for their tireless efforts in those spheres and called upon the Agency to increase further the 
contribution of nuclear technology to health and economic development, and to promote dissemination 
of knowledge on peaceful applications of nuclear technologies among States. 
121. Ukraine was convinced of the benefits of multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. The 
LEU reserve established in the Russian Federation for the Agency had successfully begun to function. 
Her country participated in the work of the International Uranium Enrichment Centre in Angarsk, the 
first such joint enterprise, which could serve as an example for future activities in the field. The 
practical aspects of the functioning of the LEU bank now needed to be worked out. 
122. Ukraine had always been committed to effective multilateral action against the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. At the 2010 NPT Review Conference, agreement had been secured on 
further steps to implement the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference resolution on the Middle 
East, including the convening of a conference in 2012. It was important for the General Conference to 
build on the results of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and avoid anything that might undermine the 
success achieved. 
123. Ms RADENKOVIC (Serbia) expressed her countryÂs sympathy and support for the people of 
Japan following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. Serbia understood the concerns and 
anxiety of the international community regarding the safety aspects of the use of nuclear power and 
the need to improve nuclear safety standards. The Agency had played a leading role in drafting the 
IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety and in acting upon lessons learned after the accident in Japan 
with the aim of strengthening nuclear safety, emergency preparedness, radiation protection of people 
and the environment, and the relevant international legal frameworks. Strengthening the global nuclear 
safety regime and promoting international cooperation and expertise were essential to support the safe 
and secure use of nuclear technologies. 
124. Strongly committed as it was to integrating itself into the European Union, her country was 
making great efforts to meet all its obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, 
with particular emphasis on nuclear safety and safeguards. 
125. Serbia had made considerable efforts to develop a legislative and regulatory framework, with a 
view to achieving full compatibility with Agency and European Commission recommendations and 
standards in the field of nuclear safety and security. Its independent regulatory body, the Serbian 
Radiation and Nuclear Safety Agency, had become operational at the end of 2010. In addition to 
developing and introducing a new set of national regulations, efforts had been made to strengthen the 
international legal framework, primarily by incorporating provisions of enacted conventions into 
national legislation and complying with provisions of instruments to which Serbia was not yet a party. 
126. Her country remained firmly committed to the peaceful application of nuclear energy. A 
strengthened safeguards system and the application of the additional protocol would help the NPT 
regime to overcome the challenges it currently faced. 
127. The establishment of a regulatory body in Serbia would expedite ratification of the additional 
protocol and accession to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 19 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which should further 
strengthen national safety mechanisms and instruments. 
128. With assistance from the Agency and a number of international partners and governments, her 
country had successfully completed the repatriation of its spent nuclear fuel to the Russian Federation 
in December 2010. She thanked all stakeholders for their contributions. 
129. Serbia fully supported efforts to combat nuclear terrorism. With a view to preventing misuse of 
nuclear and other radioactive material, and related knowledge and technologies, her country was 
improving physical protection of nuclear and radioactive material and its capabilities to combat illicit 
trafficking. Efforts were also being made to strengthen the national emergency preparedness and 
response system, in cooperation with relevant national and international organizations and regulatory 
authorities. 
130. Her countryÂs efforts in the area of capacity building and infrastructure development in the field 
of radiation protection and nuclear safety were recognized by the Agency and supported through 
several national and international projects. 
131. Finally, she noted that Serbia would continue to meet its financial and other obligations 
vis-Ã -vis the Agency. 
132. Mr KRALEV (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said that the role of the Agency 
was of crucial importance in a world in which the threat of nuclear terrorism was a reality. His country 
was aware that the primary responsibility for nuclear security lay with Member States and had 
therefore acceded to the instruments aimed at strengthening non-proliferation, nuclear verification and 
export control, submitting the relevant reports in compliance with its obligations. 
133. In view of his countryÂs ambition to join the European Union it had, over the preceding decade, 
developed and implemented a wide range of measures to strengthen its nuclear regulatory framework 
and infrastructure. Effective instruments had been put in place to protect its border against illicit 
trafficking in radioactive and nuclear material. It would continue to build capacity with a view to 
achieving further improvements in the physical protection of nuclear applications, border control 
management and its regulatory infrastructure. 
134. With assistance from the Agency, its independent Radiation Safety Directorate had made further 
progress in building national capacities for effective radiation protection and nuclear safety. A 
significant number of young experts had been trained, and national legislation in the area of nuclear 
safety and radiation protection had been further harmonized with European Union legislation. A 
national plan establishing an emergency preparedness and response system to deal with a radiological 
emergency had also been adopted and implemented. 
135. Expressing appreciation for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, he said that the 
envisioned CPF for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would be implemented via national 
and regional projects addressing the countryÂs priority development needs. The projects selected for 
the 2012Â2013 cycle were in full compliance with the new CPF for 2011Â2015 that would be signed 
in October and they focused on building capacities in human health, food safety and cultural heritage 
protection. He thanked the Department of Technical Cooperation for its assistance in that regard. 
136. The application of nuclear technologies in the field of medicine was extremely important for 
improving health services. Despite difficult economic conditions, his Government was committed to 
proceeding with the ongoing project on the establishment of a PET centre. Further support from the 
Agency would be required for the successful implementation of that project. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 20 
137. Demand in the European region for Agency activities in the area of agriculture and food safety 
was growing. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia had been among the first countries in the 
region to initiate and implement projects on crop breeding and good agricultural practices, including 
quality and food safety, in accordance with its national agricultural and rural development strategy. 
138. Thanks to successful cooperation with the Agency, some institutions in his country had become 
centres of excellence and training centres used by the Agency. His country was pleased to accept 
experts from the region in training programmes at its institutions. 
139. Despite its limited economic resources, his Government had always met its financial obligations 
to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget. It also provided significant extrabudgetary contributions for the TCF 
to facilitate implementation of the technical cooperation programme. 
140. Mr LABBÃ VILLA (Chile) underlined the importance of the AgencyÂs role in the field of 
technical cooperation, nuclear verification and non-proliferation. 
141. Promoting and facilitating research, development and the practical application of atomic energy 
was one of the AgencyÂs central functions, carried out through the Department of Technical 
Cooperation and specific projects implemented with Member States. The Agency needed resources to 
carry out those statutory functions and Chile was pleased to note the improved rate of attainment over 
the preceding year. 
142. His country also supported the Peaceful Uses Initiative, which aimed to reinforce the AgencyÂs 
work in such areas as human health, food security, nuclear energy infrastructure and water resources 
management. 
143. In Chile, technical cooperation with the Agency during the 2009Â2011 cycle had focused on 
upgrading the radioisotope production laboratory, studying the nuclear energy option, contributing to 
public health monitoring through the development and application of new methodologies for 
determining arsenic and lead, and evaluating water sources in arid areas. The current programme 
included projects on the use of nuclear techniques in mining and health, in line with Ministry of Health 
programmes and policies. 
144. Chile appreciated the AgencyÂs support in the area of nuclear security. Through regional 
projects, the Agency was working to strengthen the capacities of Member States in the areas of 
prevention and detection of, and response to incidents involving nuclear and other radioactive 
material. Human resources training was of fundamental importance in that regard. During a visit to 
Chile by the Director General from 30 June to 2 July 2011, technical cooperation issues had been 
discussed as well as the AgencyÂs support for national nuclear security programmes. The Director 
General had also attended an international workshop on nuclear security culture organized by the 
Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission. 
145. With regard to the international legal framework, the slow progress as regards adherence to 
international nuclear security instruments was regrettable. While 145 States were party to the CPPNM, 
it was a matter of concern that the number of States that had ratified the 2005 amendment to that 
Convention was far below the two thirds required for its entry into force. Chile appealed to Latin 
American countries in particular to adhere to the amendment. 
146. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011 had marked the launch of a 
process whose next stage had been the approval of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety by the 
Board of Governors. As the outcome of a process in which views had diverged, the plan could not 
please everyone and Chile would have preferred it to be more ambitious, harnessing the momentum 
provided by the Conference. Nevertheless, his country fully supported the implementation of the plan 
and would contribute as far as it was able. It was vital to demonstrate that the Agency truly had the 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 21 
will to strengthen nuclear safety activities, and it was incumbent on Member States to bring the plan to 
life. 
147. The Fukushima accident had shown that more needed to be done to ensure that international 
emergency preparedness and response mechanisms were rapid and effective. The international 
framework was not everything: Agency support for national mechanisms and capacities was of 
particular value. Chile also welcomed the efforts to explore mechanisms for strengthening 
implementation of the relevant international agreements. 
148. There was a need to improve the transparency and effectiveness of communication with the 
public and civil society in the event of nuclear emergencies, as public confidence could only be 
regained and maintained through the provision of objective, reliable, comprehensible and timely 
information. 
149. Chile supported general and complete disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction. It was party to all relevant international instruments, which it wished to see 
universally applied. It had ratified the CTBT, the entry into force of which was of vital importance, 
and it urged all States that had not yet ratified that Treaty Â particularly Annex 2 countries Â to do 
so. 
150. As a member of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a densely populated area, his 
country supported the establishment of such zones in other parts of the world, notably the Middle East. 
Consequently it welcomed the convening of a forum in November 2011 on that issue, which should 
contribute to the success of the conference on that subject planned in 2012. 
151. Article III of the NPT entrusted the Agency with a vital verification role. The additional 
protocol allowed the Agency to provide assurances regarding the non-existence of undeclared nuclear 
activities in a country. Though it was a voluntary instrument, its provisions helped strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime and universal adherence to it would allow for substantial improvements in 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. In that connection, Chile 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs announcement that 110 States had now concluded additional 
protocols. The Safeguards Implementation Report painted an encouraging picture of how States were 
meeting their commitments, but some areas of concern remained. 
152. Though his country took note of the recent dialogue, the lack of progress in efforts to 
denuclearize the Korean Peninsula was regrettable. Chile deplored the fact that the DPRK was not 
granting the Agency access to its nuclear facilities, thereby preventing the Director General from 
reporting adequately on that countryÂs activities. It hoped that the DPRK would return to the 
negotiating table and rejoin the NPT. It would once again be sponsoring the draft resolution on that 
issue submitted to the General Conference. 
153. His country had also consistently supported the AgencyÂs verification work in the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and it acknowledged that countryÂs collaboration in safeguards matters. Nevertheless, 
there was still a lack of confidence that there was no military dimension to IranÂs nuclear programme, 
and Iran should cooperate fully with the Agency to dispel the international communityÂs doubts. Iran 
must meet its international obligations if it wished to take its place in the community of nations. 
154. All organizations, including the Agency, needed to have sufficient flexibility and resources to 
meet new challenges. The Agency was contributing to achieving the Millennium Development Goals 
through its work in the areas of health, agriculture and energy, and to peace and non-proliferation 
through its verification activities. It was in the interests of all countries for the Agency to be strong, 
with the human and other resources it needed to carry out its mandate. Chile would continue to support 
the AgencyÂs work in all areas.

155. Mr BUCHEERI (Bahrain) expressed deep regret at the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power 
plant in Japan caused by the earthquake and tsunami. That event had demonstrated the need to boost 
the AgencyÂs regulatory role, especially in the area of nuclear safeguards and in promoting the nuclear 
safety regime. 
156. Since joining the Agency in 2009, the Kingdom of Bahrain had taken steps to build its national 
capacity to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in order to promote sustainable socio-economic 
development. His country was also committed to complying fully with its international obligations 
vis-Ã -vis the Agency, and to the goals of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament which would 
guarantee a safe environment for future generations free from the threat of nuclear weapons and 
radiation leaks. 
157. Bahrain had developed its relationship with the Agency, acceding to three multilateral treaties in 
a single year. It had acceded to the CPPNM on 10 May 2010, to the Convention on Nuclear Safety on 
11 November 2010 and to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident on 5 May 2011. 
Last but not least, it had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
158. His country commended the AgencyÂs role in assisting Member States to obtain access to 
nuclear energy, and in restricting the use of nuclear energy to peaceful purposes. Nuclear technology 
was a vital asset in certain medical, industrial and scientific fields and his country was studying the 
possibility of exploiting its potential as a clean and easy-to-use option in a variety of sectors. It looked 
forward to increased cooperation with the Agency under the technical cooperation programme with a 
view to acquiring the requisite expertise, as well as appropriate nuclear technology, to be used in 
implementing its future development plans and programmes. 
159. Bahrain participated in the joint programme of the Gulf Cooperation Council to promote 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The member States of the Council attached importance to 
diversification of sources of energy and hoped to use nuclear energy as an alternative to oil and gas in 
areas such as electricity generation and seawater desalination in order to reduce the harmful impact of 
the latter on the environment. 
160. His country had consistently emphasized in regional and international forums the importance of 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and the need to establish a zone free of all weapons of mass 
destruction in the Middle East. States must take resolute action to ensure the success of the conference 
to be held in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in the region. In that connection, it was essential to urge some States in the region that had 
not yet done so to accede to the NPT and to cooperate more closely with the Agency, placing their 
nuclear reactors and installations under Agency safeguards to ensure that they were used exclusively 
for peaceful purposes. 
161. IsraelÂs insistence on preserving its nuclear capabilities was a source of concern to all States in 
the Middle East and a prime cause of instability, since it posed both a military and an environmental 
threat and encouraged an arms race in the region. IsraelÂs accession to the NPT and the placement of 
its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards was recognized as a vital and strategic necessity by 
all States in the region, the Agency and the rest of the world. It was also a prerequisite for the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and hence for regional and 
international peace and security. 
162. Bahrain continued to hope for full and transparent cooperation between the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the Agency in accordance with relevant international resolutions. 
163. As a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and 
NAM, Bahrain was deeply committed to the objective of achieving peace and stability in the region 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 23 
through its support for the efforts of the Agency. It called on all regional and international parties to 
comply with their obligations under the United Nations Charter, and with the resolutions of the 
Agency and the United Nations Security Council. 
164. Weapons of mass destruction were the greatest threat facing the modern world. The Kingdom of 
Bahrain urged all countries to join forces in halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. It also 
advocated close international cooperation under the auspices of the Agency in promoting peaceful 
uses of nuclear technology, and emphasized the importance of the AgencyÂs role in implementing the 
safeguards regime and guaranteeing nuclear safety. 
Ms Dengo Benavides (Costa Rica) took the Chair. 
165. Mr SYCHOV (Belarus) offered his countryÂs condolences and support to the people of Japan 
people in connection with the national disaster which had claimed thousands of lives and caused a 
major accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Twenty-five years after the Chernobyl accident, 
the international community was once again confronted with the devastating consequences of an 
accident at a nuclear power plant. The events at Fukushima prompted an analysis of the possibility of 
safe use of peaceful nuclear energy and an assessment of the relative advantages and risks of nuclear 
power. The Republic of Belarus, like many other countries exercising their inalienable right to use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, was convinced that the sad experience of nuclear accidents 
should not become a reason to say no to the development of nuclear power. The advantages of nuclear 
power as an economical and environmentally attractive way of meeting the growing demand for 
electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to energy security were obvious. 
166. Though nuclear safety was primarily the responsibility of individual States, the problem the 
world was currently facing required effective international cooperation, in which the Agency should 
play a central coordinating role since it had the necessary competence, expertise and authority. His 
country supported the efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to mobilize and coordinate 
efforts to strengthen the international nuclear safety regime. It appreciated the AgencyÂs response to 
the Fukushima accident, the convening of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety and the 
declaration it had adopted, and the development of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety which 
would provide important guidance for joint efforts at national level. 
167. Belarus noted the importance of universalizing and further improving international legal 
instruments in the nuclear field, especially the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Convention on 
Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident. It supported the Russian FederationÂs proposal for 
amendments to those instruments to reflect lessons learned from the Fukushima accident. Due 
attention should be given to improving the AgencyÂs safety standards and implementing them 
effectively at national level, including with Agency assistance. His country also welcomed the steps 
taken by the Russian Federation and the European Union to conduct comprehensive risk and safety 
assessments at nuclear power plants. Belarus had associated itself with the declaration adopted at the 
June 2011 Brussels summit on the participation of neighbouring countries of the European Union in 
the programme of stress tests, and it would be making use of the conclusions drawn and lessons 
learned from that exercise to ensure a high level of safety at BelarusÂs first nuclear power plant. 
168. In 2008, Belarus had taken the decision to launch a nuclear power programme. Preparations for 
the construction of a nuclear power plant were being made in close collaboration with the Agency. 
Belarus had hosted a number of Agency expert missions, inter alia on site selection evaluation, 
assistance in creating a training system for nuclear power sector staff, and infrastructure assessment. It 
had joined INPRO to build collaboration with the Agency and exchange information and experience 
relating to innovative nuclear technologies. It was also creating the necessary infrastructure, 
establishing a legal and regulatory basis and training staff for its nuclear power programme in a 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 24 
consistent, transparent manner in full compliance with its international obligations, and making 
extensive use of the AgencyÂs expertise and that of States with extensive experience in the nuclear 
field. 
169. In that connection, he noted the conclusions reached by the Agency mission in October 2010 to 
assess the countryÂs nuclear emergency preparedness and response system. The mission had 
acknowledged the establishment of a reliable emergency preparedness and response system in Belarus, 
and its recommendations would be incorporated in the countryÂs programme. 
170. Having borne the brunt of the Chernobyl accident, Belarus saw nuclear safety not as an 
abstraction but as an absolute priority, which was reflected in its national legislation and applied in 
practice. 
171. He thanked the Agency for its systematic and effective assistance in strengthening the capacities 
of the countryÂs regulatory body. Agency seminars and training events contributed substantially to the 
development of human resources and improving the qualifications of national specialists responsible 
for nuclear and radiation safety. The national seminars Â conducted with Agency assistance Â on 
implementing the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and on the financial risks 
associated with nuclear power plant construction were an important contribution to the work being 
done in Belarus. 
172. Implementing a project as large as a national nuclear power programme was impossible without 
assistance from the Agency, the leading international organization in the nuclear field. Its advisory and 
technical assistance was vital to establishing the necessary infrastructure, building a reliable nuclear 
safety regulatory system and developing scientific, technical and human resources. The AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme was a key tool for achieving those goals. The main priorities of his 
countryÂs CPF for 2008Â2013 were development of nuclear power infrastructure, use of nuclear 
technologies in health care, and restoration of areas impacted by the Chernobyl accident. 
173. The national project on developing human resources and a training system for the countryÂs 
nuclear power programme had been a success. As the Technical Cooperation Report for 
2010 (GC(55)/INF/2) noted, a major accomplishment in 2010 had been the development and supply of 
a computer-based training system on the basics of nuclear power plant policies, management and 
technology. Further assistance had been provided in human resources development, workforce 
planning, and in the development of a strategy for sustaining human resources for the nuclear power 
programme. 
174. Belarus intended to continue its cooperation with the Agency on restoring the areas impacted by 
the Chernobyl accident. Such collaboration fell squarely within the scope of the United Nations 
Chernobyl strategy, which envisaged a transition to sustainable socio-economic development of the 
affected areas. His country expected the Agency to play an active part in implementing the United 
Nations action plan on Chernobyl and it hoped that the resolution on technical cooperation adopted at 
the current General Conference would include a reference to the resolution on Chernobyl adopted at 
the 65th session of the General Assembly (A/RES/65/131), in which the contribution of the Agency 
was noted. He thanked the Secretariat for posting on the AgencyÂs website in the spring of 2011 a set 
of video materials and photographs depicting the true situation in the regions impacted by the 
Chernobyl accident, and the GovernmentÂs efforts for their restoration and sustainable development. 
175. His country had consistently supported the expansion and enhanced effectiveness of the 
technical cooperation programme. It paid its voluntary contributions to the TCF on time and in full 
and was pledging its full contribution to the Fund in 2012. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 25 
176. The Republic of Belarus assigned high priority to addressing practical aspects of nuclear 
security and physical protection of nuclear material. He noted the fruitful cooperation between the 
AgencyÂs Secretariat and Belarus on issues related to strengthening of nuclear security. With 
assistance from the Office of Nuclear Security, an INSSP had been developed for Belarus and agreed. 
That document not only defined a strategy for collaboration on that issue, but also provided a basis for 
joint efforts with other international organizations and donor countries. Belarus saw those activities as 
an important contribution it made to strengthening nuclear security both domestically and at regional 
level. The national seminar on design basis threat held in February 2011 in Minsk was an example of 
such successful collaboration. It had given specialists from the country an opportunity to acquaint 
themselves with best foreign practices and acquire practical skill in applying design basis threat 
modelling methods. 
177. As a convinced and consistent supporter of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, Belarus 
unswervingly fulfilled, and intended to continue fulfilling, its obligations under the NPT and its 
safeguards agreement. It attached great importance to strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system, 
including the additional protocol as the verification standard. In that connection, he noted the effective 
collaboration between Belarus and the Agency Secretariat, and the holding of a national seminar in 
December 2010 in Minsk on issues related to implementation of the additional protocol, which had 
been an important milestone in the preparations for BelarusÂs ratification of that instrument. 
178. The Agency was facing the challenge of restoring confidence in nuclear power, which would 
doubtless require moving to a qualitatively new level in the nuclear safety field. That goal could only 
be achieved through cooperation between the Agency Secretariat, Member States and other 
organizations and partners, effective coordination of efforts, and transparency. Any attempt to exploit 
the current situation for narrow, short-term gain would only delay success in meeting that challenge. 
179. Mr RECKER (Belgium) said that his country remained convinced of the AgencyÂs crucial role 
in enlarging the contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health and prosperity and in ensuring, in 
conformity with its Statute, that nuclear material and technologies were not diverted to non-peaceful 
purposes. The Agency also played an essential role in encouraging and assisting States to apply the 
most rigorous nuclear safety and security standards, and in preventing terrorism. 
180. He expressed his countryÂs deep condolences and sympathy to the Government and people of 
Japan for the tragic loss of life caused by the earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. Belgium 
welcomed the declaration adopted by the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June, and 
saw the recommendations contained in the IAEA Draft Action Plan on Nuclear Safety as a step in the 
right direction. The task was to translate those recommendations into concrete action. Belgium called 
on all Member States to demonstrate unwavering commitment to promoting the implementation of all 
aspects of the action plan. 
181. Belgium reaffirmed its commitment to promoting nuclear safety criteria based on the most 
exacting international safety standards, and it would continue to make every possible effort to ensure 
high safety levels in its own nuclear facilities. It was in favour of systematic and, ideally, mandatory 
peer review missions to ensure the progressive implementation of safety standards at all levels. 
Strengthening of peer reviews among operators was also essential. 
182. His country was actively preparing to receive an IRRS mission and was also fully involved in 
the safety review process for nuclear power plants following the Fukushima accident. In the interests 
of transparency, the stress tests would be peer reviewed. 
183. His country advocated the strengthening of existing mechanisms such as the Response and 
Assistance Network, which should have wider access to accident-related data as well as the capacity to 
interpret the results. As regards the review of international nuclear safety conventions, there was a risk 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 26 
that negotiations could be lengthy and that must not be allowed to impede concrete effective action in 
the near future. 
184. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation regime and Belgium 
was committed to contributing to the full implementation of the commitments contained in the 
2010 NPT Review Conference action plan. The Conference had taken a positive decision regarding 
implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and, in that connection, Belgium welcomed 
the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum on experience in the establishment of 
nuclear-weapon-free zones. His country had participated actively in the seminar organized by the 
European Union in July 2010 that had provided a welcome opportunity for a constructive exchange of 
views on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery 
in the Middle East. 
185. A credible and effective safeguards and verification system was essential for countries to have 
confidence in the use of nuclear energy for exclusively peaceful purposes. The international 
community had everything to gain from the effective functioning of the system and full compliance 
with the commitments entered into, and everything to lose if corrective action were not taken in cases 
of non-compliance. Belgium therefore deplored the fact that some countries were breaching their 
international commitments and called upon the DPRK and Iran to comply fully with the relevant 
resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and the Board of Governors. No global solution 
could be found that would allow a resumption of constructive and forward-looking relations with those 
countries without complete transparency to dispel any doubts regarding the exclusively peaceful 
nature of their nuclear programmes. Belgium also called upon Syria to cooperate fully and 
transparently with the Agency. 
186. His country considered a safeguards agreement together with an additional protocol to be the 
current verification standard and it called on all States that had not yet done so to sign, ratify and 
implement those instruments. Integrated safeguards had been applied in Belgium since the end of 
2009 and routine inspections at nuclear power plants had been reduced dramatically as a result. 
187. The Agency played a crucial role in the international communityÂs efforts to combat 
proliferation and Belgium welcomed its tireless efforts to improve the effectiveness of its safeguards 
system. The unique character and high quality of the AgencyÂs safeguards system were due not only to 
its analytical and evaluation capabilities, but also to the diversity of the means at its disposal to verify 
compliance with non-proliferation obligations. All of those means were essential to the 
accomplishment of the AgencyÂs mandate under its Statute and the NPT, and privileging one over 
another could only weaken the safeguards system and undermine its credibility. 
188. Turning to nuclear security, he said that a law forming the basis of new legislation on physical 
protection of nuclear material and facilities in his country had been adopted by the Belgian parliament 
on 31 March 2011. Under it, operators were required to ensure the reliability of their associates and, in 
that connection, national regulations on security clearances had been adapted to take account of the 
situation in the nuclear sector. 
189. Work was continuing on the development of regulations on security of sources and other 
radioactive material that would cover all radioactive material with the exception of nuclear material, 
which was subject to special regulations, and would be based on a sectoral approach. Priority was 
being given to the security of radioactive waste and of final disposal sites. A project on the 
establishment of a final disposal site for low- and intermediate- level waste, focusing on site safety and 
security, was currently being developed. 
190. Belgium supported the early entry into force of the amendment to the CPPNM. Its law 
accepting that amendment had been promulgated and, pursuant to Article 102 of the Euratom Treaty, 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 27 
Belgium would deposit its instruments of ratification with the Director General together with the 
European Commission. 
191. The actions taken by Belgium were consistent with the international approach of the Nuclear 
Security Summit. Belgium would continue to contribute actively to the implementation of the 
SummitÂs action plan and it looked forward to the next such summit to be held in Seoul in 
March 2012. 
192. The Fukushima accident had highlighted the need for more passive nuclear safety systems and 
the development of 4th-generation nuclear energy systems. Belgium attached great importance to its 
MYRRHA (multi-purpose hybrid research reactor for high-tech applications) project and, in 2010, his 
Government had decided to fund 40% of the total cost of the project, estimated at Â960 million. It had 
allocated Â60 million for the period 2010Â2014 to advance the project to the front-end engineering 
design stage, which would involve: establishing an R&D programme to minimize the technological 
risks and finalizing the advanced project design; paving the way for the licensing process and 
providing the necessary reports; and establishing an appropriate project management structure and 
consolidating the international consortium in order to secure funding for implementation of the project 
which would start in 2015. 
193. The LEU fuel bank was only an emergency solution in the event of a supply disruption due to 
exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the fuel bank must not distort the functioning of the 
international market. 
194. A structural solution must be found to prevent long-term difficulties in the supply of medical 
isotopes. His country was concerned about the availability of medical isotopes and had increased the 
production capacity of the BR2 reactor at Mol and the Institute for Radioisotopes at Fleurus. Meetings 
of interested parties were regularly organized at European level and several members of the 
OECD/NEA, as well as non-members, had approved a policy approach involving full cost recovery by 
all participants in the supply chain, the creation of a reserve capacity funded by all participants in the 
supply chain, and the establishment of an environment conducive to investment in infrastructure and 
of a regulatory framework for effective market operation. Belgium hoped that that approach would be 
accepted by all and called upon the Agency to promote its application. 
195. HEU was used in Belgium for the production of medical radioisotopes. However, his country 
was aware of the proliferation risks associated with the use of HEU and supported the conversion from 
HEU to LEU provided that it was technically and economically feasible. It had already taken bilateral 
steps to convert the BR2 research reactor at Mol and was considering conversion options at the 
Institute for Radioisotopes. However, it wished to remain flexible, in particular concerning the time 
frame for conversion. 
196. Monsignor BANACH (Holy See) said that the Holy See continued to support the search for 
political solutions that not only helped prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also helped 
ensure that war was not seen as a means of resolving conflicts between nations. Some of the resources 
allocated for weapons could be redeployed for economic, educational and health-care projects, thereby 
contributing to domestic and international stability. 
197. The Agency could look back with satisfaction on what had been achieved under the three pillars 
of its mandate since its establishment. However, many challenges remained. The Holy See regarded 
the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, the basis for pursuing 
nuclear disarmament, and an important factor for further development of nuclear energy applications 
for peaceful purposes. As the Treaty was the only multilateral legal instrument in force that was 
intended to bring about a world free of nuclear weapons, it must never be allowed to be weakened. 
Other priorities were the entry into force of the CTBT and the ratification by all States Â and 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 28 
particularly the nuclear-weapon States Â of the protocols to the nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties. 
The Holy See strongly supported efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East 
and looked forward to participating in the Agency forum on experience of possible relevance to the 
creation of such a zone in that region. 
198. The Holy See had attended the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in Vienna in 
June, from which it had clearly emerged that the nuclear crisis in Fukushima was a global issue, that 
the world was exposed to real and systemic risks and not just hypothetical ones, with incalculable 
costs, and that there was a need to develop a new form of international political coordination. Many 
basic questions had to be addressed to improve the planning and management of nuclear power plants 
and bring them in line with the highest standards of safety and security. 
199. There had been recent calls to develop new safety and security standards, and for international 
monitoring of all existing nuclear plants. Without transparency, safety and security could not be 
pursued. Programmes to promote a culture of safety and security both in the nuclear sector and among 
the public at large were of vital importance. A special place must be reserved for codes of conduct for 
human resources. Security depended not only on the State but on the sense of responsibility of each 
person. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety was an important contribution to the discussion, 
especially in the context of radiation protection of persons and the environment worldwide. 
200. The Holy See appreciated the efforts of the Agency and its partners to plan and promote cancer 
control programmes, including the provision and upgrading of essential equipment, appropriate 
training of doctors, physicists and technicians, and international exchange of relevant information. It 
encouraged the Agency to continue and strengthen all such activities, particularly PACT, which 
assisted Member States in the tremendous task of combating cancer and creating regional centres of 
excellence for radiotherapy. 
201. The peaceful applications of nuclear techniques could make a contribution to meeting the most 
pressing needs, such as production of crops with improved yields or greater salt tolerance in arid 
climates, or the eradication of disease-transmitting and otherwise harmful pests in an environmentally 
friendly manner. They could also be used effectively in the study of child malnutrition and in disease 
diagnosis and treatment. 
202. However, the management of drinking water supplies was of paramount importance and 
choosing water as the topic for the Scientific Forum at the current General Conference was most 
timely. Access to safe drinking water was at the root of some of societyÂs most pressing concerns. The 
problem of water scarcity and water deprivation was experienced most dramatically by those living in 
poverty and in the poorest countries. The responsibility for the destiny of less favoured countries must 
be borne by those more richly blessed. The many children who died each year in poor countries owing 
to the lack of access to safe water and sanitation were a loss for humanity as a whole. The challenge 
currently faced in the water and sanitation sector was also an opportunity, from both a social and an 
economic perspective. Investments in safe water and sanitation could be an engine for accelerated 
economic growth, sustainable development, improved health and reduced poverty. The reduction of 
poverty was also one of the AgencyÂs goals. The water issue related to the right to life. The primary 
objective of all efforts must be the well-being of those who lived in the poorest parts of the world and 
suffered most from a scarcity or misuse of water resources. 
203. Mr TZOTCHEV (Bulgaria) said that, in the light of the tragic events in Fukushima, the 
2011 General Conference and other high-level political activities provided a prime opportunity to 
address the important issues of nuclear safety and security. Reiterating his countryÂs full solidarity 
with the Japanese people, he paid tribute to the courage of the workers and authorities in handling the 
crisis. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 29 
204. Bulgaria supported multilateral efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Along with 
the AgencyÂs nuclear non-proliferation safeguards system, the Treaty made a crucial contribution to 
regional and international peace and security. The peaceful use of nuclear energy should be based on 
full compliance with the NPT and transparency in nuclear programmes. His country was committed to 
strengthening all three pillars of the NPT and would continue its efforts to implement the final 
document of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The Agency must continue to play its crucial role in 
the implementation of the NPT. Its safeguards mechanism was a key instrument to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. As one of the first countries to sign and ratify an additional protocol, 
Bulgaria called for the swift universalization of that instrument. 
205. His country fully supported the creation of zones free of weapons of mass destruction and their 
means of delivery, including nuclear weapons. Such zones had been identified in many international 
forums as positive steps towards nuclear disarmament. Bulgaria welcomed the agreement at the 
2010 NPT Review Conference on the implementation of the 1995 NPT resolution on the Middle East, 
including the convening of a conference in 2012. The successful European Union seminar held in July 
2011 had demonstrated the importance of inclusive participation and open and constructive dialogue 
for the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. The Agency 
forum to be held in that connection in November should be a positive step leading up to the 
2012 conference. 
206. Bulgaria was following the development of the Iranian nuclear programme and noted with 
serious concern the Director GeneralÂs latest report (GOV/2011/54), in particular as regards the 
reported expansion of IranÂs enrichment activities and capacity and that countryÂs non-compliance 
with its international obligations. It urged Iran to comply fully with all relevant United Nations 
Security Council and Agency resolutions and to cooperate with the Agency to resolve all outstanding 
issues so that international confidence in the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme could be 
restored. He called on Iran to meet with the European Union High Representative and the 
representatives of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the 
United States of America. 
207. His country also noted the Director GeneralÂs latest report (GC(55)/24) confirming that, from 
the end of 2002 until July 2007 and since April 2009, the Agency had been unable to implement 
safeguards measures in the DPRK. That, along with information about the construction of a new 
uranium enrichment facility and a light water reactor, raised serious concerns about the DPRKÂs 
nuclear programme and made the resumption of dialogue and the return of Agency inspectors all the 
more urgent. The DPRK must comply with its international obligations under relevant Security 
Council resolutions and its comprehensive safeguard agreement, abandoning and dismantling any 
nuclear weapon-related programme in a prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner. It 
should also return to the six-party talks process. 
208. Bulgaria noted with serious concern the conclusions of the AgencyÂs report to the Board of 
Governors in June regarding SyriaÂs non-compliance with its safeguards agreement (GOV/2011/30). It 
urged Syria to cooperate with the Agency to resolve all outstanding issues and fulfil its international 
obligations. 
209. The Annual Report for 2010 offered an informative and comprehensive picture of the AgencyÂs 
activities over the year. His country appreciated the fact that the international nuclear community had 
maintained a high level of safety performance during that period. The increasingly important role 
played by nuclear energy in Member States required further enhancement of their national 
infrastructures and safety improvements. Hence, Agency assistance to Member States with developing 
their governmental and regulatory frameworks, especially for States interested in developing new, or 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 30 
expanding existing nuclear power programmes, was crucial to ensuring a high level of nuclear safety. 
The Agency should also continue its work in the sphere of non-power applications of nuclear energy, 
which helped Member States find appropriate solutions in the areas of human health, agriculture, 
industry and education, inter alia. 
210. Bulgaria shared the view expressed in the Annual Report that the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme was the primary mechanism for supporting Member States in the peaceful and 
safe use of nuclear technology for development. The quality of national, regional and interregional 
projects, and their adequate financing, played a key role in successful implementation and in the 
achievement of the targeted results. In the Europe region, projects to support the development of 
nuclear power and the use of radiation in health care, and to maintain appropriate levels of safety and 
security in all aspects of the peaceful use of nuclear technology, were an important area of activity. 
Recognizing the need for assured, sufficient and predictable financing of technical cooperation 
activities, Bulgaria paid its annual contribution to the TCF in full and on time. 
211. In October 2010, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria had passed an act 
amending and supplementing its law on the safe use of nuclear energy, in fulfilment of the Bulgarian 
Nuclear Regulatory AgencyÂs policy of updating legislative requirements in line with the latest 
international standards and European legislation. Amendments to international conventions and 
treaties, new European Union legislation and updated Agency documents had been taken into 
consideration, together with practical experience gained in applying the law. To ensure widespread 
distribution and easy access, the new legislation had been published in electronic form on the Nuclear 
Regulatory AgencyÂs website. In the same month, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency had issued 
five-year licences to the State radioactive waste enterprise to operate units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy 
nuclear power plant as facilities for radioactive waste management. Those licences terminated the 
validity of the operating licences for those units. 
212. Following the Fukushima nuclear accident the European Commission had demanded a 
reassessment of all nuclear power plants in the European Union with a view to learning from that 
event and ensuring that no similar disaster could occur in the Union. All nuclear facilities at the 
Kozloduy site had been reassessed and, in September 2011, a progress report had been sent to the 
European Commission. 
213. In 2010, the Nuclear Regulatory Agency had received a new version of the technical design for 
the Belene nuclear power plant which took into account the regulatory authorityÂs comments and 
recommendations on the previous version. The new version had been reviewed by national and 
international experts in order to verify whether all the comments and recommendations had been taken 
into consideration, and the final reports had been submitted to the national electricity company. For 
the design to be approved, the company would have to amend the design in line with the results of the 
expert review. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency had been continuing its review and assessment of the 
design in 2011. 
214. Mr VALLIM GUERREIRO (Brazil) said that 2011 had been a year in which nuclear power 
generation had come under close scrutiny and had raised apprehensions worldwide as to its 
cost-benefit relationship. The Fukushima accident had exposed the weaknesses as well as the strengths 
of the Agency in meeting the expectations of the international community. 
215. His country once again extended its heartfelt condolences to the Japanese people for the 
suffering caused by the earthquake and tsunami in March. Brazil had the largest Japanese community 
outside Japan, and Brazilians constituted the third largest foreign community in Japan, mostly 
descendants of those who had moved to Brazil over a century earlier and had contributed so much to 
BrazilÂs development in all walks of life. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 31 
216. Brazil had supported the decision of the Director General to convene a Ministerial Conference 
on Nuclear Safety to discuss issues relating to nuclear safety in the aftermath of the Fukushima 
accident. It had presided over the Conference and the coordinating process which had eventually led to 
its successful conclusion. The Conference had adopted a declaration, negotiated among all Member 
States, which had entrusted the Director General with the task of submitting to the Board of Governors 
and the General Conference an action plan on nuclear power reactor safety, emergency response and 
preparedness, and radiation protection of people and the environment. He commended the Director 
General for diligently carrying out that mandate and welcomed the fact that, in the preceding week, the 
Board of Governors had recommended that the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety be endorsed at 
the General Conference. 
217. For some, the action plan fell short in many areas, while for others it was too ambitious. What 
was important, however, was that a process was being initiated which, in some respects, might take 
months to be accomplished and, in others, years or even decades. It would be inappropriate at the 
current juncture to be too prescriptive about what the end result should be. The proposal the Board of 
Governors had asked the General Conference to endorse was the most that was politically possible in 
the current circumstances. 
218. Nuclear energy was an emotional issue, but some comments made in the aftermath of the 
Fukushima accident had defied rationality and, in some cases, the laws of physics. There was no 
simple way to dispel public anxieties about nuclear energy, but Member States must not shirk their 
common responsibility to take seriously the lessons to be learned from Fukushima. That would require 
courageous political leadership. Implementation of the action plan by Member States, the Secretariat 
and other stakeholders, such as other international organizations, would be a test of that leadership. 
Brazil was prepared to assume its share of responsibility in that endeavour. 
219. Brazil was not taking lightly the lessons which could be learned from the Fukushima accident. It 
and other members of the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies 
had decided to submit nuclear power plants in operation in their countries to similar stress tests to 
those to be applied in Europe and elsewhere with a view to re-evaluating the safety parameters of 
those facilities. 
220. At the 2010 General Conference, he had stressed that it was important not to yield to the 
temptation of thinking that one size fits all. His country fully recognized the important role played by 
the Agency in developing standards in many fields. Such standards provided Member States with 
essential guidance. However, an understanding of the technical issues involved might sometimes lead 
to procedures and practices which, although different, were as effective as those prescribed, or even 
more so. Common sense based on sound technical and scientific knowledge was the best guide to 
success. 
221. The current year marked the 20th anniversary of ABACC, which had been a real success story. 
Whereas, in the past, rivalry and mistrust had predominated, now confidence and trust prevailed, 
thanks to full transparency. Brazil had a complete picture of the nuclear activities carried out in 
Argentina and vice-versa. The Quadripartite Agreement had entered into force before either country 
had acceded to the NPT. That experience might prove to be of value in other regions of the world and, 
in that connection, Brazil looked forward to the participation of ABACC officials in the forum on 
experience of possible relevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East to 
be convened in Vienna in November. 
222. Mr WURST CALLE (Peru) said that the nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant had a major impact on the work of the Agency. The primary responsibility for nuclear 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 32 
safety lay with individual States. At the same time, the Agency played an important role in promoting 
international cooperation and coordinating global efforts to strengthen the nuclear safety regime. 
223. Although Peru did not have nuclear power plants, and its use of nuclear energy was mainly 
confined to research and nuclear applications in agriculture and human health, implementation of 
adequate nuclear safety standards remained a priority. Thus, his country welcomed the recent approval 
by the Board of Governors of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, developed in the aftermath of 
the Fukushima accident, which contained practical measures for strengthening nuclear safety. It would 
have preferred the action plan to be more ambitious, but it recognized that the plan was realistic and 
incorporated the concerns of all Member States. The action plan and its future implementation should 
be seen as two parts of a broader process that had begun after the Fukushima accident and that also 
included the initiative of the Director General to convene a Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety 
in June 2011, the high-level meeting on nuclear safety to be convened by the Secretary-General during 
the current week in New York, the extraordinary meeting of the parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety scheduled for 2012, and the initiative of the Prime Minister of Japan to hold an international 
conference on nuclear safety in late 2012 with the support of the Agency. 
224. His country was aware that many countries were reluctant to address the questions of nuclear 
safety and nuclear security together, but the eminently technical nature of both issues should make it 
possible to do so, particularly for countries that were just embarking on a nuclear programme. After 
all, the consequences of a nuclear accident were equally serious in terms of loss of life and 
environmental and material damage whether it was caused by a natural disaster or a malicious act. 
225. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to coordinate its activities with other United Nations 
bodies in order to avoid duplication of work, and to publicize the mandate and competencies of the 
organization. In that connection, the Agency had sent experts to Peru to attend a regional workshop in 
November 2010 in Lima on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 
1540 (2004). 
226. Peru had followed with interest the Nuclear Security Summit held in Washington in 2010 and 
was firmly committed to the objectives of that process, namely non-proliferation, nuclear 
disarmament, the peaceful use of nuclear energy and strengthening of nuclear security to prevent 
malicious acts. It had attended a workshop on nuclear security held in June 2011 in Chile and hoped to 
be able to take part in the Nuclear Security Summit to be held in March 2012 in the Republic of 
Korea. 
227. At national level, Peru had finalized a draft document with the Agency identifying practical 
measures for strengthening the physical protection of radioactive material. It hoped that that plan 
could be implemented soon, with the assistance of the Agency and the international community. 
228. His country supported the AgencyÂs missions to evaluate nuclear security and it had initiated 
preliminary discussions on a mission to assess its border control capabilities. 
229. With regard to technical cooperation, in order to meet the needs of developing countries the 
Agency should focus on the following areas: combating cancer through the creation of national 
capacities both with respect to training of professionals and the acquisition of diagnostic and 
therapeutic equipment; improving food security through the use of nuclear applications in agriculture; 
provision of technical, economic and legal assistance to Member States embarking on nuclear power 
programmes; and use of isotopic techniques in water resources management. 
230. In June 2011, the Director General had visited Peru, when he had been able to see for himself 
the various projects that were being carried out involving nuclear applications in the areas of medicine, 
agriculture and water management. Peru was committed to continuing its productive cooperation with 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 33 
the Agency. It had submitted a number of project proposals directly linked to its sustainable 
development plans. Via nuclear applications in the field of health, agriculture and water resources 
management, inter alia, the Agency played an important role in helping countries meet the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
231. At regional level, Peru had been an active participant in ARCAL since 1984. It took part in a 
large number of ARCAL projects ranging in subject area from human resources development to 
infrastructure development in such areas as energy, health, agriculture, hydrology, industry, nuclear 
safety and radiation protection. 
232. In 2010, his country had joined the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear 
Regulatory Agencies and had been working actively to standardize national legislation, drawing on the 
valuable experience of regulatory authorities in countries with a more advanced nuclear programme. 
233. Mr AL-SALAL (Kuwait) said that a major increase in energy supplies would be required in the 
coming decades to meet the needs of global socio-economic development. As nuclear energy was 
deemed to be a supplementary rather than an alternative source of energy, the decision to opt for 
nuclear energy depended on national policies, which were in turn determined by needs, aspirations and 
capacities. Kuwait was cooperating with the Agency with a view to building its national capacity and 
developing the institutions required for the implementation of key nuclear projects. It looked forward 
to further consultations and close cooperation to that end. 
234. His country was also engaged in consultations between experts from member States of the 
Gulf Cooperation Council and Agency experts on the implementation of a joint programme on 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. A great deal had been achieved during the preceding four years and 
Kuwait looked forward to further close cooperation in the years ahead. 
235. The technical cooperation programme was a cornerstone of the AgencyÂs work in support of 
capacity building and the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries for peaceful purposes. 
Kuwait had long attached special importance to technical cooperation activities and greatly 
appreciated the AgencyÂs activities in support of Asia and the Pacific region, especially the 
organization of regional workshops and training courses. It looked forward to further constructive 
cooperation and thanked the Agency staff that had visited Kuwait for their valuable assistance. 
236. Kuwait attached great importance to the safety and security of radioactive sources and nuclear 
material, and he emphasized the need for strict application of the rules and guidelines aimed at 
controlling movements of such material. His country followed with keen interest developments in the 
AgencyÂs integrated nuclear security support plans and it had agreed with the Agency to hold a 
training workshop on advanced equipment for the detection of radioactive material. 
237. The painful lessons learned from nuclear accidents had made States more determined to 
enhance their collective capacity to respond to nuclear accidents in the future Â including those 
caused by major natural disasters Â by taking practical steps to apply safety measures to all activities 
relating to the use of nuclear energy. Failure to take such action would have an adverse impact on the 
sustainability of the role of nuclear energy and its potential contribution to the economic development 
of most societies. A constructive and transparent dialogue must therefore begin at once with a view to 
identifying a solid basis for the development of new and effective strategies and mechanisms in the 
area of nuclear safety. 
238. Nuclear safety was not only a global and regional issue but also a national responsibility and it 
must be addressed at all three levels. The importance of universal application of nuclear safety 
conventions and emergency response mechanisms should be recognized, and emphasis should be 
placed on the binding nature of such international obligations. Close and transparent international 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 34 
cooperation was required as a first step towards expanding the use of nuclear energy as and when 
required. 
239. All present and future users of nuclear energy should be required to meet the highest safety 
standards. The Agency had a key role to play in all areas relating to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
especially that of nuclear safety, and it should be accorded greater authority to undertake regular 
inspections of national arrangements to deal with emergencies and improve the safety of nuclear 
installations in accordance with internationally agreed norms. Clearly, such steps might call for an 
increase in the AgencyÂs financial resources, but the benefits to be gained would greatly exceed the 
additional costs. His country called on all States that had not yet acceded to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety to do so as soon as possible. 
240. Kuwait was following developments with respect to the implementation by the Islamic Republic 
of Iran of its safeguards agreement. While it affirmed the right of all States to produce, develop and 
use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in accordance with the provisions of the NPT, it called on 
Iran to cooperate more closely with the Agency, and to respond to the latterÂs queries, in order to 
dispel any fears or doubts regarding the nature of its nuclear programme and resolve outstanding 
issues. It further called on all parties concerned to step up diplomatic efforts to resume the dialogue 
and negotiations in the interests of security and stability in the Middle East region and the world as a 
whole. 
241. The safeguards system, as a cornerstone of the AgencyÂs work and of the non-proliferation 
regime, enjoyed the support of most countries in the world. His country therefore urged all States that 
had not yet signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency to do so, and it encouraged 
States that had signed such an agreement to proceed with the signing of an additional protocol. All 
States party to the NPT should abide by their obligations under the Treaty and under their safeguards 
agreements, and should work closely with the Agency in resolving any doubts regarding their 
programmes through constructive and transparent negotiations and dialogue. 
242. Kuwait attached great importance to the application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear 
activities in the Middle East. It noted with deep regret that, although all other States in the region were 
party to the NPT and were committed to the application of the provisions of their safeguards 
agreements, Israel persisted in its refusal to sign the NPT and place its installations under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards, thereby impeding the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
in the Middle East. Its attitude undermined security and stability in the region and hence in the world 
as a whole. 
243. His country welcomed the convening by the Director General in November 2011 Â pursuant to 
General Conference decision GC(44)/DEC/12 adopted in 2000 Â of a forum on experience that might 
be of relevance to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. It also 
welcomed the efforts by peace-loving nations to convene an international conference in 2012 on the 
establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
Those were important first steps towards raising international awareness of the risk posed by IsraelÂs 
failure to accede to the NPT, and towards achieving the universality of the Treaty. 
244. Kuwait reaffirmed the inalienable right of all States without discrimination to possess and 
develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. It therefore welcomed the decision to establish a 
nuclear fuel bank under the AgencyÂs auspices and had donated a sum of US $10 million for that 
purpose. 
245. In conclusion, Kuwait had full confidence in the AgencyÂs ability to make an effective 
contribution to sustainable development in countries that were faced with economic and financial 
crises and with problems of food security and climate change. The organization deserved Member 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 35 
StatesÂ unstinting support for its efforts to guarantee security, safety, peace and prosperity throughout 
the world. 
246. Mr AL RAISI (Oman) expressed his countryÂs solidarity with the Japanese people and 
Government, and with all those who had sought to alleviate the impact of the accident at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. A number of scientific meetings had been held at different 
levels in the intervening period to study all the implications of the nuclear disaster and to draw the 
necessary lessons for the future. It was essential to undertake a transparent and comprehensive 
assessment and to share the resulting data speedily with all countries, in accordance with the 
declaration adopted at the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011. 
247. The Sultanate of Oman agreed with other States that it was necessary to consider ways and 
means of strengthening the international legal framework, including nuclear safety conventions, which 
should be effectively implemented and regularly reviewed. It was also necessary to improve early 
warning procedures, and emergency preparedness and response at national, regional and international 
level. 
248. Since joining the Agency in 2009, Oman had attached great importance to national and regional 
projects under the technical cooperation programme in the areas of energy planning, human health, 
agriculture, food, water resources management, protection of the environment and radiation safety 
infrastructure. Such projects formed part of the SultanateÂs comprehensive development plan. Oman 
had signed a CPF with the Agency in October 2010 covering the period 2012Â2017 which tied in with 
the countryÂs development plan for 2011Â2015. It trusted it could rely on the AgencyÂs support for the 
projects it had submitted for the 2012Â2013 technical cooperation cycle. 
249. His country greatly appreciated the action being taken to avert the risk of nuclear proliferation 
and it reiterated its call for the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction, especially 
nuclear weapons, in the Middle East. The General Conference should take the requisite steps to 
achieve that goal by ensuring that all nuclear facilities, including those of Israel, were placed under 
Agency safeguards. 
250. Finally, Oman was confident that the Agency would continue to promote nuclear and radiation 
safety in order to secure the support of international civil society for peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
251. Mr BELFORT (Haiti) encouraged the Agency to engage more with the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM) and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS) in general, and with Barbados in 
particular, to help it associate itself more effectively with the programme for sustainable management 
of the Caribbean Sea. Isotopic techniques could certainly be of assistance in developing that 
programme. 
252. The Government and people of Haiti extended their sympathy to the Japanese people following 
the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and thanked the Agency for the support it 
had given, and for having organized the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety earlier in the year. 
253. His Government attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, 
from which it had benefited in the areas of public health, agriculture, energy planning and the 
environment. The Haitian Government was looking at ways in which the Agency could become 
involved in the development activities that were being undertaken in Haiti by the United Nations and 
other United Nations bodies. Such integration would be difficult because the Agency did not have a 
system of permanent representation, however it could certainly be achieved through UNDAF or ad 
hoc missions. Haiti hoped that such technical missions could be sent soon to discuss with the UNDP 
the possibility of the Agency participating in the UNDAF system and thereby strengthening its 
cooperation programme in Haiti. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 36 
254. The solution to many of HaitiÂs current development problems could be found in more strategic 
cooperation with the Agency in agriculture, the environment, energy planning and public health. His 
country was experiencing difficulties in implementing its radiotherapy centre project but hoped those 
problems would very soon be resolved because, with almost 10 000 cancer cases per year, the project 
was of vital importance. His Government would welcome an imPACT mission to undertake a 
systematic evaluation of the countryÂs cancer therapy needs. 
255. Before the turn of the century, there had been practically no Agency activities in Haiti, even 
though the country had been one of the organizationÂs founding members. Between 2002 and 2009, 
great progress had been made in cooperation between Haiti and the Agency through its participation in 
numerous regional and national projects, and thanks to greater awareness on the part of the Haitian 
authorities and public of the issues surrounding the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and in 
the service of sustainable development. However, ten years of patient, work had been severely 
undermined by the earthquake of 12 January 2010, and discouragement was beginning to set in. Then, 
in March 2010, the innovative and fruitful idea of a Âspecial projectÂ for Haiti had emerged following 
discussions involving Haiti, the Agency and the member countries of ARCAL, an idea which also 
represented a new approach to the problems of LDCs. That project should not only help repair the 
immense damage caused to the countryÂs basic infrastructure but should also help restore the pace of 
development prior to the earthquake. He thanked all those who had supported the idea. 
256. For many years, his country had been telling the General Conference that the Agency needed to 
give special attention to LDCs, which had their own special difficulties and development needs that 
could not be compared with those of other developing countries or the developed countries, as had 
been recognized in various international forums. It was important that the Agency to find viable, fair 
and sustainable solutions to their problems, and LDCs should have a permanent place on the AgencyÂs 
agenda. The foundations needed to be laid to ensure that the technical assistance provided by the 
Agency was better absorbed and integrated into countriesÂ development programmes, with a view to 
achieving the fundamental objectives of elimination of poverty and respect for human dignity, 
ensuring that globalization was not a dehumanizing process but a truly positive force for the worldÂs 
population as a whole. There should also be better integration of LDCs into the global economy in 
order to counter their marginalization. 
257. The Seoul Development Consensus adopted by the G20 in November 2010 emphasized the 
need for strong infrastructures and for food security. The trend towards new approaches would no 
doubt be reinforced at the G20 meeting to be held in Cannes, France, in November 2011. The Agency 
was not only a scientific organization; it was also becoming a development body with activities 
extending over the five fields of water, energy, health, agriculture and biological diversity. His country 
was convinced that the Agency could assist LDCs in achieving the objectives of the Rio Declaration 
on Environment and Development, the Brussels Declaration, United Nations action plans for the 
LDCs and the Millennium Declaration. 
258. His country was pleased to note that, despite the Fukushima accident, the Agency was as 
determined as ever to continue developing its activities relating to the peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy in support of sustainable development. In performing its functions, the organization sometimes 
faced financial problems. Despite its own numerous problems, Haiti would do everything in its power 
to make its own very modest contribution to the AgencyÂs finances, in particular through its 
contribution to the TCF. 
259. Haiti was committed to combating terrorism, in particular nuclear and radiological terrorism, as 
well as weapons of mass destruction and everything that could pose a threat to international peace and 
security. It urged all Member States to follow the AgencyÂs recommendations on nuclear safety and 
security with the utmost rigour. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 37 
260. Finally, many international officials of the highest standing would have wished to attend the 
AgencyÂs General Conference had it not coincided with the autumn session of the United Nations 
General Assembly. Thus, that it would be both desirable and a positive move if the Secretariat, 
together with the Board of Governors, were to give consideration to scheduling the General 
Conference either slightly earlier or slightly later. 
261. Mr NYAPHISI (Lesotho) offered his countryÂs profound condolences to the Government and 
people of Japan in the wake of the events of March 2011. 
262. Expressing support for the Peaceful Uses Initiative, from which his country had benefited, he 
thanked those Member States that had contributed to it, calling on others to do likewise with a view to 
reaching the target of $100 million by 2015. 
263. As a relatively new member of the Agency, the Kingdom of Lesotho had signed the Revised 
Supplementary Agreement Concerning the Provision of Technical Assistance by the IAEA in 
September 2010 and was in the process of developing a CPF. Following a fact-finding and 
programming mission to the country, potential areas of technical cooperation had been identified, 
which included human health, animal disease control, energy planning, support for capacity building, 
and establishment of a legislative framework and national infrastructure for radiation protection. 
264. His country was committed to establishing a comprehensive, efficient and effective national 
regulatory infrastructure, in compliance with international safety standards, in the shortest possible 
time, and a bill had been drafted to that end. 
265. He expressed appreciation to the Director General for convening the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety in June 2011, and support for the resultant IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety which 
aimed to strengthen the global nuclear safety and security framework. 
266. He also welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative in dedicating the 2011 Scientific Forum to 
water matters. Such events were important, as they sought to address the plight of millions of people 
in developing countries and contributed to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. 
Addressing the increasing burden of cancer, and improving management of and access to safe drinking 
water, were important for millions of people in developing countries and were key components of 
LesothoÂs development agenda to improve the quality of life of its people. He thanked the Agency for 
the support it had given to his country and encouraged Member States to provide extrabudgetary 
resources for Agency activities in those key areas. Lesotho would be seeking support from Member 
States for the establishment of its national regulatory authority and for capacity building in that 
connection. 
267. His country had honoured its pledge to the TCF and would continue to do so in future years. It 
encouraged other Member States to contribute to the Fund. 
268. Mr PALAI (Botswana) offered condolences to the people of Japan in the aftermath of the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. 
269. That tragic event had given rise to much debate about the safety and future of nuclear energy. 
As the Director General had pointed out, confidence had been shaken and many countries were now 
considering scaling down or withdrawing from their nuclear programmes and searching for alternative 
energy sources. Confidence building was thus one of the AgencyÂs most critical tasks following the 
accident and efforts should be made not only to ensure the soundness of the science, but also to 
explore how the technology could meet current and future demands while being environmentally 
friendly. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 38 
270. That issue was of particular concern for developing countries. One of the biggest constraints on 
foreign investment was inadequate energy supplies. However, energy generation was only one of 
several peaceful uses of nuclear technology, which also had applications in areas such as agriculture 
and water resources management. 
271. The events in Japan demonstrated humanityÂs vulnerability even where optimum safety 
measures were in place. The importance of complying with relevant Agency instruments and standards 
could not be overemphasized. Successful implementation of the Convention on Early Notification of a 
Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological 
Emergency required international cooperation. 
272. Strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the additional protocol was of key 
importance for reinforcing the NPT. His country encouraged Member States that had not yet acceded 
to those instruments to do so as a matter of urgency, and it urged all Member States to cooperate fully 
with the Agency in its safeguards monitoring activities as well as to provide assurances regarding 
compliance with the aforementioned instruments. The diversion of nuclear material for military uses in 
whatever form must never be tolerated. 
273. The proposed IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, elaborated in the aftermath of the 
Fukushima accident, was a positive development and his country hoped that it would help promote 
greater transparency, which was a prerequisite for building confidence and dispelling fear. 
274. Botswana viewed AFRA as an important initiative for addressing regional challenges in the 
fields of agriculture, health, water resources, food and nutrition. AFRA had been particularly effective 
in addressing transboundary challenges such as animal diseases and human capacity building in 
nuclear technology in Africa. Such cooperation could reduce the failures associated with a fragmented 
approach to funding regional projects. Technical cooperation remained a crucial vehicle for delivering 
the promises of nuclear technology, and so a significant proportion of the AgencyÂs resources should 
be devoted to it. His country was encouraged by the increase in contributions to the programme, and it 
was grateful for the collaboration, support and assistance provided. It used nuclear technology in 
agriculture, health, water resources management, food and nutrition, and in numerous industrial 
applications. 
275. The assistance Botswana received from the Agency and other international partners was crucial 
in health-related coordinated research projects. HIV/AIDS remained the countryÂs highest priority. 
Research into food and nutrition, and into intervention techniques employing stable isotopes, gave 
hope that a sustainable solution could be found to problems in that area, while the establishment of a 
radiotherapy centre should alleviate challenges in cancer treatment. Support in human resources 
development would remain essential. In the agricultural sector, Botswana had made advances in 
animal disease diagnosis and plant breeding. The effective prevention, management and containment 
of animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease showed the value of assistance from the Agency 
and other international partners. His country was also confident that a combination of traditional tsetse 
fly eradication methods and the SIT could effectively contain further outbreaks. Because of its dry 
climate, Botswana needed to employ nuclear techniques for groundwater and soil management. That 
work complemented research initiatives in plant breeding aimed at developing high-yield mutant crop 
varieties. His Government continued to support strengthening of the regulatory framework for the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and for radiation safety. Since BotswanaÂs legislative framework had 
come into effect in 2006, the functions of the national regulator had been enhanced through the 
provision of a personal exposure monitoring service for occupationally exposed workers. In addition, 
background radiation monitoring equipment had been installed in most parts of Botswana. His 
Government was optimistic about the forthcoming project cycle. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 39 
276. In line with BotswanaÂs efforts to enhance nuclear security and combat nuclear terrorism, the 
countryÂs major border entry points, including airports, had been equipped with radiation detection 
devices. Botswana took nuclear safety and security seriously and strongly felt that even a small effort 
aimed at preventing nuclear terrorism would contribute to regional and global security. It urged all 
nations to ensure that nuclear material did not fall into terrorist hands. 
277. In conclusion, he reaffirmed his GovernmentÂs commitment to meeting its obligations and 
maximizing its support for the Agency. 
278. Mr SAIZONOU (Benin) offered his countryÂs condolences to the people and Government of 
Japan in the wake of the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant and commended the measures 
taken by the Agency in that connection. Benin remained convinced that lessons would be learned from 
the accident which would help promote nuclear safety and security culture. 
279. Benin welcomed the significant progress made at the recent NPT Review Conference as well as 
the various initiatives to facilitate the entry into force of the CTBT. It was becoming increasingly 
urgent to give full force to international commitments in that area and to work towards a real reduction 
of the role of nuclear weapons in security policies. 
280. His country supported international initiatives promoting the universal application of the nuclear 
safeguards system, which was both a prerequisite and an effective tool for combating nuclear 
terrorism. 
281. Benin appreciated the tireless efforts of the Agency to assist States with the peaceful application 
of nuclear energy in the service of sustainable development, and with accident clean-up. 
282. His country had made only minimal use of nuclear applications for many years, but it was now 
increasingly working towards meeting the criteria for more regular cooperation with the Agency. In 
that regard, it particularly appreciated the AgencyÂs ongoing technical and financial support which had 
made possible the signing of a CPF at the end of 2010. 
283. Benin attached great importance to the technical cooperation programme as one of the AgencyÂs 
core activities. It greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs support, which had helped the country develop 
several projects in such areas as agriculture, energy planning, environment, health and water 
resources. It was working on a number of priority projects in the same areas for the 2012Â2013 cycle. 
284. With the aim of optimizing its cooperation with the Agency, Benin was currently in the final 
stages of introducing national legislation governing ionizing radiation, which it had hitherto lacked. In 
that connection, he thanked the Agency for its recent support in sending an expert mission to Cotonou 
which had given that process a significant boost. Implementing a legal framework for the safe 
management of all nuclear technology applications at national level was a major challenge for Benin. 
It therefore welcomed the multifarious support it received from the Agency, which should serve to 
strengthen the operational capacities of the national regulatory framework it was planning. 
285. In addition, a project to establish BeninÂs first national radiotherapy and nuclear medicine centre 
was already under way and had received Agency backing via a feasibility study, training programmes 
and expert missions. 
286. However, his countryÂs ambitions did not end there. It was also seeking to promote education 
and research in nuclear technology and science, to improve management of its water resources and to 
control air quality in built-up areas. It thus welcomed the choice of water resources as the theme for 
the 2011 Scientific Forum. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 40 
287. Benin fully recognized the need for States to meet their financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the 
Agency so that the Agency could fulfil its mandate. Thus, his Government had recently 
paid $31 575.89 towards its arrears in contributions to the Regular Budget and it undertook to pay its 
other contributions in 2012. 
288. In conclusion, he praised the positive atmosphere of the General Conference and agreed with 
the proposal of the representative of Haiti to change the dates of the General Conference in future so 
that it did not conflict with the United Nations General Assembly. 
289. Mr MCCOOK (Jamaica) joined other delegations in extending his countryÂs sympathy and 
solidarity to the people of Japan in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent 
accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. 
290. His country welcomed the opportunity to participate in the General Conference, particularly as 
its developmental challenges often constrained the scope of its engagement in the work of the Agency. 
Having joined the Agency in 1965, it remained committed to the vision and mission of the 
organization and particularly appreciated the cooperation and support given to least developed and 
developing countries. 
291. The AgencyÂs mission was to secure global commitment to the safe, effective and peaceful use 
of nuclear technology, harnessing its tremendous benefits while preventing the catastrophic potential 
effects of accidents or malicious use. It was the capacity of nuclear technology both to help and harm 
that made the agenda of international cooperation on nuclear technology so critical, requiring the 
commitment of all. With its uses ranging from medicine to the generation of energy to power great 
cities, nuclear energy affected every member of the international community, albeit in different ways 
and at different levels. The Agency had played and must continue to play a unique and vital role in 
efforts in that area. 
292. Jamaica saw the AgencyÂs role in promoting the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear 
technologies as one of its most important mandates. Recent events had highlighted the importance of 
coherent and coordinated international approaches to dealing with nuclear safety issues. Thus, his 
country welcomed the proposals for strengthening nuclear safety and emergency preparedness. It had 
listened with interest to the reports of steps taken to assess and reinforce safety and risk reduction 
measures in several countries with extensive nuclear facilities, and it hoped that those efforts would 
help to prevent the recurrence of nuclear accidents. 
293. As challenging as the mission to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology was, 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons was no less important. Jamaica wished to see a world 
in which there were no nuclear weapons, and it therefore welcomed initiatives to promote the 
expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones and efforts to reduce and downgrade stocks of nuclear 
weapons and related material. All Member States should comply with their obligations under relevant 
treaties governing the peaceful use of nuclear technology and prohibiting the testing, development and 
proliferation of nuclear weapons. Jamaica supported the verification and safeguards procedures that 
the Agency conducted in accordance with its mandate and remained hopeful that outstanding concerns 
in that area would be resolved through full and effective cooperation among all parties. 
294. One feature of protecting society from the malicious use of nuclear technology was the 
safekeeping of nuclear supplies and effective measures to prevent nuclear technology from falling into 
the hands of terrorists. His country was fully committed to supporting the AgencyÂs efforts to 
strengthen cooperation in nuclear safety and remain alert to any attempt by unauthorized persons to 
possess or move nuclear material. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 41 
295. Not unrelated to that issue was the safe transport of nuclear material, and he welcomed the 
proposals developed in that area. He drew attention to the oft-repeated and deeply held concerns of his 
country and its neighbours regarding the transit of nuclear waste through the vulnerable Caribbean 
region, and he urged shipping States to take those concerns into account and discontinue the practice. 
296. For Jamaica, nuclear technology was of greatest relevance in the field of social and economic 
development. His country appreciated the valuable technical assistance provided by the Agency. That 
assistance had spanned several areas, expanding from a focus on programmes undertaken with the 
International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Science at the University of the West Indies to 
encompass programmes in other areas and with other institutions. Jamaica had benefited from training 
and capacity building programmes offered by the Agency and was particularly appreciative of projects 
in such areas as New World screw worm eradication and groundwater testing, including the AgencyÂs 
pioneering work on research into lead and other toxic metals in Jamaican soil, as well as assistance 
with enhanced testing of residue levels of certain materials in foods. It had also benefited from the 
expansion of radiology, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine projects, strengthening of capacities for the 
application of nuclear sciences, and assistance in drafting legislation relating to nuclear matters. 
297. At a time when global attention was focused on the grave challenges posed by 
non-communicable diseases, it was fitting to underline the importance of nuclear medicine. The 
application of nuclear technology in oncology had made a difference to peopleÂs lives in almost every 
community. Agency cooperation with Member States for the purposes of capacity building in nuclear 
medicine was thus of great significance. 
298. Agriculture was an important economic sector in Jamaica and one with a significant social 
dimension, Having witnessed the tremendous success of the campaign against rinderpest, his country 
welcomed the efforts that were being made to apply nuclear technology more widely in that area, both 
in addressing animal health issues and in water resources management and testing. Jamaica had also 
benefited from practical support in the application of nuclear technology and related measures in a 
number of agricultural initiatives. 
299. He commended the work of the Agency and acknowledged the contribution of partner countries 
and other intergovernmental bodies to facilitating technical cooperation programmes. His country 
looked forward to continued support from such programmes as the Peaceful Uses Initiative. ARCAL 
provided further opportunities for participation in Agency cooperation programmes, and Jamaica was 
giving serious consideration to joining the Agreement in view of the importance of enhanced regional 
cooperation. 
300. Mr FAROSS (European Commission) said that the General Conference was meeting at a time 
when the entire international community was focused on ensuring and continuously improving nuclear 
safety in the light of the consequences of the recent tragic natural disasters in Japan. The European 
Commission welcomed the role that the Agency had played in the aftermath of the crisis at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In particular, he thanked the AgencyÂs Incident and 
Emergency Centre for the information provided during the events, and for its excellent cooperation 
with the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange System. The European 
Commission looked forward to the follow-up to the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in 
June, and to the effective implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on nuclear safety. 
301. Nuclear safety continued to be an absolute priority for the European Union. The European 
Commission and European Union member States were working together to ensure the safety of their 
nuclear installations. The European CommissionÂs role was to ensure that the Union developed and 
implemented the most advanced legal framework for safe and sustainable use of nuclear energy, and 
that the highest nuclear safety standards were applied in the Union and promoted internationally. 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 42 
302. After the disaster in Japan, the European Union had thought it important to reassess the level of 
nuclear safety in the Union and elsewhere in the world. Accordingly, the Commission had launched an 
initiative to carry out comprehensive safety and risk assessments of nuclear power plants throughout 
the European Union. That initiative had received broad support from the European Council and the 
European Parliament. Acting on the mandate from the European Council, the Commission and the 
European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group had defined a methodology and a time frame. The 
assessment process had been under way since 1 June in all 14 European Union member States that 
operated nuclear power plants. The agreed approach encompassed two convergent tracks. The safety 
track focused on assessing how nuclear installations could withstand the consequences of unexpected 
events, from natural disasters to man-made actions and other accidental impacts, such as transport 
accidents. Those assessments went beyond previous safety evaluations made during the licensing 
process. The security track, which lay outside the mandate of the European Nuclear Safety Regulators 
Group, focused on analysing security threats and prevention of and response to incidents due to 
malevolent or terrorist acts. That process was running under a separate framework. 
303. Safety and risk assessments were being conducted in a three-step process: nuclear operators had 
carried out self-assessments; independent national regulators had verified operatorsÂ self-assessments 
and compiled national progress reports; and final national reports would be available by the end of the 
year and would be subject to peer reviews, which would start in January 2012. 
304. On the basis of the national reports, the Commission would prepare a progress report for the 
European Council meeting on 9 December, and a consolidated final report in June 2012. Member 
States would have to decide how to follow up on the assessment at national level, while European 
Union institutions would have to take decisions on further common safety policy and legislative 
initiatives. 
305. The establishment of a peer review mechanism was essential to guarantee the accountability and 
credibility of the process. Peers from all European Union member States, both nuclear and 
non-nuclear, would participate. The mechanism could also be open, on the basis of reciprocity, to 
European Union neighbouring countries that agreed to apply Union stress tests using a similar 
methodology. 
306. There was no specific European Union legislation on such stress tests. The fact that the 
European Commission and nuclear safety regulators had agreed on shared criteria and methodology, 
and that all European Union member States had accepted them as a basis for their assessments, was an 
important achievement not only for the Union but also from a global perspective. 
307. The European Council had also called on the European Commission to review the European 
UnionÂs nuclear safety framework by the end of the year and, if necessary, to propose improvements. 
The Commission intended to present its initial findings in a report to the European Council in 
December 2011. That would be followed by a public consultation involving all relevant stakeholders. 
308. In the meantime, the European Union continued to put in place a legally binding common 
framework. After the adoption in 2009 of a directive on the safety of nuclear installations, in July the 
Council of the European Union had adopted a directive on the responsible and safe management of 
spent fuel and radioactive waste, which was the second pillar of the most advanced supranational 
safety legislation, with which the Union confirmed its leading role in the responsible use of nuclear 
energy. It was anchored in the principles and requirements of the AgencyÂs safety standards and the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, and made them legally binding and enforceable. 
309. European Union member States were being requested to establish a national policy and a precise 
programme for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste from generation to disposal based 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 43 
on safety demonstrations and public involvement in the decision-making process, and including 
international peer review. 
310. International cooperation on nuclear safety was more important than ever to strengthen safety 
culture and emergency preparedness worldwide. Building on the statement by G8 leaders in Deauville, 
the European Union considered that all countries operating nuclear power plants should carry out 
similar safety assessments as soon as possible. That was in line with its conviction that safety was of 
paramount importance, and with its policy of promoting safety beyond its borders. Over the years, 
several cooperation mechanisms between the European Commission and European Union 
neighbouring countries had been put in place. After the Fukushima accident, the Commission had 
established contacts with those neighbouring countries which operated or owned nuclear installations, 
namely Switzerland, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Armenia and Croatia, or which planned to 
develop nuclear power, like Turkey and Belarus. In June, it had convened a ministerial-level meeting 
with those countries. In a joint declaration, the participants had agreed to undertake voluntary safety 
and risk assessments, taking into account the European UnionÂs specifications and methodology, 
including the principle of peer reviews. The participation of those countries created a very large 
regional space Â practically the whole continent Â with coherent action on nuclear safety, and it set a 
leading example for the global community. 
311. The European Union also cooperated on ensuring nuclear safety at global level. Under the 
Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation, it had established cooperation with some 15 countries 
worldwide to promote a high level of nuclear safety and radiation protection and the application of 
efficient and effective safeguards. 
312. Cooperation between the Agency and Euratom was well developed. Recent events, and the 
lessons to be learned from them, should motivate closer cooperation and the establishment of a 
common approach to nuclear safety. 
313. Further progress could still be made in nuclear safety cooperation. The Agency could play a key 
role in involving European Union neighbours, and other countries worldwide, in a global approach to 
nuclear safety. It could build on the UnionÂs safety and risk assessment process to determine specific 
global action in the light of the Fukushima accident. The AgencyÂs participation in the European 
mechanism for in-depth analysis of nuclear incidents (EU Clearinghouse) could also be increased. 
314. A general trend in favour of revising the international nuclear safety framework had lately 
emerged in various international forums. The fifth review meeting under the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety in April had shown the need to make the Convention more legally binding. At the IAEA 
Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June, the ConventionÂs Contracting Parties had been 
encouraged to initiate a review of that instrument in the light of the Fukushima accident. The 
European Commission was prepared to contribute actively to that process and welcomed in particular 
the initiatives aimed at enhancing and updating the provisions of the Convention in order to enhance 
its effectiveness, governance and enforceability. 
315. In the area of nuclear safeguards, cooperation between the Agency and the Commission was 
well developed and operating smoothly. Integrated safeguards had been fully implemented in the 
European Union since January 2010. The Commission welcomed the recent statements made by the 
Deputy Director General for Safeguards on future verification challenges, and especially the intention 
of the Agency to develop further the State-level concept by taking better account of all information 
available to the organization. The Commission was of the view that the Agency could make better use 
of Euratom inspection activities and results when devising State-level approaches. It therefore fully 
supported closer cooperation between the Agency and State and regional nuclear material and 
GC(55)/OR.4 
20 September 2011, Page 44 
accounting and control systems with the aim of achieving more effective and efficient safeguards 
worldwide. 
316. Ensuring and continuously improving nuclear safety was a joint responsibility that was in the 
interest of all countries, regardless of whether they used nuclear energy or not. Every effort must be 
made to put in place and implement the highest achievable standards at national, regional and global 
level. 
317. Mr GRANSER (Sovereign Order of Malta) expressed confidence in the Director GeneralÂs 
ability to ensure that the Agency continued to contribute to sustainable strategies that addressed the 
challenges of hunger, disease and poverty. 
318. The Sovereign Order of Malta had been founded over 950 years ago and had a unique sovereign 
status. It had diplomatic relations with 104 States, permanent observer status at the United Nations and 
affiliated organizations, and official relations with the European Union and numerous other 
international organizations, forming a unique diplomatic humanitarian network. The Order initiated 
and maintained projects designed to deliver emergency aid, health care, training and education. 
Responses to urgent needs were complemented by long-term relief programmes in the fields of 
reconstruction, health, nutrition, livelihood and disaster preparedness. 
319. Humanity was faced with critical challenges related to maintaining and enhancing its prosperity 
in the context of ever increasing demands as regards food production, health and security. The Agency 
was well placed to assist Member States in meeting such challenges, and to foster sustainable 
development. Poverty was a breeding ground for the worldÂs collective insecurity and lack of peace. 
Thus, prosperity depended on poverty alleviation. Strategic applications of nuclear technology in such 
areas as health, food crop and livestock improvement, and sanitation could contribute immensely to 
that end. 
320. The Order noted with appreciation the growing attention given to cancer therapy in developing 
countries under PACT, and it was particularly pleased that its own contribution to the expansion of 
cancer treatment services was soon to be formalized by the signing of a practical arrangement between 
it and PACT. Cooperation between the Agency and the Order would contribute greatly to saving the 
lives of people in developing countries. 
321. The worldÂs water resources were increasingly vulnerable and threatened by humanityÂs need 
for water, food, raw materials and energy. With a view to contributing to cooperation in that important 
field, the Order had sent one of its own water resource management scientists to the 2011 Scientific 
Forum. 
322. In conclusion, the Order remained committed to its mission of helping to reduce pain and 
suffering around the world in close cooperation with its partners, including the Agency.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 (continued) 
(GC(55)/2) 
1. Mr KOVÃCS (Hungary) expressed his countryÂs support for the international conference on the 
creation of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East 
to be held in 2012. He commended the Director General for convening a forum on that subject in 
November 2011, with a special focus on the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone, and looked 
forward to constructive consultations at the forum. 
2. He noted that, at the Fifth Review Meeting of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, all Hungarian 
nuclear installations had been found to be operating safely. His country called on all Member States 
that had not done so to join that Convention. As a Contracting Party to the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, Hungary was 
looking forward to a fruitful review meeting of that Convention in 2012. His country attached great 
importance to efforts to improve interaction and ensure knowledge transfer and continuity between 
review meetings. 
3. He expressed sympathy to the Japanese people following the earthquake and tsunami they had 
experienced. The subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had necessitated 
an immediate safety reassessment of European reactors. The nuclear power plant operator in Hungary 
had submitted its first progress report to the Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority and the regulatory 
body had forwarded its opinion on the current status of the targeted safety reassessment to the 
European Union. The country had already made significant efforts to reshape its emergency 
preparedness system prior to the accident by revising the organizational structure of its emergency 
responders and the relevant regulations. 
4. Hungary was in the process of organizing the second European Training Course on Nuclear 
Emergency Management with the support of the European Union. It had also successfully hosted an 
INEX-4 emergency preparedness exercise simulating the explosion of a dirty bomb in a heavy traffic 
environment. The nuclear power plant operator had made significant progress in its preparations for 
managing beyond design basis accidents, including the capability to provide external cooling of the 
reactor pressure vessel. A guide was also being drawn up in that regard. 
5. The above-surface part of the national radioactive waste repository near the village of BÃ¡taapÃ¡ti 
was complete and the first underground disposal chambers were under construction. The interim 
storage facility for spent fuel at the Paks nuclear power plant was being extended and the new modules 
would be in operation by the end of 2012. 
6. To provide a clear legal framework for the commissioning of new units and operation of the 
Paks nuclear power plant, the Hungarian Parliament had approved the modification of the Act on 
Atomic Energy, which incorporated the safety-related reference levels elaborated and issued by the 
Western European Nuclear RegulatorsÂ Association. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority had 
also revised the national nuclear safety code. 
7. The operator of the Paks nuclear power plant had submitted a plan for lifetime extension which 
had been approved by the regulatory body and was now being implemented, taking into account the 
suggestions made. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority was expected to assess the application 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 2 
and issue a licence for the extension of the service life of Unit 1 by the end of 2012, with the service 
life extension for the other three units coming in subsequent years. 
8. The invitation of Hungarian experts to participate in several Agency missions Â including an 
IRRS mission to Korea, an IPPAS mission to Cuba, a fact-finding mission to Japan and an EPREV 
mission to Latvia Â was an acknowledgement of the countryÂs nuclear expertise. Hungary had also 
hosted a QUATRO mission to the National Institute of Oncology to follow up on the findings of the 
2005 audit, and a SALTO mission to the nuclear power plant. 
9. During its presidency of the Council of the European Union in the first half of 2011, Hungary 
had initiated a joint meeting of the EU Energy Council and the European Nuclear Safety Regulators 
Group following the Fukushima accident, at which the parties had concluded that stress tests needed to 
be performed on all nuclear power reactors in the European Union. 
10. Hungary had played a leading role in formulating European Council Directive 
2011/70/EURATOM establishing a Community framework for the responsible and safe management 
of spent fuel and radioactive waste. That directive would allow EU member States to address their 
radioactive waste and spent fuel management challenges in a harmonized way and in accordance with 
Agency safety standards. 
11. In 2011, Hungary had hosted the European Safeguards Research and Development Association 
annual meeting with over 250 participants. The large number of participants showed the dedication of 
European countries to maintaining and improving the safeguards regime through research and 
development. His country continued to provide safeguards inspection training each year and supported 
Agency safeguards through development of innovative methods. 
12. Hungary attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. As the 
extraordinary three-year cycle drew to an end, it had become clear that three years was too long for 
planning technical cooperation activities in advance. In his countryÂs view, planning meetings for 
regional projects during that cycle had been a waste of resources. The new strategy for the technical 
cooperation programme in the Europe region promoted cooperation between the Secretariat and 
Member States, whereby each participant could contribute to the formulation of the programme and 
benefit from the help of the Agency and fellow Member States. He commended the Agency for having 
the courage to adopt such a new approach. Hungary attached great importance to the successful 
implementation of the Peaceful Uses Initiative and was considering taking an active part. 
13. Following the Fukushima accident, the Agency had swung into action, dispatching radiation 
protection experts to Japan, sending a fact-finding mission to the nuclear power plant, publishing the 
mission report, convening a ministerial conference in Vienna and drafting an action plan which 
reflected the most important lessons to be learned from the accident. Although the process was far 
from over, the AgencyÂs immediate response had been appropriate and the Secretariat was taking the 
right steps to enhance safety at nuclear installations. 
14. The Fukushima accident had raised widespread concerns over the use of nuclear energy for 
power generation. Several countries were phasing out their nuclear power plants, while others had 
reconsidered their plans to embark on nuclear power. Having assessed the pros and cons of using 
nuclear technology for energy production, Hungary had concluded that it could not meet its electricity 
needs without it. His country was therefore committed to extending the service life of the Paks nuclear 
power plant and would continue preparations to build new units at that site, with the professional 
support of the Agency. 
15. Mr OSMAN (Bangladesh) said that the preceding year had been a busy and successful one for 
the Agency and that the eradication of rinderpest in particular had been an historic accomplishment. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 3 
16. Bangladesh had a longstanding, firm commitment to comprehensive disarmament and the 
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the world. His country therefore 
welcomed the decision by the AgencyÂs General Conference to hold a forum in Vienna 
in November 2011 on the experience of existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and confidence-building 
measures with a view to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, and 
hoped that it would facilitate early establishment of such a zone. 
17. The accident in Fukushima, which had been triggered by forces of nature, had been 
unprecedented. He expressed profound sympathy to the people and Government of Japan and 
admiration for their resilience in overcoming that catastrophe. The accident had shown that there was 
no place for complacency when it came to nuclear safety and security. He praised the Agency for its 
timely actions and successful handling of the accident and commended the IAEA Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety for its adoption of the first ever action plan on nuclear safety, which 
would provide better guidance to further strengthen nuclear safety. He thanked the Director General 
for his personal initiatives to support the Government of Japan in response to the nuclear crisis and for 
his timely convening of the Ministerial Conference. 
18. He noted that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh, along with other Heads of State and 
Government, would be attending a meeting under United Nations auspices in New York the next day 
to discuss strengthening nuclear safety and nuclear disaster risk preparedness. His Government also 
hoped that the Nuclear Security Summit to be held in Seoul and the AgencyÂs proposed nuclear safety 
conference to be held in Japan in 2012 would further strengthen the nuclear safety and security 
regimes. 
19. Bangladesh called upon all vendor countries and the Agency to adopt special programmes for 
developing countries and especially for the least developed countries, all of which were lacking in 
energy resources and for which nuclear power might prove to be the most viable alternative. 
20. Development and energy were inseparable, since in order to eradicate poverty and hunger, 
ensure food security, energy security and environmental sustainability, fight killer diseases and, above 
all, ensure a decent quality of life for people, a reliable supply of energy was required. Energy was 
critical for human progress, and nuclear energy was recognized as the worldÂs principal source of 
non-polluting, carbon-free energy. 
21. The current global energy crisis, and particularly the dependence on fossil fuel, had already 
dealt a major blow to the development efforts of developed and developing countries alike, especially 
in countries like Bangladesh which were virtually without indigenous energy resources. The rapid 
depletion of fossil fuel resources and global warming owing to greenhouse gases had increased global 
recognition of the need for renewable and non-carbon energy, and in that regard nuclear energy took 
on particular significance. 
22. Under the Constitution of Bangladesh it was the responsibility of the State to ensure the food, 
health and energy security of its people, which was particularly difficult in a small country with an 
enormous population and no major source of energy. Nuclear power was viewed as the only 
cost-effective and environmentally friendly energy solution. Bangladesh was already benefiting from 
the use of nuclear technology in the development of saline-resistant high-yielding varieties of rice and 
other agricultural applications, and in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including cancer. 
His Government had always valued cooperation with the Agency in its research and development 
efforts. 
23. Bangladesh had made significant socio-economic progress since independence but was still 
unable to realize its full growth potential owing to inadequate infrastructure and lack of energy 
sources. The Government was pursuing a vision of a Âdigital BangladeshÂ with the aim of 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 4 
transforming Bangladesh into a knowledge-based middle-income country by 2021. To provide the 
energy required in order to achieve ÂVision 2021Â and ensure energy security it was important for the 
country to include nuclear energy in its energy mix. To that end, it was committed to continuing its 
nuclear energy programme in the post-Fukushima era and had been working on construction of the 
Rooppur nuclear power plant with the support of the Russian Federation. 
24. Construction of the Rooppur nuclear power plant had been a dream of the nationÂs founder, 
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Following his death in 1975 those plans had been abandoned, 
but the current Prime Minister had revived them and the Government was committed to building the 
plant as soon as possible. The necessary surveys and investigations had already been initiated, Agency 
support to finalize the site evaluation report was being sought and an agreement with the Russian 
Federation for construction of the project was near to being signed. His country would also seek 
Agency assistance in developing its national capability to make the necessary commercial, financial 
and technical assessments in connection with the plant. It also attached great importance to 
collaboration with the Agency in establishing a regulatory body to oversee and ensure nuclear safety 
and security in all activities related to the countryÂs nuclear power programme. 
25. Bangladesh was giving top priority to radiation protection and nuclear safety and security in 
implementing its nuclear power plant project. It was committed to strengthening the independence and 
effectiveness of national authorities responsible for regulating and overseeing the safety and physical 
protection of nuclear materials and installations, safeguards and import and export control, the State 
system of accounting for and control of nuclear material, transport and waste safety, transport of 
radioactive materials and emergency preparedness and response. 
26. Bangladesh was relying on the AgencyÂs and other internationally recognized codes, guidelines 
and standards for safety and would make them mandatory for all phases of the design, construction, 
operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plant. 
27. The Agency played a pivotal role in coordinating efforts to strengthen global nuclear safety, 
promoting a global culture of safety and providing expertise and advice. Bangladesh expected that 
enhanced international and regional cooperation would ensure the highest level of nuclear safety based 
on Agency safety requirements. 
28. With only three significant accidents in its history, nuclear power could not be characterized as 
unsafe and unreliable. Nuclear technology had served humanity faithfully from the start and would 
continue to do so. Rather than allow fear of the risks of nuclear technology to undermine its 
contributions, the world must move fearlessly forward. Immediate and proactive measures must be 
taken to address Member StatesÂ concerns regarding safety and security, which had always been 
paramount. Past nuclear accidents clearly underscored the importance of achieving universal 
adherence to and effective implementation of the relevant international instruments, and of improving 
the international legal framework for nuclear safety. 
29. His country recognized the need for a stronger system of national, regional and international 
emergency preparedness and response along with closer cooperation among national regulatory 
authorities and relevant national and international organizations. To make that possible, it was 
essential to increase information sharing, transparency and exchange of best practices among Agency 
Member States in cases of nuclear emergencies and further promote and expand the scope of the 
AgencyÂs response to such emergencies. The Agency might play a more vital role in the event of a 
nuclear emergency through establishment of an institutional structure under the IAEA domain. 
30. Bangladesh had been an active member of the RCA since its inception and viewed it as a 
powerful tool for promoting and coordinating research and development aimed at solving national 
problems utilizing the resources available within the Asia-Pacific region. It looked forward to RCAÂs 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 5 
continued contribution to the strengthening of regional capabilities and expertise in such areas as 
health, agriculture, industry, environment, research reactors, radioactive waste management and 
radiation protection. 
31. Bangladesh hoped that the outcome of the current General Conference session would help shape 
the future programmes of the Agency and of Member States so that the people of the world would be 
the ultimate beneficiaries of the peaceful use of nuclear technology. Countries like Bangladesh had 
long endured many economic hardships, but they could no longer afford to remain in energy poverty, 
since that would endanger all progress made to date towards achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals. Those who would lead their countries had to fulfil the hopes and aspirations of their peoples, 
and strong and sustained political leadership was needed in order to secure for those peoples the 
benefits of nuclear energy. 
32. Ms DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that her country had followed closely the development 
of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, with deepest sympathy for the people in 
the affected area, and had been ready to provide any assistance needed. The international community 
had been reminded, 25 years after the Chernobyl disaster, that it must never slacken its efforts to 
maintain and strengthen the global nuclear safety regime. Though different in nature, both accidents 
had clearly demonstrated the need for efficient international cooperation, effective sharing of 
information, knowledge and experience, and transparent communication among all parties concerned. 
The Fukushima accident had provided an opportunity to reinvigorate efforts to improve the 
international framework for nuclear and radiation safety and emergency preparedness and response. 
The Czech Republic was prepared to contribute to all such endeavours led by the Agency and other 
relevant international organizations. The first step should be to ensure implementation of existing 
international legal instruments and norms and effective use of the AgencyÂs nuclear safety services. A 
thorough analysis of the Fukushima accident Â including its root causes and an evaluation of 
individual failures Â was required before identifying possible gaps in the existing nuclear safety 
framework and formulating concrete and realistic measures to be taken. She noted that the AgencyÂs 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety would be updated as the accident was analysed further. The action plan 
would need the full support and cooperation of all Member States in order to succeed. 
33. The Czech Republic honoured its obligations and responsibilities associated with the use of 
nuclear power. As a contracting party to all relevant safety conventions, it was strongly committed to 
fulfilling their objectives. On 30 December 2010, it had completed its ratification process of the 
amendment to the CPPNM. 
34. All stakeholders in her country were committed to maintaining high levels of safety and making 
further improvements. To that end, the Czech Republic took advantage of Agency peer reviews for 
independent safety assessments on relevant topics and was eager to learn from the Fukushima 
accident. Efforts were also being made to assure the public that the countryÂs nuclear power plants 
were being operated in a safe and reliable manner. That included carrying out stress tests to verify the 
safety of the plants in natural events even more extreme than those considered in their original 
designs. The results of the self-assessment were being reviewed by the State Office for Nuclear Safety 
and would be published in due course. According to the preliminary findings, no risks had been 
identified that would require the adoption of immediate measures. National nuclear regulators were the 
only fully competent bodies equipped with all the information and in-depth knowledge of the 
inspected facilities necessary in order to draw conclusions as to their overall safety level. Public 
acceptance of nuclear power would be essential for the new nuclear reactors planned to be built in the 
Czech Republic, and any lessons to be learned from the Fukushima accident would receive proper 
consideration. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 6 
35. The Czech Republic had also provided almost US $2 million since 1998 to help strengthen 
nuclear safety in other countries, mainly Ukraine and Armenia. Her Government had recently 
approved an extrabudgetary contribution of approximately $150 000 to the Peaceful Uses Initiative to 
help Armenia strengthen its regulatory framework and implement recommendations from the recent 
OSART mission to the Metsamor nuclear power plant. 
36. Her countryÂs nuclear safety related assistance had been implemented through the technical 
cooperation programme and through significant voluntary contributions to support other important 
areas in which the Agency was active, such as nuclear security, radiation protection and human health. 
The technical cooperation programme was a unique platform allowing interested countries at various 
levels of development to share experience, information and scientific and technical know-how. The 
Czech Republic was a net contributor to the programme, providing financial support, sharing expertise 
and hosting Agency activities. It endorsed all efforts by the Secretariat to make the programme even 
more effective, efficient and transparent. 
37. Cognizant of the ever increasing importance of international cooperation in combating nuclear 
terrorism and the need to reinforce global nuclear security and non-proliferation, her country 
participated actively in relevant multilateral activities aimed at achieving the NPTÂs final objective of 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. 
38. The Czech Republic had hosted the international conference entitled ÂThe Prague Agenda Â 
the Way ForwardÂ in April 2011 in order to maintain the momentum of the major international nuclear 
disarmament and security events that had taken place there in 2009 and 2010. The conference had 
stimulated political and expert discussions on disarmament, arms control, non-proliferation and 
nuclear security and had enabled participants to take stock of the progress made in implementing 
President ObamaÂs Prague agenda. The Czech Republic was also involved in preparations for the 
Nuclear Security Summit to be held in Seoul in 2012. Her country fully supported activities aimed at 
enhancing export controls for nuclear material, improving the safety and security of radioactive 
sources and strengthening the relevant international mechanisms and regimes. 
39. Her country remained concerned over the serious challenges to the non-proliferation regime 
posed by Iran, the DPRK and Syria. It was not convinced that those countries were fulfilling all 
commitments and obligations regarding their nuclear programmes and it therefore called on them to 
comply with the relevant Agency and UN Security Council resolutions. The universal adoption and 
implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols was essential for 
further endeavours in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. 
40. The AgencyÂs capacity in the area of safeguards needed further strengthening. Through its 
Member State Support Programme, her country contributed to increasing the effectiveness and 
operational capability of the AgencyÂs safeguards system. The Czech Republic regularly provided 
training for new safeguards inspectors at its nuclear facilities, which it also made available for the 
testing of new Agency surveillance systems. In addition, the country offered its analytical services and 
expertise and supported other priority safeguards areas as its capacities and budgetary situation 
allowed. 
41. Mr BANERJEE (India) expressed his countryÂs condolences to the Japanese people for the twin 
natural disasters they had suffered and its appreciation of the efforts of the Japanese Government and 
people in dealing with the consequences. 
42. The IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in Vienna, following soon after the 
Ministerial Seminar on Nuclear Safety in Paris, had reiterated the consensus that nuclear safety was a 
national responsibility. The unanimous adoption of the Declaration of the Ministerial Conference had 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 7 
demonstrated the importance that Member States accorded to nuclear safety and to the role of the 
Agency in addressing that important issue. 
43. Nuclear energy remained an important element in IndiaÂs energy mix for sustaining rapid 
economic growth. The country remained firmly committed to its indigenous nuclear programme and 
was planning a major expansion of nuclear installed capacity to 20 000 MW(e) by 2020 with the aim 
of reaching about 60 000 MW(e) in the early 2030s. That accelerated additional capacity included the 
installation of large water cooled reactors under international cooperation and with full regard to 
safety, the environment and the livelihood of those living in the vicinity of the plants. 
44. Immediately after the accident at Fukushima, IndiaÂs Prime Minister had underlined that nuclear 
power plant safety was a high priority for the Government, which had taken a number of steps in that 
regard. A bill had been introduced in parliament to give the national safety regulatory authority 
statutory status. The results of the safety reviews mandated by the Government had been made public; 
several of the recommendations had already been implemented and a roadmap had been prepared for 
implementation of the rest. Further, a decision had been made to request an OSART and an IRRS 
mission. 
45. In addition, the emergency response and preparedness measures in IndiaÂs nuclear facilities had 
been strengthened. The National Disaster Management Authority had drawn up a holistic and 
integrated programme for the management of nuclear and radiological emergencies. 
46. The substantial data available from the Fukushima and Chernobyl accidents should be taken 
into account in the establishment of new guidelines for new emergency response intervention limits. 
47. As a party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and to the Assistance and Early Notification 
Conventions, India was looking forward to participating in their review to ensure effective 
implementation. 
48. Turning to recent achievements with regard to IndiaÂs nuclear power programme, he said that 
his country was a firm advocate of the adoption of a closed fuel cycle in order to extract maximum 
energy from its limited uranium resources and provide long-term energy security by utilizing its vast 
thorium resources. 
49. Domestic installed nuclear power capacity had reached 4780 MW(e). The total number of 
reactors in operation was 20, including three new 220 MW(e) PHWRs which had been recently 
connected to the grid. India ranked sixth in the world in the number of nuclear power reactors in 
operation. Indian PHWRs had a very competitive capital cost and offered a very low unit energy tariff. 
To date, the nuclear power sector had registered over 345 reactor years of safe operation. 
50. Nuclear power generation during the past year had shown an increase of about 40% compared 
with the previous year as a result of increased availability of fuel, both indigenous and imported. The 
average capacity factor for all reactors was over 80% and seven had exceeded 90%. 
51. En-masse coolant channel replacement and en-masse feeder replacement had been completed in 
Unit 2 of the Narora atomic power station and Unit 1 of the Kakrapar atomic power station. 
52. The construction work at two 1000 MW(e) light water reactors at Kudankulam being set up in 
technical cooperation with the Russian Federation was nearly complete. Unit 1 commissioning 
activities had reached an advanced stage and the hot run had been recently completed. Progress on 
Unit 2 was close behind. 
53. Construction of the 500 MW(e) prototype fast breeder reactor was also at an advanced stage. 
The reactor vault was nearing completion, with all the major reactor equipment in place. Welding of 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 8 
the reactorÂs top shield to the main vessel had commenced, as had installation of the steam generator 
and the secondary sodium pump. 
54. Four indigenously designed 700 MW(e) PHWRs had been launched, two each at the existing 
sites of Kakrapar in Gujarat and Rawatbhata in Rajasthan, thus raising the number of reactors under 
construction to seven. 
55. The fast breeder test reactor at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research had completed 
25 years of successful operation in October 2010 and the process for its life extension up to the year 
2030 was progressing well. 
56. The test fuel sub-assembly for the prototype fast breeder reactor had been irradiated in the fast 
breeder test reactor, with a peak burnup of 112 GWd/t having been achieved as against the target of 
100 GWd/t, and it was currently undergoing post-irradiation examination. A test loop called 
SADHANA had successfully demonstrated natural convection in sodium-to-air heat exchange for 
validating the prototype fast breeder reactor decay heat removal process. In the domain of fast reactor 
safety, a test facility for molten fuel-coolant interaction had been commissioned with a view to gaining 
understanding of severe accidents. 
57. Detailed engineering design had been initiated for the advanced heavy water reactor so as to 
enable the start of construction in the 2012Â2017 planning period. 
58. As a founder member of INPRO, his country was pleased with the progress made under that 
project over the past decade. 
59. With its broad experience in the entire range of nuclear power plant related activities, including 
the fuel cycle, India was in a position to export reactors, equipment, components and services. In 
particular, it possessed all the technologies and infrastructure relevant to small and medium sized 
PHWRs, which were a safe and cost-effective option for countries with small grids that were planning 
to start a nuclear power programme. India was therefore looking forward to exporting its proven small 
and medium sized reactors. 
60. His country was self-sufficient with regard to heavy water, zirconium alloy components and 
other related materials and supplies for PHWRs. The Nuclear Fuel Complex at Hyderabad 
manufactured fuel assemblies for various reactor types, such as PHWRs, boiling water reactors and 
fast breeder reactors. 
61. The recently opened uranium mine in Tumalapalle had the potential to be a major uranium 
resource, with reserves currently assessed at over 60 000 t. An indigenously developed alkali leaching 
process had been adopted for processing uranium ore from that mine. 
62. The new reprocessing plant inaugurated at Tarapur had been working satisfactorily to its design 
capacity. 
63. A high-flux research reactor planned for the new Bhabha Atomic Research Centre campus at 
Visakhapatnam was designed primarily to meet the large demand for high specific activity 
radioisotopes and to provide enhanced facilities for materials testing under controlled conditions. 
64. India attached equal importance to non-power applications of nuclear energy, particularly in the 
areas of health care, agriculture, hygienization of municipal waste and water desalination. The nuclear 
desalination plant at Kalpakkam, which employed the hybrid technology of multistage flash 
evaporation and reverse osmosis, had a capacity of 6.3 ML per day, making it the largest desalination 
unit in the world. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 9 
65. The use of isotope hydrology to understand better the impact of climate change on water 
resources was expanding. India had participated in an Agency coordinated research project on 
designing a global network of isotope monitoring in large rivers. His country was especially pleased 
that the theme of the Scientific Forum during the present Conference was the application of nuclear 
techniques to water. 
66. Indian health authorities attached particular significance to combating cancer. A national cancer 
network initiative had been launched and several cancer care institutes had been expanding their 
facilities and treatment capabilities. For example, the Tata Memorial Centre, which provided services 
to nearly 500 000 patients each year, had a new block equipped with sophisticated facilities. An 
international peer review conducted in October 2010 had rated the CentreÂs services at par with global 
standards. 
67. The AgencyÂs Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT), of which India was an active 
supporter, enabled the channelling of resources and expertise to developing countries. The Bhabhatron 
teletherapy machine donated to Sri Lanka under PACT the previous year was expected to be 
commissioned shortly, and arrangements were being made to provide the next machine to Namibia. 
68. A new facility for the production of technetium-99m generators had been set up at the 
laboratories of the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology in Navi Mumbai. To further enhance 
its self-reliance, India intended to set up a new facility for the production of fission molybdenum-99 in 
Trombay. 
69. His country was interested in electron accelerator based applications and was developing 
competencies and building facilities to address several aspects of accelerator technologies. 
70. IndiaÂs nuclear programme attached great importance to research and development. Recent 
achievements included a review of the design of its advanced heavy water reactor in terms of its 
robustness against earthquakes, flooding and extended station blackout. 
71. Important work was also being done in assessing the behaviour of containment under beyond 
design basis accident conditions using a scale model of the primary containment of the 540 MW(e) 
PHWR. The results would be analysed in a round robin exercise involving 15 participants from 
various countries. 
72. Under the Indian Environmental Radiation Monitoring Network, more than 100 solar powered 
environmental radiation monitors had been deployed at various locations throughout the country, 
including nuclear power plants and uranium mining sites and major cities. 
73. A Global Centre for Nuclear Energy Partnership was being set up near New Delhi to pursue 
studies in advanced nuclear energy systems, nuclear security, radiological safety and applications of 
radioisotopes and radiation technologies. Memoranda of understanding had already been signed with 
the United States of America and the Russian Federation, and one would soon be signed with the 
Agency. France had also expressed interest. To mark the launch of the Centre, a regional nuclear 
security training course on physical protection of nuclear facilities against sabotage, assessing 
vulnerabilities and identifying vital areas, was scheduled to be held in New Delhi in November 2011. 
74. The importance of nuclear power as a safe, clean and viable way to meet energy needs and 
adequately address concerns about global warming and climate change could not be overstated, 
particularly for developing countries and emerging economies. As regards safety, the world had 
logged over 14 000 reactor years of power generation, in about 30 countries, with far fewer casualties 
than any other energy generating technology over a sustained period. That was testimony in itself. 
Nuclear technology must be pursued further as an important part of a sustainable energy solution for 
the future.

75. Mr BOURROUET VARGAS (Costa Rica) said that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi 
nuclear power plant had had a significant impact on the AgencyÂs work and priorities. He commended 
the prompt and expert way in which the Secretariat and the Director General had responded to the 
challenges the accident had posed. He highlighted in particular the convening of the IAEA Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in June and the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which had been 
approved by the Board of Governors the previous week and was now before the General Conference 
for its endorsement. 
76. The Fukushima accident had demonstrated once again the transboundary and global nature of 
such events. Costa Rica strongly supported the action plan and urged all Member States to ensure that 
the voluntary measures it contained were implemented. In view of its unique mandate and capabilities, 
the Agency should continue at the forefront of efforts to improve nuclear safety worldwide. 
77. Regarding the Programme and Budget for 2012Â2013, it was essential that the Agency have the 
financial resources it needed in order to fulfil all its statutory obligations. Moreover, there should be a 
proper balance in the appropriation of those resources amongst the three pillars of the AgencyÂs 
activities. Although some progress had been made in correcting the existing imbalances, more work 
needed to be done. 
78. Costa Rica was pleased that agreement had been reached on the TCF targets for 2012 and 2013. 
It was vital, however, that the FundÂs resources be assured, sufficient and predictable so that the 
technical cooperation programme could be implemented effectively. 
79. His Government hoped that the recommendation of the Co-Chairs of the Open-ended Working 
Group on TCF targets would be carried out, namely that one working group be launched in 2013 to 
deal with both the level of the Regular Budget and the TCF targets for 2014 and 2015, in light of the 
synchronization of the regular programme and budget and TCF cycles. 
80. Costa Rica attached high priority to the AgencyÂs activities related to technical cooperation and 
the transfer of knowledge and technology to enlarge and accelerate the contribution of atomic energy 
to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. It therefore welcomed the efforts to make the 
technical cooperation programme more efficient so that it had a greater impact on social, economic 
and technological development. 
81. In 2010, the technical cooperation programme had assisted 129 countries using a total of 
$127.7 million, in addition to which extrabudgetary contributions had been provided. He welcomed 
the fact that the Peaceful Uses Initiative, launched the previous year by the United States of America, 
had already attracted some $20 million of the $100 million planned by 2015. 
82. Costa Rica cooperated with the Agency on national projects in the areas of integrated water 
management, the development of industrial applications, improving regulatory infrastructure, 
strengthening radiation safety, waste management and the security of radioactive sources. It was 
elaborating a new Country Programme Framework and, in addition, a new United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework, which would take into account relevant information in 
connection with the activities it carried out with the AgencyÂs support. 
83. Costa Rica had been honoured to serve as a panel member at the 2011 Scientific Forum on the 
highly relevant topic of water. In that context, the launching of the IAEA water availability 
enhancement initiative was an important milestone in the AgencyÂs activities in the field of isotope 
hydrology. Costa Rica had been participating in that initiative as a pilot country together with the 
Philippines and Oman and hoped that eventually all interested States could be included. 
84. He underlined the historical importance of the global eradication of rinderpest achieved jointly 
by the Agency, FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health. He also drew attention to the 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 11 
excellent work done by the IAEA Environment Laboratories in Monaco, which were celebrating their 
50th anniversary. 
85. Costa Rica stressed the importance of ARCAL as an ideal vehicle for cooperation between the 
Agency and Latin America and the Caribbean. His country was grateful for the continuing support of 
the Department of Technical Cooperation as well as the resource contributions from other countries 
and organizations in that regard. 
86. An ARCAL priority should be the establishment of stronger links with other regional 
agreements with a view to exchanging experience and improving project results. An example of such 
interregional cooperation was the project approved by the Board of Governors in June 2011 in support 
of a marine benchmark study on the possible impact of the Fukushima radioactive releases in the 
Asia-Pacific region. The methods developed and results obtained in that project, which was to be 
carried out under the RCA using extrabudgetary funding, could be extended to all countries of the 
Pacific, including many members of ARCAL. 
87. Earlier in the year, Costa Rica had ratified an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement 
with the Agency in connection with the Tlatelolco Treaty; it had entered into force in June. The 
country attached great importance to the activities carried out by the Agency in relation to nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament under the NPT and called on all countries that did not yet have an 
additional protocol in force to take the necessary steps to that end. 
88. Welcoming the fact that conditions had been conducive to the Director GeneralÂs convening, in 
November, a forum on experience of possible relevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone 
in the Middle East, he said that Cost Rica would participate actively in that forum on the basis of its 
experience as a party to the Tlatelolco Treaty and also in its capacity as coordinator in Vienna for 
matters related to OPANAL. His delegation hoped that all the countries of the Middle East would take 
part in that meeting in an open and constructive manner so that it could prove a useful building block 
in the process of achieving a comprehensive and durable peace in the region without the threat of 
nuclear weapons. 
Mr Berdennikov (Russian Federation), Vice-President, took the Chair. 
89. Mr PUJA (Indonesia) said that the Conference was taking place at a time when it was vital to 
maintain the positive momentum achieved in the area of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, 
and the Agency should seize that opportunity. The entry into force of the New START was a 
heartening development and his country hoped that the Russian Federation and the United States 
would build on that achievement and continue to work toward further arms reductions and, ultimately, 
the elimination of their nuclear arsenals. The Treaty should have a strong verification regime. 
90. Indonesia hoped that that positive trend would be reflected in the positions of the 
nuclear-weapon States on nuclear-weapon-free zones, including the Southeast Asia Nuclear 
Weapon-Free Zone. Pursuant to a decision by ASEAN Foreign Ministers in Bali in July 2011, after a 
10-year impasse, direct consultations between ASEAN and the nuclear-weapon States had been 
resumed in Geneva the preceding month and follow-up was scheduled for the coming month in New 
York. Many hoped they would be the last direct consultations. The aim was to resolve outstanding 
issues on a number of the provisions of the Protocol to the Bangkok Treaty with a view to ensuring 
early accession of the nuclear-weapon States to it. As the current chair of ASEAN, his country was 
convinced that it was in the shared interest of ASEAN and all the nuclear-weapon States to ensure, by 
the end of the year, that those consultations yielded a satisfactory outcome which accommodated 
equitably the legitimate concerns of all parties. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 12 
91. In the Middle East, Indonesia supported a comprehensive and balanced approach to resolving 
the issue of non-proliferation. Hence, it supported the conclusions and recommendations for further 
action of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, including the convening in 2012 of a conference on the 
establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass 
destruction on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at by the States in the region and with the full 
support of the nuclear-weapon States. It also supported the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a 
forum on that issue in November 2011 and stood ready to participate constructively in that process. 
92. ASEAN Foreign Ministers had stated their view that the prolonged crisis on the Korean 
Peninsula would have a negative impact on security and stability in the region. That crisis should be 
resolved through the six-party talks, and ASEAN stood ready to contribute to that resumption. 
ASEAN was committed to supporting the creation of a conducive environment on the Korean 
Peninsula through the ASEAN Regional Forum, in which all countries involved in the six-party talks 
participated. Building confidence and mutual trust among the parties concerned should continue to be 
the priority in resolving the DPRK issue. 
93. His country looked forward to the Director GeneralÂs planned visit to Jakarta to advance 
cooperation between Indonesia and the Agency. As a country that had benefited from widespread 
application of nuclear techniques in the water sector, Indonesia supported the Director GeneralÂs 
decision to prioritize that issue in the current year. Isotopic tracer technology had been used widely in 
Indonesian universities, the countryÂs Geological Agency, drinking water industries and geothermal 
exploration. In the latter field, isotopic tracers had been used to determine recharge areas and the 
origin of geothermal fluids. In the field of water management, isotope technology had been widely 
applied to resolve recharge area and groundwater dating problems. Thus, isotope hydrology had 
helped mitigate water shortage in areas where there were problems with water cleanliness. 
94. Indonesia appreciated the visit of the Deputy Director General for Technical Cooperation and 
the Deputy Director General for Nuclear Sciences and Applications, during which they had had an 
opportunity to visit facilities and witness the application of nuclear science and technology in various 
areas developed through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, the RCA and other regional 
programmes. 
95. There was a need for continued support for the AgencyÂs resources for technical cooperation. 
Indonesia had pledged to pay its share of the TCF target for 2012, which amounted to $180 000. The 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was the main vehicle whereby the Agency fulfilled its 
mandate to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, especially in developing regions of the 
world. 
96. At the meetings of the Board of Governors in June, the Director General had indicated that the 
IAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative was playing an important role in helping the Agency offset the lack of 
sufficient financial resources to fulfil its mandate. Indonesia commended those countries that had 
contributed to the Initiative and encouraged all others in a position to do so to follow suit so that the 
target of $100 million by 2015 could be attained. The Agency should continue to use those resources 
to finance footnote-a/ projects in line with established technical cooperation criteria and procedures. 
97. During the current year, his country had made progress in the management of radioactive waste 
and spent fuel. It had submitted its instrument of ratification for the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management on 1 April 2011. 
98. With respect to nuclear power, Indonesia had started putting human resources and basic 
infrastructure in place in the 1960s but had not been able to bring its plans to fruition, mainly as a 
result of the public acceptance issue. Taking due account of the renewed awareness of the importance 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 13 
of nuclear power plant safety in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident, his country would continue 
to prepare itself for the introduction of nuclear power as mandated by presidential decree. 
99. INPRO was an important forum for the exchange of information and experience in the nuclear 
power field. Indonesia was planning a Nuclear Energy System Assessment using the INPRO 
methodology. In previous years, it had supported INPRO by providing one cost-free expert each year; 
since 2011, it had been providing two. 
100. He expressed his countryÂs sympathy to the people and Government of Japan in connection with 
the unfortunate events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011, and admiration 
and respect for the tremendous courage and resilience shown by the Japanese emergency team in 
getting the facility back under control. Apart from the rescue workers and medical assistance and 
supplies his country had sent in the early days of the accident, the Indonesian Nuclear Energy 
Regulatory Agency had offered to dispatch its nuclear emergency response team to Fukushima. As the 
chair of ASEAN, Indonesia had also initiated a special Japan-ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting in 
April to promote further cooperation in disaster management. In May, one of its radiological 
protection and emergency response experts had joined the Agency-led international fact-finding 
mission to Fukushima. 
101. It was crucial to address nuclear safety in order to restore public confidence. Expectations of the 
Agency following the accident were high. Advantage should be taken of the current momentum to 
embark on a global rethink of nuclear safety. In that connection, his country supported the 
endorsement by the General Conference of the outcomes of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety and the follow-up thereto, including the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
102. The role of the RCA in promoting the use of nuclear technology for socio-economic 
development in Asia and the Pacific could not be overlooked. In the almost 40 years the RCA had 
existed, the participating countries and the Agency had accumulated valuable experience in 
cooperation and the coordination of nuclear-related development activities in the region and Indonesia 
was determined to continue its active participation in that process. As the current chair of the RCA, in 
April 2011 Indonesia had hosted the 33rd meeting of national RCA representatives in Bali, which had 
been attended by around 60 representatives. 
103. Indonesia continued to support international cooperation in nuclear security. The Agency, which 
played a central role in that area, should continue to foster coordination and exchange of information 
with other relevant organizations and nuclear security-related initiatives in order to prevent duplication 
of effort. It should also establish a mechanism that would allow all Member States to be involved in 
the development of Nuclear Security Series documents. His country had co-hosted with the Agency a 
high-level regional workshop on the international legal framework for nuclear security in July 2011 
which had been attended by representatives of ASEAN member countries. That event had raised 
awareness of the importance of strong and effective measures to enhance nuclear security. Indonesia 
noted the value of model legislation or implementation kits for nuclear security that could be used to 
transpose certain provisions into national legislation. It also emphasized the importance of updating 
the AgencyÂs Handbook on Nuclear Law: Implementing Legislation. 
104. In conclusion, his countryÂs commitment to safeguards implementation remained strong and it 
was taking part in the efforts in the Asia-Pacific region to improve safeguards collaboration by 
launching the Asia-Pacific Safeguards Network. 
105. Mr PETERSEN (Norway) said that the nuclear accident at Fukushima had once again 
demonstrated the uncertainties and risks involved in the development of nuclear energy. Above all, it 
drove home once again the fundamental lesson that even the improbable did sometimes happen and it 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 14 
was thus necessary to be prepared for the unthinkable. Furthermore, the risk of accidents might grow 
given the likely increase in the use of nuclear energy worldwide. 
106. Nuclear safety was a national responsibility but, as the Fukushima accident had shown, nuclear 
accidents would never be only a national concern, and they could only be dealt with through 
international cooperation. Both the Agency and its Member States had a critical role to play in 
reducing the risk of future accidents to a minimum. Sharing of information between nations, both 
directly and through the Agency, and the provision of accurate, timely and relevant information to the 
public were crucial. His country welcomed the plans to develop the AgencyÂs analytical capabilities in 
that regard. 
107. Fukushima had also demonstrated the need to improve not only nuclear safety but also 
emergency preparedness and response. Both the AgencyÂs capabilities and national capabilities in that 
area needed to be developed, and in particular cooperation between the Agency and countries in order 
to ensure efficiency. The Agency had a key role to play in that regard, both in its own right as the 
prime multilateral forum in that field and as a facilitator of increased international cooperation. 
108. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety was a step in the right direction. The plan outlined 
welcome measures to improve both nuclear safety and emergency preparedness and response, and he 
commended the Secretariat and Member States for their comprehensive and excellent work in that 
regard. Norway also welcomed the high-level meeting on nuclear safety and security which was being 
held in New York in the current week and looked forward to its conclusions. The challenge now was 
to ensure proper and timely implementation of the action plan, and of the recommendations in the 
International Action Plan for Strengthening the International Preparedness and Response System for 
Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies. The Agency must have sufficient resources to perform those 
tasks. 
109. The Agency must be equipped to take on both current and future challenges. Funding for 
statutory activities was still inadequate. His country had consistently argued that the AgencyÂs Regular 
Budget must increase in proportion to its tasks in order to ensure a sustainable effort in the nuclear 
safety field. Norway had allocated Â2.5 million over four years to support the organizationÂs work to 
strengthen safety capacity in developing countries, and had provided extrabudgetary funding for 
programmes on safe nuclear energy for Romania and Bulgaria. Those programmes were now in the 
final phase and Norway hoped that the results would be transferable to Member States that were 
upgrading their nuclear safety competencies and capacities. 
110. Terrorism, like nuclear accidents, did not halt at national borders. Though the commitment to 
nuclear security had been confirmed at the highest political level, progress with respect to adherence to 
the important 2005 amendment to the CPPNM was slow. His country called on all States to sign and 
ratify the global conventions on nuclear safety and security and to cooperate with the Agency in their 
implementation. It also fully supported the follow-up to the Nuclear Security Summit held in 
Washington in 2010 and was contributing actively itself in such areas as minimization of the use of 
HEU in the civilian sector. It was currently planning a follow-up to the 2005 international symposium 
held on that topic in Oslo. 
111. Interest in nuclear energy was increasing and it was his GovernmentÂs priority to ensure that the 
decision to use nuclear energy went hand in hand with the highest levels of nuclear safety and security. 
Norway had pledged approximately $3.7 million over four years to strengthen the AgencyÂs nuclear 
security assistance to developing countries. It also contributed financially to the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism and to efforts to ensure the full implementation of United Nations Security 
Council resolution 1540 (2004). 
GC(55)/OR.5

112. Nuclear safety and nuclear security could not be dealt with in isolation from non-proliferation 
and disarmament. It was essential that those issues be addressed in a coordinated manner to minimize 
the various inherent risks of nuclear power. A world without nuclear weapons could only be achieved 
through a strong and universal NPT and a strong Agency with an effective safeguards system. He 
urged all States to join the NPT, to sign and adhere to safeguards agreements and to work towards the 
objective of a world free of nuclear weapons. Norway viewed a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
in combination with an additional protocol as the current verification standard. It called on all States 
that had not yet done so to sign and ratify an additional protocol without delay. Only with the help of 
that instrument could the Agency provide comprehensive assurances, without which non-proliferation 
and security were challenged. 
113. Regarding the DPRK, Norway remained deeply concerned at that countryÂs continued lack of 
cooperation with the Agency and the international community. The DPRK must refrain from any 
further provocations, comply with all relevant Security Council resolutions and return to the six-party 
talks immediately without preconditions. His country urged the DPRK to abandon and dismantle 
completely any nuclear weapons-related programme in a prompt, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
114. There were still outstanding questions in relation to the nuclear programme of Iran and the 
potential military dimensions thereof. His country called on Iran to engage with the Agency to resolve 
those issues. Nobody was questioning IranÂs right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, but that right 
came with responsibilities and Iran must adhere to its international commitments. 
115. In his report to the Board of Governors in June (GOV/2011/30), the Director General had 
concluded that the building destroyed at the Dair Alzour site had been a nuclear reactor and should 
have been declared to the Agency. While Norway welcomed the recent letter in which Syria indicated 
its willingness to cooperate with the Agency in relation to the Dair Alzour site, it found it regrettable 
that that offer was so late in coming and called upon Syria to extend its full cooperation to the Agency 
and resolve any remaining questions regarding its nuclear programme without further delay. 
116. Norway had been strongly supporting multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and the 
establishment of the AgencyÂs LEU bank. It remained firmly convinced that the fuel bank would 
constitute an important step towards the development of a new, equitable and sustainable international 
nuclear fuel cycle regime which was fully in line with the right of countries to the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, and was beneficial to energy security without distorting the existing fuel market, while 
at the same time furthering the goals of non-proliferation and a world free of nuclear weapons. 
117. Peaceful uses of nuclear energy went far beyond the production of electricity. Safe water 
supplies, better crops, nuclear diagnostics and medicine, energy planning and pest control were just a 
few of the areas in which the Agency provided assistance. His country supported the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, paid its full share of the funding for it and was glad to host 
scientific visits by experts from other countries to Norway. He emphasized that the Agency could only 
contribute positively to meeting the Millennium Development Goals in close partnership with other 
United Nations organizations. 
118. His own countryÂs position on nuclear energy was well known. It fully supported Article IV of 
the NPT and respected every nationÂs sovereign right to choose its own energy mix, provided that the 
highest levels of safety and security were maintained. The Agency should be ready to assist in the 
overall assessment of the options of Member States requesting assistance with energy planning. 
Nuclear energy might not necessarily be the answer and a number of countries, including his own, had 
chosen not to include it in their energy mix.

119. Norway welcomed the convening of an IAEA forum later in the year in which participants from 
the Middle East and other interested parties could learn from the experience of nuclear-weapon-free 
zones established in other regions. 
120. The nuclear challenges of the coming decades were perhaps more daunting than any yet and all 
of them Â from managing a global nuclear renaissance to preventing nuclear terrorism Â required 
both sustained international cooperation and a highly professional and efficient Agency. Norway was 
committed to supporting both. 
121. Ms BUJÃN FREIRE (Spain), having offered condolences to the Government and people of 
Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and accident at Fukushima, said that her country had just 
awarded the 2011 Prince of Asturias Award for Concord to the valiant and self-sacrificing Tokyo 
Electric Power Company (TEPCO) workers known as the Âheroes of FukushimaÂ. 
122. Spain supported implementation of the action plan adopted by the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference, which included 64 concrete steps for the total elimination of nuclear weapons and also the 
convening of a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East free of nuclear weapons and 
all other weapons of mass destruction. Spain hoped that the conference would be the first step in the 
process of building confidence in the Middle East. 
123. In that context, it welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts to convene a forum on 21 and 
22 November to discuss experience relevant to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East, in the hope that it would contribute to a climate of confidence and transparency in 
preparation for the 2012 conference. 
124. Universalization of the NPT, safeguards agreements and the additional protocol thereto was 
essential in order to maintain confidence in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Spain was pleased that 
110 countries had now ratified an additional protocol and appealed to all other countries which had not 
yet done so to conclude an additional protocol as soon as possible. Similarly, Spain called on the 
15 States party to the NPT which did not have a comprehensive safeguards agreements yet in force to 
remedy that situation swiftly. 
125. Spain appreciated the fact that the Agency was already applying integrated safeguards in almost 
50 States, enabling more efficient use of human and financial resources. Like 20 other Member States, 
Spain had approved a Member State Support Programme for safeguards to help strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime. 
126. Having underscored the impartial, objective and authoritative way in which the Director 
General and the Secretariat performed the AgencyÂs verification mandate, she expressed her 
GovernmentÂs support for Agency efforts with regard to the nuclear programme of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Spain regretted IranÂs lack of cooperation and transparency which was preventing 
the Agency from fulfilling its verification mandate. Spain also regretted the most recent actions of the 
Iranian authorities to triple the production of 20% enriched uranium and transfer its production to 
Fordow, actions which undermined the international communityÂs confidence in the exclusively civil 
and peaceful nature of the programme. Spain was particularly concerned about the possible military 
dimension of the Iranian nuclear programme and IranÂs continued lack of cooperation in that regard, as 
reported by the Director General. Spain urged the Secretariat to submit to the Board of Governors a 
comprehensive and conclusive report on the real scope of IranÂs nuclear programme so that progress 
could be made toward finding a diplomatic solution to the matter. Spain called on Iran once again to 
comply with all its obligations deriving from Security Council and Board of Governors resolutions, 
including the suspension of uranium enrichment. Iran should comply with its safeguards agreement 
with the Agency and all its subsidiary agreements without exception and it should ratify and comply 
with the additional protocol. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 17 
127. On the issue of the DPRK, Spain urged that country to return to the six-party talks, observe the 
relevant Security Council resolutions and return to the NPT, thus enabling the return of Agency 
inspectors. The DPRK should abstain from any actions that would increase tension in the region. 
128. Spain was concerned that the Director General had concluded in June that the Dair Alzour 
facility was most probably a nuclear reactor and that Syria should have declared it in accordance with 
its safeguards obligations. Spain reiterated its call on Syria to solve the problem of its non-compliance. 
It should also cooperate with the Agency to clarify all outstanding questions and sign and ratify an 
additional protocol without delay. 
129. Bearing in mind that the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, as 
well as the subsequent attacks in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005 and elsewhere, had brought about a 
radical change in perceptions about the risk of nuclear terrorism, Spain supported the resolve of the 
first Nuclear Security Summit, held in Washington in April 2010, to strengthen nuclear security, and it 
reaffirmed the central role of the Agency in that endeavour. Spain would maintain that position at the 
Nuclear Security Summit to be held in Seoul in March 2012. 
130. The Agency was uniquely equipped in terms of technical and human capabilities to address the 
new nuclear threats by, for example, preparing action plans for protection against, prevention of and 
response to nuclear terrorism, developing reference guides, standards, methodologies and techniques 
for strengthening nuclear installation security, or by providing technical assistance to States. In 
addition, it could coordinate both international activities in that sphere and the efforts made by States, 
either unilaterally or in the framework of multilateral initiatives such as the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism. 
131. In SpainÂs view there was a need for in-depth consideration of the increasing synergy and 
complementarity of nuclear installation safety and security when dealing with all types of threat, 
whether natural in origin or resulting from criminal acts. 
132. The nuclear accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant would determine much of the work 
done by States and the Agency in the years to come. Review and strengthening of the entire nuclear 
safety regime would be based on the lessons learned from that accident. From the point of view of 
accident prevention and management, the Fukushima accident had demonstrated the need for 
international harmonization of the safety criteria established in national legislation on the basis of 
Agency standards. 
133. In addition, there was a need to further improve the international mechanisms for 
communication and cooperation, develop tools for promoting the exchange of information among 
regulatory bodies and ensure transparent public information in the event of emergencies. 
134. The AgencyÂs regulatory review missions were extremely important in order to attain levels of 
excellence in that regard. Through its regulatory body, the Nuclear Safety Council, Spain had a history 
of cooperation with the Agency in relation to such missions to other countries. 
135. In 2008, Spain had received an IRRS mission. At the beginning of 2011, it had hosted a 
follow-up mission, the results of which had demonstrated the good progress made in that regard. 
136. It was important for all countries using nuclear technology not only to have internationally 
recognized standards, but also to ensure their rigorous and effective application. Improvements needed 
to be made to those standards in light of the Fukushima accident, for which the extraordinary meeting 
of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in August 2012 presented an ideal 
opportunity. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 18 
137. Spain held in high regard all the efforts that the Agency, under the Director GeneralÂs 
leadership, had made in recent months, particularly through the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety, held in June 2011, where Member States had endorsed a Ministerial Declaration encompassing 
many of the measures that her country considered to be fundamental. Adoption of the IAEA Action 
Plan on Nuclear Safety had been another positive step. It was crucial that the Member States felt a 
sense of urgency about putting those measures into practice. 
138. Spain had adopted various measures at the national level since the Fukushima accident. As a 
first response, it had performed immediate verifications of its nuclear plants to ensure that all the 
safety provisions for preventing and mitigating accidents were fully operational. After that, the nuclear 
power plant owners, under the supervision of the Nuclear Safety Council, had reassessed their 
installationsÂ safety margins as part of the EU stress tests. The Council had already submitted its 
preliminary report on the results of that analysis and was expected to approve the final report for 
submission by the end of the year. 
139. The European Nuclear Safety Regulators GroupÂs First Regulatory Conference on Nuclear 
Safety in Europe, held in June 2011 and presided over by the Chairperson of SpainÂs Nuclear Safety 
Council, had confirmed the shared European vision. 
140. No review of SpainÂs activities in the field of nuclear safety and radiation protection would be 
complete without mentioning its participation in the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and 
Nuclear Regulatory Agencies, the aim of which was to promote high levels of safety in all practices 
using radioactive or nuclear material in the Ibero-American region. The Forum was an excellent 
example of sustainable and self-financing regional cooperation in close collaboration with the Agency. 
Its wide-ranging technical programme included peer-reviewed safety assessment of nuclear power 
plants. 
141. Other technical cooperation activities with the Agency included those under ARCAL, and she 
noted in particular the start of preparations for the next Regional Strategic Profile, given that the 
current one ran until 2013. 
142. Finally, she reiterated SpainÂs firm support for the Director General and wished him every 
success in the performance of his functions. 
143. Mr BARRETT (Canada) said that the world had witnessed with deep concern the human 
tragedy unfolding in Japan following the Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Canada, along 
with many countries, had offered humanitarian and technical assistance to the Japanese Government 
and to the people in the communities most devastated by the tsunami. The impact, in Japan and other 
parts of the world, of the most severe nuclear safety crisis since Chernobyl was as yet unknown. 
144. Like other Member States with nuclear power plants, Canada had taken swift action on a 
national basis to address and strengthen public confidence in the safety of those installations. It had 
also turned to the Agency, as the primary international organization in matters relating to the safe and 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, to take the lead in raising safety standards, reviewing the safety of 
nuclear facilities worldwide and enhancing international cooperation towards the shared goal of the 
safe and secure use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. 
145. It was CanadaÂs view that, in spite of the Fukushima tragedy, nuclear power would continue to 
play a vital role in supplying the worldÂs energy and therefore the importance of the Agency would 
only grow. Sovereign States bore the responsibility not only for ensuring the safety of their nuclear 
facilities, but also for assuring their neighbours and the international community that their use of 
nuclear energy was safe, since the consequences of nuclear accidents, should they occur, did not 
respect State boundaries. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 19 
146. For that reason, Canada had worked hard to ensure that the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety, adopted the previous week by the Board of Governors, set the highest possible safety 
standards, provided for best practices and peer reviews to assist countries in meeting those standards 
and built public confidence, at home and abroad, in the activities of national regulators and nuclear 
power plant operators in the area of nuclear safety. When it came to protecting human health and the 
environment, national and collective responsibility must go hand in hand. The action plan was 
therefore a living document which must be continuously reviewed and updated. 
147. He stressed that adoption of that action plan was not an end in itself, but must be followed by 
robust, effective and transparent implementation. To that end, as a small but important first step in 
bringing transparency to peer review, Canada recommended the publication of a list of all countries 
that had hosted IRRS missions and/or were planning one in the near future. 
148. For its part, Canada was leading by example. In the aftermath of the Fukushima accident, it had 
performed stress tests and reviewed the safe operation of its CANDU reactors. In addition, it strongly 
advocated the use of IRRS missions as a means of continuously strengthening its safety efforts. The 
first such mission to Canada had taken place in 2009, and the results had been published on the 
website of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. While revealing that Canada had a strong and 
mature regulatory system, the review had identified opportunities for improvement. Those 
improvements had been made and there would soon be an IRRS follow-up mission. That mission 
would be a milestone for the Agency, as it would be the first having a module focused specifically on 
reviewing response to the Fukushima accident. 
149. Canada would have an excellent opportunity to further address lessons learned from Fukushima 
when it hosted the IAEA Conference on Effective Nuclear Regulatory Systems in 2013. 
150. In the post-Fukushima world, it was necessary for all to work diligently to really learn the 
lessons and not just pay lip service to them. A global nuclear framework that would restore and 
strengthen confidence in the safe use of nuclear energy worldwide was within everybodyÂs grasp. 
151. Turning to the subject of nuclear non-proliferation, he said that no one should be fooled by 
IranÂs claims that it was a law-abiding member of the international community in the matter of its 
nuclear programme. Iran was wilfully ignoring the unambiguous legal requirements placed on it by the 
Security Council and by the Board of Governors in connection with its nuclear activities. Iran refused 
to cooperate and engage with the Agency in addressing the issues of concern surrounding its nuclear 
ambitions, announcements and activities. That failure to cooperate fully after so many years of 
repeated insistence by the Agency undermined IranÂs claims that its nuclear programme was peaceful. 
Canada called on Iran to cease its campaign of concealment and obfuscation, and instead pursue a path 
of cooperation with the Agency in order to create international confidence that it was complying with 
its NPT commitments. 
152. In June 2011, the Board of Governors had voted in favour of reporting Syria to the Security 
Council over the clandestine construction of a nuclear reactor at Dair Alzour. Despite having had 
ample opportunity to cooperate effectively with the Agency in disproving that conclusion, Syria had 
refused to do so. Canada would deeply regret SyriaÂs pursuing the same path of intransigence as Iran. 
153. Canada had voiced serious concerns about the DPRKÂs uranium enrichment programme and 
light water reactor construction activities, which were in violation of Security Council resolutions and 
the DPRKÂs commitments under the 2005 Joint Statement. Canada reaffirmed that the DPRK did not 
have Â and could not have Â the status of a nuclear-weapon State under the NPT. 
154. One of the fundamental ways in which the Agency contributed to international security was 
through its application of safeguards in verifying the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Canada was 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 20 
pleased to note that the majority of States with safeguards agreements in force had comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and an additional protocol thereto. It believed strongly that that was the current 
verification standard and encouraged all Member States that had not yet done so to adopt that 
standard. 
155. Canada strongly supported the views of the Deputy Director General for Safeguards on the need 
to move towards a State-specific, information-driven safeguards system which would also optimize 
the use of the AgencyÂs human and financial resources. 
156. Canada would continue to support the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and saluted 
its efforts in that regard. It encouraged Member States to pay their share of the technical cooperation 
target and their Regular Budget contributions in full and on time. In addition, Canada supported 
zero-real-growth budgeting. 
157. His country recognized the important role played by the Agency in relation to nuclear security. 
Since 2004, it had contributed more than $12 million to the Nuclear Security Fund. Canada intended to 
implement the commitments made at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit in Washington and was 
looking forward to the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul as an important opportunity for further 
cooperation in such key areas as physical protection, the prevention of illicit trafficking and the 
securing of radioactive sources. 
158. Under its domestic nuclear power programme, Canada was contemplating the construction of 
two new nuclear reactors at the Darlington site in the Province of Ontario. Seventeen days of public 
hearings on that proposal had been held in March and April 2011. In August, the Governmentappointed 
panel had determined that the proposal was not likely to cause significant adverse 
environmental effects and had therefore recommended approval of the new nuclear power plants. 
159. In closing, he commended the Director GeneralÂs leadership and dedication to the AgencyÂs 
mission of promoting the safe and secure use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. 
160. Mr DIÃZ (Mexico) said that the tragic events at Fukushima had raised questions about the 
future of nuclear energy, with several countries announcing that they would abandon or delay their 
nuclear power generation plans. The lessons learned from the accident should lead to improvements in 
the safety of nuclear installations. 
161. Mexico would collaborate with the Agency and the international community to prevent further 
nuclear accidents, analyse safety improvements and help strengthen the international system for 
response to nuclear emergencies. The design bases for mitigating potential natural phenomena related 
hazards for each countryÂs specific situation should be examined. 
162. All countries with nuclear power plants had a responsibility to their own people and to the 
international community to ensure high levels of operational safety. Mexico supported the promotion 
and maintenance of a robust nuclear safety culture, including the sharing of best practices and the 
development of national capacities through international cooperation, an area in which the Agency had 
a decisive role to play. 
163. The Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies had decided to 
perform stress tests on nuclear power reactors in the Ibero-American region, along the lines of those 
being carried out in Europe and other regions, with a view to reassessing the safety parameters of 
those installations. 
164. It was important that the Agency increase the dissemination of information about the ways in 
which nuclear power could help address the environmental challenges now facing the world and in 
that way help to raise public knowledge about the subject. The Agency needed to demonstrate that 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 21 
nuclear energy was clean and safe, especially in light of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant. 
165. Mexico attached particular importance to its technical cooperation with the Agency, particularly 
as it was directly related to development. MexicoÂs more than 50 years of cooperation with the 
Agency had enabled it to improve its capabilities in such areas as the creation of a radiosterilized 
tissue bank, radiopharmaceutical production, nuclear medicine, instrumentation and equipment 
maintenance and calibration, pest control, operational nuclear safety and radiation protection. 
166. In December 2010, Mexico had signed a Country Programme Framework for 2010Â2015 which 
incorporated proposals closely linked to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the UN 
Development Assistance Framework and its national development plan, thereby ensuring that its 
projects were relevant and had a major impact on the country. Aware of the importance of technical 
cooperation for the majority of Member States, Mexico had paid its share of the TCF target for 2011. 
167. Although nuclear security was first and foremost the responsibility of each sovereign country, 
the Agency was central to the nuclear security regime. Thus, Mexico supported Agency activities to 
promote the physical protection of nuclear material and installations and radioactive sources, and to 
strengthen StatesÂ legislation and regulations. Those activities were a fundamental part of measures 
aimed at preventing nuclear terrorism. It was an area in which the Agency had extensive experience 
and highly qualified personnel and, most importantly, it provided a forum for all its Member States to 
work together. 
168. In that context, Mexico had recently signed a project and supply agreement with the 
United States of America and the Agency for the replacement of the HEU in the TRIGA III research 
reactor at the National Nuclear Research Institute with LEU. It was expected that the transfer would be 
completed successfully at the start of 2012. That project demonstrated his countryÂs commitment to 
the agreements reached at the 2010 Washington Nuclear Security Summit. 
169. Mexico welcomed Agency support in strengthening security at its borders, ports and airports as 
regards the detection of nuclear material. Illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radioactive sources 
was a real concern and his country was prepared to contribute to efforts in that regard. 
170. It was also grateful for the assistance the Agency had provided with respect to security measures 
for the 16th Pan American Games to be held in Guadalajara in October 2011. 
171. The additional protocol to MexicoÂs agreement with the Agency for the application of 
safeguards in connection with the Tlatelolco Treaty and the NPT had entered into force on 
4 March 2011. His country urged all those Member States which had not yet taken that step to do so. 
172. To ensure proper fulfilment of the provisions of its additional protocol, his country had 
requested an ISSAS mission. Thus far, the Agency had carried out a preparatory mission and had 
given a training course on the additional protocol in Mexico. 
173. His country was pleased that a consensus had been achieved on convening a forum on 
experience of possible relevance to the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in the Middle East in 
November. As a staunch supporter of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, Mexico was party to 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, the first treaty to establish such a zone in a populated area, thus setting an 
example to other regions of the world. 
174. Regarding the DPRK, Mexico called for the resumption of the six-party talks with a view to 
prompt denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the DPRKÂs reincorporation into the NPT 
regime. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 22 
175. His country urged the Republic of Iran to cooperate fully and immediately with the Agency and 
take the steps necessary to resolve all outstanding issues in accordance with its obligations under the 
NPT. 
176. His delegation noted that the draft budget for 2012 entailed an increase of 3.2% as compared 
with 2011. Mexico, a traditional supporter of a policy of zero real growth, now advocated zero 
nominal growth because of domestic financial constraints and was therefore in favour of any measures 
which made the AgencyÂs budget more transparent and efficient. There must be a clear correlation 
between the AgencyÂs programmatic priorities and the budget heading allocations. In addition, Mexico 
stressed the need to maintain an appropriate balance between the AgencyÂs statutory activities and the 
importance of considering the Member StatesÂ needs and interests. 
177. Finally, he said that Mexico, like many other developing countries, would like to benefit even 
more from the use of nuclear energy and its various applications. Hence, there was now more than 
ever before a need to build confidence in the safe use of nuclear energy. The public should be 
informed about the clear advantages of nuclear energy as a low-cost, climate-neutral and safe energy 
source. A balance should be struck between safety and the need to facilitate the fullest possible 
exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy, in accordance with Article IV of the NPT. 
178. Ms RASI (Finland) said that 2011 had been marked by the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi 
power plant caused by the earthquake and tsunami. She expressed sympathy to the people and 
Government of Japan for the tragic losses and suffering endured. 
179. In Finland, nuclear power was a major component in the energy mix. FinlandÂs fifth nuclear 
power unit was under construction and a decision enabling the start of preparations for two new 
projects had been endorsed by the parliament. As a result, Finland would not only be self-sufficient in 
electricity generation for the first time in several decades, but was also taking an important step 
towards carbon emission-free energy. 
180. High priority was attached to nuclear power plant safety in Finland. However, the accident in 
Japan had been a useful reminder and reassessment of safety had been launched in Finland 
immediately after the accident. Preliminary results had shown that there were no immediate safety 
concerns at Finnish nuclear facilities and a more in-depth assessment was still under way, in 
combination with the Europe-wide stress tests. She underlined the importance of similar stress tests 
being conducted in all countries operating nuclear power plants. 
181. It was vital that countries using nuclear energy had clear legislation and responsibilities and that 
regulatory bodies were given not just the necessary authority and independence in their 
decision-making but also the resources needed to carry out their tasks. In addition, regulatory 
authorities must enjoy public trust. 
182. Finland was of the view that Member States and the Agency should strengthen and coordinate 
their efforts to ensure that countries embarking on nuclear power programmes developed sound safety 
infrastructures. While the Agency had a central role in contributing to conditions for the safe use of 
nuclear energy, it should be underscored that the prime responsibility for the safe and secure use of 
nuclear power lay with the licensed operators. 
183. Her Government subscribed fully to the declaration issuing from the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety held in June, particularly the commitment to enhance the central role of the Agency in 
promoting cooperation and in coordinating international efforts to strengthen global nuclear safety. 
Finland looked forward to strong support from all Member States for the effective, prompt and 
adequately resourced implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 23 
184. For her Government, the NPT remained the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
Nuclear weapons proliferation remained a serious concern and the international community must take 
appropriate measures in cases of non-compliance in order to preserve the integrity and authority of the 
system. 
185. Finland welcomed the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, as well as the 
agreement to convene a conference on the Middle East in 2012. It was looking forward to the 
AgencyÂs forum on that topic in November as an important preparatory step for the 2012 conference. 
186. Finland was strongly committed to strengthening nuclear security worldwide. As its 
contribution to the preparations for the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Finland was hosting a 
Sherpa meeting in Helsinki in October. Finland had provided support to the AgencyÂs nuclear security 
activities and had already made a commitment to contribute to the Nuclear Security Fund that year. 
She was pleased to announce that Finland had deposited its instrument of ratification for the 
Amendment to the CPPNM and encouraged all States to do the same. 
187. Finland recognized the importance of the technical cooperation programme which, for many 
States, represented the most tangible form of cooperation with the Agency. 
188. Nuclear technology and its applications could be of significant help in many spheres and it 
could contribute to addressing global challenges and promoting the Millennium Development Goals. 
Finland commended the AgencyÂs active role in that regard. She drew particular attention to its work 
in the field of human and animal health, including the emphasis on cancer control in developing 
countries and the 2011 Scientific ForumÂs focus on water. 
189. Finland had always paid its share in full and on time to the Regular Budget and to the TCF and 
would continue to do so. There was increasing demand for technical cooperation related to the 
introduction of nuclear power and its safe use and it was important for the Agency to be able to 
respond to that demand in an effective and sustainable manner in partnership with the wider UN 
family and other relevant organizations. 
190. Her Government continued to attach strong importance to strengthening gender equality in the 
UN organizations, and the Agency was no exception. Women must be empowered to enjoy the same 
opportunities, rights and responsibilities as men. While Finland appreciated the AgencyÂs continuing 
efforts in that regard, work remained to be done in improving the representation of women in the 
Secretariat and in mainstreaming gender issues in the AgencyÂs policies, programmes and 
organizational practices. 
191. Mr ZOGRAFOS (Greece) said that the serious accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power 
plant had brought the international nuclear community together to assist the Japanese Government and 
to study the implications. Additional safety measures were required to avoid the recurrence of such 
accidents in the future. 
192. Greece had a strong interest in the AgencyÂs expanding nuclear safety and security programmes. 
The AgencyÂs activities in that regard, with the help of Member States and other regional and 
international organizations, would enhance the global safety and security framework. 
193. Greece supported all the Director GeneralÂs efforts, especially those undertaken after the 
Fukushima accident, to strengthen safety requirements through training and technical meetings and to 
ensure the establishment of independent regulatory authorities. The International Seismic Safety 
Centre launched by the Agency a few years previously had an important role to play for countries in 
active seismic zones that were considering nuclear power programmes. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 24 
194. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission was sharing the experience it had gained in the area of 
nuclear security and illicit trafficking in nuclear material following the installation of detection 
equipment at its borders and the distribution of such equipment to the customs, police and coastguard 
authorities. In so doing, it was contributing to international efforts to mitigate the risk of nuclear and 
radioactive material being used in criminal acts. 
195. In addition, Greece had finalized the document required under its constitution to adopt the 2005 
Amendment to the CPPNM and hoped that it would soon enter into force. 
196. Noting that effective safeguards and inspections of nuclear material and facilities were a 
sine qua non for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, he said that it was possible under the NPT 
safeguards system to limit the access of inspectors within a nuclear facility. Greece therefore urgently 
called for universal adherence to the additional protocol by all States party to the NPT. 
197. The NPT Review Conferences set the standards for the success of the non-proliferation and, by 
the same token, the safeguards regime. The positive outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference 
had enhanced international confidence in that regime, which was dependent on political support at the 
international and regional level to ensure compliance with non-proliferation undertakings. Greece 
actively and unequivocally supported all efforts to further strengthen the role of the Agency to that 
end. The Agency should concentrate its effort on state-of-the-art measurement technologies, remote 
monitoring and satellite imagery to assist States Party to ensure transparency and build confidence in 
their implementation of the NPT. It was vital that the safeguards system remain strong and effective 
and that it become universal. 
198. Bearing in mind that the Director General had pointed out once again in his latest report that 
Iran had not provided the necessary cooperation to confirm that all its nuclear facilities and material 
were used for peaceful purposes, and also that he was not confident about the absence of possible 
military dimensions to that programme, Greece called on Iran to comply with all its international 
obligations, including under the resolutions of the Board of Governors and the Security Council, and 
to engage in a meaningful process to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear 
programme. 
199. Likewise, Greece called on Syria to improve its cooperation with the Agency as stipulated by 
the resolution adopted by the Board of Governors in June 2011 (GOV/2011/41). 
200. With regard to the DPRK, Greece urged that countryÂs Government to return to the full 
implementation of its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
201. Greece supported the AgencyÂs efforts to increase Member StatesÂ capabilities in the 
development and application of nuclear science for their scientific, technological and economic 
development. In particular, he pointed to the greater utilization of research reactors and the 
establishment of the Mediterranean Research Reactor Network in September 2010. 
202. It was important for the Agency to expand its cooperation with other international organizations 
like FAO, WHO, UNESCO and UNDP on projects of common interest in the field of natural sciences. 
203. Successful cooperation between the Agency and the Greek Atomic Energy Commission in the 
field of education and training had led to the signing of a long-term agreement establishing the terms 
of reference for the Commission to act as a regional training centre in Europe for nuclear, radiation, 
transport and waste safety. A major event in that context was the post-graduate course on radiation 
protection and the safety of radioactive sources to be held in October 2011. 
204. Having expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, he 
commended the SecretariatÂs pre-planning of the 2012Â2013 technical cooperation cycle to reflect new 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 25 
global trends and realities. Greece believed that the programme should focus mainly on the use of 
radiation in health care and on raising safety and security levels in all aspects of the peaceful use of 
nuclear technology. In managing the programme, the importance of partnerships with other 
international and regional organizations should not be overlooked. The SecretariatÂs interaction with 
Member States and their national institutions was necessary to enable cooperation on agreed national 
and regional objectives. Greek scientists took an active part in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
activities, including expert missions, scientific visits and the hosting of fellows in Greek laboratories 
free of charge. There was increasing interest on the part of Greek scientists to participate in regional 
and international projects. 
205. In conclusion, he said that the Greek Atomic Energy Commission had requested an IRRS 
mission, which was due to take place in May 2012. 
206. Mr SABBAGH (Syrian Arab Republic) expressed his GovernmentÂs condolences to the 
Government and people of Japan following the disaster that had struck the country and destroyed parts 
of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. He also thanked the Agency for its regular reports and 
updates on the impact of the accident. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 
2011 had led to the drafting of the first ever action plan aimed at strengthening nuclear safety and 
emergency preparedness. 
207. With regard to the application of safeguards in the Syrian Arab Republic, his country was 
deeply disappointed at the adoption by the Board of Governors in June 2011 of a resolution 
(GOV/2011/41) that was based on hypotheses rather than proven facts. The resolution also ran counter 
to the desire of many Member States to keep the matter within the Agency in order to maintain a spirit 
of dialogue and cooperation between Syria and the Agency. The resolution had not reflected SyriaÂs 
cooperation with the Agency nor its willingness to cooperate further, as expressed in SyriaÂs letter of 
26 May 2011. Nonetheless, Syria had reaffirmed its obligations under relevant international 
instruments and had demonstrated the seriousness of its desire to cooperate with the Agency in its 
letter to the Director General of 24 August 2011 in which it had proposed a meeting with the AgencyÂs 
Department of Safeguards in October to agree on a plan of action to resolve outstanding issues relating 
to the destroyed site at Dair Alzour. 
208. He recalled that the item had been placed on the agenda of the Board of Governors as a 
consequence of IsraelÂs destruction of a military building in Dair Alzour which had had no relation 
whatever to nuclear activities. That attack had constituted a brazen violation of Syrian sovereignty and 
a flagrant breach of international law and the UN Charter and should have been strongly condemned 
by the international community. Moreover, the failure of certain States to provide information 
concerning the destroyed building in a timely manner had seriously impeded the AgencyÂs ability to 
discharge its responsibilities under the NPT and SyriaÂs safeguards agreement, as reflected in the 
AgencyÂs first report on the subject. 
209. The use by some States of the Director GeneralÂs reports to step up pressure on Syria provided 
ample evidence of the politicization of the AgencyÂs work by those States. 
210. More than ten years after the adoption by the General Conference of decision GC(44)/DEC/12 
concerning the convening of a forum to share the experience of other regions relevant to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, the Director General had finally 
taken that step. To ensure the success of the forum, the States participating should have acceded to the 
NPT and the agenda should include an item on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
specifically in the Middle East, which differed from other regions in that Israel had a nuclear arsenal 
that was not subject to international oversight. 
GC(55)/OR.5 
21 September 2011, Page 26 
211. The General ConferenceÂs adoption of the resolution on Israeli nuclear capabilities in 2009 
(GC(53)/RES/17) had sent a clear message. The resolution called on Israel to accede to the NPT and 
place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. In SyriaÂs view, the resolution 
reflected many Member StatesÂ concerns regarding IsraelÂs possession of nuclear capabilities outside 
any international control and their indignation at some StatesÂ continued support for IsraelÂs 
development of such capabilities in violation of their obligations under relevant treaties. 
212. The decision by the Arab States to postpone the submission of their draft resolution under the 
item on Israeli nuclear capabilities until the next session was a gesture of good will in support of the 
efforts of a number of States to boost the prospects of success of the conference on a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East to be held in 2012 and of the forum to be held in 
November 2011. The success of the 2012 conference depended on the seriousness of the 
nuclear-weapon States and on genuine political will on the part of Israel. In that connection, he noted 
that the intransigence of successive Israeli Governments had undermined the chances of success of 
such initiatives to date or doomed them to failure. 
213. He noted that the representative of Israel had criticized Syria in a statement to the Conference 
the previous day2 but had ignored the fact that Israel had occupied Syrian and Lebanese territory for 
decades and had violated international law on a daily basis through its blockade, segregation, 
displacement, oppression and killing of Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese people. The representative of 
Israel likewise had ignored the fact that IsraelÂs nuclear activities were not subject to any international 
oversight, that its huge military nuclear arsenal posed a threat not only to the countries of the region 
but to the world as a whole, and that its refusal to accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State 
doomed all relevant initiatives to failure. 
214. Syria valued the side events organized by the Agency during the General Conference addressing 
such issues as water resources and nuclear safety. He encouraged the Agency to pay increased 
attention to water, food and health security and in particular to assist developing countries in 
addressing the devastating economic and human consequences of water shortages. 
215. The Atomic Energy Commission of Syria had served as the executive secretariat for the States 
party to ARASIA since 2003. Syria had hosted the annual meeting of the ARASIA Board of 
Representatives in early 2011, at which a programme framework had been adopted for cooperation 
covering the period 2012Â2017, along with a study of all regional projects in the areas of agriculture, 
health, nuclear reactor safety and industrial safety. 
216. He thanked the Agency for its invaluable contribution to the success of projects under the 
technical cooperation programme. Syria provided a great deal of support to the programme through its 
specialized bodies, both under ARASIA and through other regional activities conducted by the 
Agency. His country looked forward to increased Agency support for the transfer of nuclear science 
and technology, especially to developing countries whose needs in that area were steadily increasing. 
217. Finally, he noted that the 2010 NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed the voluntary nature of 
a StateÂs decision to sign an additional protocol and had drawn a distinction between that decision and 
the legal requirement for States party to the NPT to conclude a safeguards agreement. 
The meeting rose at 1.20 p.m.

7. General debate and Annual Report for 2010 (continued) 
(GC(55)/2) 
1. Ms TAN Yee Woan (Singapore) said that, following the Fukushima accident, it was important 
that the Agency and the nuclear community draw the right lessons in order to strengthen the global 
nuclear safety regime, international and regional cooperation, and response to nuclear accidents and 
emergencies. She welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to hold the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety in June 2011 in order for the international community to embark officially on that 
process. 
2. Implausible as it might sound, there were still those who insisted that the global nuclear safety 
infrastructure was fine as it stood and that all that was required was better adherence to and 
implementation of current practices. Her delegation urged all parties to keep an open mind on the 
review of safety, and to accord the highest consideration to ensuring the safety of nuclear installations, 
as any accident would have serious political, economic, medical and environmental consequences. 
Without being either alarmist or defensive, Member States needed to engage in an honest and open 
review of the global nuclear safety framework, which included standards for plant design, siting 
criteria, operational safety, regulatory effectiveness and emergency preparedness and response. To do 
less could have grave consequences, and those who had had a chance to do better but had not because 
of narrow interests would not be forgiven. 
3. The Agency needed to step up its work towards ensuring that peaceful uses of nuclear science 
and technology could benefit as many citizens of the world as possible. Important areas in that 
connection included the fields of cancer treatment, food security and water management. 
4. Nuclear proliferation remained a matter of concern. Singapore urged Iran to extend its fullest 
cooperation and to comply with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the AgencyÂs 
Board of Governors so as to clarify concerns over the possible military dimensions of its nuclear 
programme. 
5. Her country urged the DPRK to return to the NPT and to resume its cooperation with the 
Agency. She noted from media reports that there were indications that the DPRK was considering 
resuming talks on its nuclear programme without any preconditions and she hoped that that would lead 
to definite outcomes in the near future. Her delegation urged all sides to refrain from provocative acts 
which would deepen the environment of tension and suspicion and threaten the peace and security of 
the region. 
6. Singapore, as a current member of the Board of Governors, reiterated its support for the role and 
the work of the Agency, which had a unique and important mission to fulfil with regard to nuclear 
non-proliferation and the promotion of peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology. The 
Agency should be held to high standards in the achievement of those worthy goals. Singapore 
therefore appealed to all parties to allow the Agency to carry out its mandate, which was primarily 
highly technical in nature, in a consultative and professional environment free from polarization and 
unnecessary politicization of issues. The once-celebrated Vienna spirit of consensus was increasingly 
being honoured more in the breach than the observance, with some decisions being adopted by the 
Board through voting even though consensus could have been reached had there been genuine 
attempts to consult and had there not been pressing deadlines. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 2 
7. In 2011, Singapore had continued to work with the Agency in several areas. In conjunction with 
the Agency and Japan, Singapore had hosted an interregional seminar on the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system for States in south-east and south Asia with limited nuclear material and activities and another 
regional seminar on the AgencyÂs safeguards system for States in south-east Asia with significant 
nuclear activities in March 2011. Over the preceding ten years, it had hosted 22 scientific visits, 
83 fellowships and 24 regional training events with the Agency in areas such as nuclear medicine, 
radiotherapy and radiation protection. Singapore would continue to support the Agency in its work, 
and it expressed its appreciation to the Agency for providing technical advice to support the 
understanding of various important issues before the start of SingaporeÂs pre-feasibility study on 
nuclear power. 
8. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon) reaffirmed his countryÂs support for the Director GeneralÂs 
courageous and responsible decision to convene the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 
2011. Nuclear safety standards were a key element of the post-Fukushima era. The Conference had 
recognized that all nuclear emergencies had consequences extending beyond the borders of individual 
States. It had also reaffirmed the importance of the AgencyÂs role, of ensuring compliance with its 
safety standards and of guaranteeing it sufficient resources to perform that role. Lebanon supported the 
content of the Ministerial Declaration and hoped that the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety 
(GC(55)/14) would be endorsed by the General Conference. The importance of the outcome of the 
Ministerial Conference and the follow-up action was accentuated by the increasing demand in some 
regions of the world for electricity generation based on nuclear energy. As the destructive impact of a 
nuclear accident took no account of political or geographical boundaries, every country that possessed 
nuclear installations had a duty of transparency and a duty to cooperate in adopting control, oversight 
and modernization measures. 
9. In the Middle East, the risk stemmed primarily from IsraelÂs Dimona reactor. Experts and 
independent commentators in Israel itself had warned that it was high time to review the continued 
existence of the ageing reactor. It was unreasonable to maintain an information blackout instead of 
launching an international initiative to assess the possible effects and risks associated with the Israeli 
reactor, especially since it was not subject to civilian oversight and was located in a region exposed to 
quasi-permanent seismic movements. That was why all the Arab States consistently demanded that all 
Israeli nuclear installations should be placed under comprehensive Agency safeguards like those of 
other countries in the interests of the safety of the region as a whole. 
10. Furthermore, Israel persistently refused to participate in programmes, designed by countries 
with which it was on friendly terms, aimed at converting scientific research reactors so that they could 
use LEU rather than HEU. Nobody had asked it, at least not in public, about the hidden intentions 
underlying its insistence on the use of HEU. 
11. He commended other Middle Eastern countries that were preparing to introduce nuclear reactors 
for energy production on their determination to cooperate fully with the Agency and to abide by its 
standards, guaranteeing the safety and transparency required by the peoples of the region and ensuring 
social stability. 
12. The Director General had described himself as the guardian of non-proliferation and had 
stressed that the Agency would be able to perform its mandate effectively only if it struck a balance 
between two tasks: non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and support for the peaceful use of nuclear 
technology. Lebanon strongly supported that approach and urged States that had not signed the NPT to 
do so and to place all their nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. At the same time, the 
Agency should exercise caution in interpreting the standards laid down in safeguards agreements in 
order to ensure that its assessments did not exceed the bounds of the objectives for which the standards 
had been devised. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 3 
13. Israel had declared its firm intention to remain the sole State possessing nuclear weapons in the 
Middle East, even if force was required to maintain that status. Lebanon was opposed to the existence 
of any nuclear-weapon State in the Middle East and that principle underlay all the positions and 
actions it adopted. 
14. The 2010 NPT Review Conference had decided to convene a conference in 2012 on the creation 
of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Lebanon 
was convinced more than ever before, however, that the preparatory steps required to create such a 
zone were accession by Israel to the NPT and the placement of all its nuclear installations under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards as a gesture of goodwill. 
15. Lebanon and all the other Arab States had agreed on a number of principles: that the 
universality of the NPT was in the strategic interest of the entire human race and took precedence over 
all political considerations and circumstantial interests; that all Arab States had acceded to the NPT 
and the safeguards regime and had not invoked the Arab-Israeli conflict in order to defer compliance 
with their obligations; that nuclear weapons could not be regarded as an instrument for guaranteeing 
the security of any party since their possession would trigger a regional arms race that nobody 
sanctioned or desired; that nuclear non-proliferation efforts should be based on a comprehensive 
regional approach that guaranteed security for all parties, eschewing double standards and the 
discretionary selection of standards; that the approach to non-proliferation should cover all aspects of 
the issue, such as the concept of comprehensiveness, and that any failure to comply with the principle 
of comprehensiveness and universality would render its objectives and effectiveness null and void. 
16. The Agency had recorded many exceptional achievements during the past year in different parts 
of the world, including the development of expertise and productivity in needy countries. Although the 
number of States requiring technical cooperation had increased in recent years, there had not been a 
corresponding increase in the TCF. Beneficiary States therefore requested that effective mechanisms 
be established to render such assistance predictable, assured and sufficient in order to ensure that their 
development was sustainable and that they could design programmes capable of being implemented 
within specific time limits. 
17. According to the Annual Report for 2010, human needs remained a top priority in less 
developed regions. The Agency was thus faithfully discharging its mission under the Statute. The large 
proportion of budgetary funds devoted to technical cooperation demonstrated that the Agency was 
responding to requests for assistance from national authorities. 
18. Lebanon greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs support for Lebanon, where mutual cooperation was 
based on transparency, careful planning in the light of existing needs, and speedy implementation 
where capacities and circumstances permitted. Lebanon was therefore one of the leading countries in 
terms of average programme implementation. In recent years it had succeeded in reaching high levels 
of technological competence and in training Lebanese scientists and technical experts. Some of its 
achievements were currently on display at a Conference side event. His delegation would welcome 
comments and suggestions from visitors to the exhibition. 
19. Lebanon believed that, in the absence of peace and trust, it was impossible to achieve the 
development to which the world aspired. An effective and goal-oriented partnership between all 
members of the international community would serve as a vehicle to promote the peace and 
development process, a process in which the Agency played a vital role. 
20. Mr FERDINANDO (Sri Lanka) said that his country fully shared the Director GeneralÂs views 
on the lessons of the Fukushima accident. As the representative of a country that had also suffered a 
tsunami, he expressed sorrow at the loss of life and property in Japan, as well as confidence in the 
ability of the people to recover from the tragedy and rebuild their lives. The unprecedented accident 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 4 
had shown that although the peaceful use of the atom had great potential for development and 
progress, it could also pose great threats to safety, human health and the environment across national 
borders. 
21. The accident had led all stakeholders and the nuclear power industry to review safety standards. 
Sri Lanka commended the actions taken to mitigate the consequences and hoped that they would 
enhance public confidence in the safety and viability of nuclear power. He expressed appreciation for 
the cooperation of the Agency and the CTBTO in providing timely information on the situation. 
22. His country commended the Director General on his initiative of holding the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011, and he hoped that the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety 
would represent the start of a process in which vital issues of safety and emergency preparedness 
would be considered in a holistic manner. Sri Lanka looked forward to the continuation of that process 
at the High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security to be held the next day during the 
66th session of the UN General Assembly. 
23. There was a need for greater cooperation in nuclear emergencies. A system of early warning and 
notification, measures to minimize the spread of radiation, assessments of environmental and human 
health impacts, and a compensation mechanism were priority requirements for the safety of 
populations. There was also a need to review the safety standards for nuclear power plants worldwide. 
Positive measures that could be taken by States with Agency assistance included stress tests. 
24. Following the accident, his Government had taken prompt action to modernize the Atomic 
Energy Authority and to strengthen it to prepare for emergency situations. The Government had also 
monitored radiation levels in food and in the environment. As the cost of the measures had been high, 
his country urged the Agency to enhance its programmes of technical assistance to Member States to 
build capacity for nuclear emergency preparedness, including through regional cooperation 
programmes. It thanked the Agency for its assistance so far in that regard. Sri Lanka was establishing 
some sites to detect increases in background radiation and activating a radiological warning system 
through its Disaster Management Centre. With the collaboration of the Atomic Energy Authority, the 
Centre planned to conduct national training programmes in the field of radiological emergencies and 
similar situations. 
25. Energy had been identified as a priority area for development in Sri Lanka and his country also 
looked forward to receiving greater support from the Agency in that regard. 
26. Sri Lanka was embarking on a new era of economic development after overcoming the threat of 
terrorism it had faced for nearly 30 years. It fully supported global measures to combat terrorism and 
had become a signatory to a number of international conventions, including the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. It had also joined the Proliferation 
Security Initiative as well as the Megaports Initiative led by the United States of America to improve 
the safety and security of radioactive sources and monitor the international movement of nuclear 
material through its ports. Sri Lanka had also carried out security upgrades at radiotherapy facilities 
and gamma irradiation centres under the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
27. General and complete disarmament had been a declared objective of the UN and the 
international community for several decades, but sadly remained elusive. It had been during 
Sri LankaÂs chairmanship of NAM that the call for the first special session of the UN on disarmament 
had been made. 
28. The NPT was the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and fundamental to the 
pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Nuclear disarmament and 
nuclear non-proliferation could not be pursued independently of one another. Also, the obligations and 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 5 
commitments undertaken by countries should not jeopardize their sovereign and inalienable right to 
develop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The Peaceful Uses Initiative 
was important in that context. 
29. Sri Lanka welcomed the decision of the 2010 NPT Review Conference on holding a conference 
on the Middle East in 2012. It also welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene the Forum 
on Experience of Possible Relevance to the Creation of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle 
East in November 2011. 
30. Since nuclear science and technology for development was an essential pillar of the AgencyÂs 
work, Sri Lanka attached great importance to the technical assistance provided to developing 
countries. Activities should be strengthened further, and sufficient, adequate and predictable resources 
allocated to the TCF. The delivery of technical cooperation should also take the needs of recipient 
countries into consideration to enhance the impact of such assistance. Sri Lanka had greatly benefited 
from the technical cooperation programme in such areas as human health, agriculture, industry, 
nutrition and radiation protection. During the preceding few years, it had obtained technical assistance 
for national priority areas such as use of radioisotope-based nuclear techniques for the diagnosis and 
monitoring of major infectious diseases, including drug-resistant malaria and tuberculosis. 
31. PACT was a notable example of the peaceful uses of the atom. As the host of a PACT Model 
Demonstration Site, Sri Lanka hoped that the success of such Sites would help to provide models for 
comprehensive cancer care in the developing world. Sri Lanka soon expected to finalize the 
installation of the Bhabhatron-II radiotherapy machine donated by India. 
32. Sri Lanka had also signed its CPF for 2009Â2013. The next CPF cycle was expected to reflect 
the emerging priorities of redeveloping and reconstructing the countryÂs post-conflict zones and he 
hoped that partnerships through PACT and the Peaceful Uses Initiative could help to strengthen the 
radiotherapy facility in northern Sri Lanka. 
33. A feasibility study on incorporating nuclear power into Sri LankaÂs energy mix was under way. 
Atomic Energy Authority Act No. 19 was being updated to meet present and future requirements in 
the fields of nuclear power generation, nuclear terrorism, environmental protection and nuclear safety 
and security. Legislative capacity-building had been identified as an important priority, and he thanked 
the Secretariat for its initiative to provide training in that area. Sri Lanka would appreciate further 
Agency assistance in incorporating components on nuclear safety and security into its university 
curriculum. 
34. Under an RCA programme, Sri Lanka had recognized the importance of non-destructive testing 
to enhance safety and productivity in industry and was planning to establish a national centre for 
non-destructive testing that would perform such work on a large scale. 
35. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) reiterated his countryÂs support 
for the principles enshrined in the UN Charter and its conviction that those objectives and principles 
could be attained by strengthening multilateralism. Venezuela was committed to the NPT and the 
AgencyÂs Statute. 
36. Venezuela defended the sovereign right of States to develop nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes and supported the AgencyÂs efforts to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic 
energy to peace, health and the prosperity throughout the world, as set forth in Article II of the Statute. 
37. The nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi had reawoken public fears about the risks associated 
with nuclear reactors, especially as it had occurred in a highly developed country. He expressed his 
countryÂs solidarity with the people of Japan in the wake of the catastrophe that had befallen them. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 6 
38. Recalling that the Fukushima accident had, like the Chernobyl accident of 1986, been classified 
at the highest level on the INES scale, he commended the work done by the Agency and the 
Government of Japan in making an initial assessment of its consequences. He urged that such efforts 
continue so that the full details might be known and to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents in 
the future. 
39. It was important to implement a responsible global public information policy as regards the 
accident, particularly its technical aspects. People had a right to truthful and timely information, not 
only to learn about the accidentÂs consequences but also so that society could impact effectively on 
national decision-making processes. 
40. In the days following the accident, President ChÃ¡vez of Venezuela had announced his 
GovernmentÂs decision to suspend temporarily its preliminary nuclear power studies so that 
VenezuelaÂs energy policy could be assessed in light of the accident. 
41. He noted that the Annual Report for 2010, which attached special importance to nuclear power 
trends in the medium and long term, only covered Agency activities prior to the accident in Japan. 
Once more information became available and lessons were learned from Fukushima, those projections 
would undoubtedly need to be revised. 
42. The Action Plan on Nuclear Safety did not reflect the urgency required to achieve significant 
progress. Venezuela was concerned that some countries had taken advantage of their influential 
positions in order to put their own economic interests first, instead of giving priority to the safety of 
individuals and the environment. Also, the Action Plan should take into account an in-depth 
assessment of the Fukushima accident conducted by the Agency, including its potential environmental 
consequences. In particular, continuous monitoring and a series of evaluations would be needed to 
determine the accidentÂs long-term effect on marine flora and fauna. 
43. Assurance of supply had been a divisive element in the Agency, with decisions having been 
made without the approval of the majority of its Member States. In VenezuelaÂs view, the scheme put 
forward was aimed at creating a monopoly with a tight grip being maintained on nuclear fuel 
production by a small group of countries. The establishment of a nuclear fuel bank should under no 
circumstances constitute an obstacle to the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
44. The growing interest in nuclear technology meant that efforts should be stepped up to ensure 
optimal safety levels in all activities related to radioactive sources. The Agency should maintain its 
leading role in establishing relevant international standards and codes to ensure that the design, 
operation and decommissioning of nuclear technology met the highest standards. The Fukushima 
accident had highlighted the need for adequate emergency preparedness and response, nuclear 
installation safety, radiation and transport safety, and radioactive waste management. 
45. Training in the nuclear sphere should continue to be an Agency priority. Venezuela welcomed 
the number of workshops, training courses and seminars that the Agency had held in 2010 and urged it 
to expand that role. In addition, it was important that the Agency continued to be capable of providing 
the full range of relevant assistance, ranging from routine activities to accidents. 
46. While important, nuclear security activities were not mandated under the Statute and thus must 
be financed through extrabudgetary contributions. Cooperation in that regard should be given without 
the attachment of conditions and must be in the national interests of the country concerned. A clear 
distinction needed to be made between the two concepts of nuclear safety and nuclear security. 
47. Venezuela had benefited from various national and regional technical cooperation projects in a 
number of areas. Some of those projects had been implemented within the framework of ARCAL. 
Funding for technical cooperation, as a main statutory activity, should be sufficient, assured and 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 7 
predictable. Venezuela believed that technical cooperation should be funded from the Regular Budget, 
which would guarantee project continuity as well as an appropriate balance as regards national nuclear 
energy policy priorities. It also believed that footnote-a/ projects should not have to depend on 
extrabudgetary resources. Caution should be exercised in seeking partnerships with other 
UN organizations, given the highly specialized nature of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. 
48. The Agency was the sole competent authority as regards verification. Its activities in that 
respect should be based exclusively on technical and objective considerations. Regretfully, in 
succumbing to the influence of a small number of countries, the Agency was allowing its authority and 
impartiality to be undermined. The Agency was being used as a tool in the imperialist military 
intervention policy of some countries to achieve their aims in the UN Security Council. 
49. The NPT regime could not be implemented in an imbalanced fashion. A fundamental aspect of 
that Treaty was the commitment of the nuclear-weapon States to general and complete disarmament of 
their nuclear arsenals under strict and effective international control. The Agency should play an 
active role in informing Member States about disarmament-related aspects with a view to 
strengthening the international disarmament and non-proliferation regime. 
50. It was a matter for concern that some countries had developed military doctrines that 
contemplated the use or threat of the use of force employing nuclear weapons, and that expanded the 
possible reasons for using such weapons or justified the development of more sophisticated nuclear 
weapons, even though it was clear that the existence and proliferation of nuclear weapons, instead of 
enhancing security, reduced the scope for achieving lasting and sustainable peace. Such doctrines 
posed a constant threat to international peace and security and so efforts towards nuclear disarmament 
and non-proliferation should be intensified. Venezuela had consistently advocated the total elimination 
of nuclear weapons in the relevant forums. 
51. The NPT, which was recognized by all as the cornerstone of the regime for disarmament, 
non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, was still under great pressure. Agreements 
were being signed with States that were not party to the Treaty. The existence of military nuclear 
programmes not under Agency supervision was being ignored, while other countries were being 
cynically hounded for exercising their right to have nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Moreover, 
using the terrorist threat as a pretext, the production of new and more powerful nuclear weapons had 
been resumed. Responsibility lay first and foremost with the nuclear-weapon States to work towards 
reducing and eliminating their nuclear arsenals, in accordance with the letter and the spirit of the NPT. 
52. With respect to the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Venezuela underscored 
the inalienable right of the developing countries to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes 
without discrimination. After the Islamic revolution had reached Iran, some countries had, for political 
reasons, terminated their cooperation with the Iranian nuclear programme, thereby not only reneging 
on commercial agreements with that country, but also contravening the NPT and the AgencyÂs Statute. 
Iran had then been forced to develop its nuclear programme independently. Recently, Iran had made 
the important step of connecting its nuclear reactor at Bushehr to the grid, with the cooperation of the 
Russian Federation. 
53. He noted in that context that the Agency had found no evidence that IranÂs nuclear programme 
was anything but peaceful in nature. Venezuela called for an end to the threats and persecution by a 
group of countries which seemed not to be committed to resolving that issue and which, to justify their 
imperialist geopolitical and commercial ambitions in the region, had fuelled a media slur campaign 
against Iran. That privileged group of countries had brought numerous resolutions to the Security 
Council, assuming de facto, though not de jure, competencies which belonged exclusively to the 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 8 
Agency and jeopardizing the AgencyÂs credibility and the independence that was essential to its 
functioning. 
54. A discriminatory campaign was also being waged against Syria, and several countries had had 
undue influence on the Director GeneralÂs reports. Venezuela roundly condemned the September 
2007 attack by Israel on Syria. It was regrettable that a country which was the victim of a brutal attack 
was having an accusing finger pointed at it without there being any convincing proof. The Agency was 
running the risk of losing its credibility as an objective verification body. The resolution adopted by 
the Board of Governors on 9 June 2011 (GOV/2011/41) had set a grave precedent by establishing 
supposed non-compliance by Syria on the basis of suppositions, not solid arguments. It was clear that 
the purpose of the resolution had been to facilitate the plan of imperialist governments to intervene in 
Arab countries with the complicity of the Security Council. 
55. The Middle East was marked by deep military asymmetry: IsraelÂs possession of nuclear 
weapons and its failure to cooperate with the Agency were major threats to its Arab neighbours. From 
the reports submitted by the Director General to the Board it could be concluded that Israel was 
continuing to use regional conflict as a justification for not collaborating with Agency safeguards and 
maintaining its nuclear military ambitions. 
56. Venezuela did not believe in the premise that the conclusion of a peace treaty in the region 
should be a precondition for a country to accept comprehensive safeguards. On the contrary, IsraelÂs 
accession to the international safeguards regime was a necessary step to the achievement of peace in 
the Middle East. Israel should, therefore, place its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards to 
ensure that all its nuclear activities were of a peaceful nature. It was regrettable that Israel was the only 
country in the Middle East not to have acceded to the NPT or expressed any intention to do so. It was 
imperative that Israel renounce its ambition to possess nuclear weapons, accede to the NPT without 
further delay and make a commitment to enter into frank dialogue with the international community 
with a view to making the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Venezuela firmly supported the 
aspiration of the Arab countries to achieve such a zone as soon as possible in accordance with the 
relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Venezuela called on the international 
community to continue its efforts to that end and was convinced that the Agency had a major role to 
play in that regard. 
57. Mr BORGES (Angola), offering his countryÂs condolences to the people and Government of 
Japan on account of the tragic events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, applauded the Director 
GeneralÂs initiative to hold a Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011. It had offered an 
opportunity to discuss the disasterÂs consequences and the lessons to be learned. Angola set great store 
by the Declaration adopted at the Conference, highlighting Member StatesÂ commitment to improve 
nuclear safety standards, enhance emergency and response mechanisms, and ensure the safe and viable 
use of nuclear energy. A clear message had been sent to restore public confidence. 
58. Angola attached great importance to the technical cooperation programme and its role in the use 
of science and nuclear technology to solve socio-economic problems in the areas of agriculture, 
human health, nutrition, industry and the environment. He reiterated AngolaÂs profound gratitude to 
the Agency, in particular the Division for Africa. 
59. On the subject of human health, he welcomed the AgencyÂs considerable efforts to train 
professionals in oncological medicine and radiotherapy. Much remained to be done, however, as the 
numbers of cancer patients had risen drastically, with serious consequences for the population. He 
requested greater cooperation with and assistance from the Agency through PACT, in particular 
for training human resources specializing in oncology and related areas. Under the new CPF for 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 9 
2011Â2016, Angola intended to build three new oncology centres and hoped for the AgencyÂs full 
support. 
60. The new draft CPF was ready and Angola intended to sign it as soon as possible. It was in 
keeping with the priority areas identified in the medium- and long-term policies to be implemented by 
the Angolan Government. The new CPF continued to emphasize human resource development, the 
establishment of national regulatory infrastructures for radiation protection, human health, agriculture, 
the control of marine and land-based pollution, nuclear applications in industry, nuclear safety and 
general support for activities meeting national needs. 
Mr Potts (Australia), Vice-President, took the Chair. 
61. Mr BERNHARD (Denmark) expressed the general mood of horror at the destruction caused by 
the Japanese earthquake and tsunami. The Fukushima accident had demonstrated the need for 
international cooperation in substantially strengthening nuclear safety worldwide, as well as making it 
clear that the AgencyÂs increasing role in providing assistance and information to Member States was 
a pressing necessity in order to prevent nuclear accidents and ensure timely, precise and accessible 
information in cases of emergency. The Agency had begun to address that challenge with the 
Ministerial Conference in June. The Action Plan that was before the Conference for endorsement set 
out a number of commitments on behalf of the Secretariat and Member States, and certainly 
represented a step forward. Nonetheless, there was more to be accomplished as experience was 
accrued during the PlanÂs implementation. 
62. It was of continuing importance to improve peer review mechanisms and make them more 
binding, as well as to implement mandatory Agency safety inspections and make reports public. 
Proposals to strengthen the Nuclear Safety Convention, inter alia with legally binding Agency safety 
standards, also continued to merit a great deal of attention. The Action Plan could not be the end of the 
process of reinforcing nuclear safety post-Fukushima; it was the beginning. The High-Level Meeting 
on Nuclear Safety and Security to be held in New York the next day would hopefully provide further 
impetus to the AgencyÂs concerted efforts in the field. 
63. The Agency would continue to play a central role in international efforts to prevent nuclear 
proliferation. With its highly professional and dedicated staff, the Agency, through its inspection 
procedures, served to verify the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and offered all Member States 
essential assurances in that regard. Member States had the opportunity to clear themselves of any 
suspicion of wrongdoing through full and unrestricted cooperation with the Agency. As experience 
showed, however, the Agency could only play that role fully when it had the necessary tools at its 
disposal. His country was convinced that a comprehensive safeguards agreement in combination with 
an additional protocol constituted the standard for verification pursuant to the NPT, and called for 
universal conclusion of both instruments. 
64. The UN Security Council also bore key responsibility for non-proliferation. Denmark continued 
to support fully Security Council resolutions 1887 (2009) and 1540 (2004), whose adoption had 
marked a fundamental step forward. The Security Council had also adopted a number of 
country-specific resolutions with the object of upholding the integrity and efficiency of the 
non-proliferation regime. It was essential that all countries fully implement the Security CouncilÂs 
resolutions on the DPRK and Iran. 
65. His country shared the serious concerns expressed in a succession of reports by the Director 
General regarding IranÂs failure to cooperate with the Agency in such a way as to enable it to confirm 
that all nuclear material in Iran was being used for peaceful activities and dispel doubts about possible 
military dimensions of its nuclear programme. His country urged Iran to comply fully with all 
resolutions of the Security Council and the Board of Governors, and with the provisions of its 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 10 
safeguards agreement. IranÂs continuing enrichment of uranium to the 20% level in contravention of 
those resolutions was particularly alarming. 
66. Regarding Syria, his country had noted with serious concern the AgencyÂs conclusion in the 
Director GeneralÂs report2 to the June Board that the destroyed building at Dair Alzour had very likely 
been a nuclear reactor and should have been declared. Denmark therefore found necessary the 
resolution3 adopted by the Board on the implementation of SyriaÂs safeguards agreement, which 
referred the matter to the Security Council. His country joined the Director General in urging Syria to 
fully implement its safeguards agreement and bring into force an additional protocol in order to 
facilitate the work of the Agency to verify the completeness and correctness of SyriaÂs declarations. It 
was his countryÂs firm hope that Syria would implement the promise of increased cooperation that it 
had made in June. 
67. With regard to the DPRK, his country was very concerned that the Agency was not being 
permitted to fulfil its mandate and strongly supported calls on the DPRK to comply with its 
international obligations and commitments, as well as to allow an early return of Agency inspectors. 
68. Following the successful NPT Review Conference in 2010, it was important that all Member 
States prioritized the implementation of the action plan adopted there and avoid steps that might 
jeopardize that work. His country supported the Agency in its role under the action plan and welcomed 
the consensus reached on holding a forum on the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East, which 
would undoubtedly provide valuable input in the run-up to the 2012 conference mandated by the NPT 
Review Conference. 
69. Denmark greatly valued the AgencyÂs work on nuclear security. The need for protection against 
nuclear terrorism and other malicious acts involving nuclear material was moving ever higher up the 
international agenda, and rightly so. Denmark was pleased to have been able to contribute to the NSF 
in the past and was committed to working to ensure that the Fund had sufficient resources to step up 
its help to all Member States in protecting themselves and each other against nuclear terrorism. His 
country was pleased that the Agency budget for 2012 continued the positive trend in that regard and 
was ready to increase its involvement in the promotion of nuclear security. It would contribute to 
implementing the Work Plan adopted at the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit and to taking that process 
forward. 
70. With regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, his country had made the decision that 
nuclear power should not be included in its own energy mix, as it did not consider it a sustainable form 
of energy. While Denmark was not, therefore, in favour of a promotional role for the Agency in the 
field of nuclear power for electricity generation, it did respect the choice of other Member States and 
the AgencyÂs statutory obligations. It also recognized that an increasing number of States were 
interested in introducing nuclear power and highly valued the AgencyÂs contribution to ensuring that 
that happened in the best safety, security and non-proliferation conditions. 
71. Since the previous session of the General Conference, the Board had decided to establish an 
Agency LEU bank to assure LEU supply for nuclear fuel. His country supported that initiative and 
others in the area of multilateral assurances of supply aimed at providing proliferation-safe options for 
those countries that had chosen or would choose to use nuclear power. 
72. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs highly professional work in the field of technical 
cooperation on peaceful applications of nuclear technology. In 2011, Denmark had once again pledged 
___________________

3 GOV/2011/41. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 11 
its full contribution to the TCF in order to support the AgencyÂs work in combating hunger, disease 
and poverty. His country considered it highly relevant that the Director General had chosen the use of 
nuclear techniques in tackling water scarcity as the topic for the 2011 Scientific Forum. 
73. Mr MARSÃN AGUILERA (Cuba) said that the Fukushima accident had focused attention on 
key aspects of nuclear safety. The Ministerial Conference on the topic in June, the development of the 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety and the forthcoming High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and 
Security at the General Assembly undoubtedly reflected the growing importance of the issue. 
74. Primary responsibility for nuclear safety and security lay with States, although the Agency had 
an important role to play in promoting and coordinating global efforts to strengthen the nuclear safety 
and security regime. In view of their special nature, such activities should, however, be financed from 
extrabudgetary resources. 
75. The Fukushima accident and subsequent actions by the international community were a 
reminder that nuclear safety and security were a shared responsibility, and that all Member States had 
a duty to find solutions. The breadth of the issue had to be reflected in all discussions of nuclear 
safety, including summits. It was to be hoped that the necessary corrective measures would be taken so 
that all Member States with an interest in such events could participate. His country could not support 
meetings that excluded certain Member States or resolutions that made reference to such meetings. 
76. Nuclear security was closely tied to disarmament. The only effective way to avoid nuclear 
terrorism was to do away with nuclear arsenals. His country sincerely hoped that nuclear security 
summits would result in decisions leading to universal and full nuclear disarmament. Humanity, 
whose very existence was threatened by the existence of nuclear weapons, would be grateful. 
77. The AgencyÂs role in verification regarding nuclear disarmament should be strengthened. A 
decisive step towards that would be the fulfilment of NPT obligations by the nuclear Powers. The 
TreatyÂs three pillars had to be applied in a strict and non-discriminatory fashion. There should be an 
end to manipulation and double standards on non-proliferation whose unacceptable result was the 
existence of a club of privileged States that were developing their nuclear arsenals while paradoxically 
denying southern countries their inalienable right to make use of nuclear energy. 
78. His countryÂs full support for nuclear disarmament was unwavering, and it endorsed the 
declaration on the total abolition of nuclear weapons that had been adopted at the 16th Ministerial 
Conference of the NAM in Bali, where calls had been made to convene a high-level conference to 
examine the issue. It was to be hoped that the international community, and particularly 
nuclear-weapon States, would support such an event. 
79. The delicate issue of safeguards and the impartial and professional conduct of the Secretariat in 
carrying out its safeguards activities were of great importance. His country had repeatedly criticized 
the manipulation and politicization of the safeguards regime for geopolitical ends, as well as the 
double standards that were, unfortunately, so pervasive. The Agency was the sole organization with 
authority in that area, and it had been inappropriate for the Security Council to intervene in matters 
that should have been handled in Vienna. It was time for cases that had been referred to New York to 
be returned to their rightful place. 
80. Finding solutions to safeguards issues would require political determination, diplomacy, and a 
real willingness to negotiate. Such conditions were at odds with some of the statements that had been 
made at the present Conference, which had been riddled with threats and demonstrated a lack of 
respect for the sovereignty of other Member States. Under Article IV.C of the Statute, the Agency was 
based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members. Cuba would not accept the 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 12 
imposition of limits or conditions on sovereignty, as that would violate the fundamental principles of 
international law as set out in the UN Charter. 
81. His country had demonstrated its political will and firm commitment to fulfil its NPT 
obligations. It was proud to be amongst those States in which the Secretariat had found no evidence of 
diverted nuclear material or of undeclared nuclear activities. 
82. The AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear and radiation safety, as 
well as the SecretariatÂs assistance in bolstering national regulatory structures, were laudable. It was to 
be hoped that such assistance would continue in future. 
83. The Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory Agencies had continued to 
make progress towards its objective of maintaining a high level of radiation safety and nuclear security 
in its member States under CubaÂs presidency. He reaffirmed the commitment of his countryÂs 
regulatory authorities to strengthen cooperation in the Latin American region with the AgencyÂs 
support. 
84. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were of great importance and should be provided 
with all the necessary financial and human resources in a stable and consistent manner, through the 
Regular Budget. In spite of five decades of United States-imposed sanctions, his country had 
systematically met its financial obligations to the Agency, including the TCF. It had also improved the 
efficiency of the management of its cooperation programme and provided increasing numbers of 
experts to many Member States. 
85. Cuba supported ARCAL and welcomed the measures being taken to strengthen it by its member 
countries and the Agency alike, a process in which Cuba had participated actively. 
86. The Secretariat had provided valuable support in the implementation of his countryÂs national 
technical cooperation programme and in helping it to overcome the difficulties caused by sanctions. 
87. The AgencyÂs commitment to finding solutions to urgent problems facing humanity was 
noteworthy. Examples included PACT and the work it was doing to tackle the shortage of safe 
drinking water, as demonstrated by the Scientific Forum. 
88. Given the importance of the AgencyÂs remit, the General Conference needed to be revitalized 
and strengthened as a democratic supreme legislative organ involving all Member States. Similarly, 
the composition and functions of the Board of Governors should be analysed with a view to amending 
Article VI of the Statute. In CubaÂs opinion, the BoardÂs membership should be expanded in line with 
the overall number of Member States. 
89. Mr LEBAI JURI (Malaysia) joined other Member States in expressing his countryÂs deepest 
condolences to the Government and people of Japan following the earthquake and tsunami of 
11 March 2011 which had led to the Fukushima nuclear accident. His country stood in solidarity with 
Japan and the international community, and appreciated the tireless efforts of the Japanese authorities 
to bring the situation under control after that unprecedented event. He commended the Director 
General for the AgencyÂs efforts in addressing the issue and the regular briefings given to Member 
States at the height of the accident. 
90. The accident highlighted the importance of adhering to nuclear and radiation safety standards 
and of the Agency assuming a coordinating role in that regard. Malaysia therefore applauded the 
Director GeneralÂs initiative to hold the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011. The 
Conference had achieved its objective of providing political impetus to the process of drawing lessons 
from the Fukushima accident, but his country hoped to see more practical solutions for enhancing 
nuclear safety, particularly in nuclear power plants. In that regard, his country extended its support to 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 13 
JapanÂs proposal to organize a conference on nuclear safety in the second half of 2012 in partnership 
with the Agency. 
91. The Fukushima accident had also highlighted the importance of ensuring that nuclear power 
plants were safe in the face of unprecedented natural disasters. It was important to explore innovative 
technical design and construction techniques, to review safety policies and management procedures, to 
ensure emergency preparedness, and to establish a regulatory framework. His country called on all 
policy makers, nuclear technocrats, scientists and engineers to come together to review and conduct 
R&D work to design innovative, safer nuclear power plants for future generations. As the foremost 
international body in its field, the Agency would be the only logical candidate to lead such efforts, and 
his country looked forward to participating in the process. 
92. As a developing nation, Malaysia valued the technical cooperation programme and its work to 
promote the safe use of nuclear technology. His country reiterated its stand that the programme should 
be based upon Member StatesÂ needs and requests. It should therefore be formulated according to the 
guidelines established in INFCIRC/267. As the capabilities, needs and priorities of Member States 
varied, the prerogative to identify the types of assistance that they might request from the Agency 
should remain primarily with Member States, in line with their respective national developent 
requirements. The process of formulating complementary regional and interregional projects should be 
carried out with a high level of transparency, in consultation with Member States. 
93. His country reiterated that the resources for technical cooperation had to be sufficient, assured 
and predictable. In that regard, his country looked forward to discussions in the working group on 
financing of the AgencyÂs activities about the nature and level of the TCF and its relationship to the 
Regular Budget. His country would play an active role in the debate. The Medium Term Strategy, 
which provided overarching guidance and a general framework for preparing the AgencyÂs 
programme and budgetary cycles, was also important in order to ensure the necessary balance in future 
activities in line with the mandate set out in the Statute. 
94. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation projects in Malaysia were always formulated through 
active engagement and constructive dialogue with the technical cooperation programme and in 
accordance with the needs and priorities identified in the countryÂs national development plans. The 
formulation of effective projects required a dynamic process that took evolving national stakeholder 
requirements into account. As the current technical cooperation cycle was ending, his country had 
made every effort to complete the projects and utilize all available funding. 
95. Technical cooperation was also of relevance in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident. There 
was concern about possible marine contamination in the region. At the April 2011 National 
Representative Meeting in Bali, RCA members had decided to start a project for monitoring and 
benchmarking the regional marine environment. As an RCA member, Malaysia would participate in a 
regional marine benchmark study on the possible impact of the Fukushima radioactive releases in the 
Asia-Pacific region. His country was greatly appreciative of the financial contributions made to that 
project by all donor countries. 
96. Malaysia had always recognized the importance of regional cooperation and had participated 
actively in many regional projects under the aegis of the Agency. It welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to 
create a common framework for nuclear waste and spent fuel management for ASEAN countries 
through a consultancy meeting held in March 2011 and other work in the field of nuclear security and 
safety. It was to be hoped that such efforts would intensify as countries in the region progressed. 
Malaysia further proposed to strengthen regional efforts with more joint activities and sharing of 
regional resources in order to improve the economics of nuclear applications for the benefit of the 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 14 
regional population. It called on the Agency to support and coordinate efforts towards achieving those 
goals, and to make greater use of existing regional groupings. 
97. The availability of qualified personnel was vital in developing and sustaining a radiation 
protection infrastructure. The Agency had made it a top priority to develop the skills, knowledge and 
expertise of individuals across many disciplines where radioactive sources were employed, and now 
offered postgraduate education courses on radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources on a 
regular basis. Since 2000, Malaysia had been one of the countries to host such courses under the 
technical cooperation programme, and a major outcome had been that the Universiti Sains Malaysia 
had launched an MSc in Radiation Science based on the syllabus of those courses. His country 
appreciated the confidence that the Agency had shown by continuing to allow it to host the courses 
and would continue to do so to the best of its ability. 
98. The unprecedented events at Fukushima, coupled with domestic issues, had undoubtedly dented 
public confidence in the use of nuclear technology for peaceful ends. His country looked forward to 
working together with the Agency to address that issue through a systematic programme of public 
information to provide reassurance and encourage acceptance. 
99. Regarding assurances of nuclear fuel supply, Malaysia welcomed continued non-discriminatory 
and transparent discussions under the auspices of the Agency. Developing multilateral approaches to 
the nuclear fuel cycle included, amongst other elements, holding discussions on options for creating 
mecahnisms to assure the supply of nuclear fuel and on possible schemes dealing with the back-end of 
the fuel cycle. Malaysia took note of the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts to establish and improve the 
concept of the the LEU bank facility, but was insistent that any such arrangement should not in any 
way compromise Member StatesÂ inalienable rights to nuclear technology, including the fuel cycle. 
100. Alongside increasing and renewed interest in nuclear power generation from many Member 
States, his country continued to accord high priority to the peaceful use of nuclear science and 
technology for enhanced food and water security, natural resource and environmental management, 
industrial development, and medical applications. Activities in those areas would be underpinned by 
further development in national capabilities for R&D on peaceful nuclear technologies, 
commercialization, development of a more comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, 
technological infrastructure, human capital development, competency verification, public information, 
compliance with the international system of nuclear governance, and engagement in international 
cooperation and relations. 
101. With regard to the development of a more comprehensive legislative and regulatory framework, 
he expressed MalaysiaÂs appreciation to the Agency for having reviewed its new comprehensive 
nuclear law and suggested relevant improvements to strengthen existing legislation. Malaysia had 
enacted a Strategic Trade Act with heavy penalties encompassing export control measures for all 
single- and dual-use strategic goods, including nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile-related items, 
as well as conventional arms. 
102. Malaysia firmly supported the call of the 2010 NPT Review Conference for the convening, in 
consultation with the States of the region, of a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle 
East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. It also therefore 
supported the Director GeneralÂs initiative in convening a forum on that subject to be held in Vienna 
in November 2011 in order to start that process. Other initiatives to create NWFZs in all regions of the 
world, including the South East Asia, the Pacific and the Far East regions, were to be welcomed. 
103. Mr GRIFFITHS (New Zealand) expressed his countryÂs strong support for the NPT and its three 
pillars. New Zealand was dedicated to achieving a world free of nuclear weapons and continued to 
encourage national, regional and global efforts to realize that goal. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 15 
104. New Zealand had welcomed the reaffirmation at the 2010 NPT Review Conference of the 
1995 Resolution on the Middle East and the agreement to convene a conference in 2012 on the 
establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East. The implementation of that significant agreement would require that all Member States 
play their part. His country also supported the Director GeneralÂs decision to convene a forum on that 
subject in Vienna in November 2011 and was encouraged by the positive momentum that was building 
towards the forum, which it saw as an important building block in achieving the Member StatesÂ 
shared goal. 
105. New Zealand was committed to helping to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons through the 
implementation of safeguards under the NPT and recognized the vital role of the Agency in 
underpinning and advancing the non-proliferation agenda. 
106. New Zealand also endorsed the principle that nuclear technology should be available for 
peaceful uses in conformity with Articles II and III of the NPT. It welcomed and supported the 
AgencyÂs work in applying the benefits of nuclear technology to the fields of human health, water 
quality, crop enhancement, and pest control, and was pleased to be an early supporter of the Peaceful 
Uses Initiative. Safeguards, safety, security and waste management all had to be an integral part of the 
development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
107. The nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi had highlighted the vulnerabilities associated with 
nuclear energy, as well as a number of limitations in the existing international framework for nuclear 
safety and emergency response. Although efforts were still under way to resolve the accident and 
lessons might continue to emerge, Japan, the Agency and the international community had taken many 
useful steps to protect against such an accident recurring in the future. The June Ministerial 
Conference and Ministerial Declaration on nuclear safety had been very timely initiatives that had 
enabled Member States to share experiences and preliminary conclusions and that had recognized the 
AgencyÂs central role in coordinating and promoting international cooperation in enhancing global 
nuclear safety. 
108. Full implementation of the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which he trusted the Conference 
would endorse the following day, would strengthen the global nuclear safety regime. Giving urgent 
and full practical effect to the Action Plan was necessary to maintain international confidence, 
including among the public, in a global nuclear safety framework that protected the interests of nuclear 
and non-nuclear countries alike. New Zealand encouraged all Member States, the Secretariat, and 
other relevant bodies to implement the Action Plan as quickly as practicable and to take additional 
measures wherever possible to strengthen nuclear safety in all its aspects. 
109. Beyond the response to Fukushima, New Zealand welcomed the AgencyÂs ongoing work to 
support Member States in strengthening nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety, as well as 
emergency preparedness and response. 
110. As New Zealand was an island nation, the safe maritime transport of radioactive materials was 
an issue of fundamental importance to it. Such shipments ought to take place against a backdrop of the 
highest possible safety and security standards, and appropriate information in advance of any 
transports that might take place must be provided to relevant coastal States. Proper emergency 
response systems must be in operation, and there must be an effective international liability regime in 
place to insure against harm to human health and the environment, as well as possible economic loss 
due to an incident or accident during the transport of radioactive materials. 
111. New Zealand continued to work with interested Member States and the Secretariat to make 
progress on those issues in various ways, including through the annual dialogue between coastal and 
shipping States which had taken place earlier that day. His country also looked forward to a 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 16 
constructive outcome from the AgencyÂs International Conference on the Safe and Secure Transport of 
Radioactive Material to be held in Vienna in October 2011. 
112. New Zealand remained a strong supporter of INLEX and welcomed the proposal in the Action 
Plan to mandate INLEX to facilitate the development of a global nuclear liability regime that would 
address the concerns of all States that might be affected by a nuclear accident or incident, with a view 
to providing appropriate compensation. 
113. The threat of nuclear terrorism remained, and the maintenance of stringent standards of physical 
protection for nuclear material and nuclear facilities was of paramount importance. New Zealand 
recognized the AgencyÂs important role in helping Member States to improve the global nuclear 
security framework and was pleased to have made a further contribution to the NSF in 2011. In 
addition, his country would play an active role in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul and 
would support the work of the WINS on further initiatives to strengthen nuclear security worldwide. 
114. New Zealand attached importance to ensuring that the Agency had all the tools necessary to 
provide robust assurances to the international community that nuclear activities undertaken by States 
were solely for peaceful purposes. 
115. Current proliferation challenges meant that the comprehensive safeguards agreement alone was 
insufficient to provide the Agency with the necessary authority to carry out its verification mandate to 
the full. The additional protocol formed the contemporary verification standard and should always 
feature as a condition in new supply arrangements for nuclear and associated material. All States that 
had not yet done so should conclude and bring into force additional protocols as soon as possible and 
implement them provisionally in the interim. 
116. It remained critical for all cases of non-compliance with safeguards obligations to be resolved in 
full conformity with the Statute and Member StatesÂ respective legal obligations. 
117. New Zealand deplored the DPRKÂs refusal to comply with UN Security Council resolutions and 
cooperate with the Agency. It was deeply concerned by recent reports of a centrifuge enrichment 
facility at the Yongbyon nuclear site and the possible construction of a prototype light water reactor, 
as well as the DPRKÂs extensive and clandestine procurement activities. His country urged the DPRK 
to refrain from further destabilizing acts and to refocus its efforts towards peace and dialogue, 
including its Six-Party Talks commitment to abandon its existing nuclear programme. 
118. His country also shared the international communityÂs concerns about the outstanding questions 
regarding the nature of IranÂs nuclear programme. It was very troubled by the AgencyÂs increasing 
concern about the possible presence in Iran of past or current undisclosed nuclear-related activities 
with a military dimension and urged Iran to fully implement its safeguards agreement and other 
obligations, including the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements and the additional 
protocol. 
119. In June, the Board of Governors had decided that Syria had not met its obligations under its 
safeguards agreement. Syria should resolve without further delay all outstanding questions about the 
exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme and sign, bring into force and implement the 
additional protocol. 
120. The 55th regular session of the General Conference was not business as usual. Member States 
were still in the process of responding to and recovering from the nuclear accident at Fukushima, and 
only time would tell whether the steps collectively taken would be sufficient to effectively address the 
risks associated with nuclear energy. Even as progress was made on nuclear safety, greater challenges 
were posed to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, requiring renewed efforts to 
strengthen nuclear security and safeguards. The Agency had a vital role to play in leading and 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 17 
coordinating those efforts to ensure that nuclear materials were used for exclusively peaceful purposes 
to the benefit of all of humanity. 
121. Mr KARIMOV (Azerbaijan) expressed his countryÂs positive assessment of the AgencyÂs recent 
work and offered its support for further consolidation of the AgencyÂs role and authority in assuring 
non-proliferation and bolstering nuclear security. 
122. In partnership with the Agency and the international community, Azerbaijan was taking the 
necessary steps towards the peaceful use of atomic energy, the prevention of illicit trafficking in 
nuclear and radioactive materials, and the combating of nuclear terrorism. 
123. The events of the past year had once again demonstrated the complexities of the process of 
ensuring universal nuclear and radiation safety and security. The incidents at the Fukushima Daiichi 
power plant after the destructive earthquake and subsequent tsunami had yet again served as a 
reminder of humanityÂs vulnerability in the face of the unpredictable forces of nature. Even the most 
advanced technologies were sometimes powerless in extreme situations. 
124. Against that backdrop, the continuing operation of sub-standard and ageing nuclear power 
plants was all the more worrying. The Armenia nuclear power plant in Metsamor, which was long 
obsolete and did not conform to European safety standards, belonged to that category of the most 
dangerous nuclear power plants. Given its location in an earthquake zone, the plant posed a serious 
threat not only to the South Caucasus, but also to large areas of Europe and Western Asia. The 
mountainous surroundings and lack of water resources made the plant all the more vulnerable, and yet 
in spite of insistent demands from the European Union that the plant be closed and decommissioned, it 
continued to operate, indeed its power level had been raised. Furthermore, the Armenian authorities 
intended to build a new reactor in coming years, which would lead to a significant increase in the risk 
to the lives and health of the public as well as to the environment of the entire region. 
125. It was regrettable that the delegate of Armenia4 had attempted to use the Agency as a platform 
to promote the separatist regime that Armenia had set up in the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of 
Azerbaijan. That illegitimate regime was not recognized by a single State, including Armenia itself, 
and so ArmeniaÂs efforts to legitimize it were doomed to failure. 
126. Azerbaijan had an interest in fostering good relations between the countries of the South 
Caucasus and bolstering security in the region. At the same time, it was not possible to ignore the risks 
posed by ArmeniaÂs plans to build a new nuclear reactor without due transparency and without 
informing neighbouring States of the results of safety review missions. 
127. Armenian representatives claimed that each year, their country undertook up to 10 safety and 
security checks at the Metsamor site, as well as seismic and operational safety checks. Unfortunately, 
however, the reports from those and earlier Agency review missions were still restricted or classified 
and therefore unavailable to Member States neighbouring Armenia. 
128. Furthermore, though neighbouring countries had an interest in the situation, the Armenian 
leadership had refused to allow Azerbaijan, Georgia or Turkey to participate in a review under the 
Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo Convention). 
The Armenian representatives should recall that one of the central aims of the AgencyÂs Action Plan 
on Nuclear Safety was to enhance transparency in the nuclear sphere. Ensuring transparency in all 
issues of nuclear safety through the timely and consistent exchange and distribution of impartial 
information was of particular importance in order to raise levels of trust and safety in the South

Caucasus region. ArmeniaÂs failure to sign up to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and to the Convention on 
Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage was a cause for concern for his country in the 
context of possible transboundary nuclear threats and environmental protection. The most appropriate 
body to tackle those problems in the South Caucasus region was the Agency. Azerbaijan hoped that 
Member States would understand its concerns and call on Armenia to sign up to the relevant Agency 
conventions and implement a more transparent nuclear policy. 
129. His country had a high opinion of the SecretariatÂs activities in implementing its technical 
cooperation strategy and in its efforts to ensure that the cooperation programme corresponded to 
national priorities. Further increasing the effectiveness and level of cooperation was one of the central 
priorities for AzerbaijanÂs work with the Agency. His Government noted the results of cooperation 
that had been achieved to date and was intent on further supporting the AgencyÂs efforts in the sphere 
of non-power nuclear applications. 
130. Currently, in accordance with the Director GeneralÂs proposal that the programme to fight 
cancer be given priority status, two of the five national technical cooperation projects focused on 
improving and strengthening the infrastructure for diagnosing and treating cancers. The National 
Oncology Centre had been equipped with a linear accelerator and a stereotactic radiosurgery system. 
131. In April 2011 in Ganja, AzerbaijanÂs second city, a radiation therapy department had opened at 
the local oncology centre. With Agency involvement, under a national project, a TERABALT device 
containing a cobalt source with approximately 9000 Ci of activity had been commissioned. The 
deviceÂs physical protection had been assessed by international experts as conforming to the most 
stringent requirements and current international safety standards. 
132. Another noteworthy technical cooperation project was that to improve his countryÂs radioactive 
source monitoring capabilities. That project fully conformed to the requirements of the Trilateral 
Initiative of the United States, Russia and the Agency to improve the monitoring of disused 
radioactive sources. Work had been started to improve national legislatory instruments to ensure the 
full implementation of international standards and other relevant requirements for nuclear and 
radiation safety. A strict authorization programme had been set up whereby sources were classified 
according to the risk they posed. An inventory had been completed of all radionuclide sources in Baku 
and on the Absheron peninsula, which together accounted for around 85% of all radiation sources in 
Azerbaijan. 
133. Since the previous yearÂs General Conference session, under the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative, several steps had been taken to ensure the physical protection of sources of ionizing 
radiation. A seminar on the physical protection of radioactive sources and the management of their 
safety had taken place in 2010 with participants from more than 15 State bodies, and in January 2011, 
in partnership with AzerbaijanÂs State Agency for the Regulation of Nuclear and Radiation Activities, 
training courses had been set up on finding abandoned radioactive sources and providing safe storage 
solutions for them. Another project in partnership with the State Agency had been the seminar on 
preventing theft and sabotage at facilities posing a radiation risk in May 2011. In May and June of that 
year, Agency-run regional training courses on response to a nuclear or radiological emergency had 
been held in Baku under regional project RER/9/100. 
134. With Agency collaboration, a great deal of work had been done to train professionals for the 
regulatory body. That was particularly noteworthy as his country had no radiation safety training 
centres. 
135. The AgencyÂs collaborative projects in the field of nuclear science, technology and applications 
had been fruitful, and he called on the Secretariat to build on its work to improve the scientific and 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 19 
technological capabilities of Member States and develop their potential in the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. It was particularly important to further expand the SecretariatÂs partnership with the World 
Nuclear UniversityÂs School on Radioisotopes and increase the numbers of School participants from 
various countries. 
136. Preserving and reinforcing nuclear knowledge by training qualified professionals was important 
both for the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and in order to ensure sustainable development 
and safety the world over. For that reason, his country supported the AgencyÂs intention to set up 
groups within the Secretariat focusing on staff training. 
137. In 2011, as in previous years, his Government had developed national technical cooperation 
projects for the coming biennium (2012Â13) with a focus on nuclear medicine as well as nuclear and 
radiation technologies. 
138. To best diagnose cancer, there were plans to install cyclotron and positron emission tomography 
facilities at the National Oncology Centre and to set up quality control systems for X-ray diagnosis. 
139. Work would continue on establishing a laboratory for radiation processing of materials and 
foodstuffs, improving the management of radioactive sources, and reinforcing nuclear safety 
infrastructure. 
140. Those national projects, along with the 26 regional projects that his country participated in, 
were of exceptional importance for the country. His Government valued the AgencyÂs assistance under 
the technical cooperation programme and was resolute in its intention to work in partnership to 
implement projects in a comprehensive and timely manner, fulfilling all of its financial, technical and 
institutional obligations. He joined previous speakers in commending the AgencyÂs work in 2011, and 
assuring the Agency of his countryÂs support in all its endeavours. 
141. Mr DAAG (Sweden) expressed his countryÂs deepest sympathy and solidarity with the Japanese 
people, who had displayed great resilience, courage and dignity following the earthquake, tsunami and 
subsequent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The Agency had carried out 
important work in assisting Japan, informing Member States about the accident and facilitating 
international support. 
142. The stress tests carried out in Europe to ensure the nuclear safety of future and existing reactors 
had also been adopted by some non-European countries, thus indicating the value of the process. The 
test results and the experience gained from the process would be valuable for improving Agency 
safety guides and reviewing Member StatesÂ organizations. 
143. The successful outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference had given important impetus to 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The agreed action plan demonstrated all partiesÂ common resolve 
to uphold and strengthen the regime and promote disarmament. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was 
fundamental to the non-proliferation regime and to implementation of the NPT. Sweden encouraged 
all States which had not yet done so to conclude and bring into force an additional protocol without 
delay. The protocol, together with the comprehensive safeguards agreement, constituted a robust and 
effective safeguards system which should be considered as the current verification standard. 
144. His country had worked actively for a number of years to advance cooperation on multilateral 
approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. Recent important breakthroughs in that regard included the 
decision of the Board of Governors in December 2010 to establish a nuclear fuel bank under Agency 
control and its decision in March 2011 to support a model agreement on nuclear fuel assurances. 
Sweden welcomed those decisions and looked forward to their full implementation. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 20 
145. In his latest report on the implementation of safeguards in Iran5, the Director General pointed 
out a number of areas which added to concerns regarding the countryÂs nuclear programme. Iran had 
to cooperate fully with the Agency and fulfil its international obligations, including those set by the 
UN Security Council. It needed to address the legitimate concerns of the international community and 
make every effort to establish confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme. 
146. Following the BoardÂs reporting of Syria to the Security Council in June 2011 for 
non-compliance with its safeguards agreement, Sweden urged Syria to cooperate fully with the 
Agency to resolve outstanding issues and bring into force an additional protocol. 
147. It was deeply regrettable that the Agency had not been able to implement safeguards in the 
DPRK since April 2009 and therefore could not draw any safeguards conclusion regarding that 
country. 
148. He reaffirmed his countryÂs support for a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their 
means of delivery in the Middle East. A constructive and consensual approach, including 
confidence-building measures, was necessary to realize that goal. Sweden welcomed the Director 
GeneralÂs initiative to convene the Forum on Experience of Possible Relevance to the Creation of a 
Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone in the Middle East, to be chaired by Ambassador Petersen of Norway, 
and encouraged all Member States to work towards its successful outcome. 
149. The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the 
CPPNM, in conjunction with Agency security and verification activities and national implementation 
of international instruments, were vital to countering nuclear terrorism and the illegal diversion of or 
trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. The self-assessment and benchmarking offered 
under the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention had proven to be invaluable in 
raising national awareness and encouraging the creation of national policies and appropriate legal and 
regulatory systems, and a higher level of safety and radiation protection. 
150. As a prerequisite for embarking on nuclear power programmes, countries should be required to 
set up the necessary technical and regulatory infrastructures for nuclear safety and security. Relevant 
nuclear safety and security instruments and the AgencyÂs safety standards and security guidance 
should be vital tools in such a task. 
151. Sweden welcomed the AgencyÂs contributions to such areas as human health, food security and 
water management through its technical cooperation programme, and recognized the added value of 
the Peaceful Uses Initiative. Sweden contributed to the programme bilaterally and through the 
financial instruments of the European Union. 
152. Following a 20-year process, the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company had 
selected a site for a spent nuclear fuel repository in 2009 and a licence application for construction of 
the repository had been submitted in March 2011. 
153. Sweden welcomed the Euratom directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive 
waste adopted in July 2011, which would help countries of the European Union manage their 
radioactive waste and avoid imposing unnecessary burdens on future generations. 
154. The IPPAS review conducted in Sweden in May 2011 had made important recommendations 
and identified good practices. The country would also host an IRRS mission in February 2012 and 
would undoubtedly benefit from the regulatory experience and expertise of the review team. Sweden 
supported the IRRS and would continue to provide experts to its mission teams.

GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 21 
155. Sweden welcomed the completion of the reviews of the Euratom safety standards and the Basic 
Safety Standards. The new standards would enhance, modernize and harmonize measures taken within 
the international community to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of 
radiation. 
156. His country continued to be active in the field of international nuclear safety and security 
cooperation. In 2010, the annual budget for SwedenÂs bilateral engagement had amounted to 
Â7 million and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority had implemented some 50 projects. 
157. Mr BOKOLE OMPOKA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) said that the current international 
nuclear context was characterized by tragic events in Japan and the ever-growing interest of Agency 
Member States in civil nuclear applications and the acquisition of related technologies. The present 
conference was of great importance as it would mark a revolution in the field. 
158. The present session should focus on the imperative to reinforce the non-proliferation regime and 
guarantees of nuclear safety and security, while promoting the development of peaceful atomic energy 
and nuclear technologies in Member States. His country had defined a nuclear policy that focused on 
the peaceful use of its nuclear potential to meet its socio-economic needs. 
159. He acknowledged the AgencyÂs valued, efficient and long-term collaboration with his country. 
A number of technical cooperation projects implemented in partnership with the Agency had touched 
vital sectors including health care, water management, agronomy and food security. 
160. Regarding water management, applying isotopic methods and nuclear techniques to the 
hydrochemical study of the Mont Amba aquifer had made it possible to identify bodies of water with 
hydrological potential. As a result, it would be possible to carry out hydrological mapping that could 
be used in evaluating and sustainably managing water resources at the national level. 
161. Regarding health and food security, the use of induced mutation techniques had made it possible 
to establish and bolster a long-term national strategy for the fight against malaria. 
162. Furthermore, expertise gained from the long-term operation of the countryÂs two research 
reactors had led to welcome improvements in radiation safety and nuclear security. Thanks to the 
national regulatory infrastructure that had been put in place, his countryÂs reactors were regularly 
inspected and significant recommendations were being implemented. 
163. While his country had committed to move forward in its nuclear programme by modernizing 
and progressively returning its Triga MK II reactor to service, it had now decided that after 30 years in 
operation, the time had come to plan its decommissioning. The AgencyÂs input and technical 
assistance would be required. 
164. Global warming, with its many consequences for ecosystems, was now a reality recognized by 
the international community. In his country, hydroelectric generation was being affected by 
historically low water levels in the Congo River, disrupting power supply to towns and large urban 
centres, with a significant negative impact on the national economy. His country was accordingly 
considering the introduction of nuclear power generation as a reliable alternative energy source in 
order to combat the energy deficit, prepare for future energy demand, reinforce security of supply and 
fight global warming. Like most developing countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was 
glad to be able to rely on the Agency and friendly countries with long experience in the field to 
provide assistance, support and improved technology transfer. 
165. The question of nuclear non-proliferation remained unresolved, alongside that of nuclear 
disarmament. Though a series of forums and meetings had given rise to hopes of a world free of 
nuclear weapons, the establishment of NWFZs was becoming an increasingly distant goal. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 22 
166. Regarding nuclear security, his country was pleased by the significant human and technological 
resources that had been mobilized to combat illicit trafficking and the black market for nuclear 
material at regional and international levels. Its approach was both bilateral and multilateral: it was 
determined to fight those two threats side-by-side with other States, as well as regional and 
international structures. 
167. Accordingly, a joint action plan had been signed at the end of the previous year between his 
Government and that of the United States. The central goal of the agreement was to offer a 
comprehensive, effective response to recurring problems by reinforcing criminal law with respect to 
nuclear offences, securing nuclear installations, and providing training for personnel. The plan also 
included provisions to deploy physical detection facilities at borders. 
168. The Agency must continue to play a key role in promoting peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy. The technological advances made in recent years in developed countries undoubtedly reflected 
the best decisions taken individually and collectively. A global approach was vital in resolving issues 
in which countries had a shared interest. 
169. Mr QUIMBAYA MORALES (Colombia) expressed his countryÂs solidarity with the 
Government of France following the accident at the nuclear waste processing facility at Marcoule and 
reiterated its solidarity with the Government and people of Japan in the wake of the devastating 
consequences of the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March. To strengthen links between the two 
nations, President Santos of Colombia had visited Japan from 12 to 13 September. Colombia 
acknowledged the Japanese GovernmentÂs efforts to take action swiftly and in a transparent manner 
and underscored the response of the international community and the Agency. Colombia urged the 
Agency to continue its support and coordination efforts. 
170. The lessons learned from the accident in Japan highlighted the need to strengthen regulatory and 
control mechanisms to ensure the highest safety standards in nuclear power plant operation and all 
technical and scientific disciplines involving nuclear and radioactive material. In that connection, 
Colombia was party to the CPPNM, the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention, 
and had acceded to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and 
complied with its supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
171. Disarmament and non-proliferation were basic principles of ColombiaÂs foreign policy. To that 
end, it had acceded to all the most important international legal instruments related to disarmament 
and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It was a member of the worldÂs most 
populous NWFZ and was party to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State. Colombia attached great 
importance to the universalization of the NPT. 
172. The AgencyÂs work as regards the application of safeguards was effective, useful and highly 
credible. Colombia urged those countries with outstanding issues vis-Ã -vis the Agency to collaborate 
fully with it so that the world could be assured of the peaceful nature of their nuclear activities. 
173. Colombia, a member of the Agency since 1960, supported its activities aimed at the use of 
atomic energy for peaceful purposes, including technical cooperation. The recent visit by the Director 
General, Mr Yukiya Amano, to Colombia from 5 to 7 July had provided an opportunity to review the 
various cooperation projects under way in the country, which had a great impact on the well-being of 
the population. Mr Amano had met the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Mines and Energy, and Social 
Welfare as well as the Director General of national policy. 
174. Colombia was grateful for Agency support in strengthening its capacities to prevent, detect and 
treat cancer, which continued to be a major cause of death in the country. It hoped that the Agency 
would continue its assistance in that regard. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 23 
175. The first national nuclear security centre, whose purpose was to build and strengthen capacities 
to prevent, detect and respond to terrorist threats involving nuclear and/or radioactive material, had 
been inaugurated in Colombia in October 2010 with Agency cooperation. That had led to the seizure 
of radioactive sources and prosecution of illicit traffickers. Also, the Agency had provided assistance 
with respect to security in a number of cities in Colombia for the world under-20s football 
championship. 
176. Colombia attached great importance to the safe transport of nuclear and radioactive material and 
supported the AgencyÂs work to harmonize national standards in that sphere. 
177. It also attached great importance to the AgencyÂs verification work and was among those 
countries which fully met their obligations; its additional protocol had entered into force in 2009. 
178. In conclusion, he said that the threat of proliferation affected all humankind. Colombia therefore 
supported multilateral bodies in the hope that the existing international system could promote trust, 
peace and security by diplomatic means. 
179. Mr KOUBAA (Tunisia) said that, since becoming a member of the Agency in 1957, Tunisia had 
utilized various peaceful applications of nuclear technology in order to improve its capabilities in such 
fields as health, agriculture, industry, the environment and research. Through its cooperation with the 
Agency it had also been able to share its specific areas of competence and consolidate its ties with 
friendly States. 
180. In view of its increasing energy consumption, Tunisia had no choice but to look into new and 
renewable sources of energy, including the nuclear option. Tunisia took a particular interest in the use 
of nuclear energy for electricity generation and seawater desalination to meet its future needs. 
181. In light of the accident at Fukushima, he underlined the importance of the 2011 General 
Conference in dispelling fears about nuclear safety. In that context, Tunisia had appreciated the 
Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June and 
supported the various measures to be taken by the Agency to raise the level of nuclear installation 
safety and to prevent, as far as possible, any future nuclear accidents. Taking note of the enhancement 
of nuclear installation safety, particularly with regard to legal instruments and technical guidelines, 
that had taken place as a result of the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident, Tunisia called for 
the lessons of the Fukushima accident to be learned and stressed the need to attain the objectives of the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
182. Tunisia had always faithfully honoured its obligations to the Agency whether in the framework 
of the Regular Budget, its contributions to the TCF or its NPCs for technical cooperation projects. 
183. Tunisia was currently implementing 6 national technical cooperation projects and was 
participating with other African States in the implementation of 34 regional projects. In addition, in 
the course of the past year it had accepted 10 trainees on fellowships and scientific visits funded by the 
Agency. Tunisia was eager to develop its cooperation links with the Agency and was submitting its 
project proposals for the 2012Â2013 biennium. It looked forward to receiving financial support from 
friendly countries in support of the democratic movement in Tunisia. 
184. As the host country of the AAEA, Tunisia was satisfied with Â and would welcome further Â 
cooperation between that organization and the Agency, on the one hand, and among the various 
AAEA member States, on the other. 
185. He drew attention to work being done to set up the African Commission on Nuclear Energy 
pursuant to Article 12 of the Pelindaba Treaty, which had entered into force on 15 July 2009. The role 
of the Commission was, inter alia, to review and follow up the application of Agency safeguards to 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 24 
peaceful nuclear activities and to promote cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and 
technology. The Members of the Commission had met in May 2011 to elect its secretariat. Tunisia 
anticipated solid cooperation between the Commission and the Agency. 
186. Tunisia attached special importance to nuclear safeguards and the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons. It remained firmly convinced that nuclear energy should be used only for peaceful purposes. 
In that regard, it had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency, which 
it intended to ratify as soon as it had established an effective legislative and supervisory system for 
that purpose in accordance with international standards. 
187. It was important to make the Middle East a region free of all weapons of mass destruction, 
including nuclear weapons. Tunisia called for the adoption of relevant resolutions in that regard so as 
to attain that much-sought goal. 
Mr Grima (Malta), Vice-President, took the Chair. 
188. Ms KALA (Estonia) said that her country had been deeply touched by the disaster at 
Fukushima. The Government and people of Japan could rely on EstoniaÂs continuing sympathy and 
support. 
189. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had been a wake-up call for the 
global nuclear regime and industry. It had demonstrated that, even in a country with a high level of 
nuclear technology and safety standards, the risk of a serious accident should not be underestimated. 
190. Estonia commended the Director General on his initiative to hold the Ministerial Conference on 
Nuclear Safety in June, which had laid the basis for the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. In that context, 
Estonia supported all measures leading to higher national and international safety standards. It called 
on all States to ensure the safety of their nuclear installations, to assess their safety regularly and 
systematically, and to make the results of stress tests public as soon as possible. 
191. Despite the accident in Japan, nuclear energyÂs share of global energy production continued to 
grow, particularly in view of its contribution to the attainment of greenhouse gas emission targets. 
192. Estonia, which was examining ways of diversifying its energy portfolio, viewed nuclear power 
as a potential clean source of energy. However, further analysis would be required before Estonia 
decided whether to participate in regional nuclear projects or to build its own nuclear power plant. 
193. Even a country without nuclear power, like Estonia, had learned lessons from the Fukushima 
accident. It had learned, firstly, that the competencies of national regulatory bodies Â not only in 
countries with existing plants, but also in those with plans to embark on a nuclear programme Â must 
be increased and the independence of such bodies ensured. 
194. Secondly, the rapid exchange of information during nuclear incidents was imperative for all, 
and most particularly for neighbouring States. Estonia believed that the Agency had a central role to 
play in information sharing. It believed moreover that information exchange was vital under normal 
circumstances in order to keep neighbouring authorities informed about relevant power plant plans. 
195. Estonia emphasized that, while every State had a right to nuclear energy, it also bore the 
responsibility to pursue it safely, to ensure nuclear security and to meet non-proliferation concerns. 
196. In recent years, the security of nuclear and other radioactive materials had become a priority 
issue. Estonia welcomed the work done by the Agency in that regard, particularly through the NSF, 
and would continue contributing to that Fund despite current financial difficulties. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 25 
197. Her country valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation highly and had always contributed its 
target share of the TCF in full. Agency assistance to Estonia had focused mainly on public health 
services; the recent purchase of a linear accelerator to improve cancer treatment at the North Estonia 
Medical Centre was one example. 
198. Estonia paid tribute to the unique role that the Agency had played for more than five decades in 
promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy and called for continuing support for its efforts. 
199. Mr ALKAABI (United Arab Emirates) expressed sympathy, solidarity and support for Japan 
following the natural disaster that had befallen it on 11 March and acknowledged the efforts Japan had 
made to mitigate the consequences of the nuclear accident that had ensued at Fukushima. 
200. The Agency played a vital role in helping Member States to benefit from the use of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. In 2008, the United Arab Emirates, in the hope that nuclear power 
would contribute significantly to its future energy mix, had embarked on a nuclear energy programme 
to meet the growing domestic demand for electricity. In so doing, it was committed to the highest 
standards of safety and security. The national policy for development of that programme endorsed the 
principles of full transparency, non-proliferation and cooperation with the Agency. 
201. In December 2009, the United Arab Emirates had awarded a contract to a Korean consortium to 
design, construct and jointly operate the countryÂs first four nuclear power reactors. The first reactor 
was scheduled to begin commercial operation in 2017. As safety was a high priority, a great deal of 
emphasis was being put on evaluating the lessons learnt from the Fukushima accident. The operator, 
Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation, was cooperating with the Federal Authority for Nuclear 
Regulation and the Agency to implement any standards deemed essential in that regard. The Emirates 
had recently selected a site for construction of the first nuclear power plant and the corresponding 
application had been filed with the regulator. 
202. To ensure the implementation of a successful and sustainable nuclear energy programme, the 
United Arab Emirates was working closely with the Agency and international partners. In January, it 
had received an INIR mission, the outcome of which had been very positive with no major gaps 
having been identified. In addition, it had accumulated valuable experience in the AgencyÂs integrated 
guidance approach for the development of new nuclear energy programmes. 
203. His country had presented its first national report to the fifth review meeting of the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety, where its work on developing nuclear safety infrastructure had been praised. It also 
planned to submit a first national report to the fourth review meeting of the Joint Convention in May 
2012. 
204. In December 2011, the United Arab Emirates would receive its first IRRS, at an 
unprecedentedly early stage in a nuclear programme. He was proud that his country was developing 
into a model of transparency and responsibility for other nuclear newcomers. It had already issued 
11 new regulations for the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear applications and had set up 
licensing and inspection procedures. 
205. The United Arab Emirates was committed to ensuring nuclear security and had taken an active 
part in nuclear security summits. It was involved in the preparations for the next summit, to be held in 
Seoul in 2012. His country had significant oil, construction and medical industries, and so the security 
of radioactive sources was a particularly important issue. It planned to hold expert workshops on the 
topic in the Emirates in two monthsÂ time jointly with the WINS. 
206. The United Arab Emirates called for an enhanced role for the Agency in the global nuclear 
safety regime. In that regard, it welcomed the Director GeneralÂs timely response to the Fukushima 
accident by convening the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety. Joint efforts under the auspices 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 26 
of the Agency aimed at strengthening safety measures were vital to the long-term sustainability of the 
global nuclear industry. His country welcomed the outcomes of that Conference, in particular the 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, which was consistent with the approach taken by the Emirates in 
developing its nuclear programme. 
207. He noted that the Convention on Nuclear Safety, as the only legally binding instrument in the 
field, was a significant international norm for countries with nuclear facilities. He called on all 
countries with nuclear facilities which had not yet done so to accede to that Convention at an early 
date. 
208. The United Arab Emirates appreciated the important role the Agency played in building the 
scientific and technological capabilities of Member States, including the development of human 
resources. In that regard, it strongly supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, which 
enabled many countries to benefit from the AgencyÂs technical expertise in the areas, amongst others, 
of nuclear energy, nuclear security and safety. 
209. He noted that the United Arab Emirates consistently met its financial undertakings to the TCF in 
full and on time. It had benefited from national and regional workshops, training and expert meetings 
and had contributed to technical cooperation activities by providing experts and sharing its experience 
in developing a nuclear programme. 
210. Agency safeguards were a credible means of providing assurance that nuclear material and 
facilities were used exclusively for peaceful purposes. The Agency should be capable of providing 
such assurances for declared as well as undeclared material and activities. To that end, it was essential 
that all Member States bring into force an additional protocol alongside a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement, thereby enabling the Agency to meet its safeguards responsibilities and, as a consequence, 
enhance confidence within the international community. The United Arab Emirates, which had 
brought an additional protocol into force in December 2010, supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts 
to promote greater adherence to that instrument. 
211. His delegation welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts to consult with States of the Middle 
East to facilitate the early application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in 
the region. Further, his country supported all endeavours to facilitate the establishment of an NWFZ in 
the Middle East, including the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum so that the Middle East 
States might learn from the experience of other regions regarding the creation of such a zone. All the 
States of the region must be committed to making a positive contribution in order to achieve that goal. 
Also, all the States of the region Â including Israel Â must accede to the NPT and submit their 
nuclear facilities to comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
212. The United Arab Emirates looked forward to continuing its work with the Agency and to 
supporting it in its pivotal role to promote international cooperation and strengthen global nuclear 
safety, security and non-proliferation. 
213. Mr KUBELKA (Croatia) expressed his countryÂs deepest sympathy to Japan on account of the 
severe human and environmental consequences of the earthquake, tsunami and accident at the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. 
214. Croatia welcomed the various activities undertaken by the Agency in that regard, especially the 
Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety, which had 
provided an opportunity to start the process of learning lessons. Croatia welcomed adoption of the 
ensuing Ministerial Declaration and hoped that Member States would endorse and implement the 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 27 
215. Strengthening the global nuclear safety framework by improving standards in nuclear safety, 
emergency preparedness and radiation protection was a common task and it was important that the 
highest level of safety be achieved. In that regard, Croatia was pleased that an extraordinary meeting 
of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had been called for August 2012 to 
review possibilities for strengthening the Convention. It was essential that the process of reviewing 
relevant standards be transparent so as to restore the somewhat shaken public confidence in the use of 
nuclear energy. 
216. He emphasized the right of every State to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes; 
together with non-proliferation and disarmament, it was one of the main pillars of the NPT. 
217. The electricity generated at the KrÂko nuclear power plant in Slovenia played an important role 
in providing base load power to the Croatian economy and represented about 15% of its total energy 
mix. It was expected that Croatia would make a decision on whether to construct a nuclear power plant 
of its own by the end of 2012 at the latest. 
218. In the field of safety, Croatia had passed a new Act on Radiological and Nuclear Safety in 2010. 
Also, the State Office for Radiological and Nuclear Safety had been established as the competent body 
for activities related to protection from ionizing radiation and nuclear safety, and was now fully 
functional. 
219. At the international level, Croatia was party to, and an active participant in, all the main 
international nuclear safety related instruments. It encouraged all States which had not done so already 
to follow suit. 
220. Croatia supported initiatives to enhance operational safety and to strengthen international 
cooperation in the area of emergency preparedness and response. In that context, it welcomed the 
initiative to revise the Early Notification Convention and to launch the AgencyÂs new Unified System 
for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies. 
221. The comprehensive Agency safeguards agreement and an additional protocol thereto were the 
current verification standard. Croatia urged all States party to the NPT to bring those two instruments 
into force. For its part, Croatia had been implementing integrated safeguards and it had been 
concluded that all its nuclear material was used exclusively for peaceful activities. At the regional 
level, his country had established institutional capacities for preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear and 
other radioactive material. 
222. Croatia appreciated the assistance it had received under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme. The wide range of projects under way and the research agreements it had concluded were 
having a positive impact on the country. It had submitted eight project proposals for the 2012Â2013 
biennium, all of which had been evaluated positively. However, owing to financial constraints, several 
had been delayed until the next programming phase. 
223. Mr STRITAR (Slovenia), having expressed appreciation for the SecretariatÂs work to strengthen 
the Agency safeguards system, said that urgent challenges still lay ahead. Confidence in the nonproliferation 
regime needed to be reinforced in view of the unresolved safeguards issues in some 
countries. The risk of nuclear proliferation remained real and should be combated collectively, 
preferably through the close cooperation of all Member States with the Agency. Furthermore, issues 
relating to new reactors, complex facilities and country-specific approaches posed technological and 
organizational challenges. 
224. All Member States needed to work towards a self-sustaining, robust and effective safeguards 
system that inspired confidence. Such a system provided a solid foundation for nuclear trade and 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 28 
cooperation, security and progress towards nuclear disarmament. SloveniaÂs support for the AgencyÂs 
safeguards activities included its membership of SAGSI. 
225. Slovenia welcomed the increasing number of additional protocols that had been ratified by 
Member States. It urged those that had yet to bring into force a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
together with an additional protocol, the universal verification standard, to do so without delay. 
226. Nuclear security was an important area of Agency activity. It was indispensable in preventing, 
detecting and responding to nuclear terrorism. Amongst other things, the nuclear security programme 
supported advisory and evaluation missions and Slovenia had received an IPPAS mission in 2010, 
which had reviewed all its nuclear installations, yielding valuable recommendations to the national 
authorities. 
227. He noted in that connection that Slovenia had deposited its instrument of ratification for the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and was now party to 14 of 
the 16 United Nations counterterrorism conventions and protocols, including the Amendment to the 
CPPNM. 
228. Having expressed admiration for the response of the Japanese authorities to the horrific disaster 
of 11 March, he said that individual countries and the international community needed to do more as 
regards the provision of updated and reliable information in such cases. In his country, the Slovenian 
Nuclear Safety Administration (SNSA) emergency team had been activated on 12 March and had 
provided information to the public and the media. For some time thereafter it had continued to give 
daily updates on events regarding the Fukushima nuclear accident on its website. 
229. In view of the recession in the global economy, the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme 
was increasingly important for the less developed countries, particularly in the high priority areas of 
health, food, water and environmental issues. It was therefore important for the programme to ensure 
that it gave optimal value for money and every effort should be made to see that each cent was well 
spent. 
230. In 2010, Slovenia had hosted nine Agency regional workshops, training courses, meetings and 
seminars. Also, Slovenian institutions had trained Agency fellows from various developing countries. 
Since 2005, Slovenian experts had been assisting Serbia in the Vinca Institute Nuclear 
Decommissioning project with respect to all aspects of licensing, including review and assessment. 
Slovenia had supported the transport of spent fuel from the Vinca research reactor to the Russian 
Federation and in November 2010 spent fuel had passed through Slovenia and been loaded on a vessel 
in the port of Koper. 
231. Slovenia attached great importance to improving worldwide emergency preparedness and 
response and was active in Agency projects in that area. It was a member of RANET, the Agency 
network which encouraged cooperation in case of emergency and facilitated assistance to the country 
concerned. The Agency could play an indispensable role not only in assisting Member States in 
achieving a high level of emergency preparedness but also in emergency response through its Incident 
and Emergency Centre (IEC). During the recent Fukushima accident, the demand from the public and 
from expert institutions for reliable and updated information from the Agency had been enormous, 
placing great strain on the IEC and other parts of the Agency. 
232. In Slovenia, the SNSAÂs web-based communication system had been extended nationwide to 
incorporate national and local emergency response organizations. The SNSA coordinated radiation 
monitoring and acted as the hub for all radiation monitoring data and, in addition, made 
recommendations for decisions by the Civil Protection Commander. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 29 
233. In 2011, SloveniaÂs parliament had passed a new act to amend the existing Act on Protection 
against Ionizing Radiation and Nuclear Safety. More than 110 of the ActÂs 145 articles had been 
amended. A new Act on Third Party Liability and Insurance had been issued at the end of 2010, 
bringing Slovenia fully into line with the latest Paris and Brussels Convention protocols. In addition, 
Slovenia had completed the nuclear safety requirement harmonization process started by WENRA 
more than a decade previously. The last five WENRA reference levels in the area of personnel 
qualification and training had been incorporated into Slovenian legislation, putting Slovenia among 
the first European Union countries to have fulfilled the WENRA action plan. 
234. The continued safe operation of existing nuclear capacities was a priority for his country. In 
March 2011 the KrÂko nuclear power plant had experienced its first reactor trip since 2005 due to loss 
of external load caused by a malfunction of power line protection in the switchyard. Following a 
strategic decision to prolong operation of that plant, the documentation for design lifetime extension to 
60 years had been prepared, and the independent safety evaluation made by an international team had 
been submitted in April 2011. 
235. The KrÂko nuclear power plant had undergone a mandatory stress test in accordance with the 
specifications laid down by the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group and the European 
Commission following the Fukushima accident. Even before the stress test, the plant had already 
started preparing an upgrading programme which included the procurement of a fire-fighting vehicle, 
additional mobile diesel generators, mobile pumps and air compressors. 
236. Slovenia welcomed the Japanese GovernmentÂs announcement that it would hold an 
international conference on nuclear safety in cooperation with the Agency in 2012. Similarly, his 
country supported the decision to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety in 2012 in order to strengthen the provisions of that important 
document. Nuclear safety and security issues were also about to be addressed at the UN 
Secretary-GeneralÂs high-level meeting on the margins of the General Assembly. It was essential to 
ensure coherence of those activities and the AgencyÂs central role in international cooperation on 
nuclear safety should be supported by all Member States. 
237. In May 2011, Slovenia had passed an important milestone by acceding to the OECD/NEA, thus 
becoming its 30th member. Full membership would entitle Slovenian experts to take part in new 
activities and would mean enhanced cooperation with the NEA. His country had been an observer in 
the seven NEA standing technical committees since 2002 and had joined the OECD in 2010. 
238. In conclusion, he thanked the Director General and the Secretariat for their impartial, 
professional, competent and devoted work in fulfilment of the AgencyÂs statutory obligations. 
239. Mr WIN (Myanmar) expressed his countryÂs appreciation to the Director General and his staff 
for the professionalism, impartiality and objectivity with which they carried out their tasks. 
240. He expressed his countryÂs deepest condolences to the Government and people of Japan for the 
disaster that had occurred in March. The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant had been a 
focus of attention for the international nuclear community and the Agency , and he was confident that 
the Japanese Government, in cooperation with the international community, would be able to stabilize 
the situation in the affected areas and begin reconstruction work shortly. 
241. The non-power applications of nuclear science and technology played an important role in 
helping Member States to address global threats such as climate change, food insecurity, scarcity of 
potable water and the deteriorating environment. Myanmar was particularly supportive of the 
AgencyÂs efforts in the area of water resources assessment and management, including the Water 
Availability Enhancement Project, holding training courses to strengthen Member StatesÂ capabilities, 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 30 
expanding global isotope monitoring networks and preparing isotope hydrology atlases. It also 
welcomed the subject of the 2011 Scientific Forum: ÂWater matters: making a difference with nuclear 
techniquesÂ. 
242. Agency technical cooperation projects had played an important role in promoting the peaceful 
uses of nuclear techniques in Myanmar in areas of particular significance to the national development 
programme. Priority areas were agricultural productivity, livestock production and health, human 
health and nutrition, strengthening of national capacity in nuclear science and technology, radiation 
safety, water resources management, environmental monitoring and industrial applications of 
radioisotopes. 
243. Myanmar had ten active projects in the 2009Â2011 technical cooperation programme, five of 
which were in the field of food and agriculture, two in human health, and three in nuclear science and 
technology. Myanmar had also participated in many regional and interregional projects and had taken 
part in activities under the RCA. His country was grateful for the significant assistance it had received 
from the Agency over the previous year concerning crop improvement through radiation-induced 
mutation, nuclear and radiation safety, nuclear security, the use of radiation in medicine and nuclear 
science and technology applications. 
244. Myanmar was a developing country with limited infrastructure, expertise and human resources 
in nuclear science and technology applications. Efforts were being made to strengthen the national 
infrastructure for the promotion of such applications for peaceful development purposes, and 
Myanmar would appreciate Agency assistance in capacity-building, developing skilled and 
well-trained human resources and establishing the required infrastructure. 
245. His Government acknowledged the support given by the Agency to Member States in enhancing 
worldwide nuclear, radiological, transport and waste safety, including through the development of 
international safety instruments, strengthening national, regional and international emergency 
preparedness and response capabilities, preparing safety standards and guides and improving national 
nuclear safety infrastructures. The prompt assistance provided by the Agency following the 
Fukushima nuclear accident attested to its professionalism in providing emergency response services. 
246. He reiterated MyanmarÂs support for the AgencyÂs efforts to prevent and combat nuclear 
terrorism, strengthen measures for the detection of illicit nuclear trafficking, respond to nuclear 
security incidents, upgrade the physical protection of nuclear facilities, provide quality control of 
nuclear security equipment, promote education in the area of nuclear security, and facilitate and 
implement international nuclear security instruments in Member States. 
247. Myanmar firmly supported global nuclear non-proliferation and a nuclear-weapon-free world. It 
had been party to the NPT since December 1992, had signed a safeguards agreement and SQP 
pursuant to the NPT in 1995 and the CTBT in 1996 and, as a member of ASEAN, had also acceded to 
the SEANWFZ Treaty, which had entered into force in 1997. 
248. In order to ensure that it did not lag behind other countries and to improve the application of 
nuclear technology in the education and health sectors, Myanmar had previously made arrangements 
to carry out nuclear research with the assistance of the Russian Federation. It supported the legitimate 
right of every State to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It was in no position to consider the 
production and use of nuclear weapons, and had halted its previous nuclear research arrangement in 
order to avoid any misunderstanding among the international community. 
249. In conclusion, he thanked the Agency on behalf of his Government for its dedicated efforts in 
promoting the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear energy and expressed the hope that the 
Agency would continue to play a central role in strengthening international collaboration for the 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 31 
continued expansion of nuclear energy and related technologies. He reiterated MyanmarÂs firm 
support for the activities carried out by the Agency in fulfilment of its mandate. 
250. Ms PHETCHARATANA (Thailand) said that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant had presented one of the greatest challenges in nuclear history. As the UN 
Secretary-General had pointed out, the accident had served as a serious wake-up call to the 
international community on the importance of nuclear safety for both accident prevention and impact 
mitigation. 
251. At the June Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety, Thailand had emphasized three essential 
elements for strengthening the global nuclear safety regime: first, the need to strengthen the role of the 
Agency in enhancing the global nuclear safety framework, safety standards and emergency 
preparedness and response; second, transparent information sharing at the national, regional and 
international levels in order to promote transparency and confidence building; and third, effective 
capacity building, in particular for countries planning to embark on a nuclear power programme. 
Thailand was pleased to note that those elements had been incorporated into the Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety, which it hoped would serve as a basis for the global nuclear safety regime and be 
implemented at all levels. Her country also looked forward to the international conference on nuclear 
safety to be organized jointly by the Government of Japan and the Agency in 2012. 
252. Following the Fukushima accident, Thailand had postponed for three years a decision on its 
nuclear power programme. Further studies and research would be undertaken to ensure the highest 
safety standards. 
253. With the use of nuclear power increasing, it was important to build confidence and transparency 
in the safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy. To that end, Thailand had recently hosted an 
international conference on safety, security and safeguards in nuclear energy aimed at enhancing 
cooperation among nuclear regulatory bodies within the South East Asia region. Thailand had 
proposed the establishment of an informal network for the sharing of information and best practices to 
ensure the safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear energy in the region. Preliminary views from 
ASEAN Member States appeared positive, and discussions on the initiative would continue. 
254. Thailand had a number of technical cooperation projects with the Agency in areas vital for the 
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, such as public health, food and nutrition, 
agriculture and industry. She was pleased to announce that Thailand had again pledged 100% of its 
share of the TCF target for 2012. 
255. It was important to raise awareness of the benefits of nuclear technology for development 
among all sectors in Thailand. Her country was grateful to the Deputy Director General for Technical 
Cooperation for his valuable contribution to the Seminar on Nuclear Science and Technology for 
Development held in July in Bangkok. 
256. Thailand supported the Director GeneralÂs initiative to make water the subject of the 
2011 Scientific Forum. Her country had considerable experience in water resources management and 
enjoyed close cooperation with the Agency in that regard through a project on the use of isotope 
hydrology for groundwater resources management. In order to share its experiences with Member 
States, it had organized an exhibition on the use of nuclear techniques for water in Thailand as part of 
the Scientific Forum. 
257. Thailand was also considering the use of nuclear techniques for monitoring and predicting 
coastal and soil erosion in an assessment of natural risks and looked forward to working closely with 
the Agency in that area. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 32 
258. The AgencyÂs important role in safeguards, verification and security was essential to reduce 
nuclear threats and create an environment conducive to the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. Thailand supported the strengthening of Agency safeguards and security frameworks through 
relevant international legal instruments. The universal application of comprehensive safeguards 
agreements and the additional protocol would help to build confidence in the international verification 
system and in the peaceful uses of nuclear and dual-use equipment. 
259. International cooperative frameworks could also contribute to improving global nuclear security 
and to addressing the threat of nuclear terrorism. Thailand looked forward to joining the international 
efforts to further strengthen cooperation on the issue of nuclear security at the 2012 Nuclear Security 
Summit in Seoul and welcomed the UN High-Level Meeting on Safety and Security to be held at 
Headquarters in New York. 
260. Thailand also supported the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum on experience of 
possible relevance to the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East, which it hoped would be conducive 
to the convening of a conference on the Middle East in 2012. 
261. The AgencyÂs role had become increasingly important, and cooperation between the Agency 
and other international organizations and with and among Member States remained essential for the 
effective implementation of measures to strengthen global nuclear safety, security and safeguards. She 
reiterated ThailandÂs full support for and confidence in the work of the Agency under the able 
leadership of its Director General. 
262. Mr MPAY (Cameroon) expressed his condolences to the Government and people of Japan 
following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Cameroon had welcomed the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety held recently in Vienna to draw lessons from that terrible accident. 
While the responsibility for nuclear safety lay primarily with Member States, Cameroon supported the 
Action Plan on Nuclear Safety which would help to strengthen the international nuclear safety regime, 
and hoped that Member States and the Agency would work together to implement the actions 
identified. 
263. Cameroon welcomed the detailed reports on the activities undertaken by the Agency in 2010, in 
particular the Annual Report, the Technical Cooperation Report and the Nuclear Safety Review for the 
Year 2010. His country was pleased that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme for 2010 had 
placed particular emphasis on the fight against cancer, human resources development and capacity 
building, and nuclear and radiation safety. It also appreciated the importance attached to traditional 
areas of activity, namely human health, agricultural productivity and food security, water resources 
management, protection of the environment, industrial radiation applications and sustainable energy 
development. 
264. With regard to cancer treatment, he said that the modernization of existing radiotherapy 
facilities was a major challenge, including for African countries where initial infrastructures had been 
established with Agency technical assistance. Cameroon called upon the Agency to strengthen its 
support for national projects on cancer treatment and noted that searching for new sources of funding 
for such projects was essential to ensure that activities were properly budgeted for and implemented. 
265. Competent and well-trained staff were necessary if nuclear technologies were to be used 
effectively for socio-economic development. That was a challenging area, particularly for developing 
countries, where training infrastructures were poorly equipped or just did not exist. Cameroon 
commended the AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States in developing suitable human resources. The 
project concerning support for human capacity building in Member States (INT/0/083), which 
provided for specialized training to be given to participants from developing countries, should be 
strengthened. The AFRA project on sustaining the regional capability for the utilization of information 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 33 
and communications technologies for human resource development (RAF/0/026) aimed to provide 
ongoing training to ensure that professionals in the nuclear area maintained a high level of expertise. 
The Agency should continue to support that project, giving particular attention to educational 
materials and to the training of trainers. 
266. The University of Ghana and Alexandria University had been chosen by AFRA as regional 
designated centres to promote the academic education of high-level specialists in the nuclear area in 
Africa. Several fellowship students had received higher professional training under the AFRA 
fellowship programme for 2010 and 2011. Cameroon called upon donor countries to support that 
fellowship programme, which already appeared to be one of the best ways of producing a sufficient 
number of suitable regional experts. 
267. Cameroon noted with satisfaction the impressive number of activities carried out by the Agency 
in the area of nuclear and radiation safety, many of which were aimed at raising awareness of the 
international legal framework in the area of nuclear energy. The Agency helped Member States to 
strengthen their national regulatory infrastructures, and Cameroon was grateful for the assistance it 
had received with the revision of its national legislation on nuclear security, safety and safeguards. 
268. The Fukushima accident had revealed shortcomings in the global nuclear safety regime and the 
debates begun at the Ministerial Conference in June had attested to the importance the international 
community attached to the issue. The scale of the accident had demonstrated the need for an 
international and regional approach to nuclear safety and highlighted the importance of taking into 
account the possibility of external events, such as severe natural disasters, when designing nuclear 
facilities. Cameroon supported the AgencyÂs efforts to research innovative nuclear technologies and 
to adopt a multilateral approach to the introduction of nuclear energy. 
269. Cameroon was also in favour of a regional approach to nuclear safety and security. It remained 
committed to the Pelindaba Treaty and hoped that the international community would support the 
actual implementation of that Treaty. 
270. His country welcomed the establishment of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa. 
The self-assessment exercises undertaken by the Forum under Agency supervision helped to 
strengthen regional cooperation and harmonize national regulations. 
271. Cameroon had contributed to organizing regional events concerning nuclear safety in 
collaboration with the Agency. The African Regional Workshop on the Radiation Safety Information 
Monitoring System had been held in YaoundÃ© in March and Cameroon was intending to host the 
fourth meeting of the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa in 2011. 
272. The growing number of Member States and increasing demands for socio-economic 
development were undoubtedly adding to the financial pressure on the Agency. The technical 
cooperation budget should be increased so that nuclear applications could help to further the progress 
made by Member States, particularly developing countries. Given the challenges associated with the 
financing of the technical cooperation programme, Cameroon recommended increasing the 
extrabudgetary contributions of countries and donor organizations and welcomed the steps already 
taken in that regard, including through the Peaceful Uses Initiative. The increase in extrabudgetary 
contributions with respect to the 2009 level, in particular from governments to support project 
implementation in their own countries, was an indication of the importance Member States attached to 
the technical cooperation programme as an engine for socio-economic development. 
273. Cameroon had received equipment that enabled the National Radiation Protection Agency to 
begin the dosimetric monitoring of occupationally exposed workers. It was grateful to the Agency for 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 34 
agreeing to share the cost of a dosimeter reader, of 1500 individual dosimeters and of staff training to 
facilitate the establishment of a professional dosimetry service. 
274. International technical cooperation under the auspices of the Agency was the best mechanism 
for promoting the safe use of nuclear energy in the world. The international community must work 
together with the Agency to face the new nuclear safety challenges illustrated by the Fukushima 
accident. His country remained confident that the Agency would make every effort to strengthen the 
international nuclear safety regime and promote the right of all States, without discrimination, to use 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
275. Mr ROBELO GONZÃLEZ (Nicaragua) expressed his countryÂs condolences to the 
Government and people of Japan following the earthquake, tsunami and consequent accident at 
Fukushima and congratulated them for their magnificent management of the situation. The Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011 had produced a Ministerial Declaration which aimed 
to improve nuclear safety, emergency preparedness and response mechanisms and the protection of 
people and the environment against nuclear radiation. Nicaragua fully supported the action plan 
contained therein. 
276. He expressed his GovernmentÂs gratitude for the work carried out in the country under the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, in particular through PACT. As one of the PACT pilot 
countries, Nicaragua had made great progress in the fields of radiotherapy and nuclear medicine, 
including cancer diagnosis, early detection and treatment, thus reducing the inequality between rich 
and poor countries in that regard. Many Nicaraguans had benefited as a result, and he extended his 
countryÂs thanks to the PACT donor countries. 
277. Nicaragua had demonstrated its full commitment to disarmament and non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons by signing and ratifying the CTBT and accepting the additional protocol. The early 
entry into force of the CTBT was vital to advancing non-proliferation efforts. Any application of 
nuclear technology had to be strictly for peaceful purposes if it were to contribute to the progress and 
welfare of mankind and to the UN Millennium Development Goals. 
278. His Government expressed its solidarity with Iran. Some of the AgencyÂs messages in that 
regard lacked neutrality and independence, especially considering there was a country in the same 
region that had not joined the NPT and whose nuclear facilities were therefore not subject to Agency 
safeguards. Nicaragua was party to the NPT and supported the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It 
called on all countries that had not done so to join the NPT without delay in order to achieve a safe 
and peaceful world. 
279. There was an urgent need for Israel Â an Agency founder State with a considerable nuclear 
weapons arsenal Â to join the NPT and submit its nuclear arsenal to systematic Agency inspections 
with a view to maintaining a peaceful international environment, particularly in the Middle East. 
280. Nicaragua looked forward to the forum on experience of possible relevance to the creation of an 
NWFZ in the Middle East to be held in November 2011 and thanked the Director General for his 
efforts to ensure it contributed constructively to the establishment of such a zone. Nicaragua supported 
all international efforts to that end. 
281. In response to unconfirmed reports that the National Transitional Council of Libya was trying to 
submit its credentials for the 55th session of the General Conference, he said that his country did not 
recognize the Council as the legitimate Government of Libya as it had not been elected 
democratically. Rather, it was the result of aggressions led by certain western States trying to get hold 
of the countryÂs oil and gas. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 35 
282. Mr RIVERA MORA (El Salvador) said that the recent accidents at Fukushima in Japan and 
Marcoule in France had highlighted the vulnerability of nuclear facilities. In addition, the Director 
General had delivered alarming figures in his opening statement6 about activities related to the 
unauthorized possession of nuclear or radioactive material and/or attempts to sell or smuggle such 
material. The world was facing a real security threat. 
283. Nuclear security must therefore remain high on the agenda of the entire international 
community, whether countries possessed nuclear facilities or not. El Salvador would support any 
initiative to improve and strengthen nuclear power plant safety and emergency response to any nuclear 
crisis or accident, particularly when the risk posed was one of regional or global proportions. 
284. Although El Salvador had no nuclear plants, it recognized the right of the developing States to 
use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. At the same time, however, those States had an obligation to 
provide safety guarantees to others in view of the unpredictable consequences of nuclear accidents. 
285. In that context, El Salvador welcomed the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, particularly as regards 
the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response, review and strengthening of the IAEA 
safety standards, and assessment of nuclear power plant safety deficiencies. 
286. Similarly, his Government staunchly supported all instruments and initiatives to strengthen the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime and the general and complete disarmament of all weapons of mass 
destruction. 
287. The NPT should, without delay, become a universal cornerstone in the nuclear disarmament 
process. El Salvador urged those Member States which had not yet done so to accede to the NPT, 
especially States in the Middle East, and called on all the nuclear-weapon States and States possessing 
weapons of mass destruction to take meaningful steps towards the elimination of their arsenals. 
288. El Salvador also urged countries whose nuclear programmes were under question to 
demonstrate good faith and collaborate fully with the Agency. Countries which had withdrawn from 
the NPT should rejoin it as a demonstration of political will and in order to bolster confidence in the 
peaceful nature of their nuclear programmes. 
289. His country believed that having an Agency safeguards agreement and an additional protocol 
thereto in force, enabling verification of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, increased confidence and 
helped to promote, amongst other things, nuclear-weapon-free zones. El Salvador, which had ratified 
both instruments, called on Member States which had not yet signed or brought into force a 
comprehensive Agency safeguards agreement to do so as proof of their commitment to regional and 
world peace and security. 
290. As part of the worldÂs first NWFZ, his country supported all efforts to create such zones in other 
regions. Thus, it welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a forum in November to 
discuss experience of possible relevance to the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East. That forum 
would constitute an important step on the way to the 2012 conference on the same topic. 
291. El Salvador, aware of the importance of nuclear applications in the areas of human health, 
nuclear medicine, food and nutrition security, radiation protection, pest control and soil and water 
management, underscored the vital role played by the Agency in providing technical cooperation to 
developing Member States. In particular, El Salvador commended the Agency, FAO and OIE on their 
successful efforts to eradicate rinderpest. His Government hoped that it would continue to receive the 
AgencyÂs valuable technical assistance in the future.

292. Mr QUIÃONES (Dominican Republic) said that his country, a member of the Agency since 
1957, had benefited from the technical cooperation it had received over the years to develop its 
national nuclear technology capacities in such vital areas as health, agriculture, water resources and 
the environment. The Agency had become an important ally on the Dominican RepublicÂs path to 
sustainable development and his country fully endorsed the AgencyÂs mandate Âto accelerate and 
enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the worldÂ. The 
AgencyÂs task was highly relevant to its Member States now and would remain so in the future. 
293. The Fukushima accident demonstrated the crucial role played by the Agency in the field of 
nuclear safety, specifically as concerned the prevention of such events, coordination of the 
international response to radiological emergencies, assistance to countries affected and the 
minimization of damage to the population and the environment. His country welcomed the steps taken 
by the Agency to strengthen its nuclear safety activities, especially through the Ministerial Conference 
on Nuclear Safety convened in June and the establishment of the resulting Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety. 
294. In recent years, the Dominican Republic had speeded up its accession to the relevant legal 
instruments in the nuclear sphere. It was grateful for the advisory assistance it had been given by the 
Agency in implementing those instruments and in upgrading its national legislative framework. 
295. The Dominican Republic recognized the importance of safeguards and the strengthened Agency 
verification system in providing effective guarantees of the peaceful use of nuclear material. 
296. In the field of security, his country was working closely with the Agency to strengthen its 
regulatory structure through its National Energy Commission. In that regard, it was grateful for the 
assistance the Agency had provided in training personnel in the handling of radioactive sources, the 
disposal of disused sources, the response to radiological incidents and emergencies, and the control of 
illicit trafficking in nuclear material. 
297. In that context, he underlined the excellent results achieved by the Second Coordination 
Meeting under project RLA/9/061 (Strengthening National Systems for Preparedness and Response to 
Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies), held in the Dominican Republic in May 2011 and attended by 
the representatives of 15 Latin American countries. 
298. In recent years, his Government had continued to strengthen its programme of technical 
cooperation with the Agency, with special focus on areas in which nuclear technology could most 
effectively contribute to national development priorities. The CPF which had been signed in 
2009 would be modified in 2012 to bring it into line with the national development strategy that was 
being drawn up by the national authorities. That strategy would set forth a vision for the nationÂs 
long-term socio-economic development. 
299. The current technical cooperation programme with the Agency was helping in, amongst other 
things, the creation of a Centre for Nuclear Applications and Research, strengthening of the 
radiotherapy service in the new national oncology hospital, the evaluation of sedimentation in 
reservoirs, various aspects of human health and the development of human resources in general. 
300. In the next cycle, emphasis would continue to be placed on areas of vital interest. He drew 
attention, in particular, to the project relating to the cyclotron centres enabling the use of advanced 
diagnostics in oncology, neurology and cardiology. In that connection, the Dominican Republic hoped 
to receive Agency support in training the necessary operating personnel. 
301. He commended the Director GeneralÂs 2010 initiative to attach priority to the fight against 
cancer. That had enabled the Agency to enhance the significant contribution made by nuclear 
technology to cancer diagnosis and treatment. Of special note was the support the Agency had 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 37 
provided under PACT. He expressed the hope that activities under that programme would help in 
overcoming the cancer epidemic in countries of the Caribbean region. 
302. His delegation also commended the topic selected for the 2011 Scientific Forum, namely water 
and the contribution that nuclear techniques could make in that area to the sustainable management of 
aquifers, the secure supply of potable water to rural communities and the development of optimal soil 
conservation strategies. 
303. The Dominican Republic had been honoured to assume the chairmanship of ARCAL in 2011. It 
was grateful for Agency support in helping to finance the joint efforts under ARCAL, which had 
brought numerous benefits to Latin America and the Caribbean and had set an example of successful 
regional cooperation. 
304. At its 12th regular meeting, the Board of ARCAL Representatives had approved the projects to 
be implemented in the 2012Â2013 cycle. It was particularly gratifying that those projects included one 
with the Dominican RepublicÂs neighbour, Haiti, the objective of which was to rebuild and maintain 
the human resources needed to apply nuclear science and technology for the countryÂs sustainable 
development and well-being. The Dominican Government would provide support in promoting human 
development in the areas of food production and security, the integrated management of pests, human 
health and the environment. 
305. The Dominican Republic hoped that its chairmanship had contributed to political, institutional 
and technical strengthening of ARCAL and wished Panama well now that it had taken over the chair. 
306. In conclusion, he underlined the immense value of the AgencyÂs activities to the international 
community. 
307. Mr BARROS OREIRO (Uruguay) said that the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant showed manÂs vulnerability against nature. The Agency had reacted efficiently in sending 
technical equipment to Japan and providing information to the international community. The Director 
General had responded quickly and effectively in calling the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety. The Minister of Industry, Energy and Mining of Uruguay had stated at the Conference that 
countries had managed their nuclear plants responsibly and reliably for the preceding 50 years, but it 
was important to review technology, standards and emergency procedures for unforeseen events. 
There was a need for total transparency of information to ensure confidence in the use of nuclear 
power. 
308. His country played a very active role in the work of the United Nations, basing its international 
activities on the UN Charter with a view to achieving a fairer world. As a result, Uruguay had 
developed closer links with the Agency and was particularly committed to the processes of safeguards, 
nuclear verification and non-proliferation, to synergies between nuclear safety and security, and to 
systems for international cooperation. 
309. Despite the international financial crisis of recent years, UruguayÂs GDP had increased, poverty 
in the country had decreased and social inclusion had improved. Uruguay had designed an energy 
policy looking ahead to 2030 which focused on greater use of renewable energy and promotion of 
energy efficiency. A commission made up of representatives from the countryÂs four political parties 
was examining the nuclear option, basing its work on Agency recommendations. Uruguay also chaired 
and participated in the AgencyÂs Technical Working Group on Nuclear Power Infrastructure, which 
advised the Agency on how to support countries weighing up the nuclear power option. 
310. Uruguay attached great importance to the technical cooperation project ÂStrengthening National 
Regulatory Infrastructures for the Control of Radiation SourcesÂ, through which the Agency gave 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 38 
training to staff of regulatory authorities and provided expert services and high-technology equipment 
for conducting regulatory inspections. 
311. He noted the AgencyÂs contribution to protecting the health and safety of workers 
occupationally exposed to radiation, ensuring the protection of patients undergoing medical 
procedures involving radiation, safely managing radioactive waste, strengthening national nuclear 
preparedness and response systems and supporting the radiation protection infrastructure through 
training. 
312. He made special mention of the Ibero-American Forum of Radiological and Nuclear Regulatory 
Agencies, which had been working hard in key new areas of radiation and nuclear safety and enabling 
the exchange of information between regulators through the Ibero-American network. He expressed 
his countryÂs support for and commitment to that initiative and its hope that the Agency would 
intensify its regional cooperation efforts. 
313. For Uruguay, technical cooperation related to social aspects was fundamental, with over 80% of 
nuclear applications in the country used for medical purposes. Uruguay was interested in developing 
its mining sector and the National Directorate for Mining and Geology had been working to that end. 
The country was hoping to implement a technical cooperation project with the Agency in that field. 
314. Uruguay welcomed the Director GeneralÂs recent visit to Latin America, which showed his 
commitment to promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, technical cooperation and nuclear safety 
in the region. 
315. He congratulated the Agency on its initiative to hold the Scientific Forum on water matters 
alongside the present session of the General Conference. Since water was an essential natural resource, 
it was important to know the relationship between water, health and development. Access to safe 
water was a human right, but surface water and groundwater were sometimes contaminated by 
agricultural, stockbreeding and mining activities. The use of nuclear technology had been very 
beneficial to Uruguay in studying its water resources. 
316. The Agency continued to face significant challenges related to evolving political situations, 
international security and nuclear accidents. It needed to continue to promote the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, non-proliferation, the prohibition of nuclear tests and nuclear disarmament. 
317. Finally, he announced that GRULAC would be endorsing UruguayÂs candidature to serve on the 
Board for the period 2012Â2014. 
318. Mr BA HOUSSEYNOU HAMADY (Mauritania) paid tribute to the courage of the Japanese 
people in the aftermath of the Fukushima accident and expressed his countryÂs full solidarity with their 
situation. The tragedy had served as a reminder of the importance of the AgencyÂs role in mastering 
and monitoring the use of the atom. 
319. Civilian nuclear programmes had an important place in development, particularly in electricity 
production, as well as industrial, medical, hydrological and agricultural applications. However, the 
risk to health and the environment remained ever-present. 
320. Though the international community had harnessed civilian nuclear technologies, nuclear 
disasters were nevertheless increasingly challenging against a backdrop of climate change and nuclear 
proliferation. All States had a broadly similar level of exposure in the face of nuclear disasters that 
transcended national borders. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 39 
321. Because of their low level of technical expertise and inadequate human resources, the countries 
of the South were more exposed to the risks presented by the illegal transportation and storage of 
nuclear waste and other sources of ionizing radiation. 
322. For those reasons, the AgencyÂs mandate remained relevant in promoting the safe and secure 
use of civil nuclear technologies for development and preventing new risks associated with natural 
catastrophes, materials trafficking and terrorism. 
323. He praised the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and urged it to continue to follow 
the process of negotiation that had been begun in relation to climate change, and particularly the 
upcoming Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, in South Africa. 
324. The issues arising from the civilian use of nuclear technologies were a reminder of the 
importance of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, from which developing countries in 
particular benefited, and of the pressing need for all countries to sign up to the NPT to ensure a better 
world for future generations. 
325. His country believed in the power of international cooperation to monitor and harness the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technologies and welcomed the decision to organize a forum on 
denuclearization of the Middle East region in November. It also emphasized the need to treat every 
State equally so that the AgencyÂs resolutions and decisions would apply to all. 
326. Since becoming a Member State in 2004, Mauritania had benefited from Agency assistance in 
training, expert missions, technical and financial support for energy planning, hydrogeological 
cartography, the control of animal diseases, and health care, with the acquisition and installation of a 
radiotherapy unit which had been operational since the end of 2010. That unit ensured that patients 
with certain cancers, who would until recently have had to receive treatment abroad at significant 
financial and social cost, could now be treated in their own country. He also thanked the Agency for 
its assistance in setting up a National Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety and Security Authority. 
327. He called on the Agency to continue to support Member States in establishing and maintaining 
national authorities responsible for nuclear safety and security to better protect the general public from 
the effects of ionizing radiation, whether intentionally or accidentally produced. The Agency should 
also promote cooperation between developed and developing countries in civilian nuclear applications. 
That cooperation should not only encompass training and research, but also encourage technology and 
knowledge transfer so that the most disadvantaged countries could change their ways of generating 
and managing waste, producing food, travelling, using water, exploiting natural resources, building 
their homes and meeting their energy needs; in short, the cooperation should facilitate sustainable 
development. 
328. In conclusion, he noted that Mauritania had recently ratified the Early Notification Convention, 
the Assistance Convention and the Joint Convention. 
Ms Dengo Benavides (Costa Rica), Vice-President, took the Chair. 
329. Ms MUTANDIRO (Zimbabwe) said that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities 
remained critical to the efforts of developing countries to achieve socio-economic growth and the 
Millennium Development Goals. Her country valued its strong collaboration with the Agency in areas 
such as crop production, animal health, energy planning, radiation safety, human resources 
development, nuclear medicine and cancer therapy. Through a cost sharing arrangement, the Agency 
was currently assisting with the procurement of much needed radiotherapy equipment, and an 
imPACT mission had visited Zimbabwe earlier in the year to assist the Government with the 
establishment of a comprehensive national cancer control programme. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 40 
330. Her country was grateful to the Agency for the support provided to the National Radiation 
Protection Authority, which had been certified compliant with respect to Thematic Safety Areas 1 
(legislative framework and regulatory structure) and 2 (occupational exposure control). The Radiation 
Protection Authority had recently unveiled a strategic plan for 2012Â2016 and would appreciate 
continued support from the Agency in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of service 
provision. 
331. The early application of rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods in the control of transboundary 
animal diseases had drastically reduced the prevalence of some animal diseases, such as foot-andmouth 
disease, in Zimbabwe and other countries in Africa. The historical milestone achieved with the 
eradication of rinderpest in Africa in 2010 would help to boost the continentÂs economic development. 
The use of other nuclear techniques and the integrated application of pest control programmes, such as 
AU-PATTEC, had also been beneficial for developing countries. 
332. Zimbabwe welcomed the subject of the 2011 Scientific Forum since the availability of clean 
and safe water presented a challenge for many developing countries, as did efficient water resources 
management. Her country was encouraged by the AgencyÂs activities aimed at promoting the efficient 
use of limited water resources. 
333. Zimbabwe joined other Member States in calling for the provision of sufficient, assured and 
predictable financial resources for the technical cooperation programme, and trusted that the 
encouraging increase in funding between 2009 and 2010 was a trend that would continue. She hoped 
that the working group on the budget would serve as a platform for forging understanding and 
agreement on that important issue. 
334. Her country looked forward to continued cooperation with the Agency through the 
implementation of new projects and programmes under its CPF, signed in 2010. In August 2011, 
Zimbabwe had signed the amendment to its SQP. 
335. Turning to nuclear safety, she said that the tragic events at Fukushima had shown how a single 
incident could have ramifications that went beyond national boundaries. The accident had highlighted 
the need to strengthen international, regional and national emergency preparedness and response 
capabilities. The Agency should play a central role in promoting the highest and most robust nuclear 
safety standards and assist Member States in building the capacities and infrastructure to ensure the 
safe and secure use of nuclear energy and technologies. 
336. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety in June had provided a useful platform for 
launching the preliminary assessment of the nuclear incident at Fukushima and an exchange of views 
on lessons learned. She hoped that the General Conference would endorse the Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety. 
337. Her Government supported the AgencyÂs activities in the area of nuclear security and welcomed 
its efforts to support Member States, upon request, through the NSF. Although the highest safety 
standards must be met for all nuclear facilities, safety considerations should not prevent Member 
States from utilizing nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. The Agency had a critical role to play 
in promoting enhanced international cooperation to strengthen safety standards and all applicable 
international regulatory frameworks on nuclear safety and security should come under Agency 
auspices. However, Member States should bear the primary responsibility for safeguarding their 
nuclear facilities. 
338. Zimbabwe was fully supportive of disarmament initiatives aimed at ridding the world of nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. She welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to

the Middle East in November, which would help to build confidence among States in the region and 
contribute to the convening of the United Nations conference on the establishment of a zone free of 
nuclear weapons in the Middle East planned for 2012. 
339. She welcomed the efforts of the Director General to address the gender imbalance within the 
Agency and boost the number of staff from developing countries. Those remained challenging areas, 
particularly at senior levels, and she urged the Director General to further intensify outreach activities 
to highlight the career opportunities open to women. Zimbabwe called on Member States to support 
those activities. 
340. Mr LYSSIOTIS (Cyprus) expressed his countryÂs deep-felt sympathy to the people of Japan 
following the tragic events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and paid tribute to the 
courage and fortitude of the workers at Fukushima, as well as the Japanese authorities, in handling the 
crisis. 
341. His country acknowledged the immediate response of international organizations and the 
broader international community to the Fukushima accident, which had demonstrated that such 
cooperation could bring only positive effects, as it enhanced nuclear safety, emergency preparedness 
and response, and transparency worldwide. The Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety had begun 
the process of ensuring that the international community drew lessons from the accident and worked 
actively and collectively to ensure the implementation of the highest standards of nuclear safety 
globally. His country welcomed the Declaration which had emerged from the June meeting and the 
Action Plan which was awaiting endorsement at the present session. 
342. The accident in Japan, like a number of similar events in the past, had demonstrated the 
transboundary implications of nuclear incidents. The risks associated with the use of nuclear energy 
needed to be addressed further by the international community. His country did not use atomic energy 
and did not plan to introduce nuclear power to its energy mix in the foreseeable future. However, 
neighbouring countriesÂ decisions to operate nuclear power plants gave rise to serious concerns. 
Radiation did not stop at borders and the vulnerability of his countryÂs region to seismic activity 
increased the risks from nuclear power plants in its immediate vicinity. While each country had a 
sovereign right to decide whether to include nuclear power in its energy mix, the international 
community should thoroughly study as a global issue the long-term implications of nuclear energy and 
its sustainability. 
343. His country therefore attached the utmost importance to improving safety standards for nuclear 
power plants worldwide. Accordingly, it had ratified, signed or participated in several international 
conventions, treaties, agreements and other instruments relevant to nuclear safety. As a member of the 
European Union and the Agency, it had established a comprehensive system for radiation protection, 
nuclear safety and nuclear security in line with European and international standards. 
344. Recently, a decision had been taken by the European Union and a number of other countries to 
perform stress tests at nuclear power plants. Such stress tests should be introduced worldwide for all 
existing and planned nuclear plants. They should cover all relevant factors and all risks, whether 
natural or manmade, such as human error, possible terrorist threats and geophysical factors. 
345. It was vital to further improve cooperation, information-sharing and transparency between 
neighbouring countries and globally in order to establish an effective system for emergency 
preparedness and response to nuclear accidents or radiological events with transboundary 
consequences. His country was committed to all initiatives aimed at strengthening the international 
nuclear safety and security regime.

21 September 2011, Page 42 
346. Mr ILLO (Niger) commended the courage and determination of the Japanese people and 
welcomed the AgencyÂs professional, rapid and effective response to the Fukushima nuclear accident. 
Niger supported the twelve-point Action Plan on Nuclear Safety aimed at strengthening the AgencyÂs 
efforts to raise standards of nuclear safety in the world. 
347. Niger was more committed than ever to the AgencyÂs objectives of preventing the use of 
nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes and ensuring that it was utilized in accordance with Agency 
safeguards and safety and security standards. Niger, a major uranium producer, would work 
transparently with the Agency and the international community to ensure that nuclear energy remained 
an engine for development in a world free from nuclear threat. 
348. Throughout its long history of cooperation with the Agency, Niger had acquired practical 
experience that had enabled it to achieve significant progress towards national and international goals 
in relation to non-proliferation, the regulatory framework for safety and security, and radiation 
protection. His Government had ratified the main legal instruments concerning non-proliferation, 
nuclear safety and security and radiation protection. 
349. Niger welcomed the signature, in January 2011, of its CPF for 2010Â2015. Activities would be 
focused on the priority areas of nuclear safety and security, human health, animal resources and 
agriculture, sustainable energy development, improved water resources management and human 
resources development in the area of nuclear science and technology. The projects to be undertaken 
were consistent with the accelerated development and poverty reduction strategy adopted by the 
Government of Niger to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. 
350. His Government was working with PACT and other development partners to implement its 
national cancer control programme. It had set up a cancer treatment centre and a radiology department 
was being built with Agency assistance. The department would be operational in the near future and 
would provide a reference centre for the comprehensive treatment of cancer patients in the subregion. 
351. Niger would become the second largest uranium producer by 2013. His Government was 
mindful of its responsibilities towards the international community and would take all measures to 
ensure that uranium was mined in accordance with national and international standards. 
352. For Niger, like many African countries, electricity production remained an ongoing concern and 
its shortage an obstacle to development. He called for the AgencyÂs assistance in the development of 
an integrated nuclear power programme to meet the demand for electricity in the subregion. Countries 
that already used the technology should encourage training and technology transfer to enable more 
African countries to add nuclear power to their energy mix. 
353. More than 80% of the working population in Niger worked in the farming sector, and his 
country therefore attached great importance to the technical cooperation programmes aimed at 
increasing animal and crop production. The use of nuclear techniques to improve crop varieties and 
nutrition would help to meet challenges associated with food security and the fight against poverty. 
354. Niger was also using isotopic techniques to study the silting-up of the Niger river. 
355. Lastly, he commended the Agency for its assistance under regional and subregional 
programmes and AFRA, to which Niger remained fully committed. 
356. Mr CURIA (Argentina) said that, following the unfortunate events at Fukushima, his country 
had not changed its decision to continue the resurgence of its nuclear activities. However, the accident 
had drawn attention to the importance of nuclear power plant safety in the face of natural catastrophes. 
GC(55)/OR.6

357. Despite delays, construction of the Atucha-2 unit was nearing completion and connection to the 
national grid was anticipated in 2012. The project had yielded valuable experience and specialized 
training that would facilitate further development of the national nuclear power programme. 
Hydrodynamic testing of the fuel elements fabricated for Atucha-2 had been conducted successfully 
using engineering developed by the Argentine National Atomic Energy Commission and the first 
shipments of fuel had been sent to the plant. At the same time, the supply of heavy water from the 
Arroyito production plant was continuing in order to provide the 600 tonnes needed for the initial 
inventory of Atucha-2. 
358. The tasks related to life extension and increasing the generating capacity of the Embalse nuclear 
power plant were progressing. All the preparatory work had been completed, including recent 
finalization of the associated contractual aspects. As with the work relating to the Atucha-2 project, 
high priority would be given to the participation of domestic industry. 
359. There had been significant progress in construction of the CAREM (Argentine-designed 
modular plant) prototype. The milestones reached included finalization of the support infrastructure, 
the implementation of preparatory work at the site selected, and preparation of the technical 
specifications of the reactor building and the pressure vessel. In addition, preliminary site studies had 
been performed for the future construction of a 150 MW commercial CAREM reactor in ArgentinaÂs 
north-western Formosa province. 
360. Argentina, which planned to incorporate some 6000 MW(e) of nuclear power over the next 
20 years, had continued to evaluate the various technologies available for its new nuclear plants. The 
fourth Argentine nuclear power plant, Atucha-3, had already received parliamentary approval. 
361. Work was continuing on the resumption of gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment at the 
Pilcaniyeu Technological Complex and also on preliminary studies of centrifuge and laser isotope 
separation technologies. ArgentinaÂs enrichment-related activities were intended to meet future 
domestic demand for LEU fuel for use: in its heavy water moderated natural uranium power reactors 
(an Argentine technology used successfully since 2001 with much improvement in burnup and savings 
in fuel costs); in the countryÂs six research reactors; potentially in experimental reactors exported to 
other countries; in indigenous CAREM reactors in the medium term; and in reactors that might be 
added to the Argentine grid in the future. 
362. In the field of uranium mining, exploration of the countryÂs geological potential was ongoing. 
Approvals had been granted for the environmental remediation of former uranium mine sites prior to 
the restart of operations. Funding assistance was being provided in that regard by the World Bank in 
the form of a loan. In addition, an investment project for the remediation of production operations at 
the San Rafael Mining Industrial Complex had been approved. 
363. With regard to nuclear technology applications, particularly for human health, the Government 
had been increasing its support for public nuclear medicine centres by providing them with the latest 
equipment. The centres undertook treatment and research and provided training for staff from 
Argentina and other Latin American countries. 
364. Argentina had continued to satisfy the demand for molybdenum-99, both at home and in other 
Latin American countries. The radiopharmaceutical lutetium-177 with a specific activity of 
23.7 Ci/mg had been obtained for the first time in Latin America, enabling labelled monoclonal 
antibodies and peptides to be obtained for the treatment of non-HodgkinÂs lymphoma and cerebral 
gliomas. Furthermore, ArgentinaÂs production cyclotron was already capable of producing gallium-67 
with a national radiochemical module for injection quality. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 44 
365. An important milestone concerning radioisotope production in particular, but also nuclear 
technology research and development, had been the decision to construct a new experimental reactor, 
the RA-10, co-designed with Brazil, with the necessary power and capacity to meet future 
requirements in that area. 
366. Activities had been stepped up in connection with nuclear power and research reactors, the fuel 
cycle, spent fuel and radioactive waste management, and industrial applications of nuclear technology, 
as well as basic scientific research related to nuclear activities. Specialized training was being 
provided with particular emphasis on nuclear reactors, the fuel cycle, radiochemistry and medical 
physics. 
367. Argentina took an active part in international efforts to develop reactors and innovative fuel 
cycles that enhanced operational safety, reduced the generation of radioactive waste and minimized 
nuclear proliferation risks. Of particular note in that regard was INPRO, to which his country regularly 
contributed experts and extrabudgetary funds. 
368. Argentina remained open to establishing and strengthening cooperation in the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. At the multilateral level, it was an active participant in ARCAL and the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, to which it made extrabudgetary contributions. Through its 
collaboration in INPRO, Argentina contributed to activities on seismic risks for nuclear facilities. At 
the bilateral level, it implemented specific cooperation agreements with 32 countries relating to the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
369. He reiterated ArgentinaÂs condolences to Japan with respect to the Fukushima accident, as a 
result of which the difficult, lengthy, but essential, process of reviewing the pertinent nuclear safety 
standards and mechanisms had begun. 
370. Argentina assigned special importance to nuclear, radiological, transport and waste safety, and 
to international cooperation in that area. It was vital that joint efforts be made to ensure a more solid, 
effective and sustainable infrastructure in that regard. 
371. The AgencyÂs nuclear safety standards should be quantitative, objective, measurable and 
comparable and should be adopted by consensus. In that regard, the co-participation of relevant 
organizations in the UN system was desirable where possible. 
372. International safeguards, like nuclear and radiation safety, were especially important for 
facilitating nuclear expansion. They should be developed in an atmosphere of cooperation and 
dialogue between the Agency and Member States and be guided by the principles of 
non-discrimination, quality, technical excellence and objectivity. 
373. He drew attention to the fact that 2011 was the 20-year anniversary of the founding of ABACC. 
An event marking the occasion had been held in his country in July, attended by the foreign ministers 
of Argentina and Brazil and the AgencyÂs Director General, at which the regionÂs commitment to the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy, non-proliferation and the development of regional safeguards had been 
underscored. His Government attached great importance to the cooperation between ABACC and the 
Agency and urged both sides to redouble their efforts in that connection. 
374. Ms BOYLE (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization) said that the Agency and the Commission were key components in the web of 
multilateral institutions working towards cooperative security in the realm of nuclear non-proliferation 
and disarmament. The interaction between the two in 2011 had been unprecedented. 
375. The tragic consequences of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan had been a stark reminder that 
unexpected events could arise which tested capacities to react quickly and efficiently, requiring work 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 45 
to be reprioritized at short notice. The earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident at the Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power plant had triggered all elements of the verification system designed to ensure 
compliance with the CTBT and had served as an unprecedented, high-intensity stress test for the 
Commission to react and share data with CTBT States signatories. It had also proved that the 
CommissionÂs International Monitoring System (IMS) and the transboundary data and data products 
produced by its International Data Centre had wide-ranging civil and scientific applications of direct 
relevance to disaster mitigation. The earthquake and several thousand aftershocks had been 
conclusively detected by dozens of IMS seismic stations worldwide. Data generated by those stations 
had contributed to rapid alerts issued by tsunami warning centres in the Pacific region. Furthermore, 
infrasound detection had provided evidence of explosions at the nuclear power plant. Radionuclide 
and noble gas monitoring stations had provided independent, reliable, real-time, accurate and verified 
data on the global impact of releases from the plant. Following the first detection of enhanced 
radioactivity levels at the Takasaki station 200 km south-west of the power plant, 40 other monitoring 
stations had detected radionuclides released from the plant. In addition, 19 noble gas monitoring 
systems had detected radioactive emissions related to the event. The emissions had been detected by 
all the CTBT radionuclide measurement systems in the northern hemisphere and a few in the southern 
hemisphere. The CommissionÂs atmospheric monitoring tool had predicted with a high degree of 
accuracy which stations and countries were going to be affected by the release. That tool was central 
to CTBT verification and provided information on where the release might have originated and on the 
dispersion of materials, allowing accurate predictions as to when and where detection might be 
expected. 
376. Data related to the nuclear accident had immediately been made available to CTBT States 
signatories, who had recognized that the sharing of information could contribute to national, regional 
and global response efforts, including the mitigation of damage to human health and the environment. 
The information gathered from the IMS radionuclide network had helped assess the global radiation 
situation and the possible conditions of the reactor. Initial estimates of the radioactivity released had 
also been made on the basis of IMS data. The information provided by the Commission had served as 
an independent source for other organizations to assess the situation. 
377. The Commission had subsequently held six technical briefings in which States and international 
organizations had been invited to participate. Together with other international organizations, the 
Commission had been able to provide a more accurate picture of the situation for national 
governments and the general public. The exchange of data and cooperation between the Agency and 
the Commission had therefore been important. The CommissionÂs role in the Inter-Agency Committee 
on Radiological and Nuclear Emergencies was also significant and should be formalized. 
378. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety was an important step in strengthening the global 
nuclear safety framework and the mechanisms of relevant international organizations to ensure that 
necessary assistance was made available promptly after a disaster. Also important was the recently 
published UN system-wide study on the implications of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear 
power plant, which recognized the importance of the CommissionÂs global monitoring network of 
radionuclide stations in nuclear emergencies. The Commission would be represented by its Executive 
Secretary at the High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security to be held in New York the 
following day. 
379. The Commission stood ready to continue its cooperation with the Agency and other relevant 
organizations by providing expertise and data for disaster mitigation. Synergies between organizations 
and existing monitoring systems needed to be enhanced, with due emphasis on the need for 
cost-effectiveness and the utilization of existing expertise. Institutional cooperation and specialized 
knowledge-sharing between regional and international organizations also needed to be fostered and 
maximized. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 46 
380. Over the preceding year, the Commission had further advanced the objectives of the CTBT and 
enhanced its verification regime. 182 States had now signed the Treaty. Guinea was currently in the 
process of depositing its instrument of ratification with the UN Secretary-General, thus bringing the 
number of ratifications to 155. More ratifications and signatures would be forthcoming shortly. That 
testified to the commitment by the vast majority of the international community to giving the Treaty 
full legal standing. Nine of the 44 States listed in Annex 2 to the Treaty had not yet ratified it, thus 
delaying its entry into force. Collective efforts had to be made to secure the remaining ratifications 
while promoting universal adherence. The 7th Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the 
CTBT would be held in New York on 23 September, coinciding with the 15th anniversary of the 
signing of the Treaty. 
381. The IMS was over 80% complete. All signatory States had equal access to all 
verification-related information, with 120 States making use of that opportunity. Scientists and experts 
in over 1200 academic and scientific institutions worldwide had free and transparent access to the 
data. The value of the system, its data and data products had been highlighted during the ÂCTBT: 
Science and Technology 2011Â conference held in June. The conference had brought together more 
than 750 participants Â the vast majority of whom were scientists Â for an in-depth intellectual 
debate on scientific issues related to the CTBTÂs verification system. 
382. Safeguarding the Treaty, its entry into force and its verification regime remained of utmost 
importance for global and regional peace and security and for safety, human welfare and development. 
The necessary capacities and knowledge base had to be maintained and developed to ensure that the 
next generation was equipped to achieve those objectives, namely through training in disarmament, 
monitoring and verification. The objective of the CommissionÂs Capacity Development Initiative was 
to enable all States to participate equally in the implementation of the Treaty and benefit from its 
verification regime. The restructuring, consolidation and integration of training activities under that 
Initiative would help States build and maintain the necessary capacity to overcome the technical, 
scientific, political and legal challenges facing non-proliferation and disarmament. More than 
220 people from nearly 80 countries had participated Â either in person or online Â in the course 
entitled ÂStrengthening Verification, Enhancing Security: The Science and Political Significance of 
the CTBTÂ. Participants had included staff of CTBT national data centres, station operators, 
diplomats, university students and academics. An advanced course on CTBT verification technologies 
was being planned for later that year. It was hoped that the Capacity Development Initiative would 
inspire a new generation of policy and technical experts to pursue careers in the field of 
non-proliferation and disarmament. Investment in the education of future generations and continued 
interaction among the international community and intergovernmental institutions would serve to 
attain a safer and more secure world. 
383. The CTBT provided a platform upon which to measure progress towards multilateralism in 
arms control and international relations. Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation depended on 
increased transparency between States regarding security issues, enhanced cooperation on verification 
activities, and the implementation of security and confidence-building measures, particularly in 
regions prone to conflict. The CTBT and its verification regime embodied those principles both in 
letter and in spirit. 
384. Mr MAHJOUB (Arab Atomic Energy Agency) said that, with the accession of Morocco and 
Mauritania, the AAEA now had 15 Member States from the continents of Asia and Africa. 
385. The AAEA was committed to a cooperation agreement with the Agency (INFCIRC/25/Add.6) 
under which several joint programmes had been implemented. It hoped that such cooperation would 
continue as Arab States took advantage of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for their socio-economic 
development. 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 47 
386. In addition, the AAEA looked forward to assistance to the Arab countries from the advanced 
States with regard to teaching, training and capacity building of human resources. In that connection, 
he expressed gratitude to the Republic of Korea for its efforts to help the AAEA in conducting training 
programmes on nuclear safety and security, radiation protection and nuclear legislation. 
387. The Israeli nuclear capabilities posed a threat to the States of the Middle East and the AAEA 
called for pressure to be exerted on Israel to submit all its installations to Agency control and to accede 
to all the relevant nuclear non-proliferation instruments. That would contribute not only to peace and 
security but also to aspirations to make the Middle East a nuclear-weapon-free zone, following in the 
steps of those created in Africa, Asia and South America. 
388. He emphasized that the peoples of the Middle East had the right to enjoy life without the threat 
of atomic weapons. Everyone had a responsibility to work towards achieving security in the region 
and a world free of nuclear weapons. 
389. Mr MARCUZZO DO CANTO (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of 
Nuclear Materials) said that 2011 had been a very special year for ABACC as it had celebrated its 
20th anniversary. During those years, its principal mandate had been to safeguard all nuclear facilities 
and material in Argentina and Brazil. One of the events held to celebrate the occasion had been an 
important meeting in July in Buenos Aires, attended by the foreign ministers of both countries, the 
AgencyÂs Director General and the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of ABACC. In their speeches, both 
foreign ministers had noted the unique support provided by ABACC to the international 
non-proliferation regime and its important role in promoting cooperation activities in the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. They had also reaffirmed the wish of their governments to continue strengthening 
ABACC. Director General Amano had stated at the meeting that ABACC had been a great success 
and that the Agency was proud to be its partner. On 18 July, the UN Secretary-General had 
congratulated the governments of Argentina and Brazil, saying that ABACC had made a very 
substantial contribution to regional nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by providing a sound 
regional framework for the application of Agency safeguards, and had facilitated the entry into force 
of the Tlatelolco Treaty. ABACCÂs 20th anniversary would also be celebrated with an international 
seminar in Rio de Janeiro in November and a commemorative stand in the VIC rotunda. 
390. The success of ABACC and the independence of its conclusions could be attributed in part to 
the ongoing technical training of its human resources and its use of the latest equipment. In addition, 
its relationship with the Agency, which had been honed over time, allowed both institutions to work 
alongside one another with great objectivity. The mechanisms developed for their joint activities, such 
as the joint use of equipment, also allowed them to optimize their efforts. 
391. The ABACC safeguards system was unique in the world and respected by the international 
community, as proven by the Nuclear Suppliers GroupÂs acceptance of the system as an alternative to 
the additional protocol. There had also been various articles published around the world highlighting 
the success of the system and suggesting that it could be used as a model for other areas. It was 
therefore with satisfaction and anticipation that ABACC had received the news that the 
Director General intended to hold a special forum on the possible contribution of agencies such as 
Euratom and ABACC in setting up similar arrangements in other parts of the world. Such 
arrangements clearly demonstrated the political will of the countries involved to give total 
transparency to their nuclear programmes. The mutual trust built facilitated good understanding 
between the parties and created the necessary conditions for overcoming technological challenges, 
aiding constructive collaboration on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation policies and 
promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. However, the ABACC model obviously could not be 
transposed directly to other regions Â the geopolitical characteristics and cultural differences needed 
GC(55)/OR.6 
21 September 2011, Page 48 
to be taken into account in each case. The idea of forming regional agencies, making use of the 
Âneighbours watching neighboursÂ concept, was definitely worth considering. 
392. Despite the incident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, many countries were still 
considering nuclear expansion. The latest Agency projections predicted there would be approximately 
90 new reactors worldwide by 2030. Such growth would pose great challenges in the field of 
safeguards and non-proliferation. One way of facing future challenges would be to promote the 
creation of independent and reliable regional systems that could operate in coordination with the 
Agency, thus optimizing the resources available. ABACCÂs success could serve as a guide in that 
regard. 
393. As a result of the 99 inspections performed by ABACC inspectors at nuclear facilities in Brazil 
and Argentina in 2010, it could be confirmed that all nuclear material and other items under 
safeguards in those two countries had been used exclusively for peaceful purposes and had been 
adequately accounted for. ABACC had found no indication of non-compliance with the commitments 
undertaken by both countries. 
394. The effectiveness of safeguards could be improved with scientific and technological 
developments. The use of three-dimensional laser images, environmental samples and satellite images 
could strengthen safeguards activities and make them less intrusive. ABACC had developed policies 
to train its staff and constantly update their knowledge so as to keep abreast of such advances. 
395. The exchange of experience and knowledge between ABACC and other bodies involved in 
safeguards Â for example the Agency, Euratom, the United States Department of Energy, the 
European Safeguards Research and Development Association and the Institute of Nuclear Materials 
Management Â was extremely beneficial to all. ABACC thanked them all for 20 years of cooperation 
and joint growth. 
396. A determining factor in the success enjoyed by ABACC was the ongoing support of the 
governments of Brazil and Argentina, demonstrated through many joint declarations, their financial 
support, the preservation of ABACCÂs institutional independence, the support of both countriesÂ 
resident representatives to the Agency and ABACCÂs technical cooperation with the laboratories of 
various organizations and institutions in both countries. 
397. ABACC was committed to applying safeguards in Brazil and Argentina in a transparent 
manner, maintaining the necessary information confidentiality in accordance with the framework 
defined by the Quadripartite Agreement.

(GC(55)/2) 
1. Mr MACOVEI (Romania) said that his country greatly appreciated the action taken by the 
Agency following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, supported the actions 
taken by the Japanese authorities, and acknowledged the efforts made by the international community 
to enhance nuclear safety and radiation protection and strengthen international standards in nuclear 
safety and emergency preparedness and response, as well as appreciating the need to draw lessons 
from the accident. 
2. As the IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June had shown, public 
confidence in the safety of nuclear power had declined dramatically after Fukushima. Given that 
nuclear power would remain important for many countries, it was imperative that nuclear plants built 
in the future met the highest standards of nuclear safety. 
3. Despite the emotional impact of the tragic events caused by the unforeseen magnitude of the 
Japanese earthquake, Romania continued to look upon nuclear power as a significant option for 
meeting its energy needs at low cost and in an environmentally acceptable manner. As a confirmation 
of its commitment, in 2010 it had been granted approval by the European Commission to complete the 
construction of Units 3 and 4 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant. It also planned to build a new 
nuclear power plant which would become operational in the coming decade. The technology to be 
used for the new plant must meet the highest standards of nuclear safety. 
4. With a view to the development of its national nuclear programme, his country had extended its 
participation in INPRO activities and had joined the INPRO-SYNERGIES project as a preliminary 
step towards studies and simulations on a synergistic approach to different fuel cycles. 
5. One of the main responsibilities of a country with a nuclear power programme was managing 
radioactive waste in a responsible and safe manner. Romania had taken important steps to that end by 
planning the development of a national low- and intermediate-level waste repository, to be 
commissioned by 2020, for the operational waste generated by its nuclear power plants. Another 
objective was to commission a national deep geological repository for spent nuclear fuel and 
long-lived waste by 2055. 
6. With regard to non-power nuclear energy applications, his country was committed to 
implementing new medical and industrial image analysis and processing systems, with a special focus 
on early diagnosis and treatment centres for cancer using positron emission tomography. Those 
initiatives had been discussed with the Director General during his visit to Romania. 
7. RomaniaÂs technical cooperation with the Agency had been excellent. Together with the 
Agency, it had organized several international events on topics related to CPF priorities, providing an 
opportunity for experts to exchange experience and knowledge on the safety of nuclear reactors, safety 
assessment, decommissioning of nuclear facilities, planning of human resources and management of 
nuclear power plant lifetimes. 
8. The safe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy was heavily dependent on attracting, 
developing and stabilizing human resources and strengthening nuclear knowledge management, 
including through education and training. Hence the need to promote bilateral and multilateral 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 2 
cooperation among all Member States in that area. In that connection, in January 2011 Romania and 
Jordan had signed a cooperation agreement for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
9. In May 2011, RomaniaÂs National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control, the Norwegian 
Radiation Protection Authority and the Agency had completed an extrabudgetary regional excellence 
programme on safe nuclear energy in Romania. The programme had been funded by a grant from 
Norway through the Norwegian cooperation programme for economic growth and sustainable 
development in Romania. The key aim of the regional excellence programme had been to strengthen 
nuclear safety in Romania, to maintain and enhance safe nuclear power operations with a view to 
avoiding incidents, and to improve safety culture and emergency preparedness and response. Special 
attention had been given to capacity building and knowledge management. 
10. His country fully supported international commitments related to nuclear non-proliferation, 
regional stability and humanitarian assistance and it would continue to endorse activities initiated 
under the NPT. 
11. Over the years, Romania had actively promoted, and continued to promote the AgencyÂs 
activities in the area of nuclear safety and security. International cooperation and adherence to the 
relevant conventions in the nuclear field remained crucial for the global nuclear safety and security 
framework. His country appealed to Member States to accede to the relevant international safety and 
security instruments in order to strengthen efforts to make the world safe and secure. 
12. In the light of the Fukushima accident, a review of the safety of all nuclear plants the world 
over, through a comprehensive and transparent risk and safety assessment, was a matter of high 
priority. The action carried out by the European Union served as an example that could be applied 
internationally. 
13. The year 2011 had been characterized by dramatic events in the nuclear field that had led to a 
global reconsideration of nuclear safety concepts. Nuclear accidents did not respect borders, but 
Romania was convinced that the measures promoted by the Agency would result in improved nuclear 
safety standards. At the same time, every country should take measures to strengthen safety culture 
and public acceptance. In conclusion, he expressed appreciation to the Agency for its efforts in 
assuming a central role in improving nuclear safety and security in the service of the common 
aspirations of peace and welfare throughout the world, based on the benefits that peaceful nuclear 
technologies could bring. 
14. Mr ENKHSAIKHAN (Mongolia) said that the Agency was being called upon to play an 
increasing role in international affairs and its mandate needed to be strengthened accordingly, 
especially with regard to nuclear safety and security. 
15. The nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which had occurred 
25 years after the Chernobyl disaster, compelled new consideration of the measures needed to ensure 
the utmost safety and security at nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. While the two 
accidents were different in nature, they both highlighted the constant need to upgrade safety and 
security. Thus, his country had welcomed the convening of the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear 
Safety in June and the declaration adopted by it on strengthening nuclear safety, emergency 
preparedness and radiation protection of people and the environment worldwide. Mongolia also 
attached great importance to the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety that had recently been adopted 
by the Board of Governors. 
16. The Agency was not only a technical organization that was called upon to play an increasing 
role in promoting freedom from fear or want, nor just a watchdog. It had an important role in 
promoting the goals of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He encouraged the General 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 3 
Conference to take decisions that would promote favourable political conditions for the convening in 
2012 of an international conference on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East. As a country with a well recognized nuclear-weapon-free status, Mongolia fully supported 
international efforts to convene such a conference and, in that connection, it welcomed the 
understanding reached by the Director General with the States concerned to convene a forum on the 
issue in November 2011 which could make a major contribution to the successful convening of the 
aforementioned conference. 
17. Nuclear safety and security were important for all countries, especially those pursuing nuclear 
power or other peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Mongolia was interested in working closely with the 
Agency and its Member States to strengthen national, regional and international standards. It was 
currently working on acceding to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
18. The AgencyÂs technical assistance and cooperation programmes offered important benefits for 
its Member States. Over the preceding eight years, the number of workers in Mongolia who dealt with 
radioactive material had more than tripled. In the preceding year, the country had been designated as 
the eighth PACT Model Demonstration Site country. His Government was committed to developing 
the required capacity in radiotherapy so as to ensure better and more effective early detection and 
treatment of cancer. 
19. With assistance from PACT, Mongolia had drawn up a general action plan on cancer prevention 
and control for 2011Â2021 and adopted a strategic plan for development of radiotherapy covering the 
same period, the implementation of which would enable it to address professionally and more 
effectively the growing threat of cancer and, at the same time, as a PACT Model Demonstration Site 
country, to share its experience with others. 
20. Mongolia was a developing country with limited infrastructure, expertise and human resources. 
It urged the Agency to continue to provide assistance with capacity building, development of skilled 
and well trained human resources, and the establishment of the infrastructure required for nuclear 
activities. There was a need for greater contributions to the TCF and other funding sources so as to 
advance the goals of technical cooperation, as well as programmes and specific projects. Contributions 
made through the Peaceful Uses Initiative were most welcome in that regard and would surely benefit 
many Member States. 
21. In line with its commitment to prevent illicit trafficking in radioactive sources, his Government, 
with technical assistance from other Member States, was installing radiation detection equipment at its 
main border crossings. It was also working with the Agency and Member States to put in place an 
effective system for responding to emergencies, as well as a system for notification, import and export, 
entry point control inspection, and enforcement of radiation safety and security of nuclear and 
radioactive sources. 
22. His country was blessed with uranium resources which it was planning to exploit for its national 
development, including addressing its own growing energy needs. It was well aware that the 
exploitation of its uranium would pose a number of challenges, such as ensuring physical security of 
the nuclear material at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including waste disposal. It would therefore 
be looking to the Agency and international partners for advice on and assistance with the proper 
exploitation of its uranium. Contrary to some press reports, Mongolia was not prepared to enter into 
any commercial nuclear fuel leasing agreement that would allow import of foreign spent nuclear fuel, 
nor to build an international storage depot for spent nuclear fuel in the country. Its first priority was to 
learn more about the nuclear industry, establish the required national capacity and lay solid 
foundations for a true safety culture. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 4 
23. Mongolia was preparing a pre-feasibility study to explore whether nuclear power should be 
included as part of its energy mix and, in doing so, it hoped to work more closely with the Agency to 
benefit from its expert advice and support. 
24. Mr TURDIU (Albania) said that one of his countryÂs foreign policy priorities was its 
commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and to meeting its obligations under 
relevant international treaties. He called on all countries to implement all General Conference 
resolutions and Board of Governors decisions, in particular those aimed at ensuring an effective and 
efficient international safeguards system and at establishing international confidence in the exclusively 
peaceful nature of nuclear programmes. The Agency had an important role to play in facilitating 
nuclear disarmament through verification. 
25. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and other regions would be 
a positive step towards global nuclear disarmament. However, there could be no nuclear-weapon-free 
zone in the Middle East until the States in that region cooperated and peace was established there. 
Albania welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts to convene a forum in Vienna on 
21-22 November 2011 to examine the experience of existing nuclear-weapon-free zones and its 
relevance to the Middle East. All interested Member States should continue to prepare for the regional 
conference planned in 2012 on establishing a zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of 
mass destruction in the Middle East, as called for in the final document of the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference. 
26. The additional protocol to AlbaniaÂs safeguards agreement had entered into force on 
3 November 2010. On 29 June 2011, his country had deposited instruments of accession for the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which conventions would enter into force for 
Albania on 27 September 2011. Albania was also in the process of approving the amendment to the 
CPPNM. 
27. Albania attached great importance to continued cooperation in the field of nuclear security with 
the aim of combating illicit trafficking in radioactive material, preventing terrorist acts and reducing 
radiological threats. Border management and controls had been greatly improved at all checkpoints 
and along land and sea borders. His country participated in the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear 
Terrorism and the Proliferation Security Initiative, was an active member of the illicit trafficking 
database, and showed considerable interest in the AgencyÂs related training and educational 
programmes. It was fully dedicated to the successful implementation of the AgencyÂs global plan to 
combat nuclear terrorism. 
28. Conveying his countryÂs condolences to the people and Government of Japan for the tragic loss 
of human life resulting from the earthquake and tsunami in that country, he said that the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety held in June 2011 had provided an opportunity to start learning lessons 
from the Fukushima accident. The IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety outlined a series of steps to 
help improve nuclear safety, emergency preparedness and the radiation protection of people and the 
environment. The plan should lead to a steady improvement in nuclear safety, and its robust 
implementation would be a significant step forward. 
29. Albania supported the Peaceful Uses Initiative, which not only sought to expand and accelerate 
support for Agency activities that increased access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, but also was a 
critical component of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Through the Initiative, Albania had 
benefited from funds for an assessment mission to make recommendations for improving the 
application of nuclear technologies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Like many other Member 
States, it would be benefiting from that increased support in the coming years. All Member States 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 5 
should support and profit from the Initiative and he called on those in a position to contribute to help it 
reach its US $100 million goal by 2015. 
30. Energy, health, environment, education and nuclear safety and security were the most important 
issues for his country, in line with its development priorities. 
31. Known for its excellent cooperation with the Agency and its successful implementation of its 
national technical cooperation programme, Albania was a PACT Model Demonstration Site country. 
According to its national cancer control strategy, elaborated with the AgencyÂs assistance, the 
countryÂs oncology centre would soon achieve the status of a centre of competence in radiotherapy. 
Albania would continue to be a beneficiary of PACT. It was highly appreciative of the AgencyÂs 
assistance and was fully committed to strengthening cancer control. Improvements had been made at 
the radiotherapy service of the oncology department and at the nuclear medicine service of the Mother 
Teresa University Hospital Centre in Tirana, in close cooperation with the Agency. The radiotherapy 
service would soon benefit from the addition of an electron beam accelerator, and a linear accelerator 
was currently being installed in the neurosurgery department. In April 2011, the nuclear medicine 
service had commissioned a new multi-purpose gamma camera which it had already used to diagnose 
hundreds of patients. The service would soon be expanding its patient care and education and training 
activities. Another gamma camera, for thyroid diagnosis, would be installed by the end of 2011 and 
modern thyroid cancer treatment employing iodine would begin soon. 
32. The Director General had visited Albania in June 2011, meeting top government officials. His 
visit should foster cooperation between Albania and the Agency, especially in the areas of technical 
assistance and nuclear safety and security. 
33. Nuclear power was a viable option for meeting the energy needs of many Member States, but 
any State planning to embark on a nuclear power programme had to establish an appropriate nuclear 
safety infrastructure based on Agency safety standards and the relevant guidance and assistance, with 
the help, inter alia, of effective Agency technical cooperation mechanisms for supporting the safe and 
secure use of nuclear technologies. The legal framework for nuclear safety could be reviewed only 
under the AgencyÂs leadership, and the AgencyÂs safety guidelines should be made compulsory. 
34. Nuclear power contributed significantly to global electricity generation and could not easily be 
replaced. Without it, the goals for reduction of carbon emissions could not be met. HumanityÂs need 
for energy required risks to be taken. The important thing was that those risks were well managed. For 
all its terrors, Fukushima had not demonstrated that they could not be. 
35. Thus, his Government regarded safe and secure nuclear power as a real and reasonable option to 
be taken seriously into consideration, and it had launched a national nuclear programme. A National 
Nuclear Agency had been set up in the preceding year with the main objective of preparing the legal 
and regulatory frameworks for the programme along with the proper infrastructure, inter alia for the 
potential introduction of nuclear power. However, nuclear technology transfer and implementation 
was a long process and international cooperation and assistance, including from the Agency, would be 
needed for many years to come. In that connection, his countryÂs National Nuclear Agency had 
recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Italian National Agency for New 
Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development. 
36. In conclusion, he reiterated his GovernmentÂs full support for the Agency in the fulfilment of all 
its statutory functions under the guidance of its Director General. 
37. Mr AL HAMMADI (Qatar) said that for decades the Agency had played a pivotal role in 
expanding the contribution of atomic energy to world peace and prosperity. It had sought to make 
nuclear energy an environmentally friendly option for meeting growing energy demand, and had 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 6 
promoted nuclear technology and applications as an effective means whereby developing States could 
address socio-economic challenges while meeting all nuclear safety and security requirements. 
38. He commended the Agency, its Director General and experts on organizing the Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011, which had highlighted the AgencyÂs role in establishing 
nuclear safety guidelines and culture and in enhancing safety levels Â with the participation of the 
international community Â in order to overcome the challenges that had arisen following the 
Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. Qatar stressed the need for international solidarity in 
establishing new nuclear safety standards in the light of lessons learned from that accident. At the 
same time, it emphasized that strengthening nuclear safety was a national responsibility. It looked 
forward to adoption by the General Conference of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. 
39. The AgencyÂs safeguards regime was of fundamental importance to international efforts to 
prevent the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and limit the use of nuclear energy to peaceful 
applications for the benefit of humankind. His country was firmly convinced that nuclear weapons and 
other weapons of mass destruction posed a great danger to international peace and security in general, 
and to peace and stability in the Middle East in particular, where the relevant resolutions aimed at 
ridding the region of nuclear weapons had still not been applied. 
40. It was essential that Israel accede to the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State and submit all its 
nuclear installations to Agency safeguards, thereby making the Treaty universal in the region and 
paving the way for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. That would 
provide an incentive to the States in the region to focus on their socio-economic development instead 
of an arms race that only impeded development efforts, exacerbated tensions and led to a confidence 
deficit. Qatar hoped that the related forum to be convened by the Director General in November would 
push efforts forward in that regard and contribute to the success of the planned 2012 conference. It 
looked forward to collaborating with the Agency in preparing the background documentation for that 
conference. 
41. Much time had elapsed since the adoption of the resolution on the Middle East at the 1995 NPT 
Review and Extension Conference and there had been no substantive progress. Whereas the Arab 
States had taken a unified stance in support of the non-proliferation regime and had acceded to the 
NPT, Israel remained the only country in the region outside that important regime, pleading the 
illegality of any international measures that urged it to accede to the Treaty as a non-nuclear-weapon 
State and place its military nuclear installations under comprehensive safeguards. That was a serious 
shortcoming and constituted a threat to regional and international peace and security. The time had 
come for the international community to redress that situation and persuade Israel to accede to the 
NPT regime. 
42. In recent years a number of States, particularly in the Middle East, had shown an interest in 
utilizing nuclear technology for power generation. The State of Qatar endorsed that position but 
considered it vital that such States adhere to the relevant international instruments so as to ensure the 
safety and security of installations, and avoid the potential hazards of contamination. The importance 
thereof had been underscored by the Fukushima accident. One of the lessons learned from that event 
was that all States should be called upon to sign and ratify the relevant instruments in the nuclear 
safety field. 
43. Qatar valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, which contributed to the 
development of human and technical capacities in the field of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. The 
programme had had a great impact on the development plan of his own country, which hoped to 
implement more projects with Agency support and had recently prepared its CPF, defining its future 
needs. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 7 
44. He commended the Director GeneralÂs choice of the topic of adequate water supplies as the 
focus of the AgencyÂs programme for the coming year, underlining the role radioisotopes could play in 
water supply and treatment issues. 
45. In conclusion, he affirmed his countryÂs confidence in the AgencyÂs effectiveness in providing 
technical support to its Member States, thereby strengthening the role of nuclear technology in 
achieving social well-being and economic prosperity, as well as its effectiveness in establishing 
nuclear safety standards and in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons so as to strengthen 
international peace and security. 
46. Mr GRIMA (Malta) said that the recent dramatic events in the Mediterranean region in 
2011 presented the international community not only with unforeseen opportunities but also with new 
challenges. His country valued the important role the Agency played, through its technical assistance 
programme, in promoting the peaceful application of nuclear technology for nuclear energy as well as 
for human health, food and agriculture and the environment. It invited the Agency to increase its focus 
on the Mediterranean region with a view to identifying specific needs arising from the recent 
developments. That might include assistance in the areas of human health and the environment, but 
also training and capacity building in the area of nuclear energy to ensure the highest standards of 
nuclear safety and security. Partnerships with other international organizations and stakeholders, to 
ensure coherence and create synergies with other programmes, were of paramount importance. 
47. He expressed his countryÂs sympathy to the Government and people of Japan for the tragic loss 
of life following the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. The subsequent crisis at the Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power plant had underscored the urgent need for the international community to 
evaluate nuclear safety thoroughly at the global level and learn lessons from the accident in order to 
ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety worldwide. Malta continued to favour more stringent 
environmental and safety checks, as well as more cooperation and information sharing, and it believed 
that tighter controls should be developed and implemented at global level. The Agency should play a 
central role in those efforts, including by further assisting Member States to enhance the safety of their 
nuclear infrastructures and their emergency preparedness and response capabilities. His country 
welcomed the inclusion of those aspects in the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. In Malta, the 
Radiation Protection Board was the competent authority for radiation protection issues, with the 
responsibility and authority to develop regulations and guidance to protect people and the 
environment. 
48. The NPT was an integral and indispensable part of the international nuclear non-proliferation 
regime. Malta recognized the inalienable right of every State to develop nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. However, that right came with international obligations to ensure the highest standards of 
safety and security. The AgencyÂs verification programme remained at the centre of multilateral 
efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear material. Through its verification activities, the Agency also 
had an important role to play in nuclear disarmament. Comprehensive safeguards agreements, together 
with an additional protocol, constituted the current Agency verification standard. All Member States 
had an obligation to preserve and strengthen the verification regime and to refrain from actions that 
could hamper its application. His country urged Member States that had not yet done so to bring into 
force a comprehensive safeguards agreement without delay, as required under the NPT, and to sign 
and ratify an additional protocol as soon as possible. 
49. The nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran remained a matter of serious concern. 
Malta called on Iran to refrain from further enrichment activities, to cooperate fully with the Agency 
and to comply with the requirements of the United Nations Security Council. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 8 
50. Similarly, it called on the DPRK to resume dialogue and cooperation with the Agency without 
delay. Malta supported the six-party talks which, if successful, should lead to the denuclearization of 
the Korean Peninsula. 
51. Illicit trafficking in sensitive nuclear material continued to pose an enormous non-proliferation 
challenge. The potential for malicious acts involving nuclear material remained an ongoing threat and 
required constant vigilance. Malta welcomed the increase in the number of States participating in the 
illicit trafficking database programme and supported measures that enhanced the capabilities of States 
to prevent and respond to illegal acts involving nuclear and other radioactive material. The AgencyÂs 
efforts in implementing activities under the Nuclear Security Plan 2010Â2013 Â including to control 
nuclear material and radiological sources, protect nuclear facilities and strengthen border controls Â 
were particularly appreciated in that regard. 
52. His country continued to be committed to a policy that opposed the proliferation of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, and it fully supported the 
implementation of multilateral treaties and intergovernmental initiatives aimed at preventing 
proliferation and at the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. Accordingly, it fully supported the 
Agency, the OPCW and the CTBTO in their compliance verification tasks. 
53. At national level, Malta had put in place effective control measures to prevent illicit trafficking 
in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery, and related materials, 
including the adoption of legislative measures and the enforcement of sanctions. 
54. Malta continued to support efforts to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
The consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review Conference should serve as a strong basis for future 
action in that regard. The Agency forum on that issue, to be held in November 2011, should make a 
useful contribution to the planned conference to be held in 2012 as a follow-up to the resolution on the 
Middle East adopted at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference. 
55. In conclusion, he commended the Director General and the Secretariat on their professional 
work over the preceding 12 months. 
56. Ms AYITTEY (Ghana) underscored the continued importance and relevance of the Agency to 
the world, particularly in ensuring that nuclear technology and its applications continued to be used for 
peaceful purposes. 
57. In the area of nuclear safety and security, she noted that the AgencyÂs focus was on 
strengthening global emergency preparedness through collaborative activities with Member States. In 
the aftermath of the Fukushima nuclear power plant accident following the devastating earthquake and 
tsunami that had struck Japan in March 2011, it was imperative that emergency response and 
preparedness in Member States be enhanced. Ghana urged the Agency to step up its assistance to 
Member States in that connection. She expressed the hope that the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety would provide important guidelines to help prevent, where possible, and limit both natural and 
man-made accidents and their devastating effects, which was essential to restore public confidence in 
the use of nuclear power. 
58. Her country commended the Agency on its work to ensure that Member States, and particularly 
developing countries, acquired the ability to apply nuclear and isotopic techniques in various ways. 
Under GhanaÂs CPF, its scientists at its national research institutions and universities were engaging in 
activities geared towards food preservation, medical sterilization, crop improvement, pest management 
and isotope hydrology in order to improve the standard of living of the population, thereby 
contributing to the nationÂs sustainability and complementing the GovernmentÂs efforts to achieve the 
Millennium Development Goals. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 9 
59. Ghana appreciated the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, which was aimed at the 
peaceful and safe use of nuclear technology for development, and it particularly appreciated the 
priority accorded to human health and agriculture. It remained committed to PACT, through which the 
Agency was assisting developing countries to integrate radiotherapy into the broader framework of 
cancer control. As the seventh PACT Model Demonstration Site country, Ghana would continue its 
collaboration with the Agency with a view to improving and enhancing national and subregional 
control programmes. 
60. She thanked those Member States Â notably the United States of America, Japan and the 
Republic of Korea Â that were providing extrabudgetary funding to ensure the success of 
programmes under the AgencyÂs Peaceful Uses Initiative, which sought to expand and accelerate 
support for the AgencyÂs activities in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Her country urged other 
international partners to join and support the Initiative, with a view to raising the target figure of 
$100 million by 2015. She thanked the United States of America for providing funds for a cancer 
assessment mission to Ghana and expressed the conviction that the missionÂs recommendations would 
be useful in further improving treatment of cancer in Ghana through the use of nuclear techniques. 
61. As one of the pilot sites for the Virtual University for Cancer Control and Regional Training 
Network in Africa, Ghana would be working closely with the Agency to facilitate education and 
training of cancer care professionals in their home countries. 
62. Ghana was also developing a comprehensive groundwater assessment programme, using isotope 
hydrology to map its groundwater resources. The project would require the establishment of a tritium 
analysis laboratory and her country looked forward to the AgencyÂs assistance with that project. 
63. Her country had been very supportive of the initiative by AFRA Member States to establish the 
AFRA Network for Education in Nuclear Science and Technology and it was confident that the 
establishment of that networkÂs web portal in Ghana would contribute to efforts to enhance, preserve 
and maintain nuclear knowledge in Africa. Similarly, the AgencyÂs designation of GhanaÂs Graduate 
School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences as a regional centre for professional and higher education for 
the AFRA masterÂs programme in nuclear science and technology should contribute towards that 
objective. Preparations were well advanced for the commencement of the postgraduate diploma course 
in radiation protection and safety of radiation sources in November 2011. The tireless efforts and 
unwavering support of the AgencyÂs Department of Technical Cooperation for that project and other 
AFRA regional projects was very much appreciated. 
64. Ghana had recently ratified and acceded to a number of international instruments relating to 
nuclear safeguards, safety and security, including the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety. The Ghana Nuclear Regulatory Authority would also soon be established. Those measures 
demonstrated GhanaÂs continued commitment to playing its part in advancing the activities of the 
Agency, and its continued support for the Agency in the discharge of its statutory duties. 
65. Mr MABHONGO (South Africa) said that the NPT remained the only international instrument 
that contained both the legal commitment to eliminate nuclear weapons and measures to prevent 
nuclear proliferation, while recognizing the inalienable right of States to the peaceful use of nuclear 
science, technology and applications. It was therefore imperative that all State parties to it be held 
accountable for compliance with their NPT obligations. The current intensification of 
non-proliferation measures must be matched with measures to strengthen the other two pillars of the 
Treaty. During the 20 years since it had signed the NPT, South Africa had worked closely with the 
Agency on the verification of its nuclear material and on strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 10 
system, including via the additional protocol which, while voluntary, was an important 
confidence-building measure, especially for States with advanced nuclear programmes and facilities. 
66. Nuclear energy could play an important role in energy security to promote sustainable 
development and poverty alleviation, and in mitigating climate change. In line with its obligations 
under the UNFCCC, his country would continue to contribute to global efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and to implement strategies to mitigate climate change. It was pursuing clean energy 
and expansion of energy access, as well as diversification. Under its 20-year integrated resource plan, 
it was foreseen that nuclear energy would contribute 23% of all new electricity generation capacity 
by 2030, and the first reactor of the new fleet would be connected to the grid by 2023. The Nuclear 
Energy Corporation of South Africa would play an instrumental role in the nuclear power expansion 
programme, serving as the hub for the supply of specialized local content for the future fleet and for 
access to the global supply chain of reactor vendors and fuel manufacturers. Since 2007, Eskom, South 
AfricaÂs electricity utility, had conducted an environmental impact assessment of three potential sites 
for nuclear power plants. The final report thereon would be submitted for evaluation and 
environmental authorization at the end of 2011. 
67. In 2011, unprecedented attention had been paid to nuclear safety, partly in response to the 
Fukushima accident, after which his country had realized it could not take a Âbusiness as usualÂ 
approach to that subject. The national nuclear regulator had directed its licensees, including the 
operator of the Koeberg nuclear power plant, to conduct safety reassessments and stress tests at all 
nuclear installations, addressing such issues as design requirements and potential vulnerabilities in the 
design, with a particular emphasis on defence in depth and low-probability beyond design basis 
accidents, prolonged power blackouts, availability of cooling water and cooling of spent fuel under 
severe accident conditions. 
68. The review and enhancement of South AfricaÂs regulatory framework would also cover safety 
standards relevant to the siting of nuclear installations and severe accident management, including 
multiple hazards and emergency preparedness and response. Having adhered to most of the obligatory 
and voluntary nuclear safety conventions and best practice measures, South Africa would work to 
ensure that its national nuclear regulator participated in the AgencyÂs safety standards committees, 
working groups and technical committees. As further evidence of its strong commitment to nuclear 
safety, it would host an Agency technical meeting on nuclear safety culture in Cape Town in 
December 2011. Also, the national nuclear regulator had used the AgencyÂs methodology and 
associated self-assessment tool to identify gaps between its safety standards and Agency safety 
standards, with a view to strengthening regulatory effectiveness. 
69. South Africa continued to play a leading role in the Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in 
Africa, which had been given impetus by the entry into force of the Pelindaba Treaty. To complement 
the initiatives of the Forum, the heads of nuclear regulatory bodies in the Southern African 
Development Community had agreed to establish a nuclear regulatory network. 
70. His country had embarked on efforts to improve public understanding of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear science, technology and applications, spearheaded by the Visitor Centre of the Nuclear Energy 
Corporation of South Africa at the Pelindaba site which had officially opened in February 2011 and 
had already attracted large numbers of visitors. 
71. His country looked forward to the adoption by the General Conference of the IAEA Action Plan 
on Nuclear Safety and urged all Member States to spare no effort in implementing it. 
72. With a view to consolidating a culture of nuclear security, South Africa would continue to build 
on work undertaken within the framework of its INSSP. Support would be provided to the Nuclear 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 11 
Energy Corporation of South Africa for the establishment of a nuclear forensics laboratory to extend 
its existing radioanalytical capabilities. 
73. In the area of human health, his country was playing a leading role in the stabilization of the 
global radioisotope market, following the supply disruptions of recent years. A major investment had 
been made in the LEU-based production of molybdenum-99. 
74. South Africa attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and 
would be pledging its full share of the TCF target for the next cycle. He commended AFRA on its 
projects in support of AfricaÂs development and the ultimate attainment of some of the Millennium 
Development Goals. South Africa would work towards ensuring that AFRA and the Agency assisted 
with the prompt commencement of the activities of the African Commission on Nuclear Energy. 
75. His Government had recently offered to provide support for, and contribute Â1.5 million to 
activities to improve veterinary capacities in sub-Saharan Africa. 
76. South Africa welcomed the decision of the 2010 NPT Review Conference on the need for full 
implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East. He called for efforts to be stepped up to 
organize the planned conference in 2012 on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East and looked forward to the forum on that subject to be held in November 2011. The 
success of those initiatives should contribute to the broader goal of achieving peace in that region. 
77. It was important to enhance implementation of the decision taken some years ago to expand the 
composition of the Board of Governors. South Africa had completed its ratification of the amendment 
to Article VI of the Statute and had deposited its instrument of ratification. 
78. There was a need to revitalize and strengthen the Agency, enhancing its relevance and ensuring 
that it was equipped to meet the challenges the world was facing in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
79. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that the concerns raised by the Fukushima accident had led to 
the adoption of an action plan following the Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety held in 
June 2011. Algeria supported that plan which reaffirmed the AgencyÂs key role in arriving at an 
international consensus on what should be the high level of safety required to protect the public and 
the environment against the adverse effects of ionizing radiation. Universal application of basic safety 
standards and principles and regular reviews of nuclear power plants in operation throughout the 
world, including those in the Mediterranean region, should help promote regional confidence. Sharing 
of information remained crucial. 
80. Her country attached great importance to security, which required constant vigilance. The 
high-level conference of the countries of the Sahel on security, partnership and sustainable 
development held in Algiers on 6Â7 September had highlighted the risks and dangers posed by the 
uncontrolled circulation of weapons for the security and stability of the region. 
81. As a party to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, Algeria had put in 
place emergency plans at all its nuclear facilities, including those housing radioactive sources, 
implementation of which would be governed by regulations currently being promulgated. 
82. Her country appreciated the assistance provided by the Department of Nuclear Safety and 
Security and the Department of Technical Cooperation with improving its national safety 
infrastructure, in particular for radiation protection, and with the 2011Â2013 plan for training 
30 Algerian trainers and the establishment of the Algerian Institute of Nuclear Engineering, which 
would offer specialized training at national and regional level including in the field of nuclear and 
radiation safety. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 12 
83. Algeria, which was currently chairing the African Group, reaffirmed its commitment to 
international cooperation as a means of disseminating scientific knowledge and realizing the AgencyÂs 
prime objective Âto accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and 
prosperity throughout the worldÂ. 
84. In designing technical cooperation programmes and projects, it was vital to ensure that the 
priorities of Member States were also those of the Agency, thereby reinforcing Member StatesÂ sense 
of belonging to the Agency, with due respect for diversity and without discrimination. 
85. The Agency needed to be given the human and financial resources it required to meet its 
growing responsibilities and expanded role, which might have implications for the Statute, bearing in 
mind the greater demand for energy, capacity building and the infrastructure needed for the nuclear 
power programmes planned in many countries including her own. 
86. Thus, determined efforts must be made to speed up the ratification of the amendment to 
Article VI of the Statute in order to expand, and achieve balanced geographical representation in the 
Board. 
87. Algeria attached equal importance to the AgencyÂs different statutory missions, i.e. promotion 
of nuclear energy, safety and security, and safeguards. Balance in the AgencyÂs operations could not 
fail to have a positive impact on its contribution to peace and security, socio-economic development 
and environmental protection. 
88. Global projections showed that nuclear energy continued to be perceived as a credible and clean 
alternative which could help reduce greenhouse emissions by half, and whose applications contributed 
to the well-being of the public. Moreover, improvements in nuclear safety brought about by advances 
in the nuclear industry, which was developing increasingly safe reactors, could benefit States 
interested in embarking on a nuclear power programme. 
89. As had been reaffirmed by the 2010 NPT Review Conference, potential risks related to 
proliferation of sensitive technologies as a result of the nuclear renaissance, and the safety concerns 
raised by the Fukushima accident, should not be used to deprive States party to the NPT of the 
peaceful uses of the atom. Similarly, limitations on the rights and choices of States with regard to the 
nuclear fuel cycle were unacceptable as long as they respected their international obligations. Those 
rights were just compensation for the enormous concession made by non-nuclear-weapon States in 
acceding to the NPT. 
90. The Agency played a unique role in verifying compliance with disarmament and 
non-proliferation obligations and maintaining peace and security. The impartiality and professionalism 
of the Secretariat in the discharge of that important task must be protected against any interference or 
undue pressure. 
91. As one of the first countries to ratify the Pelindaba Treaty, Algeria welcomed the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa as a sign of regional confidence and a tangible contribution to 
the goals of non-proliferation and general and complete disarmament. 
92. In that connection, the forum on experience of possible relevance to the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East to be organized by the Agency in Vienna on 
22Â23 November 2011 was a positive step towards realizing one of the 13 steps recommended by the 
2000 NPT Review Conference. As a non-nuclear-weapon State committed to disarmament and 
non-proliferation, Algeria was of the view that the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East would help put an end to the imbalance created by Israeli nuclear capabilities that were 
not subject to Agency safeguards, a situation which was unacceptable to the States in the region that 
were party to the NPT. She encouraged the Director General and the Agency to continue their efforts 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 13 
to achieve universality of the NPT and safeguards agreements, and the establishment of a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
93. Her country also urged the nuclear-weapon States to comply with their non-proliferation and 
disarmament obligations under Article VI of the NPT. It appreciated the decision by the United States 
of America and the Russian Federation to entrust the Agency with the verification of unused 
weapons-grade plutonium, the results of which exercise would be made available to Member States. 
94. The theme of water resources that had been selected for the Scientific Forum during the current 
General Conference was much appreciated. Africa, and particularly the countries of the Sahel, had 
great expectations of that event and hoped to benefit in that field from the use of nuclear techniques. 
Algeria encouraged the Agency to design a multi-year programme on water resources in Africa which 
would cover transboundary aquifers. The parties concerned and development banks should be 
requested to contribute to that initiative. For its part, Algeria was prepared to host a regional centre on 
the use of isotope techniques in exploiting groundwater resources. 
95. Her country was pleased that the global cancer problem had been included in the Millennium 
Development Goals. It encouraged the Agency to continue its efforts to mobilize financial and human 
resources to consolidate the PACT programme and inter-agency partnerships, notably with the WHO. 
96. Algeria would be hosting an imPACT mission in October 2011 on strengthening national 
capacities for combating and controlling cancer and was prepared to continue providing assistance to 
African States, and to host a regional cancer therapy centre in cooperation with the Agency. 
97. Her country also appreciated the initiative of the United States of America in making an 
extrabudgetary contribution for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy from which an Algerian project on 
the production of short-lived radioisotopes had benefited and, it was hoped, would continue to do so in 
the future. 
98. Bilateral cooperation between Algeria and the Agency should improve in quality with the 
finalization of the CPF for 2011Â2020. That document identified socio-economic development 
objectives and priorities requiring the use of nuclear applications and would be signed by the end of 
2011. 
99. Algeria, which held the presidency of AFRA during 2011Â2012, welcomed the designation of 
two regional designated centres for nuclear medicine and secondary standards dosimetry, and the new 
AFRA regional centre for training in radiation protection. 
100. Her country continued to contribute to the AFRA programme by making available its experts in 
areas of interest for Africa, including health, radiation protection and nuclear safety. It was also 
pursuing its cooperation under the AFRA Regional Strategic Cooperative Framework for 2008Â2013, 
and it encouraged the Secretariat to contribute to the next Regional Strategic Cooperative Framework 
for 2014Â2018, and to assist with activities in progress in the key areas of health, energy and water 
resources and those scheduled for 2012Â2013. 
101. Agency assistance was also requested to facilitate interaction and synergies between the AFRA 
programme and the African Commission on Nuclear Energy established pursuant to the Pelindaba 
Treaty in connection with nuclear applications, regulation, safety and security. The Peaceful Uses 
Initiative and the partners of the Pelindaba Treaty might also be involved. 
102. Another subject of interest for Algeria and many African countries was control of the desert 
locust, which required continuing collaboration between the Agency and the FAO to develop nuclear 
techniques to combat that pest. Setting up a training centre in that field would be particularly useful. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 14 
103. Mr SOULAMA (Burkina Faso) said that the current session of the General Conference was 
taking place against a global backdrop that called for profound reflection on the use of nuclear 
technology. The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident had reminded the international 
community of the vital necessity of according the greatest importance to safety and security at nuclear 
installations. 
104. With a view to strengthening the global nuclear safety framework, Member States should 
systematically review the safety of their nuclear installations, and other facilities housing ionizing 
radiation sources, in close cooperation with the Agency. States should also work effectively to 
strengthen their capacity as regards defining and evaluating the risks associated with establishing and 
operating such facilities. 
105. Nuclear technology was undeniably a global asset benefiting humankind. However, its use 
required the application of appropriate safety and security measures, without which the world would 
be exposed to major disasters with transboundary consequences. In that connection, the Agency 
played a vital role via capacity building, technical assistance and the promotion of a safety and 
security culture in Member States. The lessons of past nuclear accidents clearly demonstrated the need 
to strengthen the international legal framework governing such matters in order to limit the effects of 
accidents on people and the environment. 
106. He expressed appreciation to the Director General for convening the IAEA Ministerial 
Conference on Nuclear Safety in June 2011, pursuant to which the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear 
Safety had been developed and submitted to the General Conference. 
107. Despite the Fukushima accident, which continued to prompt cautious reactions with respect to 
the development of nuclear power, his Government was still convinced that nuclear power remained 
one of the solutions to energy problems and climate change and it encouraged the Agency to pursue its 
awareness-raising activities, alongside sound and practical action plans to promote nuclear safety and 
security. 
108. In recent years, Burkina Faso had experienced a mining boom and increased use of radiation 
sources in a range of socio-economic areas. As the various uses of radiation sources could lead to 
safety and security problems, his Government had requested an INSServ mission from the Agency, 
which had taken place in June 2010 and had reviewed security measures, visited the installations 
concerned and interviewed officials and technical staff. The mission had concluded that his country 
had made progress in implementing a legal framework for safety and security of nuclear material and 
other radiation sources, and for safeguards. However, Agency technical assistance with the 
development and implementation of an INSSP was essential. 
109. Burkina Faso supported international initiatives to promote the effective application of the Code 
of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and universalization of the safeguards 
system, which was a prerequisite and an effective tool for combating nuclear terrorism. 
110. His country fulfilled its obligations under its SQP and additional protocol, making the 
appropriate declarations regularly to the Department of Safeguards and thus demonstrating its 
commitment to use the atom exclusively for socio-economic development. 
111. Of the three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities, his country attached great importance to the 
technical cooperation programme and welcomed the positive results of that programme in key 
socio-economic sectors such as health, food security, water resources management and energy demand 
planning. 
112. However, its ambitions went beyond traditional technical assistance, including promoting 
education and research in nuclear science and technology, which would facilitate strengthening of 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 15 
national capacity. Its second CPF, covering the period 2012Â2016, had been prepared with the aim of 
strengthening its partnership with the Agency. 
113. Burkina Faso acknowledged the commitment of Member States to meeting their financial 
obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency in order to enable it to carry out its mandate, and his Government 
pledged to pay its share of the TCF for 2011. 
114. Noting with satisfaction the spirit and atmosphere pervading the current session of the General 
Conference, he expressed the conviction that its conclusions would help the Agency to do even more 
to fulfil its prime role of promoting socio-economic progress, peace and international security. 
115. Mr ELWAZER (Palestine) said that the AgencyÂs role in the world had been spotlighted by the 
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan. His country expressed its profound 
sympathy to the Japanese people and Government in their tragic ordeal. They had demonstrated great 
prowess in responding to the crisis and stabilizing the nuclear reactors. 
116. The eradication of rinderpest was a major achievement for the Agency. He also commended the 
successful organization of the Scientific Forum on water matters. 
117. The Agency played an important role in promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy in such 
areas as electricity generation and seawater desalination. Palestine also attached great importance to 
activities aimed at ensuring the safety and security of radiation sources and nuclear material. Strict 
rules and guidelines should be applied in controlling and monitoring the transport of such material. 
118. Agency safeguards were cornerstone of the organizationÂs mandate and of the non-proliferation 
regime and were supported by most countries. Palestine therefore called on States that had not yet 
signed a comprehensive safeguards agreement to do so as soon as possible, and urged all States party 
to the NPT to comply with their obligations under the Treaty. 
119. Palestine welcomed the outcome of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, especially the decision 
to convene an international conference in 2012 on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons 
and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. It urged the Agency to discharge its 
responsibility to prepare the basic documents for the conference, and called on the international 
community to do its utmost to compel Israel to sign the NPT. 
120. The technical cooperation programme played a major role in promoting the transfer of nuclear 
technology for peaceful purposes, especially in developing countries. The use of nuclear energy was 
becoming increasingly widespread in such areas as medicine, agriculture, industry and research, since 
the applications were easy to use and produced fast and reliable results. 
121. Palestine was grateful to the staff of the Agency for their cooperation and for the funding of a 
number of projects aimed at establishing an infrastructure that could be used to develop peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy. It hoped that such cooperation would assist Palestine in protecting the environment, 
building its technical and scientific capacity, and training human resources to respond to radiological 
and nuclear emergencies, especially since the Israeli Dimona reactor was only 40 kilometres away. 
That reactor was a perennial source of concern and a major threat to the Palestinian people and 
environment because of its age and the possibility of a nuclear accident. 
122. Under its technical cooperation programme, the Agency had agreed to fund projects on the 
following topics: establishing legislative and regulatory infrastructure, safety infrastructure for 
occupational and medical exposure control, and emergency response capabilities; supporting 
education and training in radiation protection and medical physics; integrated management of fruit 
flies in Palestinian territories; and improving local Palestinian wheat and barley varieties for salt and 
drought resistance through mutation breeding and biotechnology. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 16 
123. Those projects could not succeed, however, if the Israeli occupation authorities continued to 
impede the delivery of materials and equipment provided by the Agency. For instance, materials and 
equipment that had been purchased in 2008 were still in the AgencyÂs warehouses at Seibersdorf 
awaiting delivery. He hoped that the Agency would take effective action to assist the Palestinian 
authorities in overcoming such obstacles, and would send Agency experts to visit Palestine in order to 
assess the current nuclear and radiological situation. 
124. The Palestinian people had the right to live in peace and security, like other peoples in the 
region, in an independent Palestinian State with its capital in Jerusalem. With a view to ending Israeli 
occupation of Palestinian land, the Palestinian leadership, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas, was 
determined to exercise PalestineÂs right to demand full membership of the United Nations. It was fully 
qualified for statehood, as many States and international organizations had attested, including the 
World Bank. However, that did not mean that Palestine had abandoned negotiations. He availed 
himself of that opportunity to thank all countries that had recognized the Palestinian State within the 
borders that had existed prior to 4 June 1967 with its capital in Jerusalem. His people were confident 
that the Palestinian dream of becoming the 194th member State of the United Nations would come 
true. 
Mr Feruta (Romania), President, took the Chair. 
Â Oral report by the Chairperson of the Committee of the 
Whole 
125. Ms YPARRAGUIRRE (Philippines), Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole, presented the 
outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 22, 23 and 24.

Measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste 
safety (agenda item 14) 
139. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(55)/L.3 was adopted. 
140. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to consultations he had conducted, he intended, on behalf 
of the General Conference, to convey the text of the resolution just adopted, along with the text of the 
IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, to the United Nations Secretary-General, who was the convener 
of the High-Level Meeting on Nuclear Safety and Security to be held that day in New York. He took it 
that that was agreeable to the Conference. 
141. It was so agreed. 
142. Mr NAKANE (Japan) welcomed the adoption of the resolution entitled ÂMeasures to strengthen 
international cooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safetyÂ and thanked the delegation 
of Australia, and especially Ms Ada Cheung, for producing the consensus resolution. His country also 
welcomed the ConferenceÂs endorsement of the BoardÂs decision to approve the IAEA Action Plan on 
Nuclear Safety. In order to strengthen further global nuclear safety, the action plan would need to be 
implemented promptly and effectively through the taking of concrete measures by, and cooperation 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 18 
between Member States, international organizations and other stakeholders. Japan was committed to 
implementing the action plan with a view to achieving substantive results in a timely manner, and 
there would be discussions on progress made in that regard at the high-level conference on nuclear 
safety to be organized by Japan and the Agency in his country in the second half of 2012. Japan would 
also continue to share knowledge acquired and lessons learned from the Fukushima accident and the 
subsequent restoration efforts with the international community. 
Strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and applications 
(agenda item 17) 
143. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions contained in document 
GC(55)/L.7 were adopted. 
Amendment to Article VI of the Statute (agenda item 22) 
144. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft decision set out in document 
GC(55)/L.4 was adopted. 
Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee (agenda item 23) 
145. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, Mr Anthony Hinton of Canada and 
Mr Sardar Adnan Rashid of Pakistan were elected as alternate members of the AgencyÂs Staff Pension 
Committee. 
Personnel Matters (agenda item 24) 
146. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolutions contained in document 
GC(55)/L.6 were adopted. 
25. Examination of delegatesÂ credentials 
(GC(55)/27) 
147. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met that day as a credentials committee 
to examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. Since 
that meeting, the Secretariat had received credentials in due form for the delegate from Kuwait. 
148. After discussion, the Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft 
resolution contained in paragraph 7 of its report (GC(55)/27), with the reservations and positions 
expressed therein. 
149. Mr POURMAND TEHRANI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his countryÂs acceptance of 
the recommendation did not in any way constitute recognition of the Zionist Israeli regime. 
150. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) expressed serious concern over 
the decision of the Committee to propose that the General Conference recognize the transitional 
government of Libya and allow it to be represented in the Conference as a Member State since, in 
VenezuelaÂs view, it was not a body properly constituted in accordance with the sovereign will of the 
Libyan people. 
151. The Foreign Ministers of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, which represented 
8 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, had issued a communiquÃ© on 9 September 2011 
concerning the military intervention by NATO in Libya and, in that context, Venezuela reiterated its 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 19 
rejection of that intervention which had forced a regime change under the pretext of preventive war, 
and which had exploited the United Nations Security Council to further the geopolitical and economic 
interests of the major powers in violation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). His country 
remained firmly committed to the principle of the self-determination of peoples enshrined in the 
Charter of the United Nations and it called for an immediate and unconditional cessation of NATOÂs 
bombing and military intervention in Libya. Efforts must be made to find a peaceful resolution of the 
situation in Libya through negotiation and dialogue. 
152. The de facto recognition by the General Conference of a transitional authority imposed through 
foreign military intervention would set a grave precedent and led Venezuela to express its 
reservations. It would be better that LibyaÂs seat remain unoccupied until it had a government 
legitimately constituted without foreign intervention and representing the Libyan peopleÂs freely 
expressed choice. 
153. Mr MARSÃN AGUILERA (Cuba) said that his country joined Venezuela in expressing its 
reservations concerning the report of the Committee. Cuba did not recognize the transitional 
government of Libya because it had not been democratically elected by the Libyan people. The change 
of government had been brought about by an illegitimate military operation launched by NATO with 
the clear objective of appropriating LibyaÂs strategic resources. NATOÂs intervention was a violation 
of LibyaÂs sovereignty made possible through the abuse of the mandates of United Nations bodies and 
of the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Cuba, in keeping with the position it 
had expressed in the United Nations General Assembly, and with the declaration of the Foreign 
Ministers of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, rejected the illegitimate aggression committed 
against the Libyan people which had caused the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians. It likewise 
rejected the attempt to adopt a similar approach in Syria, taking advantage of the political difficulties 
that country was experiencing, and reaffirmed its support for the self-determination of all peoples. 
154. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt) said that his countryÂs endorsement of the report of the Committee 
should not be interpreted as recognition of the borders of Israel or of that countryÂs occupation of 
territories in 1967, including the West Bank, the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip and the Shebaa Farms. 
155. Mr ROSENBERG GUERRERO (Ecuador) said his country joined Venezuela and Cuba in 
expressing its reservations with regard to the grave situation in Libya, in keeping with the recent 
statement by the Foreign Ministers of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. Ecuador could not 
accept the fact that LibyaÂs seat at the General Conference was occupied by a transitional and 
illegitimate authority which had been imposed through foreign military intervention. It should be 
occupied only by a legitimately elected government constituted without foreign intervention as the 
expression of the free and sovereign will of the Libyan people. 
156. The PRESIDENT asked the representative of Ecuador to clarify whether his country rejected 
the report of the Committee or whether it merely wished to record its reservations. 
157. Mr ROSENBERG GUERRERO (Ecuador) said that his country accepted the report with the 
reservations expressed. 
158. Mr ROBELO GONZÃLEZ (Nicaragua) said that his country joined Cuba, Venezuela and 
Ecuador, and the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, in expressing its reservations 
regarding the transitional government of Libya. 
159. Mr QUEISI (Jordan) said that his countryÂs acceptance of the credentials of the delegate of 
Israel to the current session of the General Conference was based on the understanding that IsraelÂs 
territory did not extend beyond that countryÂs borders as they had existed on 4 June 1967. 

GC(55)/OR.7

160. The PRESIDENT took it that, with the reservations expressed, the Conference wished to adopt 
the draft resolution contained in paragraph 10 of document GC(55)/27. 
161. It was so decided. 
19. Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between 
the Agency and the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea 
(GC(55)/4; GC(55)/L.5 and Add.1) 
162. The PRESIDENT noted that the item had been included in the agenda pursuant to resolution 
GC(54)/RES/12 adopted by the General Conference the preceding year. Document GC(55)/24 
contained a report by the Director General summarizing developments over the preceding year. 
Document GC(55)/L.5 contained a draft resolution submitted by a number of countries. 
163. Mr BARRETT (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document GC(55)/L.5, 
said it had been negotiated by a core group of countries in consultation with China and the Russian 
Federation. 
164. It was similar to the preceding yearÂs resolution on the agenda item in question and reiterated 
concerns over actions by the DPRK which posed serious challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation 
and disarmament regime and to peace and security. It noted serious concerns outlined in the Director 
GeneralÂs report, inter alia recent reports of claims by the DPRK regarding a uranium enrichment 
programme and construction of a light water reactor. It reiterated strong calls for the DPRK not to 
conduct any further nuclear tests and stressed the importance of full implementation of obligations 
pursuant to United Nations Security Council resolutions and of commitments undertaken in the 
context of the six-party talks. It strongly urged the DPRK to abandon all its nuclear weapons and 
existing nuclear programmes and to cease immediately all related activities. It deplored the DPRKÂs 
cessation of all cooperation with the Agency, endorsed the actions taken by the Board of Governors 
and commended the impartial efforts of the Director General and the Secretariat to apply 
comprehensive safeguards in the DPRK. It encouraged the Secretariat to maintain its readiness to play 
an essential role in verifying the DPRKÂs nuclear programme. It stressed the desire for a diplomatic 
resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue and expressed support for the six-party talks as an effective 
mechanism for dealing with that issue. It also called on the DPRK to come into full compliance with 
the NPT and to cooperate promptly with the Agency in the full and effective implementation of 
Agency comprehensive safeguards. 
165. Canada had confirmed that the draft resolution would be supported by the five Agency Member 
States involved in the six-party talks. Given the importance of the DPRK nuclear issue to international 
peace and security, it had been disappointed that consensus had not been reached on the General 
Conference resolution on the DPRK nuclear issue in 2010 and it hoped that consensus would be 
possible on the current draft resolution. 
166. Mr MARSÃN AGUILERA (Cuba) said that his country would not oppose the consensus. 
167. Cuba supported the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It strongly believed that 
diplomacy and dialogue should continue with a view to achieving a definitive, sustainable and viable 
resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue. 
168. His country reaffirmed its position on nuclear disarmament, stressing its concern over the threat 
to humanity posed by the continuing existence of nuclear weapons and their potential use or threat of 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 21 
use. Cuba was greatly concerned at the slow pace of nuclear disarmament and the lack of progress on 
the part of the nuclear-weapon States in eliminating their nuclear arsenals. It reaffirmed its support for 
the action plan put forward by NAM at the most recent NPT Review Conference aimed at eliminating 
and banning nuclear weapons at the latest by 2025. It likewise supported the declaration on the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons adopted at the 16th NAM Ministerial Conference held in Bali the 
preceding May, which had called for a high-level conference to address that issue. 
169. His country once again called on all nuclear-weapon States to comply immediately and 
unconditionally with the obligations contained in Article VI of the NPT, and to accelerate 
implementation of the agreements reached at the 1995 and 2000 NPT Review Conferences regarding 
the total elimination of nuclear weapons through systematic and progressive efforts, in particular the 
13 practical steps identified in the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference. It reiterated 
its conviction that international peace and security could only be guaranteed through the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery. 
170. Finally, Cuba noted with satisfaction the recent announcement by the DPRK authorities of their 
willingness to resume the six-party talks and hoped that that process would contribute to the long-term 
resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue through diplomacy and dialogue. 
171. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(55)/L.5 without a vote. 
172. It was so decided. 
173. Mr CHO Hyun (Republic of Korea) said that his country welcomed the adoption of the 
resolution by consensus and thanked Canada for submitting it. 
174. The resolution highlighted the DPRKÂs construction of a light water reactor and a uranium 
enrichment facility, which had been revealed to a group of United States scientists in November 2010. 
Those activities reflected the DPRKÂs ongoing defiance of its obligations under United Nations 
Security Council resolutions requiring it to abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear 
programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner, and to cease immediately all related 
activities. 
175. As the Director General had stated in his report, the DPRKÂs nuclear programme was a matter 
of serious concern, and the construction of a new uranium enrichment facility and a light water reactor 
was deeply troubling. The existence of a uranium enrichment plant, in particular, should be of grave 
concern to all States, as it could open a second path for the DPRK to develop its nuclear weapons 
capability. If that serious provocation by the DPRK were to go unchallenged, it would shake the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime to its core. The absence of a firm response to actions taken in 
defiance of international norms and binding obligations relating to the use of nuclear energy would be 
interpreted as tacit approval and would set a most unwelcome precedent. 
176. The participants in the six-party talks were working hard to resume dialogue with the DPRK. 
On the preceding day, representatives of the DPRK and the Republic of Korea had met in Beijing to 
discuss the common goal of the denuclearization of the DPRK and ways to resume the six-party 
process. The Republic of Korea welcomed those developments, but nothing would be gained by not 
saying what needed to be said just for the sake of resuming the talks. Such reticence would only 
encourage the DPRK to continue to defy the international communityÂs calls to re-engage in the 
denuclearization process. Delivering the right message to the DPRK would not only help bring about 
an early resumption of the talks but would also promote a successful outcome. 
GC(55)/OR.7 
22 September 2011, Page 22 
177. The Republic of Korea welcomed the adoption of the draft resolution by consensus and hoped 
that that unified message from the international community would be heard loud and clear by the 
DPRK and would pave the way for achieving the denuclearization of the DPRK. 
178. Mr NAKANE (Japan) noted that the Director GeneralÂs report stated that the DPRKÂs nuclear 
programme gave cause for serious concern, in particular the reports of the construction of a new 
uranium enrichment facility and a light water reactor. The DPRKÂs nuclear activities were in violation 
of relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and joint statements, including the 
September 2005 Joint Statement from the six-party talks pursuant to which the DPRK should not 
conduct any further nuclear tests, should abandon all its nuclear weapons and existing nuclear 
programmes, including any uranium enrichment activities, in a verifiable and irreversible manner, 
should immediately cease all related activities, should retract its announcement of withdrawal from the 
NPT and should act strictly in accordance with its safeguards agreement with the Agency. In addition, 
the DPRK must provide the Agency with transparency measures in accordance with relevant Security 
Council resolutions. 
179. With those remarks, he welcomed the fact that the draft resolution had been adopted by 
consensus.

8. Election of Members to the Board of Governors 
(GC(55)/3 and 26) 
1. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference had approved a procedure 
whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a particular area, no 
secret ballot would be held. Balloting would take place only in respect of those areas for which there 
was no agreed slate. That procedure considerably facilitated the rational use of the General 
ConferenceÂs time. 
2. However, Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure, which provided that elections to the Board should 
be by secret ballot, would need to be suspended in respect of the areas for which no secret ballot was 
to be held. If there was no objection, he would proceed with the election of Members to the Board of 
Governors in the manner outlined. 
3. It was so agreed. 
4. The PRESIDENT drew attention to document GC(55)/3, containing the names of the Members 
which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the fiftyÂfifth 
(2011) session of the Conference until the end of the fiftyÂsixth (2012). 
5. Recalling that, under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, the presiding officer must indicate to 
the General Conference those elective places on the Board which must be filled, he referred the 
Conference to document GC(55)/26, paragraph 2 of which indicated, for each of the geographical 
areas, the number of Members which must be elected so as to ensure that the Board would be 
constituted in accordance with Article VI.A. of the Statute. 
6. There were 11 seats to be filled: 2 for Latin America, 2 for Western Europe, 2 for Eastern 
Europe, 2 for Africa, 1 for the Middle East and South Asia, 1 for the Far East and 1 Â the so-called 
floating seat Â which it was the turn of a Member State in South East Asia and the Pacific to fill. 
7. Paragraph 3 of that document contained a list of 24 Member States which had been either 
designated by the Board of Governors the previous June for membership of the Board pursuant to 
Article VI.A.1 of the Statute or elected by the General Conference in 2010 in accordance with Article 
VI.A.2 of the Statute and which would therefore be serving on the Board during the year 2011Â2012. 
8. In order to facilitate the election, delegates had been furnished with a note showing the results 
of consultations among the area groups regarding their candidates for the vacant seats as far as they 
were known. The note was purely informal in character and provided information insofar as it had 
been made available to him and to the Secretariat. 
9. Agreement had been reached in respect of all areas listed in Article VI except for Africa; there 
would have to be balloting in order to fill the two vacant seats for that area. 
10. He suggested first taking up the areas in respect of which there was agreement and formally 
electing Members for those areas by suspending Rule 79 in order to dispense with the need to hold a 
ballot. 
11. It was so agreed. 
GC(55)/OR.8 
22 September 2011, Page 2 
12. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Cuba and Mexico to the 
two vacant seats for Latin America. 
13. Cuba and Mexico were duly elected. 
14. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Italy and Sweden to the 
two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
15. Italy and Sweden were duly elected. 
16. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Bulgaria and Hungary to 
the two vacant seats for Eastern Europe. 
17. Bulgaria and Hungary were duly elected. 
18. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Saudi Arabia to the one 
vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
19. Saudi Arabia was duly elected. 
20. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Republic of Korea to 
the one vacant seat for the Far East. 
21. The Republic of Korea was duly elected. 
22. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Indonesia to the floating 
seat, which it was the turn of a Member State in from South East Asia and the Pacific to fill. 
23. Indonesia was duly elected. 
24. The PRESIDENT recalled that there were two seats to filled in respect of Africa. While 
agreement appeared to have been reached in the African Group that one of the vacancies should be 
filled by the United Republic of Tanzania, there appeared to be no agreement on the second vacancy, 
in respect of which a secret ballot would therefore have to be held. 
25. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), Chair of the African Group, said that, in order to preserve the unity 
of the African Group, Algeria had decided to withdraw its candidature for a seat on the Board for the 
period 2011Â2013. The African Group had endorsed AlgeriaÂs decision and had, in line with a 
decision of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union taken at their summit in January 
2011, decided to endorse the candidature of the United Republic of Tanzania to fill one of the vacant 
seats for Africa on the Board for the period 2011Â2013. She thanked those delegations which had 
supported AlgeriaÂs candidature. 
26. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the United Republic of 
Tanzania to one of the vacant seats for Africa. 
27. The United Republic of Tanzania was duly elected. 
28. The PRESIDENT said that a ballot would be needed in order to fill the remaining seat. As the 
election was to fill one elective place, Rule 80 of the Rules of Procedure applied. In addition, Rule 79 
provided that the election of Members to the Board of Governors Âshall be by secret ballot. There shall 
be no nominations.Â In accordance with Rule 74 of the Rules of Procedure, explanations of vote would 
not be allowed before or after the vote. The relevant Rules governing voting rights of Member States 
applied. 
29. Mr MENESI (Libya), recalling General Assembly resolution A/RES/66/1, said that the General 
Assembly had accepted the credentials of LibyaÂs National Transitional Council. In addition, the 
GC(55)/OR.8 
22 September 2011, Page 3 
African Union had recently recognized the National Transitional Council as the legitimate 
representative of the Libyan people and had unanimously adopted a clear resolution nominating Libya 
and the United Republic of Tanzania to fill the vacant seats for Africa on the AgencyÂs Board of 
Governors. He hoped that the Conference would respect the decision of the African Union reflected in 
that resolution. 
30. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt) said that his country was a candidate for the one remaining vacant seat 
for Africa. 
31. The PRESIDENT, having thanked the two previous speakers, again drew attention to Rule 79 of 
the Rules of Procedure, which stated that there should be no nominations in elections to the Board. 
Delegations were free to vote for any eligible Member State in the area of Africa. 
32. He invited the Conference to proceed to a vote by secret ballot for the one remaining vacant seat 
for Africa, noting that, in accordance with Rule 85 of the Rules of Procedure, the two outgoing Board 
members from the area of Africa, Cameroon and Kenya, were ineligible under Article VI.A.2 of the 
Statute for re-election, and votes for Niger, Tunisia and South Africa, and for Member States that 
were not in the area of Africa, would also not be valid. 
33. A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
34. At the invitation of the President, Mr Camara (Brazil) and Ms Crowley (New Zealand) acted as 
tellers. 
The meeting was suspended at 4.10 p.m. and resumed at 4.35 p.m. 
35. The PRESIDENT announced the result of the ballot to the Conference. 
36. In the election of Members to the one vacant seat for Africa, the result of the vote was as 
follows: 
Ballot papers returned: 125 
Invalid votes: 0 
Abstentions: 8 
Valid votes: 117 
Required majority: 59 
Votes obtained: 
Egypt: 87 
Libya: 28 
Algeria: 1 
Mauritania: 1 
37. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria), speaking on a point of order, said she was surprised that her country 
had received a vote given her earlier comments regarding the withdrawal of AlgeriaÂs candidature. 

GC(55)/OR.8 
22 September 2011, Page 4 
38. The PRESIDENT recalled that, in accordance with Rule 79, the vote had been taken by secret 
ballot and that delegations had been free to vote for any eligible Member State in Africa. 
39. Having obtained the required majority, Egypt was duly elected. 
11. Appointment of the External Auditor 
(GC(55)/6) 
40. The PRESIDENT said that the tenure of the AgencyÂs present External Auditor would end with 
the completion of the audit of the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial year 2011. It would therefore be 
necessary to appoint an External Auditor to audit the AgencyÂs accounts for the financial years 2012 
and 2013. The Board had considered the matter in June, but it had not been in a position to make a 
recommendation to the Conference. The three remaining candidates for the post of External Auditor 
were the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Chairperson of the Philippine Commission on 
Audit and the President of the Spanish Court of Audit. 
41. Ms BUJÃN FREIRE (Spain) said that her Government believed that the External Auditor 
should continue to be appointed by consensus and that a vote would set a bad precedent. In the 
interests of reaching a consensus, it had therefore decided to withdraw the candidature of the President 
of the Spanish Court of Audit for the post of External Auditor of the Agency for the period 2012Â 
2013. 
42. She thanked the many States that had supported the Spanish candidate and urged them to give 
their support to whichever candidate was appointed. If a vote were taken, Spain would abstain. 
The meeting was suspended at 4.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.55 p.m. 
43. The PRESIDENT, noting that two candidates remained for the post of External Auditor, said 
that there was no other option but to appoint the External Auditor by election, which, pursuant to 
Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure, would be by secret ballot. He drew attention to the fact that Rule 79 
provided that there should be no nominations. 
44. A vote was taken by secret ballot. 
45. At the invitation of the President, Mr Camara (Brazil) and Ms Crowley (New Zealand) acted as 
tellers. 
The meeting was suspended at 5.15 p.m. and resumed at 5.45 p.m. 
46. The PRESIDENT announced the result of the ballot to the Conference. 
47. In the election of the candidate for the post of External Auditor, the result of the vote was as 
follows: 
Ballot papers returned: 124 
Invalid votes: 1 
Abstentions: 6 
Valid votes: 117 
Required majority: 59

Votes obtained:

48. Having obtained the required majority, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India was duly 
elected. 
49. Ms YPARRAGUIRRE (Philippines) thanked those Member States which had supported the 
candidature of the Chairperson of the Philippine Commission on Audit. She congratulated the 
Comptroller and Auditor General of India on his appointment and assured him of the PhilippinesÂ 
support in helping to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency. 
50. Mr KHULLAR (India) thanked those Member States which had supported the candidature of 
the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and commended the President on his highly constructive 
role in the election process.

20. Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(55)/23; GC(55)/L.1) 
1. The PRESIDENT said that item 20 had been included in the ConferenceÂs agenda pursuant to 
resolution GC(54)/RES/13. The Director General had submitted the report contained in document 
GC(55)/23 pursuant to paragraph 13 of that resolution. The matter had been considered by the Board, 
the preceding week, on the basis of that report. Document GC(55)/L.1 contained a draft resolution 
submitted by Egypt. 
2. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution, said that its text was identical to that of 
the resolution adopted at the fifty-fourth session of the General Conference, with only necessary 
technical updates. 
3. It had come to be universally recognized that the application of comprehensive Agency 
safeguards to nuclear facilities and activities greatly contributed to international peace, security and 
stability. That was particularly true in regions such as the Middle East, where potentially dangerous 
tensions persisted. 
4. The overwhelming support given by Member States to the draft resolutions on the ÂApplication 
of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ submitted by Egypt at past sessions of the General 
Conference eloquently testified to that reality. Such support encouraged Egypt to pursue with even 
more vigour and determination the efforts it had been exerting for several decades to bring about 
universal NPT adherence in the Middle East and comprehensive Agency safeguards at all nuclear 
facilities in the region. 
5. It remained a source of astonishment to Egypt that some appeared to still hold the view that 
NPT universality and the global application of comprehensive Agency safeguards were objectives that 
were desirable only in certain cases and under certain circumstances. Such a position was untenable, 
as it was diametrically opposed to the spirit and letter of dozens of decisions, resolutions and final 
documents adopted by a variety of regional and global fora and organizations, including the Agency. 
6. EgyptÂs view was that there were no circumstances under which the application of 
comprehensive Agency safeguards to nuclear facilities would lead to destabilization or to diminished 
security. What was a fact, however, was that unsafeguarded nuclear facilities had a persistently 
destabilizing effect on the region where they were located, thereby preventing confidence from being 
built. 
7. Egypt would continue to rely on the support of those Member States which shared its 
commitment to the goal of a Middle East where there was no room for unsafeguarded nuclear facilities 
and activities. It would also continue to launch and to lend its support to initiatives that might lead 
towards that goal. In that context, Egypt looked forward to the AgencyÂs intensified involvement in 
and commitment to efforts aimed at turning the Middle East into a comprehensively safeguarded Â 
and therefore safer Â region where political differences could not escalate into potential mass 
destruction. 
8. Egypt looked forward to adoption of the draft resolution on the ÂApplication of IAEA 
Safeguards in the Middle EastÂ without a vote. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 2 
9. Mr AZOULAY (Israel) said that his country had long cherished the vision of the Middle East as 
a zone free of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery systems. However, Israel was 
situated in a region where security was an issue relevant to its very existence, where threats to 
annihilate States still prevailed and where forces dedicated to creating internal and regional instability 
were used by those wishing to prevent the peaceful settlement of disputes. 
10. For the vision to become reality, substantial changes had to occur in the Middle East, and those 
changes had to include recognition of the right of all States in the region to exist, and also the 
establishment of enduring peaceful relations and good-neighbourliness. Full compliance by the States 
in the region with their international obligations regarding disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation 
had to be achieved as well. No amount of endless rhetorical campaigning in international 
fora would contribute to the realization of a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. A serious attitude, 
commitment, constructiveness and good faith on the part of all relevant participants were 
indispensable in the process, which must also emanate from regional partners themselves, on the basis 
of arrangements freely arrived at. 
11. For its part, Israel had always pursued a responsible policy of restraint in the nuclear domain, 
and it had shown its support for positive engagement by its participation in European Union seminars 
held to promote confidence-building and support a process aimed at establishing a zone free of WMD 
and means of delivery in the Middle East. In that connection, it should be noted that Israel had been 
the first State in the Middle East to give its principled consent to the Director GeneralÂs convening of a 
forum aimed at learning from the experience of regions where NWFZs had been established Â and it 
welcomed the positive responses received from regional partners and hoped for a constructive 
approach by all concerned. 
12. A new Middle East was evolving, with profound changes taking place in many States of the 
region. On the positive side, the democratization process might make possible a better atmosphere, 
conducive to the building of trust among regional parties, but Israel could not ignore the voices that 
were questioning the achievements of peace accords concluded in the region. With four of the five 
cases of gross violations of the NPT involving Middle East States, one could not but question the good 
faith of those States as regards the fulfilment of their international legally binding obligations. In the 
present state of transformation and turmoil in the Middle East, Israel had to give serious thought to the 
uncertainties it was facing. 
13. The present agenda item had a long history, but for 14 years running, until 2005, it had enjoyed 
the coveted status of an item leading to the adoption of a consensual resolution. Israel had endorsed 
that resolution not because of support for the precise language, but because of its principled adherence 
to the vision of the Middle East as a zone free of WMD and their delivery systems Â and because of 
an understanding with the resolutionÂs principal sponsor, Egypt, that any move to change that 
language would necessitate dialogue and coordination. Unfortunately, that understanding had ceased 
in 2006 with the introduction of unilateral changes by Egypt, whose action had clearly indicated that 
ÂIsrael-bashingÂ was more important for some. 
14. That unsatisfactory situation had persisted during the General ConferenceÂs 2007 and 2008 
sessions. Then, in 2009, Israel and Egypt had, under the auspices of the United States of America and 
the European Union, engaged in discussions aimed at a consensus on the resolution. Those discussions 
had created a glimmer of hope that the sides would once again reach a common understanding and 
agree on a text, but because of EgyptÂs determination to retain paragraph 2, directed against Israel, a 
consensus had not been achieved. That paragraph figured in the draft resolution submitted in 2010, 
and it figured once again in the draft resolution now before the General Conference. Had IsraelÂs 
neighbours truly wished a consensus to be achieved once again, they would have approached Israel 
directly. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 3 
15. For its part, Israel, which remained committed to dialogue, stood ready to join in adoption of the 
2005 resolution text in order to recreate the spirit of consensus. In the present circumstances, however, 
its position obliged it to request separate votes on paragraph 2 of the draft resolution in document 
GC(55)/L.1 and on the draft resolution as a whole. 
16. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt), speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), expressed 
support for the draft resolution contained in document GC(55)/L.1 and said that NAM was still 
committed to its principled position regarding the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle 
East. It strongly believed that stability could not be achieved in a region where a continuing massive 
imbalance in military capabilities, due particularly to the possession of nuclear weapons, allowed one 
party to threaten its neighbours and others in the region. 
17. NAM, which considered that the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East would be a 
positive step, leading towards the objective of global nuclear disarmament, continued to favour the 
establishment of such a zone in accordance with the relevant General Assembly and Security Council 
resolutions. 
18. NAM, which was convinced that the effective and efficient application of Agency safeguards 
promoted greater confidence among States, considered that achieving universality of comprehensive 
Agency safeguards in the Middle East was a necessary step towards the establishment of an NWFZ 
there. 
19. NAM welcomed the fact that its member States party to the NPT had concluded comprehensive 
safeguards agreements with the Agency in fulfilment of their obligations under NPT Article III.1 as 
non-nuclear-weapon States. 
20. All States in the Middle East region except Israel were parties to the NPT and had accepted 
comprehensive Agency safeguards. NAM regretted IsraelÂs continued insistence that the issue of 
comprehensive Agency safeguards could not be addressed in isolation from the regional peace 
process; there was no automatic sequence linking the application of comprehensive safeguards at all 
nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the prior achievement of a peace settlement. 
21. NAM also regretted the fact that the Director General had not been able to make further 
progress, pursuant to resolution GC(54)/RES/13, as regards the application of comprehensive Agency 
safeguards covering all nuclear activities in the Middle East. The situation was unacceptable, and all 
Member States should cooperate in rectifying it. In the promotion of Agency safeguards in the Middle 
East, top priority should be accorded first to achieving the universality of comprehensive Agency 
safeguards there. 
22. NAM, which welcomed the fact that the Director General had Âcontinued to encourage the 
development and consideration of relevant new ideas and approaches that could help to move his 
mandates forwardÂ and the fact that he would Âcontinue with his consultations in accordance with his 
mandate regarding the early application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities 
in the Middle East regionÂ, would like him to brief Member States regularly on the results of his future 
efforts. 
23. The NAM member States party to the NPT, recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted 
in 1995 by the NPT Review and Extension Conference, welcomed the fact that the 2010 NPT Review 
Conference had Âendorsed the practical step that the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the 
co-sponsors of the 1995 Resolution, in consultation with the States of the region, will convene a 
conference in 2012, to be attended by all States of the Middle East, on the establishment of a Middle 
East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, on the basis of 
arrangements freely arrived at by the States of the region, and with the full support and engagement of 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 4 
the nuclear-weapon States.Â NAM noted that the 2012 conference would take Âas its terms of 
reference the 1995 Resolution.Â 
24. NAM had noted with appreciation the Director GeneralÂs recent efforts to develop Âan agenda 
and modalities which will help to ensure a successful forum on the relevance of the experience of 
existing NWFZs, including confidence-building and verification measures, for establishing a nuclearweapon-
free zone in the region of the Middle East.Â Also, NAM had noted that, in his report contained 
in document GC(55)/23, the Director General stated that those efforts had been welcomed by many 
States and that he had written Âto all Member States inviting them to take part in the Forum to be held 
on 21Â22 November 2011 at IAEA headquarters in Vienna.Â For the Forum to be successful, its 
agenda should reflect the consensus within the international community on the importance of 
establishing an NWFZ in the Middle East. Accordingly, NAM would like the Director General to 
continue consultations with all Member States on arrangements conducive to the ForumÂs being a 
constructive contribution to achievement of the objective of the establishment of an NWFZ in that 
region. 
25. NAM, which was fully committed to supporting the Director GeneralÂs efforts in implementing 
resolution GC(54)/RES/13, expected all Member States of the Agency to support those efforts. 
26. Mr GASHUT (Libya) said that he was speaking on behalf of the new Libya, a country 
committed to transparency, mutual respect and peaceful coexistence and to full compliance with all 
the international treaties to which it was a party. 
27. More than 15 years had elapsed since the NPT Review and Extension Conference had, in 1995, 
adopted a resolution concerning the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. In 2010, however, 
the NPT Review Conference had decided to convene, in 2012, a conference that would bring together 
all States of the Middle East with a view to implementing the 1995 resolution and creating a zone free 
of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in that region. Libya welcomed the 
steps being taken by the international community to create such a zone. 
28. Mr POURMAND TEHRANI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that more than three decades had 
elapsed since the idea of establishing an NWFZ in the Middle East had first been put forward. It had 
been put forward by Iran in 1974 as an important disarmament measure in the Middle East region and 
had led to a United Nations General Assembly resolution. Since 1980, the General Assembly had each 
year adopted a resolution on the issue by consensus, demonstrating global support for the promotion of 
peace, security and stability in the Middle East through the realization of an NWFZ. Iran, having 
ratified all major treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction, supported the establishment of a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. 
29. It was regrettable that, notwithstanding global attempts to establish NWFZs, particularly in the 
Middle East, 30 years later no progress had been made towards realization of that aim owing to the 
intransigent policy of the Zionist regime. Owing to that regimeÂs non-adherence to the NPT and, more 
importantly, its refusal to place its unsafeguarded nuclear facilities under the AgencyÂs verification 
system, the aspiration of the countries in the region to establish an NWFZ had not been realized. 
Moreover, that regimeÂs irresponsible behaviour cast serious doubt on the possibility of one being 
established in the near future. 
30. The Zionist regime was the only country in the region that was not a party to the NPT. Despite 
repeated calls by the international community, such as the resolution on the Middle East adopted in 
1995 at the NPT Review and Extension Conference and related resolutions of the General Assembly, 
the Agency and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, that regime, confident of the political and 
military support of the United States of America, had neither acceded to the NPT nor placed its 
nuclear facilities under full-scope Agency safeguards. It had not even declared its intention to accede 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 5 
to the NPT. Its clandestine nuclear activities seriously threatened regional peace and security and 
endangered the non-proliferation regime. 
31. Unfortunately, the imposed inaction of the United Nations Security Council over several 
decades as regards the well-documented nuclear weapons programme of the Zionist regime had given 
that regime the audacity to acknowledge explicitly its possession of nuclear weapons. The regimeÂs 
clandestine development of nuclear weapons not only violated basic principles of international law, 
the Charter of the United Nations, the NPT and numerous General Assembly and Security Council 
resolutions, it also clearly defied the demands and concerns of the overwhelming majority of United 
Nations member States and obstinately disregarded repeated appeals by the international community 
for Israel to renounce nuclear weapons and accede to the NPT. The Zionist regime was the only 
obstacle to the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. Peace and stability in the region were 
unattainable while its nuclear arsenal continued to threaten the region and the rest of the world. 
32. As a State party to the NPT, Iran was fully committed to its international undertakings and 
believed that the NPT was the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Universal 
adherence to the NPT, particularly in the Middle East, would effectively ensure the establishment of 
an NWFZ in the region. Pending the realization of such a zone in the Middle East, no country in the 
region should acquire nuclear weapons, or permit the stationing within its territory or under its 
jurisdiction or control of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosive devices, and countries in the region 
should refrain from actions that ran counter to the letter and spirit of the NPT and of other 
international resolutions and documents relating to the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
It was a matter of regret that, while no practical measure was being taken to contain the threat posed 
by the Zionist regime as the real source of nuclear danger in the Middle East, Iran, a party to the NPT 
and the initiator of the idea of the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East, was under 
tremendous pressure to renounce its inalienable right to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. 
33. The Director General had stated in his report on the ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the 
Middle EastÂ contained in document GC(55)/23 that all States in the Middle East except for Israel 
were party to the NPT and had undertaken to accept comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
34. Iran therefore firmly believed that an agreed plan of action and a timetable for achieving 
universality of the NPT, especially in the Middle East, should be a top priority on the agenda of all 
States party to the NPT, especially the nuclear-weapon States. Pressure should be brought to bear on 
the Zionist regime to eliminate its nuclear weapons and to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear 
facilities under Agency safeguards in order to pave the way for the realization of the long-sought goal 
of the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East and the achievement of peace and security in the 
world. 
35. Mr MARSÃN AGUILERA (Cuba) said that the international community had repeatedly called 
during the past few decades for the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East as a prerequisite for 
the achievement of peace and stability in the region. The establishment of such a zone depended on the 
accession of Israel to the NPT and the placing of all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency 
safeguards. 
36. Israel should accede to the NPT without further delay. Moreover, the United States Government 
should be transparent about the equipment, materials and other forms of assistance it provided to Israel 
in the nuclear field. 
37. Cuba, which was concerned about the Director GeneralÂs failure to achieve any progress 
towards the implementation of resolution GC(54)/RES/13 concerning the ÂApplication of IAEA 
safeguards in the Middle EastÂ, hoped that the forum in November 2011 on the relevance of the 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 6 
experience of existing NWFZs for the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East would 
contribute to the achievement of that goal, which was of the utmost importance for peace and stability 
in the world as a whole. 
38. The PRESIDENT noted that the representative of Israel had requested that a separate vote be 
taken on operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution contained in document GC(55)/L.1. 
39. At the request of Mr Shamaa (Egypt), a roll-call vote was taken. 
40. New Zealand, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
41. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia,

Against: Israel. 
Abstaining: Botswana, Canada, Colombia, India, Marshall Islands, Nigeria, Palau, 
Senegal, Uganda, United States of America. 
42. There were 111 votes in favour and 1 against, with 10 abstentions. Operative paragraph 2 of the 
draft resolution was adopted. 
43. Mr PATNAIK (India), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his delegation had abstained 
because it believed that operative paragraph 2 of the draft resolution introduced matters extraneous to 
the Agency. 
44. The PRESIDENT noted that the representative of Israel had requested that a separate vote be 
taken on the whole of the draft resolution contained in document GC(55)/L.1. 
45. At the request of Mr Shamaa (Egypt), a roll-call vote was taken. 
46. Mongolia, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
47. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and

Against: None. 
Abstaining: Botswana, Canada, Colombia, Israel, Marshall Islands, Palau, Uganda, 
United States of America. 
48. There were 113 votes in favour and none against, with 8 abstentions. The draft resolution was 
adopted. 
49. Mr DAVIES (United States of America), speaking in explanation of vote, said that his 
delegationÂs decision to abstain had not been taken lightly. It reflected the belief of the United States 
that the discussion of Middle East safeguards in the General Conference should proceed on the basis 
of dialogue, respect and consensus. While consensus had been achieved on resolutions concerning 
Middle East safeguards at previous General Conference sessions, the present text had regrettably not 
been negotiated among all States in the region. His delegation hoped for a return to a consensus 
approach at the next session. 
50. The United States remained unequivocally committed to the goals of a Middle East region free 
of all weapons of mass destruction and the universality of the NPT, even though they could not be 
achieved quickly or in the absence of essential conditions. The absence of such conditions, however, 
was not an excuse for neglecting dialogue. 
51. The United States was also committed to supporting the convening of a regional conference in 
2012 in accordance with the relevant recommendation of the 2010 NPT Review Conference. It had 
been working closely with the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and the Office of the United 
Nations Secretary-General, in consultation with States in the Middle East region, to identify a host 
State and facilitator, and it hoped to complete the process in the near future. 
52. The Director General was to be commended for convening a forum, to be held in November 
2011, on the experience of regions with NWFZ treaties in force and its potential relevance for the 
Middle East. His Government hoped that all States in the region would take advantage of the 
opportunity for dialogue and understanding. Clearly, singling out one country for criticism would 
impede progress and raise questions as to whether the 2012 regional conference could be conducted in 
a fair and balanced manner. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 8 
53. Mr WYGANOWSKI (Poland), speaking in explanation of vote on behalf of the European 
Union (EU), said that the EU remained fully committed to universalization of the NPT. While the EU 
had supported the resolution, it would have preferred to call on all States party to the NPT to ensure 
compliance with that treaty. The EU would continue to urge all States in the Middle East to conclude 
and implement comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It felt that the 
resolution would have been stronger if it had included a call for the implementation of such protocols. 
54. The EU welcomed the consensus reached at the 2010 NPT Review Conference. The agreement 
reached on an action plan and a procedure for implementing the resolution on the Middle East adopted 
in 1995 by the NPT Review and Extension Conference, including the holding of a conference in 2012 
on the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the 
Middle East, demonstrated the common resolve not only to uphold but also to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. 
55. The EU, which had in July 2011 held a seminar as a contribution to the process leading to the 
2012 conference, had been encouraged by the constructive approach of Member States and was 
looking forward to the November 2011 forum convened by the Director General. 
21. Israeli nuclear capabilities 
(GC(55)/1/Add.1; GC(55)/18) 
56. The PRESIDENT noted that item 21 had been included in the agenda pursuant to a request 
submitted by the Arab States that were members of the Agency. He drew attention to an explanatory 
memorandum contained in document GC(55)/1/Add.1 and to document GC(55)/18. 
57. Mr EL-KHOURY (Lebanon), speaking on behalf of the Arab States that were members of the 
Agency, said that all Arab States without exception had adopted a united stance in favour of the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime, had acceded to the NPT and had approved the initiative aimed at 
establishing an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
58. Israel, on the other hand, had refused to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards, and it possessed nuclear weapons, as confirmed by impartial reports from a 
variety of sources. Its attitude rendered peace and security difficult to achieve and was a source of 
increased tension in the Middle East that could trigger an arms race. 
59. The goal of the Arab States in raising the issue of Israeli nuclear capabilities at successive 
sessions of the General Conference was not only to draw attention to a dangerous situation but also to 
propose a practical solution, which consisted in adopting a comprehensive approach that took the 
security of all countries in the Middle East into consideration instead of dealing in a biased and 
selective manner with each country individually and applying double standards. 
60. At its fifty-third regular session, the General Conference had, in resolution GC(53)/RES/17, 
called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive 
Agency safeguards. The United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, and NPT Review 
Conferences, including the one held in May 2010, had also adopted resolutions calling on Israel to 
accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards as a 
prerequisite for the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
61. With impartial reports confirming that Israel possessed a significant arsenal of nuclear weapons, 
the Arab States and the international community as a whole could not afford to tolerate the efforts of 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 9 
Israel to further develop its nuclear capabilities, taking advantage of the lack of any real international 
pressure aimed at preventing it from doing so. Some countries were doing their utmost to ensure that 
no light was shed on IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities and to impede the adoption by the General 
Conference of a resolution that mentioned Israel by name. At the same time, charges were being 
levelled Â without solid proof Â against other countries. 
62. Some countries had sought to prevent the inclusion of the item ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ in 
the agenda of the General Conference. They had argued, for instance, that the AgencyÂs role was a 
technical one and that it was inappropriate for the Agency to address political issues. However, the 
item had been discussed at numerous previous General Conference sessions, and the resolution 
adopted at the fifty-third session had focused on technical issues that fell within the AgencyÂs 
mandate, particularly the application of comprehensive safeguards within the framework of the NPT. 
63. The argument that a single agenda item concerning the Middle East was sufficient was 
untenable. It was clear from the content of the draft resolutions on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ 
submitted at previous sessions and that of the resolutions on the ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in 
the Middle EastÂ that they should be dealt with under different agenda items and that achievement of 
the goal of the former constituted a necessary step towards achievement of the goal of the latter. 
64. Moreover, Israel was not being singled out by the Arab States; it was singling itself out and 
isolating itself by failing to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive 
Agency safeguards. 
65. In spite of all the arguments adduced, the General Conference had voted in favour of the draft 
resolution concerning ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ at its fifty-third session, thereby demonstrating that 
the international community recognized the danger that IsraelÂs unsafeguarded nuclear activities and 
facilities posed for the Middle East and the need to ensure the accession of Israel to the NPT and the 
placing of all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
66. Regrettably, some States Â including nuclear-weapon States Â were continuing to claim that 
they espoused the principle of universality of the NPT while setting aside that principle completely 
when the question of its applicability to Israel arose, thereby applying double standards and impeding 
implementation of the General Conference resolutions on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ. 
67. The Arab Group considered that the agenda item ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ was no less 
important than other agenda items as it had a direct bearing on the achievement of security and peace 
in the Middle East. Allegations to the contrary again demonstrated the application of double standards. 
68. Israel had repeatedly refused to cooperate with the Agency in the implementation of resolution 
GC(53)/RES/17 and all other relevant international resolutions, as attested by the message from the 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Israel to the Director General dated 26 July 
2010. Moreover, the Israeli representative had stated immediately after the adoption of that resolution 
at the fifty-third session of the General Conference that his country would not cooperate in any way in 
its implementation, and the Israeli Prime Minister had stated after the 2010 NPT Review Conference 
that he rejected all its decisions concerning the Middle East and would not cooperate in their 
implementation. The Arab Group considered that the cooperation of Israel in the implementation of 
resolution GC(53)/RES/17 and all other relevant international resolutions would enhance the prospects 
of success of any initiative aimed at creating an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
69. The Arab Group, which had contributed to the success of the 2010 NPT Review Conference and 
to the adoption of the decision to hold a conference in 2012 on the establishment of a Middle East 
zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, considered that the current 
international efforts to establish such a zone were long overdue. The parties concerned should take 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 10 
serious and speedy action to rid the Middle East of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass 
destruction in accordance with the relevant international resolutions. 
70. The Arab Group had refrained from submitting a draft resolution entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear 
capabilitiesÂ at the current session of the General Conference as a demonstration of its goodwill and 
because the submission of such a draft resolution might be used as a pretext for delay. 
71. The Arab Group was grateful to NAM, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the African 
Group and the Asian Group, which were continuing to support its stance Â a stance consistent with 
the principle of universality of the NPT and with the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
72. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt), speaking on behalf of NAM, reiterated its principled position on IsraelÂs 
nuclear capabilities: NAM strongly believed that stability could not be achieved in a region where a 
massive imbalance in military capabilities was continuing to exist, particularly due to the possession 
of nuclear weapons, allowing one party to threaten its neighbours and others in the region. 
73. NAM, which welcomed the fact that its member States party to the NPT had concluded 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency in fulfilment of their obligations under 
Article III.1 of the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States, noted that all States in the Middle East except 
Israel were party to the NPT and had accepted comprehensive Agency safeguards; and NAM regarded 
the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East as a positive step towards attaining the objective of 
global nuclear disarmament and continued to advocate the establishment of such a zone in accordance 
with the relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. 
74. A selective approach to the issue of nuclear capabilities in the Middle East was undermining the 
viability of the AgencyÂs safeguards regime. Also, it had resulted in the continuing dangerous presence 
of unsafeguarded Israeli nuclear facilities and activities, notwithstanding the repeated calls on Israel to 
subject those facilities and activities to comprehensive Agency safeguards. NAM was gravely 
concerned about the dire consequences for international security of the acquisition of a nuclear 
capability by Israel, which posed a serious threat to the security of its neighbours and of other States, 
and about the continuing provision to Israeli scientists of access to the nuclear facilities of one of the 
nuclear-weapon States. 
75. All Member States should cooperate in rectifying what was an unacceptable situation and 
achieving the universality of comprehensive Agency safeguards in the Middle East. Implementing 
resolution GC(53)/RES/17, entitled ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ, was a first step towards that end. 
76. NAM regretted IsraelÂs continuing insistence that the issue of Agency safeguards could not be 
addressed in isolation from the regional peace process. There was no automatic sequence linking the 
application of comprehensive safeguards at all nuclear facilities in the Middle East to the prior 
conclusion of a peace settlement. The former would contribute to the latter. 
77. NAM continued to want a complete ban on the transfer to Israel of nuclear-related equipment, 
information, material, facilities, devices and other resources and the provision of other assistance in 
nuclear-related scientific and technological fields. 
78. In a letter attached to the Director GeneralÂs report contained in document GC(54)/14, IsraelÂs 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs had stated that Israel valued the nonproliferation 
regime, acknowledged its importance and had over the years demonstrated Âa responsible 
policy of restraint in the nuclear domain.Â Regrettably, official documents of the Agency were 
testimony to the contrary. For example, in various resolutions regarding South AfricaÂs nuclear 
capabilities adopted by it prior to 1994, the General Conference had recalled General Assembly 
resolutions dealing with relations between Israel and South Africa in which the General Assembly 
had, inter alia, strongly condemned the extensive collaboration between Israel and the then racist 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 11 
regime of South Africa, especially in the military and nuclear fields, in defiance of General Assembly 
and Security Council resolutions. 
79. Mr ZNIBER (Morocco) said that his country believed that universalization of the NPT would 
help in solving the problem of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities and that it would also reduce tension in the 
Middle East and have a positive impact on international peace and security. The establishment of an 
NWFZ in the Middle East would help to reduce proliferation risks and to bring about mutual security 
for all States in the region. 
80. While all other States in the Middle East were parties to the NPT and had accepted the initiative 
aimed at the establishment of an NWFZ there, Israel regrettably continued to refuse to place all its 
nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
81. The fact that no draft resolution on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ had been submitted at the 
current session of the General Conference did not mean that the issue would no longer figure on the 
AgencyÂs agenda. Rather, the Arab Group was displaying goodwill in the light of international 
developments, particularly the preparations for the 2012 conference on the establishment of a Middle 
East zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction and for the Forum on 
Experience of Possible Relevance to the Creation of a Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone in the Middle East 
to be held in Vienna on 21-22 November 2011. 
82. The Agency was the most appropriate forum for resolving the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities, especially through constructive dialogue with the States of the Middle East, and thereby 
for facilitating the establishment of an NWFZ there. The 2012 conference would be a first step 
towards that end. 
83. Mr OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that his country, which had contributed to all 
initiatives aimed at creating an NWFZ in the Middle East, had in 2003 launched an initiative of its 
own, but the initiative had been opposed by some influential States. 
84. Israel was the only State in the Middle East that had not acceded to the NPT, and its 
intransigence in refusing to place all its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards not 
only constituted a serious threat to security and stability in the Middle East but also undermined the 
credibility of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
85. The decision of the AgencyÂs Arab Member States not to submit a draft resolution on ÂIsraeli 
nuclear capabilitiesÂ at the current session of the General Conference was a goodwill gesture whose 
purpose was to maximize the chances of success of the forum to be held on 21Â22 November 2011 
and the 2012 conference on the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and all 
other weapons of mass destruction. 
86. The international community should pressure Israel into acceding to the NPT as a non-nuclearweapon 
State, concluding a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency and eliminating all 
its stocks of nuclear weapons, and the United Nations should prevent the application of double 
standards in that connection. The establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East was a prerequisite for 
peace and stability in that region. 
87. Mr QUEISI (Jordan) said that his country, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
safeguards regime, was of the view that the difficulties of establishing an NWFZ in the Middle East 
were jeopardizing the stability of that region. In order to pave the way towards the establishment of an 
NWFZ there, Israel should accede to the NPT and place all of its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards. The States of the Middle East would then be better able to focus on economic and social 
development instead of being drawn into an arms race that undermined their well-being. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 12 
88. Mr MARSÃN AGUILERA (Cuba) said that his country attached great importance to the 
sensitive agenda item now under discussion as IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities had serious negative 
implications for regional and international peace and security. 
89. Israel should accede forthwith to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards. The other countries of the Middle East had long been pressing for 
that with a view to the establishment of an NWFZ there. That goal could not be achieved while a 
group of countries, especially the United States of America, continued to transfer to Israel nuclearrelated 
equipment, information, material, facilities, devices and other resources and provide it with 
other assistance in nuclear-related scientific and technological fields. 
90. Genuine political will and the elimination of double standards were needed in order to turn the 
Middle East into a region of peace and security for all. Cuba rejected the double standards espoused by 
the United States of America and the other countries that were harassing some States in the region for 
alleged non-compliance with safeguards agreements while continuing to provide nuclear-related 
assistance to Israel and that were endeavouring by all available means to prevent the adoption by the 
General Conference of a resolution calling on Israel to accede to the NPT. The United States of 
America and its allies should be consistent Â they should abandon their permissive approach to Israel 
and require it to destroy, under international control, the nuclear weapons that it seemed prepared to 
use, if necessary, in executing its plans for the Middle East. 
91. Ms FEROUKHI (Algeria) said that her country attached great importance to the mandate 
conferred on the Agency by Article III.B.1 of the Statute Â Âto promote peace and international cooperation 
... in conformity with polices of the United Nations furthering the establishment of 
safeguarded worldwide disarmament and in conformity with any international agreements entered into 
pursuant to such policiesÂ Â and to the mandate conferred on the Director General in resolutions in 
which the General Conference and the Board had affirmed the urgent need for the application of fullscope 
Agency safeguards throughout the Middle East and had called for the organization of a forum 
on experience relevant to the creation of an NWFZ there. 
92. Algeria was participating in the efforts aimed at universalization of the NPT and of 
comprehensive Agency safeguards that had been called for by NPT Review Conferences, the General 
Assembly and the General Conference, particularly in relation to the Middle East, where universal 
adherence to the NPT and the application of full-scope Agency safeguards in all States were 
absolutely essential. 
93. The forthcoming Forum on Experience of Possible Relevance to the Creation of a Nuclear- 
Weapons-Free Zone in the Middle East would be a tentative yet encouraging contribution to the effort 
to achieve general and complete disarmament, in accordance with the 13 practical steps agreed upon at 
the 2000 NPT Review Conference, over which Algeria had had the honour to preside. The Forum 
would provide an opportunity to launch a dialogue on regional security, and particularly on the 
creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
94. As one of the first States to ratify the Pelindaba Treaty, which had entered into force in July 
2009, Algeria was greatly in favour of the adoption of such regional confidence-building instruments 
in support of the achievement of general and complete disarmament. In that connection, it would like 
to see the nuclear-weapon States fulfilling their disarmament obligations arising out of Article VI of 
the NPT. 
95. The establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East could put an end to the imbalance caused by 
the existence of unsafeguarded Israeli nuclear facilities Â an imbalance unacceptable to the States in 
the region that were parties to the NPT. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 13 
96. Mr AL-HAMMADI (Qatar) said that the Arab Group, which was showing flexibility on the 
issue now under consideration in order to increase the chances of success of the 2012 conference on 
the creation of an NWFZ in the Middle East, was very concerned about the fact that Israel had 
persistently disregarded calls from the majority of States to place all its nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive Agency safeguards and participate in the establishment of a zone free of nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in that region. 
97. Qatar hoped that the international community would be prepared to take decisive measures to 
promote peace and security in the Middle East in the light of the outcome of the 2012 conference. 
98. Mr POURMAND TEHRANI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities 
were a serious security concern for the Middle East and the rest of the world. The aggressive practices 
of Israel and its complete disregard for international norms in defiance of over 100 resolutions adopted 
within the framework of the United Nations and the Agency showed its complete lack of respect for 
the international community. 
99. IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and comply with its provisions was the main obstacle to 
the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East; there was an urgent need for all the nuclear 
activities of the Israeli regime to be placed under comprehensive Agency safeguards. 
100. Since 1982, the General Conference had adopted numerous resolutions and decisions in which it 
had, inter alia, called upon the Israeli regime to accede to the NPT and accept comprehensive Agency 
safeguards. The failure of the Israeli regime to do so not only jeopardized global security, but 
undermined the AgencyÂs verification mechanism. 
101. All States in the Middle East should accept the application of full-scope Agency safeguards to 
their nuclear activities as an important confidence-building measure. The 2010 NPT Review 
Conference had called upon all States in the Middle East that had not yet done so to accede to the NPT 
as non-nuclear-weapon States, in order that universal adherence to the NPT might be achieved at an 
early date. 
102. Israel was continuing to ignore international norms and increase its illicit nuclear capabilities, 
with the assistance of certain nuclear-weapon States that were allowing Israeli scientists access to their 
nuclear facilities, even though the NPT stipulated that States parties should not provide States that 
were not parties with assistance which might enable them to produce nuclear weapons or other nuclear 
explosive devices. Any increase in IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities meant a still greater threat to peace and 
security in the Middle East and the world at large, but Israel had been emboldened to the point where 
Israeli representatives had openly admitted its possession of nuclear weapons. 
103. The issue of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities should remain on the agenda of the General 
Conference, and the Director General should draw up detailed recommendations for urgent practical 
steps to encourage Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards, in order to pave the way for the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. 
104. Mr BADDOURA (Lebanon) said that there had been little progress since the previous session 
of the General Conference towards the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East. Israel still 
refused to accede to the NPT and was continuing to cling to the military nuclear option in spite of the 
constant appeals of the international community. IsraelÂs assertion that it could not accede to the NPT 
until a comprehensive peace had been achieved in the Middle East was belied by the many other 
States of the Middle East which had acceded despite the many conflicts in the region. 
105. As well as the huge security threat in the Middle East posed by IsraelÂs aggressiveness, the 
ageing nuclear installations of Israel were a safety hazard Â an issue of which the international 
community had become more aware since the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 14 
Japan. The issue was an urgent one and should be on the agenda for the General ConferenceÂs next 
session. 
106. The NPT Review and Extension Conference had agreed in 1995 that the NPT should remain in 
force indefinitely, and the Member States of the Agency had agreed that nuclear energy should be 
used exclusively in the interests of peace and development. All of them should live up to that ideal. 
107. Mr DANIELI (Israel) said that, once again, the General Conference had been exposed to 
political diatribes from States of the Arab Group and their supporters. The request by the Arab Group 
to include an item on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ in the ConferenceÂs agenda had been especially 
unfortunate in view of the need for Member States to focus on the lessons to be learned from the 
accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. At a time of great challenges and 
transformations in the Middle East, were Arab States, in raising the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear 
capabilities once again, merely seeking to divert attention from their domestic problems? 
108. The States in question were the same ones which had prevented a consensus on the ÂMiddle 
East packageÂ of resolutions since 2006. 
109. Israel had not failed to comply with any of its international obligations, under the NPT or any 
other instrument. However, nothing had been done about the blatant cases of non-compliance with 
NPT obligations involving some States of the Middle East. The Director General had reported on the 
covert nuclear reactor built by the Syrian Arab Republic, with the assistance of the DPRK, and more 
would undoubtedly be discovered about the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction held by that 
country and the former Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and further light was being shed on the Islamic 
Republic of IranÂs activities in pursuit of nuclear weapons. Which country would be next? 
110. Israel, which acknowledged the importance of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, had 
repeatedly stated that it would not be the first country to introduce nuclear weapons into the Middle 
East. The greatest threats to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the NPT were posed by States 
which sought to obtain nuclear weapons despite their NPT membership. Thus far, the nonapplicability 
of the NPT in the Middle East had been amply demonstrated by the cases of Iraq, the 
former Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic Republic of Iran Â the 
situation in the two last-mentioned countries requiring the continued attention of the Agency. Much 
remained to be done if the aims of the NPT, the States parties to which were expected to refrain from 
the threat or use of force and work for peace and security, were to be achieved. 
111. The Member States with an anti-Israel agenda should not pursue it in the General Conference. 
That agenda served the narrow interests of some countries, but it harmed the wider interests of the 
Agency and its professional reputation. 
112. The decision of the Arab Group not to submit a draft resolution on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ 
at the General ConferenceÂs current session had been a positive one. However, for there to be genuine 
trust and confidence in the Middle East the politically divisive agenda item in question should not 
figure in future General Conference agendas. 
113. Mr DAVIES (United States of America) said that Member States should concentrate their 
efforts on making the Middle East free of all weapons of mass destruction and expressed the hope that 
the Arab GroupÂs decision not to submit a draft resolution on ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ at the 
General ConferenceÂs current session would usher in a new era of consensus. 
114. Mr UZCÃTEGUI DUQUE (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that his country, a 
supporter of the aspirations of the Arab States to create an NWFZ in the Middle East, wished to see 
Israel renouncing nuclear weapons, acceding to the NPT and submitting all its nuclear installations to 
GC(55)/OR.9 
23 September 2011, Page 15 
Agency safeguards. In its view, Israel should be denied all access to nuclear-related equipment, 
material and other resources and all other scientific and technological assistance in the nuclear field. 
115. The issue ÂIsraeli nuclear capabilitiesÂ should remain a top Agency priority, since IsraelÂs 
nuclear programme posed a threat to peace and security, especially in the Middle East, and 
undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
116. His Government, which deplored the efforts of a certain group of countries to prevent the 
Agency from verifying IsraelÂs nuclear activities, would like to see the international community 
pressing for the establishment of an NWFZ in the Middle East Â a process in which the Agency 
would play a fundamental role. 
Â Report on the Scientific Forum 
117. The PRESIDENT, recalling that the theme of the Scientific Forum 2011 had been ÂWater 
Matters: Making a Difference With Nuclear TechniquesÂ, invited the Chairperson of the Scientific 
Forum 2011, Ms Ruiz FernÃ¡ndez, to present the report on it. 
118. Ms RUIZ FERNÃNDEZ (Chairperson of the Scientific Forum 2011) presented the report, 
which is reproduced in the Annex. 
119. The PRESIDENT thanked Ms Ruiz FernÃ¡ndez for her report and commended her and the 
Secretariat on the success of the Scientific Forum 2011. 
The meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.

IAEA Scientific Forum 2011 
ÂWater Matters: Making a Difference with Nuclear TechniquesÂ 
Report to the General Conference by the Chairperson, 
Dr. Ana Carolina Ruiz FernÃ¡ndez 
Mr. President, Director General, Distinguished Delegates, 
I am pleased and honoured to be given this opportunity to present to the General Conference my 
report on the IAEA Scientific Forum 2011, whose theme was Water Matters: Making a Difference 
with Nuclear Techniques. 
Among the Millennium Development Goals for 2015, we have to halve the number of people 
without access to safe drinking water as well as to halve the number of people who suffer from 
hunger. Although progress has been made, there are still far too many people that do not have access 
to clean water for basic needs. 
In many coastal regions, human subsistence depends on the exploitation of marine resources. 
However, climate change and pollution are compromising the health of our oceans. 
Having focussed on cancer control last year, the Director General decided that he would give 
priority in 2011 to another major global challenge, the global water crisis. Thus, in this yearÂs 
Scientific Forum, the challenges related to water availability, the optimization of water use for food 
production and the protection of the oceans, and also how nuclear techniques can help, were addressed 
by a wide range of participants from national, regional and international organizations, and by 
beneficiaries of IAEA-supported technical cooperation projects. 
During the opening session, the Director General stressed, in reference to the title of this yearÂs 
Scientific Forum, that Âwater mattersÂ. He highlighted that there is virtually no area of human activity 
that does not depend on water. It is vital for human health, for agriculture, for industrial production, 
and for technological development. 
The Director General was joined by a very distinguished panel each member of which gave 
examples of the necessity for sound science to underpin sound water management decisions. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
Annex 
23 September 2011, Page 2 
In the session ÂMaking Water More AvailableÂ, the panellists underlined that the world is 
experiencing a Âglobal water crisisÂ and that more needs to be done. 
Capacity is a real problem. Too few countries have sufficient capacity to characterize their 
water resources, and it is estimated that the number of water professionals must be increased by up to 
300% in some parts of the world. 
Groundwater will be increasingly used to address the growing demand for water, yet most 
countries do not have sufficient information about their water resources. The new IAEA Water 
Availability Enhancement (IWAVE) project is an important step to address this problem. Monitoring 
is essential for making sound water management decisions. Programmes such as the IAEAÂs Global 
Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) and national networks are extremely important to 
maintain and expand. 
In the session ÂTackling Water Scarcity and Saving Water in AgricultureÂ, the panellists 
indicated that agriculture currently uses an average of 70% of available fresh water for irrigation. By 
2050 the global population will reach 9 billion, with an anticipated 50% increase in the demand for 
water to meet food demand. Thus, increased water use efficiency in agriculture will also be required. 
This was addressed by participants in an IAEA TC project involving 19 African countries who have 
worked to implement small-scale irrigation systems, supported by nuclear techniques, to make sure 
that every drop of water leads to greater yields. 
The 47-year-old FAO/IAEA partnership has been highly successful in improving water 
management in agriculture. The normative work of FAO is being complemented by capacity-building 
activities of the IAEA. This and other partnerships should be expanded. 
In the session ÂProtecting our oceansÂ, the panellists highlighted the transboundary nature of 
global issues affecting the marine environment. While research has considerably advanced in the last 
50 years, we still do not fully understand the complex processes related to global change; information 
is needed in order to develop appropriate marine policies. Nuclear techniques are often the only or the 
most efficient approach for addressing these needs. 
GC(55)/OR.9 
Annex 
23 September 2011, Page 3 
One example is that of the outbreak of harmful algal blooms where the public needs to be 
warned in time to avoid socio-economic losses. Nuclear techniques, such as the Receptor Binding 
Assay, are most effective for providing an early warning system for such outbreaks.. 
In the absence of long-term series of environmental data, sediment cores are the only way to 
obtain information needed in order to understand global changes to the marine environment and 
predict the consequences. In one TC project highlighted during the Forum, 12 Caribbean Member 
States received capacity-building and technical support in the use of radionuclides to make historical 
reconstructions of environmental changes. Through this they gained an understanding of the relevance 
of land-based sources of pollution and their impacts on the marine environment. Such success stories 
can be replicated. 
The panellists and other participants made clear the importance and urgency of responding to 
the global water crisis. This will become even more severe with increasing global change. Three 
factors were identified for improving responses to the crisis: 
1. Credible and timely scientific data to support decision-making. Nuclear techniques 
are very effective, often cheaper and more accurate than traditional methods to provide 
information needed for management. 
2. More effective communication among end-users, scientists and supporting agencies 
to maximize impact. It is not enough to generate data. It is imperative to be able to 
communicate results to the public, and that scientists and endÂusers participate jointly in 
the design and implementation of water management policies and programmes. Mutual 
outreach to communicate scientific results and necessary management responses should 
be a high priority. 
3. A stronger strategic framework for cooperation and synergies through collaborative 
partnerships should be established. It is important that UN agencies and programmes 
that are working on water issues work closely together. Partnerships between all 
stakeholders and end-users, particularly Member State institutions, should be enhanced.

In conclusion, the Scientific Forum showed the significant capabilities that have been 
established in several Member States. However, more still needs to be done in order to optimize 
capabilities to use nuclear science and technology for a better planet!

Â Oral report by the Chairperson of the Committee of the 
Whole 
1. Ms YPARRAGUIRRE (Philippines), Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole, presented the 
outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 15, 16 and 18. 
2. Under item 15, ÂNuclear security including measures to protect against nuclear and radiological 
terrorismÂ, the Committee recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution set out in 
document GC(55)/L.9. 
3. Under item 16, ÂStrengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activitiesÂ, the Committee 
recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution set out in document GC(55)/L.8/Rev.1. 
4. Under item 18, ÂStrengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Additional ProtocolÂ, the Committee was unable to reach 
agreement on a recommendation. 
5. She expressed her gratitude for the confidence that the Conference had placed in her by electing 
her to undertake the important task of chairing the Committee of the Whole. She thanked Ms BujÃ¡n 
Freire of Spain and Mr Csuday of Hungary, who had served as Vice-Chairpersons; Mr Brady of 
Ireland, who had worked tirelessly in conducting consultations on an important agenda item; the 
members of the Committee, for their particularly cooperative spirit; and the staff of the Secretariat, 
along with all others who had assisted in the CommitteeÂs work. 
6. Mr LUEDEKING (Germany) said that he was grateful to the Chairperson of the Committee of 
the Whole for her work but regretted the fact that the Committee had not been able to reach an 
agreement on all the agenda items referred to it. 
7. He proposed that the meeting be suspended, under Rule 61 of the Rules of Procedure of the 
General Conference, for 30 minutes in order that the situation might be considered. 
8. The PRESIDENT, having read out Rule 61 of the Rules of Procedure, and following objections 
on points of order by the representatives of ARGENTINA and the ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN, 
invited the Plenary to vote by show of hands on whether to suspend the meeting for 30 minutes under 
Rule 61, as proposed by the representative of Germany. 
9. There were 51 votes in favour and 29 against, with 16 abstentions. The proposal was adopted 
and the meeting suspended. 
The meeting was suspended at 9.40 p.m. and resumed at 10.15 p.m. 
Nuclear security, including measures to protect against nuclear and radiological terrorism 
(agenda item 15) 
10. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(55)/L.9 was adopted. 

GC(55)/OR.10 
23 September 2011, Page 2 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities (agenda item 16) 
11. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(55)L.8/Rev.1 was adopted. 
Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and 
application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 18) 
12. The PRESIDENT said that, as reported by the Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole, the 
Committee had been unable to reach an agreement on a recommendation under the agenda item 18. 
Consequently, there was no resolution before the Conference. However, on the basis of his 
consultations, he understood that the Conference wished to request the Director General to report to it 
at its fifty-sixth (2012) regular session on the implementation of resolution GC(54)/RES/11 adopted in 
2010. 
13. It was so decided. 
26. Report on contributions pledged to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund for 2012 
14. The PRESIDENT said that document GC(55)/22/Rev.4 contained details of pledges of 
contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2012 which governments had made to the 
Director General by 5:50 p.m. on 22 September 2011. By that time, Member States had pledged a total 
of Â8 086 381 or 12.98% of the target for 2012, which was 0.25% higher than the percentage of 
pledges received by the corresponding time in the preceding year. Since that document had been sent 
for printing, further Member States had communicated pledges to the Director General, as follows: 
Algeria Â Â76 632; China Â Â1 915 180; Palau Â Â623; and Senegal Â Â3 738. That brought the 
total amount pledged to Â10 082 554, or 16.18% of the 2012 Technical Cooperation Fund target. 
15. He urged all delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2012 pledges and to pay their 
contributions in full at the earliest opportunity so that the Secretariat could submit to the Technical 
Assistance and Cooperation Committee in November a proposed technical cooperation programme for 
2012Â2013, based on the level of pledges received, that it would be able to implement, after approval, 
without hindrance or uncertainty. 
Â Closing of the session 
16. The PRESIDENT said that the current session of the General Conference had been well 
attended by high-level representatives of Member States, including one Vice-President, 28 ministers 
and five ministers of State. During the general debate, 120 speakers had taken the floor. 
17. Mr ENKHSAIKHAN (Mongolia) paid tribute to the dedication, objectivity and neutrality with 
which the President had guided the work of the General Conference and that had enabled it to take 
important decisions. 
GC(55)/OR.10 
23 September 2011, Page 3 
18. He thanked the Vice-Presidents and the additional members of the General Committee for their 
contributions and commended the Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole and her colleagues for 
their tireless efforts. 
19. Mr MENESI (Libya) commended the PresidentÂs patience and sagacity, which had contributed 
greatly to the success of the ConferenceÂs current session. 
20. His delegation wished to take the opportunity to comment on media reports regarding the 
alleged discovery of a new site containing nuclear materials in Sebha, Libya. The discovery was not a 
new one, and his country had already reported the site to the Agency, whose safeguards inspectors had 
on numerous occasions visited it and verified the nuclear materials there. The Agency could be sure 
that, with the site under the supervision of LibyaÂs National Transitional Council, there would be no 
cause for concern. 
21. Mr SHAMAA (Egypt), speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, expressed gratitude 
for the manner in which the President had conducted the ConferenceÂs current session. His 
professionalism and patience had been major factors in the success of the session. 
22. The PRESIDENT, expressing his gratitude for the kind words addressed to him, said that it had 
been a great honour to serve as President of the General Conference during its fifty-fifth session. 
23. Serving as President of the General Conference had confirmed for him that where there was a 
will, there was a way and that no effort should be spared in the pursuit of a positive outcome. 
24. He was grateful to the Vice-Presidents and to the Chairperson of the Committee of the Whole 
and the other General Committee members for their contributions. He was also grateful to the Director 
General and the Secretariat staff for their support. In addition, he was grateful to the members of his 
own team, who had worked so hard in backing him up. 
25. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he 
invited the Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 
26. The PRESIDENT declared the fifty-fifth regular session of the General Conference closed. 
The meeting rose at 10.30 p.m.
