IMPLEMENTATION OF UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS 
RELATING TO IRAQ 
(GC(46)/13 and Corr.1; GC (46)/L.3 and Add.1) 

1. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark), introducing the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(46)/L.3 on behalf of the European Union and the co-sponsors, said that it 
directly addressed the AgencyÂs work in Iraq in connection with the implementation of 
relevant Security Council resolutions. Although there had been recent new developments, the 
Agency should not pre-empt that debate and move ahead of the Security Council. It had been 
almost four years since the Agency had been in a position to carry out its mandate in Iraq. 
The draft resolution supported and recognized the AgencyÂs efforts to maintain and improve 
its capabilities to carry out its mandate, and called on Iraq to provide immediate, 
unconditional and unrestricted access to Agency inspectors. 
2. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that his country had fulfilled its obligations as set 
forth in paragraphs 12 and 13 of Security Council resolution 687 (1991), as was confirmed by 
the Director GeneralÂs report contained in document GC(46)/13. On 19 September 2002, the 
Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs had read out to the current session of the General Assembly 
of the United Nations a message from President Hussein to that effect, which should have 
allayed the fears of all those who had heard the groundless claims by the United States of 
America with regard to IraqÂs alleged weapons of mass destruction. The countryÂs authorities 
would welcome a visit to any of its sites by experts and scientists, accompanied by politicians 
representing any country. 
3. Regrettably, the United States of America had spread unfounded allegations, which had 
led to the submission of the draft resolution in question. The latter was a purely political and 
biased document that formed part of a campaign by the United States to provoke war rather 
than seek wisdom and peace. It applied double standards, served only the aggressive military 
and economic aims of the United States, and blatantly ignored the 11-year embargo that had 
led to the suffering of millions of Iraqis, including children and the elderly. Many of the 
statements it contained on IraqÂs nuclear capabilities were groundless suppositions. 
Moreover, no mention was made of IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities and its refusal to adhere to 
the NPT. 
4. Operative paragraph 2 called for IraqÂs full co-operation with the Agency, implying that 
the drafters had not listened to IraqÂs commitment to allow the return of the inspectors. Some 
paragraphs spoke of the Agency mandate in Iraq where it would have been better to have 
reflected the international communityÂs welcome for IraqÂs wise decision. Operative 
paragraph 5 implied that IraqÂs nuclear capabilities had changed since the teams had left the 
country, which was inconsistent with the Director GeneralÂs report and the situation 
documented by the Security Council. Operative paragraph 6 repeated part of the language of 
the Director GeneralÂs report to the General Conference, while omitting other parts in order to 
skew the facts. 
5. There being no justification for the submission of the draft resolution, he requested that 
each of its paragraphs be put to a roll-call vote.

The meeting was suspended from 3.50 p.m. and resumed at 4.00 p.m. 

6. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark), invoking Rule 75 of the Rules of Procedure, 
objected to IraqÂs motion for division. 
The meeting was suspended at 4.05 p.m. and resumed at 4.10 p.m. 

7. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) said that his country could accept a roll-call vote on the 
draft resolution as a whole. 
8. Lithuania, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
9. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Holy See, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, 
Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Monaco, 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States of 
America, Uruguay, Yugoslavia. 

Abstaining: 
Algeria, Angola, Bangladesh, China, Cuba, Egypt, Ghana, India, 
Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, Malaysia, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, 
Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, 
United Republic of Tanzania, Viet Nam, Zambia. 

10. The draft resolution was adopted by sixty-two votes to zero, with twenty-five 
abstentions. 
11. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) said that Egypt had consistently called for the scrupulous 
implementation of Security Council resolutions as an essential condition for the maintenance 
of international peace and security. Thus, it had repeatedly urged Iraq to comply with 
relevant Security Council resolutions. IraqÂs recent acceptance of the unconditional return of 
inspectors should be welcomed as a positive development. Given the stated position of the 
EU on that issue, his country had expected that the resolution would, at the very least, have 
included similar language to the EU statement which Ânoted with interestÂ the new Iraqi 
position. Regrettably, the resolution did not adequately reflect that positive development but 
rather emphasized the negative side of the situation. Egypt had also hoped, in view of the 
recent developments, that the concerned parties would have redoubled their efforts to arrive at 
an agreed text. That, unfortunately, had not been the case.

page 7 

12. While his country continued to urge Iraq to implement its obligations under the relevant 
Security Council resolutions, it noted with regret that other countries in the region continued 
to flout Security Council resolutions with impunity. For instance, over twenty years ago 
Security Council resolution 487 (1981) had requested Israel to place its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. That was a clear case of double standards. 
13. For those reasons, Egypt had abstained from voting. 
14. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) thanked those countries that had abstained or left the 
meeting room during the vote and requested the General Conference to make a declaration 
expressing its satisfaction with IraqÂs decision to accept unconditionally the return of the 
inspectors. 
15. Mr. CHENG Jingye (China) said that his country had noted the report submitted 
by the Director General and it welcomed IraqÂs decision to accept unconditionally the return 
of the inspectors. It hoped that the inspectors would return to Iraq as soon as possible and 
submit an objective, impartial and independent verification report. ChinaÂs position regarding 
the issue under consideration had been consistent and clear: Iraq should fully and effectively 
implement the relevant Security Council resolutions, but its sovereignty and territorial 
integrity should be properly respected. The issue should be solved by political and diplomatic 
means within the framework of the United Nations. It was with those considerations in mind 
that his country had abstained from voting. 
16. Mr. BERDENNIKOV (Russian Federation) said that, since there was broad 
international consensus in favour of restarting inspections in Iraq, the adoption of resolution 
GC(46)/L.3 should play a positive role in the peaceful settlement of that complex situation. 
The resolution focused on the most important task, namely resuming inspections as soon as 
possible. The Russian Federation welcomed the Iraqi GovernmentÂs decision to readmit 
inspectors unconditionally, and fully supported the efforts being made in the Agency and the 
United Nations to facilitate the recommencement of inspections. It was in favour of solving 
the problem by political means based on the relevant Security Council resolutions, which was 
also the aim of the resolution. He expressed the hope that the immediate return of the 
inspectors to Iraq would be an important first step towards a solution which respected the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq, paving the way to the lifting of sanctions. 
17. Mr. BRILL (United States of America) said that his country welcomed the 
positive outcome of the vote and shared the hope that that clear message would be heeded in 
Iraq. However, there was reason to be sceptical since Iraq had consistently flouted the 
international community and broken its commitments. 
18. In its letter of 16 September to the United Nations Secretary-General, Iraq had agreed to 
the return of inspectors without condition. The aim of the United States was the verifiable 
disarmament of Iraq and the compliance of that country with all Security Council resolutions. 
The Iraqi letter provided no assurance that the Government in Baghdad intended to comply 
with its Security Council obligations and might only be a tactical step aimed at avoiding 
strong Security Council action. Indeed, Saddam HusseinÂs letter of 19 September to the 

GC(46)/OR.10 
page 8 

United Nations General Assembly already placed conditions on that so-called unconditional 
offer. 

19. He noted with concern that, since December 1998, the Agency had not been able to 
provide any measure of assurance that Iraq was in compliance with its United 
Nations-mandated disarmament obligations owing to the cessation of inspections. The longer 
Iraq delayed the AgencyÂs return, the longer it would take to re-establish the inspectorsÂ 
baseline knowledge. He commended the Agency for maintaining its readiness to resume 
inspection activities. The absence of the inspectors for almost four years had heightened 
concern. Iraq continued to withhold important information about its nuclear programme. It 
employed a battery of capable nuclear scientists and technicians and retained the physical 
infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon. Its State-controlled media had reported 
meetings between Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his 
continued interest in developing a nuclear weapon. 
20. Iraq knew what needed to be done. It had to prove its full co-operation with the United 
Nations and comply with all Security Council resolutions, including the obligation to disarm. 
The international community had to demand that any resumption of inspections in Iraq be 
immediate, unfettered and unrestricted, and ensure absolutely that Iraq complied in fact with 
what it sought to imply in words. 
21. Mr. BELAOURA (Algeria) expressed regret that it had not proved possible to 
have the resolution adopted by consensus. Algeria welcomed IraqÂs decision to accept 
unconditionally the return of the inspectors, a decision which facilitated the implementation of 
relevant Security Council resolutions while respecting the sovereignty and integrity of Iraq 
and the well-being of its people. It hoped that the new developments would contribute to a 
peaceful and lasting solution to the problem. 
ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

22. Mr. MOLTENI (Argentina), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented 
the outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on items 5(c), 13-17 and 22. All of the draft 
resolutions the Committee was submitting to the Plenary had been adopted in the Committee 
by consensus. In the case of the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(46)/COM.5/L.7/Rev.1 on item 16, Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the 
efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the Model Additional Protocol, the 
Committee had been unable to agree. Under item 15, Strengthening the AgencyÂs activities 
related to nuclear science, technology and its applications, four countries had expressed 
reservations with regard to a specific paragraph of draft resolution C contained in document 
GC(46)/L.6. Under item 5 (c), Restoration of voting rights, the Committee had recommended 
that the Conference request the Board to consider the criteria, guidelines and measures being 
applied in connection with requests for the restoration of voting rights, in particular the 
requirements for payment plans, and to deal with the matter at its June 2003 meetings 
following the meetings of the Programme and Budget Committee in May 2003. Finally, 
under item 22, Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee, the Committee had 
recommended to the General Conference that Mr. Aidan Kirwan of Ireland and 

GC(46)/OR.10 
page 9 

Mr. Raul Pelaez of Argentina be elected as Alternate Members to represent the General 
Conference on the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee. 

23. The PRESIDENT, having congratulated the Chairman, the two Vice-Chairmen 
and others who had assisted him on the manner in which they had conducted and facilitated 
the work of the Committee, invited the Conference to take up one by one the items considered 
by the Committee of the Whole. 
Restoration of Voting Rights (agenda item 5(c)) 

24. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the Conference requested the Board 
to consider the criteria, guidelines and measures being applied in connection with requests for 
the restoration of voting rights, in particular the requirements for payment plans, and to deal 
with the matter at its June 2003 meetings following the meetings of the Programme and 
Budget Committee in May 2003. 
Measures to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation, transport and 
waste safety (agenda item 13) 

25. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A, B, C and D 
contained in document GC(46)/L.7 were adopted. 
26. Mr. ENDO (Japan), referring to the development of radiological criteria for 
long-lived radionuclides in commodities, as mentioned in operative paragraph 18 of draft 
resolution A, said that that matter deserved careful discussion since the national legal 
mechanisms of each country and international trade would be influenced significantly by the 
introduction of radiological criteria for commodities. Furthermore, with respect to the safety 
of radioactive waste management, as mentioned in operative paragraph 22 of the same draft 
resolution, he urged the Secretariat and Member States to implement the actions described in 
Attachment 5 to document GC(46)/11, in particular Action 3 on safety standards for 
geological disposal, taking into account the many different factors that needed to be 
considered when selecting disposal sites in each country. 
27. Ms. BRIDGE (New Zealand) said that her country was very pleased that a 
consensus had been reached on the resolution on transport safety. She paid tribute to the 
Ambassador of Australia whose skill in chairing the negotiations had played a major role in 
their success. The large number of countries which had sponsored the resolution was 
pleasing. New Zealand was keen to see as strong an international regulatory regime as 
possible for the safe transport of radioactive material and hoped that the resolution would help 
achieve that objective. 
Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities (agenda item 14) 

28. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(46)L.5 was adopted. 
29. Mr. ENDO (Japan) said that it was extremely important to ensure a payment level 
to the TCF beyond the rate of attainment. Japan had consistently paid 100% of its share of 

GC(46)/OR.10 
page 10 

the TCF target, which meant that the proportion of the funds in the TCF it had been supplying 
had been increasing substantially. If that situation continued, it might be forced to reconsider 
its policy in that regard. 

30. It was also important that Member States paid their assessed programme costs. His 
country had stated clearly during the meetings of the Board of Governors in September 2002 
that it would not stand in the way of a consensus on the higher target for the TCF in 2003, on 
the understanding that countries undertook to reduce and eliminate their arrears in the 
payment of assessed programme costs. 
31. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that her country had joined the consensus on the 
draft resolution just adopted even though it felt that it overemphasized the role of nuclear 
power. While it understood that several countries needed to resort to all sources of power in 
order to promote their development, Kuwait did not believe that nuclear power was the only 
option open to others. Moreover, the resolution was too selective in describing the role of 
nuclear power in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, since other sources of energy could 
also contribute to that goal. 
Strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and 
applications (agenda item 15). 

32. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A, B, C and D 
contained in document GC(46)/L.6 were adopted. 
33. Mr. STELZER (Austria), speaking on behalf of Austria, Denmark, Ireland, 
Luxembourg and New Zealand, said that those countries had strong reservations with regard 
to preambular paragraph (c) of draft resolution C contained in document GC(46)/L.6. Having 
rejected nuclear energy themselves, they believed it incompatible with the objectives of 
sustainable development since risks related to safety, waste management and transport 
remained unresolved. However, they had decided not to block the adoption of the resolution. 
Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system 
and application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 16) 

34. The PRESIDENT suggested that, since the Committee of the Whole had failed to 
agree on the draft resolution contained in document GC(46)/COM.3/L.7/Rev.1, discussion of 
the item in question should be postponed till later. 
35. It was so agreed. 
Nuclear Security - progress on measures to protect against nuclear terrorism 

(agenda item 17). 

36. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(46)L.4 was adopted.

Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee (agenda item 22) 

37. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, Mr. Aidan Kirwan of Ireland and Mr. 
Raul Pelaez of Argentina were elected as Alternate Members to represent the General 
Conference on the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee. 
STRENGTHENING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF 
THE SAFEGUARDS SYSTEM AND APPLICATION OF THE MODEL ADDITIONAL 
PROTOCOL 
(GC(46)/COM.5/L.7/Rev.1) 

38. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark), introducing the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(46)/COM.5/L.7/Rev.1 on behalf of the European Union and the co-sponsors, 
said that the text, which had been produced by an informal working group, was merely a 
refinement of document GC(46)/COM.5/L.7 but did not contain any substantive changes. 
The discussions in the informal working group had reflected the desire of the participants to 
co-operate, and take into account and respect the sensibilities of different countries. The 
importance of reaching a consensus had been recognized by all. 
39. Mr. FRANK (Israel) requested that operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution 
be voted upon separately. 
40. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) requested that the vote be taken by roll-call. 
41. Botswana, having been drawn by lot by the President, was called upon to vote first. 
42. The result of the vote was as follows: 
In favour: 
Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Belarus, 
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, 
Colombia, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, 
Greece, Guatemala, Holy See, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, 
Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Republic 
of Korea, Kuwait, Latvia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, 
Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Namibia, Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Philippines, 
Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, 
Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, 
Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United 
Republic of Tanzania, United States of America, Viet Nam, 
Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zambia. 

Against: 
India, Israel, Pakistan.

Abstaining:1 Angola, Botswana, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan. 

43. Operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution was adopted by eighty-four votes to three, 
with four abstentions. 
44. The PRESIDENT asked whether the Conference wished to adopt the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(46)/COM.5/L.7/Rev.1 as a whole. 
45. It was so decided. 
46. Mr. SREENIVASAN (India) said that his Government attached great importance 
to the AgencyÂs safeguards activities. However, the purpose of the strengthened safeguards 
system and the Model Additional Protocol was to detect undeclared nuclear activities and 
facilities in States which had concluded comprehensive safeguards pursuant to the NPT. The 
Agency owed its success to the meticulous manner in which it had carried out its tasks in 
accordance with its mandate without getting entangled in extraneous issues. It was not the 
watchdog of nuclear non-proliferation or disarmament, nor was it the secretariat of the NPT. 
47. Up until 2000, a delicate compromise had been maintained in the language used in 
safeguards resolutions. However, in 2001 a new operative paragraph had been added which 
contradicted the spirit of that compromise. During the current session, his country had made a 
sincere effort to achieve a compromise, but to no avail. 
48. The signing of treaties was a Member StateÂs sovereign decision and IndiaÂs 
membership of the Agency did not impose upon it any obligation beyond those contained in 
the Statute. It could not accept any resolution which ran counter to the spirit of that Statute 
and had therefore had no option but to vote against operative paragraph 3. 
49. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his country supported the strengthening of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. However, it had voted against operative paragraph 3 and, in that 
connection, he endorsed the remarks made by the representative of India. 
50. Mr. NAQVI (Pakistan) expressed disappointment at the failure to achieve a 
consensus on operative paragraph 3 of the resolution, despite the working groupÂs efforts. His 
country had been prepared to work towards a mutually acceptable solution but, since a vote 
had been necessary, he wished to place on record his countryÂs position on the universal 
application of Agency safeguards. 
51. Articles II and XII of the AgencyÂs Statute made it clear that safeguards agreements 
applied only to Agency projects or other instances where the Agency was requested by the 
parties concerned to apply safeguards. The resolution was therefore in contradiction of the 
AgencyÂs own Statute. It was a fundamental principle of international law that a State was 
bound only by those obligations which it had accepted when it acceded to a treaty or 
agreement. 
Kazakhstan later informed the Secretariat that it had meant to vote in favour. 


GC(46)/OR.10 
page 13 

52. Pakistan had shown itself to be constructive, consistent and responsible in nuclear 
matters. It had developed its own nuclear capability for the purposes of deterrence and 
national defence, but it had exercised the utmost restraint and had made specific proposals 
aimed at preventing a nuclear arms race in the region. It would continue to co-operate with 
the international community in the fields of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear 
disarmament. 
EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS 

53. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his country was unable to 
recognize IsraelÂs credentials which had been issued from the occupied territory of Al-Quds 
(Jerusalem). 
REPORT ON CONTRIBUTIONS PLEDGED TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION 
FUND FOR 2003 
(GC(46)/22/Rev.3) 

54. The PRESIDENT said that, by 6.30 p.m. on 19 September 2002, the contributions 
pledged by Member States to the Technical Co-operation Fund had amounted to 
US $7 609 147, or 10.18% of the target for 2003, which was 1.24% lower than the percentage 
of the target for 2002 pledged by the same point in the preceding year. Since then, further 
Member States had communicated pledges to the Director General, bringing the total amount 
pledged to $8 888 954, or 11.89% of the target. 
55. He urged those delegations which had not yet done so to make their 2003 pledges and to 
pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, so that the Secretariat could submit 
to the Technical Assistance and Co-operation Committee a proposed 2003 programme based 
on reasonably assured resources and subsequently implement the approved programme 
without hindrance or uncertainty. 
CLOSING OF THE SESSION 

56. Mr. MANNINEN (Finland) thanked the President for bringing the work of the 
General Conference to a successful and punctual conclusion. In particular, he commended the 
PresidentÂs handling of the agenda items which had been dealt with at that dayÂs 
meetings. The President had also taken part in many informal consultations outside the 
meeting room in an attempt to reconcile diverging views. 
57. Mr. HUGHES (Australia), speaking on behalf of the countries of the South East 
Asia and the Pacific Group, thanked the President for facilitating the smooth running of the 
session. The successful conclusion of the ConferenceÂs work owed a great deal to his 
personal efforts. 
58. The PRESIDENT thanked all participants for the co-operation and assistance they 
had given him throughout the session. He also thanked the Director General and his able and 
dedicated staff for their valuable support, and the Austrian authorities and the city of Vienna 
for their hospitality. 

GC(46)/OR.10

59. Finally, in accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure, he invited the 
Conference to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and observed one minute of silence. 

60. The PRESIDENT declared the forty-sixth regular session of the General 
Conference closed. 
The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.

OPENING OF THE SESSION 

1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-sixth regular session of 
the General Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he 
invited delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT recalled that the previous yearÂs session of the 
General Conference had been overshadowed by the terrorist attack of 11 September. That 
terrifying event had deserved attention and strong reactions. The good co-operation of all 
delegations and the SecretariatÂs dedicated help had enabled him, as President, to bring the 
Conference to a successful close. 
4. During the past year, the Secretariat had been closely engaged in developing and 
implementing action plans for combating nuclear terrorism, but despite those unexpected 
additional activities, the regular programme had been carried out as planned. 
5. The AgencyÂs constructive contribution to the preparation of the recent United Nations 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg was to be commended. The 
conferenceÂs final outcome did not contain anything that would suggest major changes to the 
AgencyÂs programme. However, the views of countries remained sharply divided as far as 
nuclear power was concerned. A group of countries rejected its use, whereas many other 
countries considered it to be a viable option in their energy mix. One reason for the 
unfavourable attitude was lack of confidence in the ability of scientists and engineers to 
develop safe and ethically acceptable solutions for the final disposal of high-level nuclear 
waste and spent nuclear fuel. In some countries, however, such confidence seemed to have 
grown. The Parliament of Finland and the Congress of the United States of America had 
recently approved final disposal facilities for high-level nuclear waste in Olkiluoto and in the 
Yucca Mountain, respectively. 
6. There had also been some indications of emerging changes in favour of nuclear power 
in the energy policies of certain countries. The AgencyÂs programme contained topics 
reflecting that new situation, such as the increasing work of INPRO and the activities related 
to the management of nuclear knowledge. 
7. An effective international safeguards system was generally accepted as a prerequisite 
for nuclear co-operation. The ongoing activities for further strengthening the AgencyÂs 
safeguards enjoyed broad support among Member States. He stressed in that context how 
important it was for all States that had not already done so to conclude and bring into force 
the required safeguards agreements and additional protocols at an early date. 
ELECTION OF OFFICERS AND APPOINTMENT OF THE GENERAL COMMITTEE 

8. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT invited nominations for the office of President 
of the Conference. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 6 

9. Mr. HUGHES (Australia), speaking on behalf of the South East Asia and the 
Pacific Group, proposed Mr. Rajasa (Indonesia) for that position. 
10. Mr. Rajasa (Indonesia) was elected President by acclamation. 
11. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT congratulated Mr. Rajasa on his election and 
wished him every success in his task. 
Mr. Rajasa (Indonesia) took the Chair. 

12. The PRESIDENT thanked all delegations for supporting his nomination. He 
expressed gratitude to his predecessor, Mr. GrÃ¶nberg, for his able guidance of the previous 
session of the General Conference. 
13. As was well known, peaceful applications of nuclear technology continued to contribute 
positively to human development. The Agency played an important part in accelerating and 
enlarging the contribution of atomic energy to health, prosperity, peace and justice throughout 
the world. He underscored its crucial role in the area of promotion, safeguards and technical 
co-operation. 
14. When carefully used for peaceful purposes, nuclear energy had proven itself to be 
everyoneÂs friend. From fulfilling such basic needs as increasing agricultural productivity, 
water management, feeding and improving the health of the worldÂs growing population, 
enhancing the quality of industrial output and alleviating problems associated with 
urbanization to providing the energy needed for economic growth and development, the 
benefits of nuclear technology were wide-ranging. 
15. The General Conference would be discussing international issues relating to nuclear 
technology in order to find ways of increasing and improving not only its availability and 
accessibility but also its safety and security. 
16. Many years of experience had shown that nuclear technology could assist the 
international community in achieving sustainable development. That would serve as an 
important alternative tool for improving social welfare and alleviating poverty, which in turn 
would help ensure that a segment of society did not embrace radical ideologies or terrorist 
activities. 
17. Turning to the election of officers and appointment of the General Committee, he 
recalled that under Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference had to elect 8 
Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and 5 additional members of 
the General Committee, resulting, with himself as Chairman, in a Committee of 15. The 
current year, however, there was agreement among the regional groups that there should be a 
Committee of 16, since the President of the Conference came from a region which 
customarily had only one representative on the General Committee. 
18. From the consultations that had taken place, he understood that there was a consensus 
on that matter, and he therefore proposed that: the delegates of Algeria, Guatemala, Jordan, 
the Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, Thailand and the United 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 7 

States of America be elected as Vice-Presidents; that Mr. Molteni (Argentina) be elected as 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole; and that the delegates of Armenia, Canada, 
Hungary, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland be 
elected as additional members of the General Committee. 

19. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
20. The PRESIDENT further proposed that, in order to save time, the General 
Conference should deal with items 2, 3 and 6 pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs 
recommendation on the provisional agenda. 
21. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
APPLICATIONS FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE AGENCY 
(GC(46)/3, 4 and 17) 

22. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(46)/3, 4 and 17 containing 
applications for membership by the State of Eritrea, the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of 
Seychelles, respectively. The three applications had been endorsed by the Board, which had 
also submitted three draft resolutions for adoption by the General Conference. 
23. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt the three applications by acclamation. 
24. It was so decided. 
25. Ms. DJESHENKULOV (Kyrgyz Republic) thanked delegations for their support 
of her countryÂs application for membership of the Agency and assured them that Kyrgyzstan 
intended to meet its obligations as a member and act in accordance with the purpose and 
principles of the Charter of the United Nations. 
26. KyrgyzstanÂs nuclear energy policy had always been in line with the AgencyÂs 
underlying principles. Her Government continued to attach particular importance to the non proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and was making every effort to put an end to the illegal 
transit of nuclear material through the territory of Kyrgyzstan. 
27. Her Government greatly appreciated the technical assistance which the Agency was 
providing to Kyrgyzstan in the areas of training for national customs officials and the holding 
of international seminars to which Kyrgyzstan officials had been invited. In particular, she 
expressed thanks for the provision of experts for the seminar held in KyrgyzstanÂs capital in 
May 2001 on the rehabilitation of former uranium deposits. 
28. In closing, she stressed that Kyrgyzstan was eager to broaden all aspects of its cooperation 
with the Agency and its Member States at both the bilateral and multilateral level.

MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS 

29. Mr. DHANAPALA (Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs) read out 
the following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my greetings to the 46th General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. 

ÂAs all of you and, indeed, the world at large, are all too aware, nuclear disarmament 
and nuclear non-proliferation remain unfinished tasks. The strengthening of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, including concrete steps to reduce the number of and 
dependence on nuclear weapons, is more critical than ever for the continuing 
sustainability and credibility of that regime. The IAEA continues to play a central role 
in that regime through its long-standing work to verify compliance with 
non-proliferation obligations. 

ÂEffective measures are also needed to reduce the risk of weapons of mass destruction 
falling into the hands of terrorists. I urge the IAEA to continue its initiatives for this 
purpose, including its programmes aimed at safeguarding nuclear material against nonpeaceful 
uses, ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities and preventing the 
illicit trafficking of nuclear material and radiation sources. 

ÂDespite these concerns, peaceful uses of nuclear technologies and materials will 
continue to be an important factor in economic development - not only in producing 
nuclear energy, but also in helping to fight disease, enhancing agricultural production, 
managing water resources and monitoring the environment. The IAEA must do its 
utmost to address the real concerns about safety and waste and transform nuclear energy 
into a force for progress. 

ÂI look forward to working with the IAEA in facing these and other complex 
challenges, and I wish you success in your important deliberations.Â 

STATEMENT BY THE DIRECTOR GENERAL 

30. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that recent years had witnessed important 
changes and events relevant to every aspect of the AgencyÂs work. All those changes and 
events had had a profound impact on its activities and priorities. 
31. Beginning with nuclear technology and the area of nuclear power, he said that the 
urgent need for sustained human development would clearly necessitate increases in the 
supply of energy and electricity in the coming decades. Nuclear power was currently a 
significant contributor to world electricity and continued to be the only source that could 
provide electricity on a large scale with comparatively minimal impact on the environment. 
32. Nuclear power remained, however, mainly in a holding position. While its 
environmental merits were increasingly recognized, public concerns persisted, principally 
about operational safety and waste disposal. For a number of years, he had been stressing that 
the future of nuclear power would depend on sustaining a strong safety record, improving 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 9 

economic competitiveness and demonstrating waste management solutions and technological 
developments - in short, regaining public support. He was pleased to note that, in the past 
year, there had been positive developments in many of those areas. 

33. In 2001, nuclear power had supplied 16.2% of the worldÂs electricity, up from 15.9% 
in 2000. That increase had been mainly due to continuing improvements in plant availability 
as a result of effective management. 
34. With regard to the construction of new plants, Asia and Eastern Europe remained the 
centres of expansion. Some important developments had also taken place recently in Western 
Europe and North America. The United States Government had made a commitment to work 
with the nuclear industry to have a new nuclear plant operating in the country before the end 
of the decade. That would be the first start of construction of a new nuclear plant in the 
United States of America since the late 1970s. And in May the Finnish Parliament had 
ratified the GovernmentÂs favourable Âdecision-in-principleÂ to build a fifth nuclear power 
plant. That was also the first decision to build a new reactor in Western Europe in 15 years, 
and contrasted with past decisions in Belgium, Germany and Sweden to phase out nuclear 
energy. 
35. In the light of those developments, a key challenge for the industry would be to prove 
that available new designs addressed the often expressed concerns about nuclear power. 
Work was being carried out on advanced water cooled reactors, modular high temperature gas 
cooled reactors, liquid metal cooled fast reactors and accelerator driven systems. All those 
new designs aimed to produce electricity at an enhanced level of safety, and some sought to 
serve additional aims, such as producing hydrogen as a clean fuel source, producing potable 
water at minimal cost, incinerating long-lived radioactive waste and reducing plutonium 
stockpiles. 
36. Despite the positive results achieved to date on new designs, nuclear energy, like all 
other technologies, must continue to innovate if it was to play a significant long-term role 
commensurate with its potential. The Agency encouraged collaborative innovation - through 
both INPRO and close co-operation with similar efforts. The INPRO International 
Co-ordinating Group was currently working to define user requirements related to economics, 
waste, safety, non-proliferation and other issues. 
37. For many countries - particularly developing countries - an important potential use of 
nuclear power was for seawater desalination. More than one billion people had no access to 
clean water. The focus of the AgencyÂs nuclear desalination activities was being shifted to 
country-specific projects. One of them, the Indian nuclear desalination project at Kalpakkam, 
was currently in the commissioning test stage. Those nuclear desalination projects should 
help enhance understanding of the technical and economic feasibility of using nuclear power 
to produce clean potable water. 
38. The management and disposal of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste continued 
to be a major point of public concern with respect to nuclear power. Some important progress 
had taken place in the past twelve months. In the United States the selection of the Yucca 
Mountain site as a repository for high-level waste and spent fuel had already been approved 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 10 

by the President and Congress. Also Sweden had begun geological investigation of candidate 
sites for a spent fuel repository. Thus, together with the decision in Finland to go forward 
with a deep disposal facility near the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant - on which he had 
reported to the General Conference in 2001 - it was likely that by the end of the coming 
decade one or more repositories for the disposal of high-level waste and spent fuel would be 
in operation. As he had often stated, the most important step in gaining public confidence in 
that area would be to demonstrate that technologically and environmentally sound waste 
disposal solutions existed and were actually working. 

39. A major part of the AgencyÂs technology activity was focused on transferring nuclear 
technology in applications other than nuclear power. A few examples would illustrate the 
range and variation of Agency activities in those areas. 
40. Many of the AgencyÂs developing Member States had given high priority to the 
introduction or upgrading of radiotherapy services. Radiotherapy was used with curative or 
palliative benefit for over 50% of cancer patients in industrialized countries. However, two 
thirds of global teletherapy equipment served the populations of industrialized countries - and 
the remaining third was stretched among the remaining 5.5 billion people. It was therefore 
expected that requests for assistance would increase, especially given recent Agency 
successes in initiating radiotherapy programmes in some developing Member States, 
including Ethiopia, Ghana, Mongolia, Namibia and Uganda. 
41. Tsetse flies, and the sleeping sickness they transmitted to humans and ngana disease to 
livestock, created a significant burden on rural populations across Sub-Saharan Africa - not 
only in terms of direct health effects, but also by restricting the use of draft animals in crop 
production. The Agency supported the efforts of African Member States to implement the 
Pan-African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign, including the use of the 
sterile insect technique. Mali had begun preparation for releasing sterile tsetse flies over an 
area of 2500 square kilometres, and Ethiopia was constructing a factory for sterile tsetse 
production that would supply a similar project over a 5000 square kilometre area. 
42. The use of isotope hydrology in water resources management was continuing to gain 
recognition through technical co-operation projects in 40 countries around the world. Isotope 
hydrology was used to map underground aquifers for improved groundwater management and 
for investigation and recovery from contamination events. In addition, the Agency was 
exploring uses of isotope hydrology to assist in river basin management and - based on its 
successful experience in Venezuela in isolating and correcting dam leakage - it was working 
with multiple teams under AFRA to assess the leakage and structural integrity of dozens of 
dams across Africa. 
43. To conclude his review of developments in nuclear technology, he said that while the 
Secretariat was aware of the merits of nuclear power and its potential, it was equally aware of 
the concerns associated with it and the divergent views that existed today on its role. The 
choice of whether to use nuclear power was a national prerogative. The AgencyÂs statutory 
role, however, was to ensure - by fostering safety, security and technological development that 
that important energy source, as well as the benefits from the broad range of other nuclear 
applications, remained available for those who wanted to make use of them. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 11 

44. Safety in nuclear activities around the globe remained a key factor for the future of 
nuclear technology. It was satisfying to note that nuclear safety continued to improve at 
power plants worldwide. Nevertheless, more work needed to be done. The need for a more 
effective and transparent global nuclear safety regime, therefore, continued to be a high 
priority. 
45. The development and adoption of legally binding norms had proven to be a powerful 
mechanism for enhancing safety worldwide. The Early Notification and Assistance 
Conventions were long established. The Joint Convention had been in force for over a year. 
In April, the Agency had hosted in Vienna the second review meeting of Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. However, many States were not yet party to those 
Conventions, and certain key areas of the nuclear fuel cycle were still not subject to 
conventions. The development and continuing evolution of a comprehensive body of safety 
standards, together with assistance in their implementation, was another key component of the 
global safety regime. The major overhaul of the AgencyÂs safety standards programme 
initiated in the mid-1990s had resulted in a revised oversight committee structure and a set of 
standards which represented present international best practice, and were thus to be regarded 
as universally applicable. 
46. Turning to the application of safety standards, he urged Member States to make use of 
the AgencyÂs safety services. Developed on the basis of the AgencyÂs safety standards, its 
safety services ranged in focus from operational and radiation safety to safety culture and 
regulatory review, and provided important feedback on the effectiveness of their 
implementation. 
47. The Agency continued to refine its regulations for the safe transport of radioactive 
material, and was collaborating closely with the IMO on the preparation of its emergency 
management schedules. In the past year, Agency TranSAS missions had been carried out in 
Brazil and the United Kingdom to help those countries assess their own effectiveness in 
applying the AgencyÂs transport standards. He urged Member States, particularly transporting 
countries, to make use of that service, and said that the Agency would continue to co-operate 
with all concerned with a view to enhancing all aspects of transport safety. 
48. In response to growing concerns about the potential loss of knowledge arising from the 
ageing and retirement of the nuclear workforce, and the decreasing level of support for 
university programmes on nuclear science and engineering, the Agency had recently held a 
meeting entitled ÂManaging Nuclear KnowledgeÂ at which experts from Member States had 
compared notes with a view to establishing what more could be achieved through 
co-operative international efforts. The meeting had concluded that urgent international 
co-operation throughout the nuclear community was required in order to promote mutually 
supportive networking among governments, industrial leaders and academic institutions. 
49. He observed that there was still much room for improvement in areas such as research 
reactor safety, the control of radioactive sources, and safety at certain power reactors and 
waste management facilities built in accordance with older safety standards. Important 
components in that process would be achieving wide adherence to the existing safety 
conventions and the adoption of legally binding agreements for the remaining areas of nuclear 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 12 

activity. Also important would be the completion of an entire set of safety standards, together 
with the upgrading of all the existing standards and a simultaneous effort to ensure their 
universal application. 

50. The universalization, consolidation and strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime, including the taking of concrete steps to reduce the number of and level of 
dependence on, nuclear weapons, were more important than ever to the regimeÂs 
sustainability and credibility. At the regimeÂs centre stood the AgencyÂs verification system. 
In the Safeguards Implementation Report for 2001, the Agency had been able to conclude 
that, in the 141 States (and in Taiwan, China) which had safeguards agreements in force, the 
nuclear material and other items placed under safeguards had remained in peaceful nuclear 
activities or had otherwise been accounted for adequately. Moreover, for several States - each 
of which had both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in 
force - the Agency had been able to provide broader assurance which also took account of the 
absence of undeclared nuclear material or activities. Since the previous session of the General 
Conference, new safeguards agreements had entered into force for Kuwait, the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mali and Yemen. Ten States had signed additional 
protocols, and additional protocols had entered into force for China, the Czech Republic, 
Ecuador, Mali, Panama and South Africa. Unfortunately, the number of safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols in force was well below expectations. Forty-eight States 
had yet to fulfil their obligations under the NPT to bring safeguards agreements with the 
Agency into force, and additional protocols had entered into force for only 28 States. For the 
Agency to provide the required level of assurance, it must have the required authority. 
51. The Secretariat had continued its efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system and make it more cost efficient. In that regard, the completion of the 
conceptual framework for integrated safeguards and its submission to the Board at its session 
in March constituted a major milestone. As a result, for States with both a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol in force, and in which the necessary 
safeguards conclusions had been drawn, the Agency would be able to implement safeguards 
in a way that made the verification process more robust and efficient. Integrated safeguards, 
together with the conceptual framework that guided them, paved the way for a new system of 
verification that was both more comprehensive in its outlook and more effective and efficient 
in its measures. 
52. For nearly four years, the Agency had not been in a position to implement its mandate 
in Iraq under Security Council resolution 687 and related resolutions. At the time of its last 
inspection in December 1998, the Agency had reported to the Security Council that - on the 
basis of the inspections carried out over the previous seven years - there was no indication 
that Iraq had achieved its goal of producing a nuclear weapon, nor that there remained in Iraq 
any physical capability for the production of amounts of weapon useable material of any 
practical significance. Since that time, however, the Agency had been unable to draw any 
conclusion or provide any assurance regarding IraqÂs compliance with its obligations under 
the Security Council resolutions. Upon recommencement of inspections, therefore, the 
Agency would have to resolve the key issue of whether the situation had changed in any 
significant way since December 1998. Since the Agency had no additional information that 
could be directly linked without inspection to IraqÂs nuclear activities, the resumption of 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 13 

inspections represented a crucial step towards providing assurance to the international 
community that IraqÂs nuclear weapons programme had been neutralized and was not being 
revived. As a participant in the two rounds of talks held earlier in the year between the 
Secretary-General and Iraq, the Agency had made it clear that, once inspectors returned to 
Iraq and provided that Iraq co-operated in all respects, the Agency would need approximately 
one year to be in a position to report to the Security Council as to whether the conditions for 
the suspension of sanctions under Security Council resolution 1284 had been met. He 
therefore joined the Secretary-General in urging Iraq to accept the resumption of inspections 
without delay, as an indispensable step that was clearly in the interests of both the 
international community and Iraq itself. 

53. Turning to matters concerning the DPRK, he said that, since 1993, the Agency had been 
unable to implement fully its comprehensive safeguards agreement with that country, and 
more specifically, to verify that the DPRK had declared all the nuclear material that was 
subject to Agency safeguards under its NPT safeguards agreement. Since November 1994, 
the Agency had been monitoring the ÂfreezeÂ of the DPRKÂs graphite moderated reactor and 
related facilities, under the terms of the Agreed Framework between the United States of 
America and the DPRK. Assuming full co-operation by the DPRK, the Agency estimated 
that the work required in order to verify the correctness and completeness of the DPRKÂs 
initial declaration could take three or four years. That verification work was both a basic 
obligation of the DPRKÂs safeguards agreement and a prerequisite to the delivery of key 
nuclear components under the terms of the Agreed Framework. KEDO had informed the 
Agency that the delivery of those components for the first reactor would take place by 2005. 
Therefore, any further delays to the AgencyÂs verification activities in the DPRK could lead to 
a delay in implementation of the KEDO project. He urged the DPRK to agree without further 
delay to the commencement of the long overdue verification process, and also to enter into 
dialogue with the Agency on that and other issues relating to the normalization of relations 
between the DPRK and the Agency. 
54. Pursuant to the mandate given to him by the General Conference, he had continued his 
consultations with States of the Middle East region on the application of full-scope safeguards 
to all nuclear activities in the Middle East and on the development of model agreements that 
would contribute to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free-zone in that region. Once 
again, he was disappointed to have to report that no progress had been made. Nevertheless, 
he intended to use all means at his disposal to move the process forward. 
55. Agency verification continued to play a critical role in ensuring the health and vitality of 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It was essential to continue making progress on nuclear 
arms control and disarmament, and in the process achieve universal application of the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. An immediate priority in that regard was the conclusion of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols by all the States which, in 
entering into non-proliferation commitments under the NPT and other relevant agreements, 
had also entered into a legal obligation to apply Agency safeguards. 
56. Turning to protection against nuclear terrorism, he recalled that, in the wake of the 
terrorist attacks in the United States, the 45th General Conference had adopted a resolution 
requesting him to initiate a thorough review of Agency activities and programmes relating to 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 14 

the prevention of acts of terrorism involving nuclear and radioactive materials. By the 
following March, the AgencyÂs Board of Governors had approved a plan of enhanced and 
new activities to upgrade nuclear security worldwide. Implementation of the plan had then 
started in earnest: two IPPAS missions had been conducted in Romania and the Czech 
Republic, one follow-up mission had been performed in Bulgaria, and another two were 
planned for Lithuania and Ukraine. In addition, training courses and workshops had been 
held in a number of countries on physical protection, design-basis threat, State systems of 
accountancy and control, and nuclear forensics. Since December 2001, the Agency had 
helped to locate and secure a number of radioactive sources in Georgia, Kabul and Uganda. 
While the primary responsibility for addressing such concerns continued to reside with 
individual States, it was essential that the Agency and Member States worked together to 
ensure effective national and international systems of nuclear security, and that Member 
States continued to contribute the resources needed for full implementation of the plan. It was 
clear that much remained to be done in the area of nuclear security. The Agency attached 
high priority to IPPAS missions and threat assessment training as tools for helping protect 
nuclear facilities and material against attack, sabotage or theft, and believed they should be 
extended to cover other nuclear facilities, including research installations that also contained 
nuclear and other radioactive material. Another highly important task was that of bringing 
radioactive sources under appropriate control. 

57. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme was a principal mechanism for 
implementing its fundamental mission of Âatoms for peaceÂ. Not only did the Agency seek to 
ensure that nuclear materials and equipment were used peacefully and safely, but it was also 
committed to expanding the contribution that nuclear technologies made to peace and 
development. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, which focused more directly 
on the specific needs and priorities of recipient Member States, delivered approximately 
US $70 million per year of expert services, training and equipment as a complement to the 
Regular Budget programme, in activities relating to all three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities. 
The main objective of the 2002 version of the Technical Co-operation Strategy submitted to 
the Board of GovernorÂs June meetings remained that of responding to socio-economic 
development needs through the introduction and transfer of appropriate nuclear technologies. 
The Strategy also continued to emphasize the importance of adequate funding, high-quality 
project designs, and strong government commitment. 
58. With respect to the financing of technical co-operation, he was pleased to report that an 
attainment rate of 80% had been achieved in the previous year, as prescribed by the General 
Conference. However, the rate of attainment for the current year stood at 58%, as against the 
target of 85%. He thanked the developing and developed countries which had paid their 
share, and in particular those such as the Republic of Korea and Germany, which had 
increased their pledges significantly in comparison with previous years. He encouraged all 
other countries to play their part in reaching the current yearÂs target. 
59. The technical co-operation programme had continued to respond successfully to the 
needs and priorities of Member States. However, the Agency was faced with the continuing 
challenge of securing sufficient resources to meet the ever-increasing demand for technical 
co-operation support. In the near term, the Agency would work to strengthen the linkage 
between technical co-operation planning and the governmental priorities of individual 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 15 

Member States by improving the quality of Country Programme Frameworks, and by 
imposing a requirement for strong government support as the prerequisite for programme 
approval. 

60. In preparing the programme and budget for the next biennium (2004-2005), the 
Secretariat had made extensive efforts to consult with Member States; it was currently in the 
process of calculating the human and financial resources required for implementation. For 
15 years, despite steadily growing responsibilities, the AgencyÂs Regular Budget had 
remained frozen, resulting in inadequate levels of funding for many high-priority activities in 
most areas of the AgencyÂs work. In the area of safeguards, the chronic and corrosive degree 
of under-funding meant that the Agency was close to being unable to provide credible 
safeguards. In order to fulfil its many statutory and other legal obligations and high priorities 
in all areas of activity while also continuing to maintain an appropriate balance between 
developmental and other statutory activities, the Agency would require increased resources 
for the coming biennium. 
61. In conclusion, he said that the overview he had just provided reflected both the 
continuing evolution in all areas of the AgencyÂs activities and the dynamic nature of the 
AgencyÂs response to that challenge. Although the Secretariat remained well-prepared and 
focused, it was crucially dependent on partnerships with Member States, especially with 
regard to the provision of funding and, when needed, the required authority. He hoped and 
trusted that both would continue to be forthcoming. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TECHNICAL CO-OPERATION FUND FOR 2003 
(GC(46)/18) 

62. The PRESIDENT said that, following the agreement reached by the Board of 
Governors at its meetings immediately prior to the General Conference, a target figure of 
$74.75 million had been recommended for 2003. The early pledging and payment of 
contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in planning the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programmes, and he therefore urged delegations in a position to do so to notify 
the Secretariat during the General Conference of contributions which their governments 
would be making to the Fund for 2003. He would report at the end of the session, under a 
later agenda item, on the contributions which had been pledged so far. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 
(GC(46)/2) 

63. The PRESIDENT, pointing out that more than 80 delegates had already inscribed 
their names on the speakersÂ list, took it that, in order to avoid too many prolonged afternoon 
meetings or even a night meeting - the total cost of the latter being more than $16 000 - the 
Conference authorized him, under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of 
speeches to 15 minutes. 
64. It was so agreed. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 16 

65. Mr. Young-bok CHAE (Republic of Korea) congratulated the President of the 
General Conference on his election and welcomed Eritrea, the Kyrgyz Republic and the 
Seychelles as new members of the Agency. He also commended the Director General and the 
Secretariat for their dedicated service and the remarkable results they had achieved during the 
past year. 
66. His Government, which had contributed $100 000 to the fund for activities against 
nuclear terrorism, highly appreciated the SecretariatÂs prompt response in formulating a plan 
to provide enhanced protection against nuclear terrorism. Also, Korea attached great 
importance to strengthening the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, 
and hoped that a diplomatic conference to revise the Convention would be convened as soon 
as possible. 
67. He congratulated the Secretariat on its efforts to publicize the role of nuclear energy 
during the World Summit on Sustainable Development held recently in Johannesburg. His 
Government looked forward to the continuation of those efforts, and to the eventual 
acceptance of nuclear energy as one of the most practical options for dealing with the problem 
of carbon dioxide emissions. 
68. Korea believed that the application of radiation technology was essential to enhancing 
the role of atomic energy for sustainable development. It was currently in the process of 
enacting a law on the utilization of radiation and radioisotopes, whose objective was to 
promote R&D in radiation technology, the establishment of related industries and manpower 
development. 
69. The Korean Government would continue to supply cost-free expertise towards 
successful implementation of the AgencyÂs INPRO project, and hoped that the Agency would 
adopt more proactive measures for informing interested Member States on progress. 
70. KoreaÂs 17 operational nuclear power plants supplied over 40% of its total electricity. 
Three more units were under construction and a further eight would be built by 2015. The 
Korean Government had recently issued a standard design certificate for its advanced 
APR-1400 power reactor, which had a 60-year design lifetime, offered enhanced safety 
features and was highly competitive from the economical viewpoint. Korea had also 
completed the basic design for the 330 MW(t) SMART (system-integrated modular advanced) 
reactor, which could be used for both power generation and desalination. His delegation 
highly appreciated the AgencyÂs active implementation of technical co-operation projects in 
compliance with resolution GC(43)/15, ÂPlan for Producing Potable Water EconomicallyÂ. 
The Agency, Indonesia and Korea had together been implementing a technical co-operation 
project on the use of nuclear technology for sea water desalination which, it was hoped, would 
serve as a model for future projects involving other Member States. 
71. Turning to the Nuclear Safety Convention, he said Korea had continued to submit 
regular national reports to the Agency and to participate actively in review meetings. Also, 
the Korean Government had completed the ratification process for the Joint Convention and 
would submit the relevant documents to the Secretariat during the present General 
Conference. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 17 

72. He welcomed the AgencyÂs proposal to establish the Asian Nuclear Safety Network for 
enhancing nuclear safety in the Asian region. His Government would be hosting the second 
consultation meeting in early 2003. 
73. With a national safeguards inspection system in operation since 1997, Korea had 
accomplished 95% of its safeguards inspection goal attainment level since 1999. In 2001, 
Korea had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Agency concerning the 
implementation of enhanced co-operation for light water reactors. His Government believed 
that the experience gained from that New Partnership Approach would make a useful 
contribution to the development of future integrated safeguards. 
74. Korea was deeply concerned about the DPRKÂs continuing failure to co-operate in 
connection with its safeguards agreement with the Agency. He called on the DPRK to 
comply fully and promptly with that agreement, which remained binding and in force. 
Progress on the KEDO project was being made in accordance with the Agreed Framework, 
and the delivery of the key nuclear components was expected in 2005. In view of the 
construction schedule and the AgencyÂs assessment that it would take three to four years to 
complete the verification process, full and prompt co-operation by the DPRK was now a 
matter of urgency. 
75. Korea continued to support strongly the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, 
especially in the field of nuclear education and training for developing countries. In the Asia 
and the Pacific region, the AgencyÂs RCA was expected to make an important contribution 
towards meeting the growing demand for energy. In April 2000, 17 RCA Member States had 
agreed to establish a regional office in Korea, which had opened the following March. As a 
demonstration of the international nuclear university concept, which Korea had first proposed 
during the 44th General Conference, the regional office was planning two major manpower 
development projects: a post-doctoral fellowship programme and the RCA Masters degree 
course. Korea welcomed the recent meeting on management of nuclear knowledge as a 
timely and useful contribution to that cause. 
76. Earlier in the year, Korea had hosted the International Youth Nuclear Congress, which 
had attracted 300 young nuclear scientists and engineers from 37 countries. 
77. In conclusion, he called on those Member States which had not done so to expedite their 
ratification of the amendment to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute and pledged KoreaÂs 
continuing support for global efforts to ensure peaceful and safe use of atomic energy. 
78. Mr. OMI (Japan) said promotion of the peaceful use of nuclear energy was 
important for both meeting the worldÂs need for stable sources of energy and protecting the 
environment, notably by preventing global warming. Japan had adopted a global warming 
prevention programme and had ratified the Kyoto Protocol in June 2002. 
79. As part of its long-term nuclear energy programme Japan was undertaking R&D 
regarding the use of plutonium in fast reactors and LWRs. Although the recent case of 
falsification of self-inspection records at several nuclear power plants in Japan had not 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 18 

jeopardized nuclear safety, there was a need to rebuild public confidence, and the matter was 
now being investigated to ensure that it would never recur. 

80. He was pleased to note that a number of countries were now giving nuclear power a 
greater role in their energy policies, and also that R&D work for innovative reactors had 
gained momentum. In particular, he welcomed the progress made with the ITER project, for 
which Japan had proposed a site at Rokkasho-mura. He hoped that the United States would 
rejoin that project. 
81. Japan, as the only country to have suffered grave damage from atomic bombs, would 
continue to adhere to the three non-nuclear weapon principles of not possessing or producing 
nuclear weapons, or permitting the introduction of such weapons. In order to prevent nuclear 
proliferation, it had observed its Agency safeguards agreement and had promoted the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy. It would continue to comply with its comprehensive safeguards and 
the additional protocol thereto. 
82. He emphasized the importance of the universalization of the additional protocol, which 
improved the AgencyÂs capability to detect both undeclared nuclear materials and concealed 
nuclear-related activities by enlarging the scope of information to be provided and by 
ensuring complementary access. Japan would be hosting an international conference for the 
universalization of the additional protocol in December 2002 in Tokyo. He urged the 
Secretariat to make further efforts to ensure early adoption of integrated safeguards, in order 
not only to rationalize safeguards implementation but also to give Member States an incentive 
to conclude the additional protocol. 
83. Reinforcement of the non-proliferation regime was closely related to regional security. 
Japan was greatly concerned over the AgencyÂs inability to implement its safeguards 
agreement with the DPRK, since that had repercussions on the security of North-East Asia. 
The most effective solution would be the implementation of the Agreed Framework between 
the United States and the DPRK and promotion of the activities of KEDO, which Japan 
supported. His Government urged the DPRK to co-operate without delay by fulfilling its 
obligations under the safeguards agreement with Agency, which was still binding upon it. 
84. Since the tragedy of 11 September 2001, nuclear terrorism posed a new threat to the 
non-proliferation regime, and the international community should unite to deal with it. His 
Government had pledged half a million United States dollars to support the AgencyÂs action 
plan for protection against nuclear terrorism, and believed that strict control of nuclear 
materials and radioactive isotopes was crucial. It strongly supported the AgencyÂs activities 
in that area and called on other Member States to pledge contributions. 
85. The transport of nuclear material played a vital role in promoting the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. With regard to maritime transport, freedom of navigation as recognized under 
international law had to be respected. He hoped that the Agency would continue to play a 
significant role from the scientific and technical standpoint in that regard. Japan would be 
actively participating in the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material to be held in July 2003. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 19 

86. It was still his GovernmentÂs policy to call upon all international organizations to 
respect zero nominal growth in their budgets. He urged the Secretariat to set clear priorities, 
to make further cost reductions in all its activities, and to seek more efficient safeguards 
operations within the limits of available resources. He also strongly encouraged Member 
States to pay their assessed contributions and their share of the TCF in full and without delay. 
87. While Japan continued to advocate the total elimination of nuclear weapons, it believed 
that the peaceful use of nuclear energy would contribute to the welfare of mankind and to the 
stability and development of the world. Since the Agency would play a significant role in 
furthering the achievement of those objectives, Japan was determined to support it. 
88. Mr. ABRAHAM (United States of America) began his statement by reading the 
following message from Mr. George W. Bush, President of the United States of America: 
ÂI send greetings to those gathered for the 46th General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. For more than four decades, the IAEA has helped to make the 
world more secure by working to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
promoting the safe use of nuclear energy. The United States remains steadfast in its 
strong support for these important efforts. 

ÂIn our dynamic world, the IAEA is a pillar of stability, standing on the front line of 
international initiatives to secure nuclear materials and counter the threat of 
international terrorism. The United States appreciates the IAEAÂs valuable 
contributions to the war against terror, as well as its prompt and energetic response to 
last SeptemberÂs terrorist attacks. 

ÂThe threat from nuclear proliferation remains real, immediate, and dangerous. We 
must ensure that the IAEA has the resources it needs to carry out its mission effectively. 
I encourage all member states to adopt and implement the Additional Protocol and the 
safeguards agreements required by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I was pleased 
earlier this year to submit to the United States Senate the U.S. Additional Protocol, and 
my Administration will press for its ratification. 

ÂThe United States also applauds the IAEAÂs global leadership on issues such as the 
safe use of nuclear energy. We will continue to support your work in these areas, and 
many others. For more than four decades, the IAEA has helped to make the world more 
secure by working to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Best wishes for a 
successful conference.Â 

89. Mr. Abraham, recalling his address to the General Conference at its 45th regular session 
just six days after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, noted that all participants had 
been fully aware that, given the opportunity, the ambitions of those very dedicated killers ran 
much higher than the annihilation of several thousand innocent people. After 
11 September 2001, there could be no doubt that if they could acquire nuclear materials 
terrorists would use them to harm the innocent citizens of civilized nations. The events of 
11 September had demonstrated to everyone just how important the Agency was. In the past 
12 months much had been done to work towards securing a world which did not live under 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 20 

the constant threat of nuclear terror. His own country had concentrated on enhancing security 
at its nuclear facilities. He himself had worked very closely with his Russian counterpart, Mr. 
Rumyantsev, on a wide variety of non-proliferation issues, meeting on a regular basis to 
discuss greater co-operation, enhancing the protection of dangerous materials and improving 
safety and security in the peaceful use of atomic energy. They had worked out an agreement 
for expanded and accelerated joint efforts to strengthen the protection of nuclear material. 

90. The new relationship between the Russian Federation and the United States was one of 
the reasons why their joint operation to secure highly enriched uranium at the Vinca reactor in 
Belgrade had been a success. They had also agreed to work together to improve the security 
of radiological sources which might be used to develop a radiological dispersal device - a socalled 
Âdirty bombÂ. Such materials existed in many forms, including medical isotopes, 
radiography sources and sources that provided electric power. While radiological dispersal 
devices were not comparable to nuclear weapons in their destructiveness, they were far easier 
to assemble and employ. The physical destruction they would cause was comparable to that 
caused by conventional explosives, but the disruption caused by widespread contamination 
was far greater, and it was disruption that terrorists sought to create. The United States and 
the Russian Federation were looking at what they could do to preclude the sources presenting 
the greatest threat from becoming useful to terrorists. Accordingly, they had created a joint 
task force which was examining the threat in depth in order to recommend appropriate 
responses. Large quantities of nuclear material had remained unsecured in the former Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics following the end of the Cold War. There could be no question 
but that the effort to secure dangerous materials had to be an international undertaking relying 
on a multitude of partners. Controlling nuclear material had to remain high on the 
international agenda because there were regimes in the world which sought nuclear weapons 
for aggressive purposes and which co-operated with and sponsored terrorists. President Bush 
had laid out the case against one such regime before the General Assembly just a few days 
before. 
91. The establishment of the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and 
Materials of Mass Destruction had indicated the seriousness of purpose in the effort to control 
nuclear material. The Global PartnershipÂs pledge of up to $20 billion towards new and 
expanded co-operation projects to address non-proliferation, disarmament, counter-terrorism 
and nuclear safety issues was an important step and the money would go a long way towards 
preventing terrorists, or those that harboured them, from acquiring or developing nuclear, 
chemical, radiological and biological weapons, missiles, and related materials, equipment and 
technology. That meant addressing the problem at its source: the dismantling and destruction 
of weapons, the disposal of fissile materials and the employment of former weapons 
scientists. It also meant developing and maintaining effective border controls, as well as 
enhanced law enforcement efforts aimed at thwarting the trafficking in illicit nuclear 
materials. It meant further strengthening the international framework for accomplishing such 
objectives by, for example, moving expeditiously to achieve the AgencyÂs goal of 
strengthening the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
92. The AgencyÂs role in ensuring the success of global non-proliferation efforts was 
absolutely critical, and it was particularly true for work on radiological dispersal devices. 
While safeguarding materials usable for weapons should remain the AgencyÂs highest 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 21 

priority, it was also important for all Member States to act as partners in reducing the threat of 
other radioactive nuclear materials which could be used for Âdirty bombsÂ. To that end, he 
called on all States to join his country in working with the Agency to address the threat posed 
by the potential misuse of radiological materials. He was therefore proposing an international 
conference to discuss how the international community could build on the Trilateral Initiative 
launched by the United States, the Russian Federation and the Agency, and to extend those 
efforts globally. The Agency had the technical expertise to help States respond appropriately 
to the problem by developing national standards for accounting for and tracking radiological 
materials, by identifying resources needed to dispose safely of unneeded radiological 
materials, by serving as a clearing house for critical information and by making invaluable 
experience available to Member States. Putting off addressing such threats was not an option; 
the detailed instructions on how to make Âdirty bombsÂ found in the Al Qaeda caves had 
made horrifyingly clear how necessary it was to have a firm plan to reduce the likelihood of 
the most dangerous materials being acquired by those seeking to use them as weapons of 
terror. 

93. The events of 11 September 2001 should not lead to any reduction in efforts to employ 
nuclear power for peaceful purposes on a broad international basis. It was indisputable that 
all Member States should re-examine security at their nuclear reactors. The simple truth was 
that nuclear power had to be kept as a key part of the energy mix. Nuclear energy now 
accounted for 20% of United States electricity generation, and not much less than that 
worldwide. There were arguments for nuclear power today reflecting policy imperatives that 
were either unknown or not well understood at the dawn of the atomic age. The first 
imperative reflected the commitment to a clean environment; nuclear power plants emitted 
none of the pollutants associated with the burning of fossil fuels. The second was to supply 
energy that was both abundant and affordable; the United States had identified hydrogen as a 
potentially unlimited source of clean energy, and one of the challenges for future decades 
would be to produce hydrogen cleanly and efficiently. Nuclear energy promised to do exactly 
that. Finally, there was the policy debate surrounding the issue of climate change; an energy 
source capable of supplying a significant proportion of the worldÂs power with no greenhouse 
gas emissions should clearly be at the centre of that debate. In advocating a greater role for 
civilian nuclear power, a number of issues had to be addressed: increased safety of nuclear 
reactors; how to deal with radioactive nuclear waste; and the development of proliferationresistant 
technology. It was very encouraging that the international community was on its 
way towards finding solutions to all those issues. 
94. It would not be possible to address all the problems he had outlined without spending 
more money. The Agency needed more resources in order to expand in the areas which the 
events of 11 September 2001 had forced the international community to address. The 
AgencyÂs safeguards budget needed to be increased so that it could fulfil its obligations 
pursuant to the NPT. Also, the Agency needed more resources to expand its efforts to help 
protect against the threat of nuclear terrorism. The United States of America today pledged 
an additional $3 million for Agency nuclear security initiatives. Every Member State would 
need to increase its annual contributions in the years ahead if the Agency was effectively to 
address the threats posed by dangerous nuclear materials falling into the wrong hands. The 
security the international community hoped to achieve through the Agency was not a luxury 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 22 

but a necessity. The nations of the civilized world faced a common threat, and it would be a 
mark of that civilized world if it could mount the united front necessary to vanquish it. 

95. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that since the Second World 
War and the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, atomic energy and nuclear technology had 
been used both in the field of human development and in regional and global wrangles. 
Nuclear competition with the aim of unilateral domination of the world had achieved nothing 
but the ominous Cold War. Despite the apparent disappearance of traces of the Cold War, the 
sense of authoritarianism and unilateralism continued to prevail. 
96. The Agency had been established in order to facilitate the transfer of peaceful uses of 
nuclear technology to developing Member States. The Agency had pursued faithfully its 
mandate in that regard, but it was important that it continued upholding the principle of 
balance between its promotional and verification activities. 
97. The establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones helped strengthen the NPT, and it was 
encouraging to see that several such zones had been created. In 1974, Iran had called for such 
a zone to be established in the Middle East. Israel, however, had refused to co-operate and 
had consistently shrugged off the international call for safety and peace by turning its back on 
world public opinion and refusing to allow the Agency to inspect its nuclear installations. 
IsraelÂs arrogant attitude could lead to unexpected consequences for the region. Adherence to 
the NPT by all Member States in the region was an essential preliminary step towards the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
98. As the world community was more than ever in need of mutual understanding and 
confidence building, it was discouraging to witness an attempt by certain quarters to unravel 
important aspects of such international treaties as the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, 
the Biological Weapons Convention and the Convention on the Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. 
That would send the wrong message worldwide and threatened to set an unwanted precedent 
for shaking the foundations of other important non-proliferation treaties. 
99. Iran was embarking on a long-term plan to construct nuclear power plants with a total 
capacity of 6000 MW(e), and the associated fuel cycle, safety and waste management 
technologies, within two decades. Such a sizeable project entailed thorough preparation and 
he invited all the technologically advanced Member States to participate in IranÂs plan. He 
expressed his GovernmentÂs satisfaction with the AgencyÂs assistance in construction of the 
Bushehr nuclear power plant. 
100. The Islamic Republic of Iran had always condemned the possession of weapons of mass 
destruction. It had always maintained strong ties with the Agency and had submitted all its 
nuclear activities to the AgencyÂs supervision. Thus, his Government was seriously 
committed to ensuring complete transparency in IranÂs nuclear activities. 
101. Ms. SHABANGU (South Africa), having commended the Agency for its sterling 
work to accelerate and enlarge the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, said that two important 
gatherings - the inaugural Summit of the African Union and the World Summit on Sustainable 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 23 

Development - had been held in South Africa recently. A firm resolve to take up the 
multifaceted challenges confronting Africa had been demonstrated throughout the 
deliberations of both. 

102. The AgencyÂs General Conference had a unique role to play in the quest for socioeconomic 
development through the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, which should be 
publicized with more zeal. Communication with regard to nuclear technology applications 
within the sector and, more importantly, with the public remained a great challenge for 
everyone. Her Government had undertaken several activities to help address that challenge. 
Firstly, it had hosted a meeting of the Network of Regulators of Countries with Small Nuclear 
Programmes in October 2001, demonstrating her GovernmentÂs determination to enhance 
international co-operation in establishing international nuclear regulatory authority 
co-operative groups. Secondly, in November 2001, South Africa and the Agency had 
co-hosted a Regional Public Seminar in Cape Town, which had succeeded in demonstrating 
that nuclear technologies had health, water and other applications in addition to electricity 
generation. One of the lessons learnt during that seminar was the need for simplicity and the 
use of neutral facilitators to ensure a lack of perceived bias. She thanked the Secretariat for 
sending a high-level delegation to the event, as well as for help in demystification of the 
technology. Thirdly, South Africa and the Agency had co-hosted a seminar in Benoni in 
June 2002 to encourage African States which had not yet done so to conclude safeguards 
agreements and sign additional protocols with the Agency. The possible benefits such 
seminars stood to gain from the involvement of other relevant organizations in the United 
Nations system should be explored. Also, her Government had launched a ÂWomen in 
NuclearÂ programme for South Africa, believing that the quest for socio-economic 
development pursued by the Agency could not and should not be separated from the struggle 
for the emancipation of women. The burden on women in the developing world was 
compounded by poverty, malnutrition and lack of access to fresh water, problems which the 
Agency was seeking to address through innovative nuclear technology applications. 
103. South Africa supported the AgencyÂs initiatives to strengthen international co-operation 
in nuclear, transport and waste safety and would continue to participate actively in the 
AgencyÂs safety standards programme. It welcomed the SecretariatÂs initiative to broaden 
representation in the safety standards committees. That would provide an ideal opportunity to 
consider mechanisms to enhance and evaluate the use of Agency safety standards 
documentation, particularly by Member States currently developing their nuclear and 
radiation safety infrastructure. 
104. With regard to nuclear installation safety, her Government strongly supported the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and, as a Contracting Party, had submitted its second national 
report to the second review meeting in April 2002. As a follow-up to that meeting, South 
Africa was undertaking a detailed review of the meetingÂs summary report in order to identify 
any shortcomings in the South African context and to implement improvements where 
necessary. South Africa also supported the AgencyÂs initiatives for the development of an 
international safety enhancement programme for research reactors and other nuclear 
installations. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 24 

105. In the area of radiation safety, the Agency was on the right track. However, exposures 
from naturally occurring radioactive material could benefit from increased attention, 
particularly since slime dumps and waste rock piles continued to present a long-term radiation 
hazard in South Africa. She urged the Agency to develop a programme to address that matter. 
106. With regard to radioactive waste, South Africa supported the initiative to develop a 
common framework for decisions on the safe disposal of different types of radioactive waste. 
Her delegation appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the project to evaluate boreholes as a 
possible option for disused sealed sources. It was hoped that the project, in which her country 
was actively participating, would help to prevent accidents involving such sources, 
particularly in developing countries. 
107. The transport of radioactive material was another important issue intrinsically linked to 
the entire safety culture. Although no catastrophic accident had yet occurred, more work 
needed to be done to minimize the inherent dangers. South Africa was prepared to participate 
extensively in discussions on the safe transport of radioactive materials. Furthermore, it had 
adopted the AgencyÂs revised Transport Regulations (Safety Standards Series No. TS-R-1 
(ST-1, Rev.) 
108. Thanks to Agency help in obtaining a drum scanner on loan from the United States of 
America, South Africa was now in a position to characterize nuclear material in waste drums. 
The scanner would be used to measure several thousand 100 litre drums in a South African 
storage facility. As a result, the outstanding non-attainment of the inspection goal could be 
fully resolved in a shorter time-span. 
109. Work had continued on the licensing activities for the pebble bed modular reactor 
which, it was hoped, would make a meaningful contribution to the search for other forms of 
energy. A comprehensive and systematic approach to the licensing process was being 
followed which, inter alia, made provision for public participation. The conclusion of the 
environmental impact assessment, expected towards the end of 2002, would determine the 
future of the project. 
110. South African experts were continuing to carry out missions at the request of Member 
States to solve urgent needs in such areas as the conditioning and storage of spent sources, 
dam leakage detection, and evaluation of nuclear programmes and to offer advice on ways to 
increase self-reliance, including more financial independence. South Africa was proud of that 
modest contribution to socio-economic development. 
111. South Africa continued to attach great importance to technical co-operation and 
particularly welcomed the various projects undertaken by the Agency in the African region. 
Such assistance was also important within the context of NEPAD. 
112. It was important to find innovative ways of accommodating the interests of developing 
countries. Efforts should be concentrated on the application of nuclear techniques in 
combating such infectious diseases as tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS, which continued 
to hamper economic prosperity in many parts of the world. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 25 

113. She underlined the importance of continual evaluation of the effectiveness of projects, 
with a view to identifying new and productive areas for technical co-operation. Clearly, for 
developing countries to continue to benefit as much as possible from technical co-operation, 
the financial means must be available, and South Africa appealed to Member States to support 
technical co-operation activities vigorously and generously. For its part, South Africa again 
intended to pledge its full amount of the share of the TCF target. 
114. In conclusion, she said that South Africa had just passed another important milestone in 
signing the additional protocol. 
115. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark), speaking on behalf on the European Union and 
its associated States - Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Turkey - said the tragic 
events of 11 September 2001 had demonstrated the willingness of terrorist groups to use 
whatever means they had at their disposal to further their aims. The need to strengthen 
measures to improve nuclear security had therefore acquired a new urgency. The fight against 
terrorism had become a priority for the European Union and it had adopted a wide range of 
pertinent measures in April 2002. Those measures would also support the work of the 
Agency in fulfilling its mandate in the fight against terrorism. The Agency clearly had an 
essential role to play in that regard. He commended the Director General and the Secretariat 
for having responded quickly to that challenge by reinforcing and re-orientating ongoing 
activities, as well as by presenting short-, medium- and long-term strategies for activities at 
the national and international level to help Member States secure a stringent nuclear security 
framework for nuclear installations and materials. Since the primary responsibility for 
nuclear security rested with Member States, the AgencyÂs activities could serve only to 
support national measures to counter nuclear terrorism. Technical co-operation programmes 
were already proving to be a valuable instrument in upgrading safety and security. 
116. The European Union called on Member States to introduce or strengthen and to enforce 
measures to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material, and welcomed 
the AgencyÂs work in support of such efforts. 
117. It deplored the lack of progress being made regarding the amendment to the Convention 
on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
118. He underlined that, although extrabudgetary funding was an acceptable temporary 
solution for funding the new activities being imposed on the Agency, long-term activities, 
approved by the Board, should be financed in a mandatory and predictable fashion. 
119. An international nuclear non-proliferation regime of a universal character, backed by a 
strong international safeguards system requiring States to properly account for and control 
nuclear materials, was absolutely essential for international efforts to maintain collective 
security. Promoting the universality of the non-proliferation regime and adhering to the 
applicable international instruments was the responsibility of Member States. 
120. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was the essential instrument of the global 
non-proliferation regime. At the first session of the Preparatory Committee of the 2005 NPT 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 26 

Review Conference in April 2002, the AgencyÂs responsibility for further strengthening the 
regime had been strongly underlined. Noting the concerns expressed in that regard by the 
Director General, the European Union recognized the need for a properly funded safeguards 
system that was both effective and cost-efficient and it was prepared to consider growth in the 
safeguards budget whenever such requirements could be demonstrated. 

121. Commending the Director General and the Secretariat on finalization of the conceptual 
framework for integrated safeguards in 2002, he expressed the European UnionÂs view that 
the conceptual framework should be further developed on the basis of evaluations, technical 
developments, implementation experience and continuing dialogue with the Member States. 
In implementing the new measures it was important that greater attention be paid to the 
qualitative aspects of providing assurance of non-diversion notwithstanding the key role of 
nuclear material accounting. 
122. The European Union, whilst considering that the initially agreed Âcost neutralityÂ set 
out in documents GOV/INF/2000/4 and GOV/INF/2000/26 remained valid, realized there 
might be a temporary increase in the total cost of safeguards during a transition period before 
general implementation of integrated safeguards had taken place. 
123. All the European Union Member States had unequivocally engaged in the process of 
ratifying their respective additional protocols and most had reached completion. Furthermore, 
the European Union had committed itself to having all its protocols enter into force 
simultaneously. The European Union considered additional protocols to be an integral part 
the AgencyÂs safeguards system and that adherence to them was an essential means of 
demonstrating fulfilment of the obligations laid down in Article III of the NPT. He urged all 
States which had not signed and ratified the additional protocol to do so. The European 
Union shared the Director GeneralÂs concern that some 50 States party to the NPT had not yet 
entered into comprehensive safeguards agreements and called on them to do so. Also, 
expressing concern regarding the continued existence of un-safeguarded nuclear facilities and 
material in States not party to the NPT or equivalent treaties, he called on those States to place 
all their nuclear activities under Agency safeguards. 
124. The situation in Iraq remained a major concern. The European Union regretted that 
recent talks with the Government of Iraq had not led to the resumption of Agency inspections 
under the relevant Security Council resolutions. On its return to Iraq, the Agency would have 
to resolve the key issue of whether IraqÂs nuclear activities and capabilities had changed since 
December 1998. The European Union strongly urged Iraq once again to implement in full all 
the relevant Security Council resolutions, to co-operate fully and without any preconditions 
with the Agency and to provide immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to enable 
the Agency to carry out its mandate. 
125. The European Union also remained seriously concerned by the DPRKÂs continuing 
failure to implement fully its safeguards agreement with the Agency, which remained in force 
and binding, as well as by the lack of tangible progress made on important verification issues 
over the preceding year. Mindful of the fact that it would take some three to four years for the 
Agency to complete the verification process, assuming full co-operation by the DPRK, the 
European Union urged the DPRK to work with the Agency without further delay. He 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 27 

commended the impartial efforts made by the Director General and his staff to bring the 
DPRK into full compliance with its safeguards agreement. 

126. A high level of nuclear safety worldwide was paramount and European Union Member 
States and the associated countries co-operated closely to that end. The second review 
meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had concluded that 
significant progress had been achieved in a number of key nuclear safety areas. At the same 
time, however, human and organizational aspects and safety management had been identified 
as issues requiring further attention. 
127. The majority of European Union Member States had already ratified the Joint 
Convention, which had entered into force in June 2001. The European Union as such had 
also started the relevant procedures to join the Convention. It looked forward to the first peer 
review of the national reports by Contracting Parties that would take place in November 2003 
and urged Agency Member States to become parties to the Convention. 
128. Endorsing the ongoing activities of the Agency and its Member States to improve the 
safety and security of radioactive sources and the revised Action Plan for the Safety and 
Security of Radiation Sources as reflected in GC(46)/11, he commended the Secretariat for 
helping Member States develop appropriate national strategies. He reaffirmed the European 
UnionÂs readiness to co-operate, when and as appropriate, to detect and locate orphan sources 
and to facilitate their subsequent management. 
129. The European Union wished to see a programme and budget for the 2004-2005 
biennium that reflected the real needs of Member States and which clearly fell within the 
statutory activities of the Agency. It intended to participate actively in further consultations. 
Experience showed that there was a need to continue to refine and extend the performance 
indicators. Those indicators and the identification of desired outcomes should help 
concentrate the activities of the Agency on clear priorities and enhance effectiveness and 
efficiency. 
130. Every effort should be made to ensure the Agency had the financial resources to meet 
its statutory obligations under the Regular Budget despite mounting difficulties. The 
European Union urged all Member States to pay in full and on time their assessed 
contribution to the Regular Budget as well as outstanding contributions from previous years 
amounting to approximately $18 million. 
131. The European Union supported the Director GeneralÂs continued efforts to improve the 
AgencyÂs effectiveness. A results-based approach to budgeting required strong management 
and a clear definition of cross-cutting activities. Enhanced co-operation and co-ordination 
between departments should be encouraged, leading to greater synergy and better use of 
resources - human as well as financial. The Director GeneralÂs decision to engage an outside 
management consultant in that regard was welcome. 
132. Recruitment and management of the AgencyÂs human resources were important issues. 
He expressed concern about emerging difficulties in the process of staff recruitment at the 
higher levels and stressed the need for increased transparency in that regard. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 28 

133. As announced at the meeting of the Board of Governors in March 2002, the European 
Union proposed to introduce a single euro-based currency system with respect to the Agency 
taking effect from the 2004-2005 biennium. That would improve transparency, effectiveness 
and efficiency in the AgencyÂs management of its financial resources. The European Union 
looked forward to the SecretariatÂs comprehensive report on the matter expected later in 2002 
with a view to agreement on a proposal during the first half of 2003. 
134. The European Union was following closely the development of projects relating to 
innovative reactors and fuel cycles which could lead to the development of new approaches 
on the essential questions of safety, non-proliferation and minimization of nuclear waste. 
135. Ensuring the continuity of nuclear knowledge was a matter of increasing urgency and it 
was timely that managing nuclear knowledge was the topic of the Scientific Forum. He 
expressed the hope that the debate would provide new impetus to considerations at the 
national and international level. Over the coming few years a considerable number of the 
AgencyÂs staff would reach retirement age and the European Union asked the Director 
General to keep Member States informed of the measures envisaged to maintain the 
knowledge necessary for the Agency to carry out its obligations. 
136. The great importance attached by the European Union to technical co-operation was 
well demonstrated by its very high level of voluntary contributions, amounting to 
approximately 35% of the total contributions in 2002. Those important activities needed 
adequate financing and the European Union would contribute constructively to the Board of 
GovernorsÂ review of the funding mechanism for technical co-operation in 2003. Technical 
co-operation funds should be used in the most cost-effective, efficient and transparent way 
possible and it was important that the Secretariat provided a detailed breakdown of the 
Regular Budget expenditure on technical co-operation in all its departments and programmes. 
He expressed concern at the some $7 million owed in outstanding assessed programme costs 
as at June 2002, representing nearly 10% of the target figure for 2002 for the TCF. That debt 
posed a serious impediment to implementation of the technical co-operation programme. The 
European Union strongly supported the revised strategy paper on technical co-operation 
which emphasized a demand-driven approach and clear priority-setting, and welcomed the 
approach the Secretariat had taken in recent years in devoting considerable efforts to 
supporting countries in selecting and prioritizing their projects. That had led to fewer and 
more focused projects which better reflected the needs and priorities of Member States. Also 
technical assistance could serve as a catalyst for national efforts to ensure the safety and 
security of nuclear material and other radioactive sources. 
137. Monitoring and evaluation of ongoing programmes should have high priority as they 
provided valuable input into the continuous process of programme formulation and execution. 
138. The European Union acknowledged the important contribution being made by the 
Agency to the larger efforts of the United Nations to reach the goals for sustainable 
development set out in the Millennium Declaration. It urged the Director General to continue 
his efforts to expand partnership with governments, United Nations agencies, multilateral 
financial institutions and other intergovernmental bodies to ensure optimization of scarce 
resources throughout the United Nations system. 

GC(46)/OR.1 
page 29 

139. In conclusion, he said that the European Union and the States that had associated 
themselves with his statement fully supported the Agency as the competent authority for 
verification of compliance with the international nuclear non-proliferation regime as well as 
its role in promoting the safe usage of nuclear technologies for peaceful applications in those 
Member States which had chosen to use that technology. 
RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 

140. The PRESIDENT noted that communications had been received from Iraq, Mali 
and Georgia, which were among those Member States to which Article XIX.A of the Statute 
applied, requesting that their voting rights be restored. He proposed that, following past 
practice, those and other such requests be referred to the General Committee for initial 
consideration and report. 
141. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba) said that, although Cuba was not yet a party to 
the NPT, the strictly peaceful nature of CubaÂs nuclear programme was well known. 
2. His Government continued to believe that the present non-proliferation system was 
inadequate and discriminatory, since it permitted the existence of a ÂclubÂ of nuclear Powers 
which had not entered into any specific disarmament commitments. 
3. However, his Government had decided that Cuba should become a party to the NPT. 
The announcement to that effect made by CubaÂs Minister of Foreign Affairs on 
14 September had also underlined his countryÂs hope that all nuclear weapons would 
ultimately be eliminated under conditions of strict international verification. 
4. His Government was continuing to strive for a safeguards system based on an equitable, 
universal non-proliferation regime which would lead to the immediate, total and 
unconditional elimination of nuclear weapons. 
5. Cuba had also announced its decision to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty, despite the 
aggressive and hostile policies systematically and increasingly directed against it by the 
United States of America, the only nuclear Power in the region. 
6. While considering that there should be an appropriate balance between the three pillars 
of the Agency - technical co-operation, safety and verification - Cuba attached particular 
importance to the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. and it greatly appreciated the 
SecretariatÂs efforts to strengthen those activities. 
7. His country welcomed the fact that the Board of Governors had, after a lengthy 
ÂfreezeÂ, recommended an increase in the TCF target, and it hoped that the target would 
continue to rise, in line with recipient countriesÂ real and growing needs. 
8. Over the years there had been extensive technical co-operation between Cuba and the 
Agency, and his country had made optimum use of the resources provided for high-priority 
national programmes with a major impact. 
9. His Government had demonstrated its support for ARCAL by recently ratifying the 
ARCAL Agreement and agreeing to host the fourth meeting of the ARCAL Technical 
Co-ordination Organ in Havana in May 2003. 
10. Cuba, whose anti-terrorism and anti-war position was well known, recognized the role 
which the Agency could and should play, within the framework of its Statute, in combating 
nuclear terrorism. At the same time, it believed that the Agency activities directed against 
nuclear terrorism should not be allowed to draw human or financial resources away from 
activities in support of sustainable socio-economic development. 
11. Cuba, which welcomed the creation of an extrabudgetary fund for the receipt of 
voluntary contributions in support of the Agency activities directed against nuclear terrorism, 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 6 

nevertheless believed that steps should be taken to ensure that the resources voluntarily 
contributed for technical co-operation purposes did not ÂemigrateÂ to the new high-priority 
field of activity. 

12. His Government recognized the role of nuclear technologies in sustainable development 
and would therefore continue attaching particular importance to the Agency. 
13. Mr. RUMYANTSEV (Russian Federation) said that the tragic events of 
11 September 2001 had united all right-minded States in the fight against international 
terrorism. They had triggered a combining of multilateral efforts in the creation of a global 
system to deal with new threats, including threats in the nuclear sphere. 
14. The Agency activities directed against nuclear terrorism were of great importance, 
especially following the decisions taken by the leaders of the G-8 at the Kananaskis Summit. 
Strengthening of the regime for the physical protection of nuclear materials, improvements in 
the AgencyÂs system for nuclear material accounting and control, increases in the 
effectiveness of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the introduction of proliferation-resistant 
nuclear technologies would make it impossible for terrorists and their helpers to gain access to 
dangerous materials. 
15. In the new international setting, the NPT was acquiring particular importance as a major 
element of stability and security at the global and the regional level, and his delegation was 
sure that the preparations just starting for the 2005 NPT Review Conference would help to 
strengthen the NPT regime. 
16. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty signed in May by President Bush and 
President Putin would greatly contribute to the strengthening of strategic stability. The 
significance of the Treaty and of the Joint Declaration on a new strategic relationship between 
the United States of America and the Russian Federation went beyond the framework of 
bilateral relations. 
17. Fulfilment by the two States of the commitments which they had entered into would 
substantially further the cause of nuclear disarmament and help to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. He and the United States Secretary of Energy were working hard to 
ensure that those commitments were fulfilled. 
18. The disposition of excess nuclear weapons material and the reduction of the nuclear 
weapons complex in Russia were important aspects of nuclear disarmament. 
19. Implementation of the 18 February 1993 agreement between the Russian Government 
and the United States Government on the utilization of HEU extracted from nuclear weapons 
was continuing. The problems involved in modifying the current contract so as to facilitate its 
implementation had been resolved. 
20. From the results to date of the consultations being conducted within the framework of 
the Trilateral Initiative it was clear that the technical, legal and financial aspects of Agency 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 7 

verification of excess fissile material had been examined sufficiently. His country looked 
forward to a continuation of the trilateral consultations. 

21. His delegation, which believed that promoting nuclear power development was still a 
primary task of the Agency, was pleased with the results of the adoption - in 2000 - of 
resolution GC(44)/RES/21 on ÂStrengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear 
science, technology and applicationsÂ, especially the launching of INPRO. Implementation of 
INPRO was a practical way of pursuing, under the AgencyÂs auspices, the initiative, 
announced by President Putin at the United Nations Millennium Summit, relating to energy 
for sustainable development and to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The results of 
INPROÂs first phase, which was now nearing completion, would undoubtedly have a positive 
impact on nuclear power development worldwide. His delegation believed that both INPRO 
and the Generation IV International Forum would benefit from close co-ordination between 
the two. 
22. Having emphasized the importance for nuclear safety of national nuclear regulatory 
authorities and having commended the efforts of Mr. Vishnevsky, the Head of RussiaÂs 
Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Authority, he said that, on the whole, the existing legal 
basis was sufficient for ensuring nuclear safety at atomic power stations and nuclear fuel 
cycle facilities. However, further efforts were needed in order to achieve universality of the 
legal basis. The entry into force of the Joint Convention had been very important in that 
regard. 
23. Carelessness in the management or handling of radioactive sources had on a number of 
occasions had sad consequences, and there were also concerns about the possibility of such 
sources being employed in malicious acts. In Russia, a campaign was being launched, with 
the co-operation of the United States, to prevent the unauthorized use of radioactive sources 
(including their use for terrorist purposes). 
24. His delegation was pleased that a start had been made with the practical implementation 
of understandings reached by Russia and the United States, with active Agency participation, 
regarding the return to Russia of research reactor fuel of Soviet origin. Recently, fuel from a 
research reactor in Yugoslavia had been returned to Russia for safe storage and subsequent 
reprocessing. The operation, greatly assisted by the Yugoslav authorities, had constituted a 
useful precedent. 
25. Work was under way in Russia on new systems for reprocessing spent fuel from 
Russian and foreign nuclear power plants, the aim being to permit safe final disposal of the 
radioactive waste from the reprocessing operation after volume minimization. Important for 
that work was international co-operation, and an international conference on Russian 
initiatives in the field of spent fuel management held in Moscow the previous week -and 
attended by over 200 Russian and foreign scientists, politicians and nuclear industry 
representatives - had pointed the way to how international co-operation relating to spent fuel 
management could be expanded. 
26. His delegation, which welcomed the fact that the issue of the preservation of knowledge 
relating to nuclear technology was now being addressed within the Agency framework, hoped 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 8 

that the Scientific Forum, which would be discussing that issue during the current week, 
would make useful recommendations. 

27. His country, which attached great importance to the efforts being made to increase the 
efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and introduce integrated safeguards, would like 
to see Agency safeguards activities optimized, with the conclusion of further additional 
protocols and with due account taken of the AgencyÂs financial resources. In that connection, 
it was pleased that the development of a conceptual framework for integrated safeguards and 
of safeguards approaches for a number of nuclear facility types had been completed. The 
Russian Federation would continue to help strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards system 
through its safeguards support programme. 
28. Together with the Agency, the Russian Federation, which was co-operating closely with 
the Office of Physical Protection and Material Security in the Department of Safeguards, had 
introduced at Obninsk practical courses for training specialists from CIS countries in the 
operation of physical protection systems. A seminar on the formulation of design-basis 
threats and adversary models for nuclear facilities in Russia and one on safety culture at 
nuclear power plants - with participants from Ukraine, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Lithuania had 
been held earlier in 2002, and a number of similar events were planned for 2003. 
29. The Russian Federation, which was supporting the SecretariatÂs efforts to improve the 
quality of technical co-operation projects and to ensure that they achieved an appreciable 
socio-economic impact in recipient Member States, would soon be paying its TCF 
contribution for 2002 and intended to continue contributing regularly to the TCF. 
30. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China) said that the Agency's achievements over the 
preceding year had been commendable. In the nuclear power field, the Agency had continued 
to promote R&D work on innovative nuclear reactors and fuel cycles. In the area of nuclear 
safety, it had worked on establishing and refining safety criteria for all kinds of nuclear 
activities, strengthening international co-operation on the safety of radiation sources and 
radioactive material and providing all kinds of related services, thereby helping to raise 
nuclear safety levels throughout the world. 
31. With regard to nuclear technology applications and technical co-operation, the Agency 
had helped establish strategic partnerships, advancing the application of nuclear techniques in 
agriculture, water resources management, medicine and environmental protection, and 
bringing notable social and economic benefits to Member States. The Nuclear Technology 
Review provided helpful information for governments and the public on that subject. 
32. In the safeguards field, the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards had been put 
in place and implementation had begun in a step-by-step manner. 
33. In response to the appalling terrorist attacks against the United States on 
11 September 2001, the Director General had convened experts from Member States to 
explore ways of combating nuclear terrorism, and the Board of Governors had reviewed and 
approved plans which were now being implemented. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 9 

34. During the forty-fifth regular session of the General Conference, his country had 
stressed the importance of nuclear power for sustainable development and the statutory role of 
the Agency in that regard. Over 40 yearsÂ experience had provided sufficient evidence that 
nuclear power was clean, safe and economical. Nuclear power accounted for about one sixth 
of the electricity generated in the world, and it had made a great contribution to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries, including China, had been in favour of including 
nuclear power in the CDM. Also, the new energy programmes of some countries which were 
major energy consumers envisaged the use of clean energy forms including nuclear power. 
The Agency, as the most authoritative intergovernmental organization in the nuclear field, 
should continue to be responsible for promoting nuclear power and nuclear technology and 
for co-ordinating the development of a new generation of nuclear power technology. 
35. Promotion of the utilization of nuclear techniques was one of the most important 
responsibilities of the Agency and was of crucial importance to developing Member States in 
their efforts to address problems relating to agriculture, the environment, water resources 
management and medical care. That being so, adequate and reliable funding should be 
provided for the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. Following lengthy consultations, 
consensus had at last been reached on the TCF targets for the coming two years. China 
would, as ever, support and participate in the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, pay 
its TCF contribution in full and on time, and try to make an extra contribution. 
36. As the largest developing country in the world, China was playing a positive role in 
global efforts to tackle climate change. At the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in 
Johannesburg, the Chinese Prime Minister had announced that China had ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol, thus demonstrating its active participation in international co-operation in 
environmental protection and the promotion of global sustainable development. 
37. Two nuclear power units had been put into commercial operation in China during the 
current year, and another six units under construction would be put into operation over the 
coming 2-3 years. At the same time, his country attached great importance to developing and 
using advanced technologies that helped increase the utilization rate of traditional fossil fuels. 
38. Although the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rested with individual 
governments, international co-operation in that field was vital. The Agency should continue 
to play a central role in promoting international co-operation in nuclear safety. After years of 
effort, a series of international legal instruments on nuclear safety had been concluded and 
had entered into force. The standards which the Agency had developed with the support of 
Member States had played an important role in raising nuclear safety levels. The Agency was 
devoting a great deal of effort to helping Member States to strengthen their nuclear safety 
infrastructures, improve the related laws and regulations and remedy safety weaknesses of 
research reactors. China was supporting the Agency's efforts to set up an Asian nuclear safety 
network centre for promoting regional nuclear safety co-operation. It hoped that the centre 
would strengthen nuclear safety technology exchange and nuclear safety training and provide 
practical help to developing countries. 
39. The Agency had a proven record of effectiveness in the verification field, and China 
was supporting its efforts in that field. The protocol additional to ChinaÂs safeguards 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 10 

agreement had entered into force on 28 March 2002, and his country would like to see other 
Member States - especially nuclear-weapon States - that had not yet done so taking the 
necessary steps to bring their additional protocols into force at an early date. 

40. Preventing terrorists from attacking nuclear facilities, or from making and using Âdirty 
bombsÂ, had become a high priority. His country was opposed to terrorism in any form and 
believed that all countries bore an unshirkable responsibility to prevent nuclear terrorism. It 
welcomed the Agency efforts aimed at preventing nuclear terrorism and was prepared to 
provide expert services and other in-kind assistance in support of those efforts. The Chinese 
Government, together with the Agency and a number of Member States, was planning a 
training course on the physical protection of nuclear material and nuclear facilities to be held 
in China later in the year. Also, Chinese technical and legal experts had been participating 
actively in the efforts to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
41. China believed that, through the joint efforts of Member States and the Secretariat, the 
Agency would continue promoting the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and preventing 
nuclear proliferation. 
42. Mr. EYUBOV (Azerbaijan) said that his country, which was actively involved in 
the international communityÂs efforts to strengthen the international nuclear safety regime, 
was also taking steps to improve its own nuclear safety arrangements. 
43. Azerbaijan, a country located in a highly sensitive region, was particularly concerned 
that nuclear energy should be used for exclusively peaceful purposes. It had accordingly 
become a party to the NPT and the CTBT - and also to the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
44. Azerbaijan, which had denounced all forms of terrorism on many occasions, had made a 
practical contribution to the fight against terrorism during the international communityÂs 
counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan. 
45. In 1997, the President of Azerbaijan had proposed the establishment of a nuclearweapon-
free zone in the South Caucasus. Unfortunately, it was proving impossible to follow 
up on that proposal owing to the destructive policy of Armenia, which had committed armed 
aggression against Azerbaijan and occupied 20% of its territory. The Government of 
Azerbaijan was unable to monitor that section of the countryÂs border which lay within the 
occupied zone, and that significantly increased the likelihood of illegal transborder 
movements of nuclear material. Steps had been taken to train and equip AzerbaijanÂs border 
guards, customs officers and quarantine service officials so that they might detect and 
intercept such movements, but those steps would not be fully effective as long as a part of the 
territory and a section of the border of Azerbaijan remained under foreign military 
occupation. The problem was particularly serious given the close ties between the Armeniasponsored 
separatist regime established within the occupied part of Azerbaijan and various 
international terrorist organizations. 
46. To date, Armenian terrorist groups had carried out 32 attacks against AzerbaijanÂs 
civilian population, killing over 2000 persons and injuring tens of thousands. The attacks had 
taken place in the metro and on buses, trains and boats. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 11 

47. In the light of the continuing military conflict with Armenia, his country was very 
concerned about the resumption of operations at ArmeniaÂs Metsamor nuclear power plant, 
located in a seismic area close to the border with Azerbaijan. It hoped in particular that a 
close watch would be kept on the movement of radioactive waste from the plant since, 
according to some reports, the waste was being transferred to the occupied part of Azerbaijan 
for burial. 
48. In May, Azerbaijan had received a visit from the Director General, with whom 
President Aliev had discussed a number of important issues which, Azerbaijan hoped, could 
be resolved with the AgencyÂs help. In order to further the interaction between the Agency 
and Azerbaijan, a ÂState Commission on Cooperation with the IAEAÂ had been established 
by presidential decree with him (Mr. Eyubov) as Chairman. 
49. Currently, the main priorities as regards co-operation with the Agency were improving 
radiation protection in Azerbaijan and strengthening the countryÂs system for ensuring the 
safety of radiation sources used in industry and medicine. Also, his delegation hoped that the 
proposals submitted to the Agency by his country for projects relating to -inter alia - radiation 
oncology and the prevention of illegal movements of radioactive materials would receive 
favourable consideration. 
50. His delegation also hoped that, through the Agency, Azerbaijan would be able to obtain 
assistance with monitoring for the detection of radioactive waste and for the determination of 
levels of contamination in the soil, in the rivers Araks and Kura and in the environment 
generally and with the management of radioactive waste. 
51. Although many Azerbaijani specialists had been receiving training through the Agency, 
his country still had an acute need for training in the use of state-of-the-art techniques for 
detecting nuclear and radioactive materials and in radiation oncology. 
52. He looked forward to still closer co-operation between Azerbaijan and the Agency and 
other international organizations in resolving, soon and comprehensively, the issues which he 
had mentioned along with their causes. He was certain that such co-operation would greatly 
assist Azerbaijan in implementing its non-nuclear-weapon strategy. 
53. Mr. COLOMBANI (France) said that, during the year since 11 September 2001, 
the international community had reacted commendably to the threat of terrorism, including 
nuclear terrorism. Individual States, which were responsible for the formulation and 
implementation of security policies, had reassessed the threat of acts of nuclear terrorism and 
strengthened their systems of protection against such acts. Also, they had stepped up 
international co-operation, and the Agency, which had an essential role to play in such 
co-operation, had within a few months presented -and gained approval for - the broad lines of 
a comprehensive and well-conceived programme for combating nuclear terrorism. 
54. France, which intended to support the programme financially and through in-kind 
contributions, had proposed to the Director General a plan for 20 high-priority activities to be 
implemented by it in co-operation with the Agency and relating to physical protection, the 
control and securing of radiation sources and the promotion of international legal instruments. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 12 

Besides such contributions in kind, France would be making a contribution of 300 000 euro to 
the Nuclear Security Fund. 

55. France was closely following the work of the technical and legal experts engaged in 
preparing a draft of an amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material. His delegation was disappointed that the experts had failed to complete their task 
earlier that month, but it hoped that a consensus would be reached in the near future - with the 
holding of a diplomatic conference soon thereafter. 
56. The NPT remained at the heart of the international nuclear non-proliferation regime, 
and the first session - in April - of the preparatory committee for the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference, during which there had been a constructive exchange of views, had demonstrated 
the effectiveness of the strengthened NPT review process. In his delegationÂs view, the 
success of the preparatory committeeÂs first session should pave the way for a balanced and 
forward-looking review of the workings of the NPT in 2005, resulting in progress towards full 
implementation of the NPT with regard to disarmament, non-proliferation and safeguards, and 
promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that connection, France was still looking 
forward to the entry into force of the CTBT and to the opening of negotiations in the 
Disarmament Conference - on the basis of the Shannon report - on a treaty to ban the 
production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
57. As regards the AgencyÂs safeguards system, his country believed that the international 
community must strive for its universality in terms of the commitments entered into by States 
in order that its full effectiveness might be attained. The fact that more than 50 States party to 
the NPT had yet to conclude an NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency was a cause for 
concern, and France would like to see all those States fulfilling their NPT obligations with a 
minimum of delay. 
58. France would also like to see all States which had not yet done so concluding and 
implementing protocols additional to their comprehensive safeguards agreements with the 
Agency as soon as possible. It was supporting the SecretariatÂs efforts in that connection. For 
example, earlier that year it had conducted a campaign in Africa and the Indian Ocean region 
to promote the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, 
and his delegation had therefore welcomed the recent signings by Niger, Mali and South 
Africa. As to FranceÂs additional protocol, his delegation hoped that the draft law for 
ratifying it would be adopted by the French Parliament before the end of the year. 
59. With regard to the situation in Iraq, the Agency was to be commended for its consistent 
efforts to fulfil the role entrusted to it by the United Nations Security Council. The Director 
General could count on FranceÂs firm support when endeavouring to apply the relevant 
Security Council resolutions. 
60. France was disappointed that the DPRK had done an about-turn regarding the 
modalities of application of its safeguards agreement with the Agency. It hoped that, 
following the official start, on 8 August, of the construction of the two LWRs being provided 
to the DPRK through KEDO, the DPRK would meet its NPT commitments and review its 
position in order to enable the Agency to accomplish its mission. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 13 

61. France, although attached to the principle of cost neutrality in real terms, had 
consistently been of the view that the Agency must have the resources necessary for 
performing its statutory tasks within the framework of its Regular Budget. The performance 
of those tasks should not be allowed to suffer because of the new demands being made on the 
Agency. All Member States should be ready both to respond to the AgencyÂs new needs and 
to ensure that there were sufficient budgetary resources for safeguards, in the interests not 
only of international peace and security but also of promoting the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. 
62. France had consistently paid its full TCF target share, the amount for 2002 being over 
US $4.5 million. Also, it financed footnote-a/ projects and supported AFRA and ARCAL 
activities. It was pleased that, under the skilful guidance of the Chairman of the Board, 
Ambassador Hughes, a consensus had been reached on the TCF targets for 2003 and 2004, 
but an increase in the resources available for technical co-operation would depend mainly on 
the major donor countries paying their full TCF target shares. It hoped that they - and many 
other Member States - would do so. At the same time, it hoped that more recipient Member 
States would pay in full the assessed programme costs due from them. 
63. France, which had participated actively in the Second Review Meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, was pleased with the progress made 
in many areas since the First Review Meeting, held in 1999. It had noted with satisfaction the 
commitments made to implement those improvements which were still necessary, and it 
hoped that those Member States with nuclear facilities which were not yet Contracting Parties 
would accede to the Convention soon. 
64. France, which was actively preparing to participate in the First Review Meeting of the 
Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention, planned for 2003, believed that only very wide 
adherence to the Joint Convention would make the international community more confident 
about the quality of nuclear fuel cycle management. 
65. WENRA, wishing to arrive at a common approach to nuclear safety, had in January 
decided to compare, using a methodology based to a large extent on Agency safety standards, 
the practices of different member countries. France believed that that comparison would help 
to further increase the safety of nuclear installations in western Europe. 
66. The AgencyÂs Transport Regulations, the requirements of which had been incorporated 
into the regulations of the modal organizations, were being strictly observed in France 
regardless of the mode of transport and the materials being transported. In the interests of 
transparency in that connection, France had just officially requested a TranSAS mission 
for 2003. 
67. As regards international transport, France and its partners had for several years been 
conducting a dialogue whose purpose was to ensure the greatest possible transparency and to 
provide requesting countries with the assurances which they wanted and also with certain 
information of use to them. The practice in question had been welcomed in General 
Conference resolutions. Those involved should bear in mind the basic requirements of 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 14 

physical protection, however, and the practice should not be allowed to call the provisions of 
maritime law into question. 

68. In that connection, his delegation was looking forward to the 2003 International 
Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, at which France would share 
its expertise and experience in a spirit of transparency. His delegation was confident that 
there would be useful technical discussions at the International Conference, resulting in 
progress towards even greater safety - if further improvement were possible - in the domestic 
and international transport of radioactive materials. 
69. In order to integrate nuclear safety and radiation protection in France more closely and 
to increase the resources available for the activities in question, a General Directorate for 
Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection (DGSNR) had been established at the beginning of 
the year as the sole authority responsible for oversight - on behalf of the State - in those two 
areas. A large nuclear safety and radiation protection research organization which would in 
particular provide technical support to the DGSNR had also been established. 
70. As to the future of nuclear power, there were signs of renewed vitality in those countries 
which were opting for that source of energy for their sustainable development. In a recent 
report of the European Commission on the security of energy supplies, it had been concluded 
that nuclear power, which accounted for 35% of electricity production in Europe, was 
essential and that the range of energy supply options should be as broad as possible. Energy 
supply security considerations underlay the strategic plans made public during the past two 
years by - among other countries - the United States, Japan, Russia, Finland, the Republic of 
Korea, China and India. 
71. France had been implementing a responsible energy strategy orientated towards nuclear 
power in order to ensure a high level of energy independence. In 2001, 58 operational 
reactors had accounted for 76.2% of electricity production in France. The French authorities 
had recently announced the imminent launching of a major public debate on energy, to be 
followed by the passing of a framework law which would increase the role of renewable 
energy but also guarantee a place for nuclear power. 
72. With regard to concerns about the environment and global warming, the benefits of 
nuclear power were indisputable. The European Commission had estimated that the amount 
of CO2 being emitted in European Union countries was 300 million tons less per annum than 
it would be without nuclear power production - the equivalent of half the CO2 emissions from 
motor vehicles within the European Union. 
73. His delegation, which welcomed the political will displayed at the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development, hoped that all those involved in peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy would work hard to ensure that nuclear energy played its full part in sustainable 
development. In that connection, it was pleased with the way in which the Secretariat had, at 
the Summit, highlighted the role of the Agency in the areas of nuclear technology transfer, 
human health, food and agriculture, water resources management and environmental 
protection. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 15 

74. Besides recognizing the advantages of nuclear power from the points of view of energy 
supply security and combating climate change, some countries were now conducting in-depth 
studies of the competitiveness of nuclear power - something already recognized in Finland. 
75. Against a background which was generally favourable as regards the future of nuclear 
power, France was participating in the Generation IV International Forum and following with 
interest the work being done in the context of INPRO - two initiatives between which close 
co-ordination should be encouraged. The systems being studied within the framework of 
those two initiatives should, in his countryÂs view, be suitable for electricity generation in 
conjunction with - for example - hydrogen production or seawater desalination. 
76. France, which had long appreciated the need to preserve knowledge important for the 
future of nuclear science and technology, stood ready to participate in the knowledge 
management activities to be undertaken within the Agency framework. 
77. In 2001, there had been a major reorganization of research and the nuclear industry in 
France. The research capabilities of the CEA had been regrouped under four headings - 
ÂnuclearÂ, ÂdefenceÂ, Âbasic researchÂ and ÂtechnologyÂ - and the nuclear industry had been 
rationalized and consolidated within the AREVA group, the primary global player in the 
nuclear field. 
78. France, which was sure that nuclear power would play a substantial role in the 
sustainable development of humankind and the protection of the planet, believed that the 
Agency was making an essential contribution by helping to ensure international peace and 
security and enabling more and more countries to benefit from the peaceful uses of atomic 
energy. 
79. Mr. SOURANG (Senegal) said that his country, which had joined the Agency 
20 years previously only seven months after gaining independence, had since then 
implemented, with Agency assistance, several projects in areas such as agriculture, nuclear 
medicine, hydrology, stockbreeding, manufacturing and natural resources evaluation and 
exploitation. The use of radioisotopes in those areas had enabled it to achieve results which 
would have been difficult to achieve using traditional methods. Moreover, the Agency had 
assisted his country in the area of nuclear physics research and the Secretariat had arranged 
for nationals of Senegal to receive training in areas such as radiochemistry and 
radiopharmacy. 
80. In agriculture, the main beneficiary was the National Agronomic Research Centre of the 
Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute, which had regional stations located in various 
parts of Senegal. The Agency had provided equipment, and had assisted with the setting up 
of a radioisotope laboratory where studies of soil-water-plant relationships and of manure 
application efficiency were being carried out. The research conducted by the Institute had 
helped to identify pedo-climatic zones, the water requirements of millet and peanuts and 
drought-resistant varieties. In addition, cowpea and peanut cultivars capable of fixing large 
quantities of nitrogen in cultivation systems had been identified.

81. The Agency had helped the National Laboratory for Stockbreeding and Veterinary 
Research to establish radioimmunoassay capabilities for determining reproductive hormones 
and to strengthen its diagnostic capabilities. Also with Agency assistance, radioimmunoassay 
and related techniques had been introduced at the Inter-State School of Veterinary Sciences 
and Medicine for use in animal nutrition and livestock reproduction studies. Through one 
technical co-operation project, his country had gained access to improved methods for 
diagnosing, combating and controlling animal diseases. As a result, rinderpest had been 
virtually eradicated and the country had been provisionally declared free of it in 2001. 
82. Co-operation in the human health field had greatly intensified since 1986. Two 
technical co-operation projects had helped with the development of diagnostic capabilities at 
the Aristide le Dantec Hospital, and one had helped with the establishment of scintigraphic 
imaging and in vitro assay capabilities at the biophysics laboratory of the Sheikh Anta Diop 
University and the Aristide le Dantec Hospital, extending the range of clinical examinations 
available. 
83. Several projects had helped with the introduction of isotope hydrology techniques to, 
for example, study groundwater flow and characterize aquifers. Also, a complete 
hydrochemistry laboratory had been set up. Senegal had participated in Model Project 
RAF/8/022, which had aimed at improving the management of water resources in arid and 
semi-arid zones in Africa. 
84. Following a RAPAT mission to Senegal in 1988, a radiation protection training project 
had been initiated at the Applied Nuclear Technology Institute. Also, under that project, 
expert services in the field of thermoluminescence dosimetry and assistance with the drafting 
of legislative and regulatory texts had been provided. 
85. His delegation hoped that the Agency would continue to assist Senegal, which was a 
member of AFRA, particularly in the fields of food and health. His country had concluded an 
NPT safeguards agreement and would shortly be concluding an additional protocol, and 
within the framework of the African Union it was supporting the denuclearization of Africa 
through the Pelindaba Treaty. 
86. Mr. VALECA (Romania) said that his Government attached great importance to 
the development of nuclear power and that Unit 1 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant was 
currently covering 11% of RomaniaÂs electricity demand. 
87. Three main factors had led his Government to decide that construction work at Unit 2 
should continue and to invite foreign investment in Unit 3: the high levels of safety at all of 
RomaniaÂs nuclear installations; the fact that the expected continuation of economic growth at 
an annual rate of about 5% would result in an energy deficit of 1000 MW(e) by 2005; and the 
fact that Romania had the nuclear infrastructure and expertise necessary for supporting the 
construction and operation of Unit 2. 
88. The commercial contract for the completion of Unit 2 had been concluded in 2001 
between the Romanian company Nuclearelectrica (SNN) and its traditional partners - Atomic 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 17 

Energy of Canada Limited and ANSALDO Energia (Italy). Companies based in France, the 
United States of America and other countries were also participating in the project. 

89. It was expected that Unit 2 would by 2005 account for more than 20% of RomaniaÂs 
electricity production, so that by then about 50% would be accounted for by clean 
technologies such as nuclear and hydroelectric power generation. 
90. The countryÂs National Nuclear Strategy provided for the continuation of construction 
work on Unit 3 of the Cernavoda nuclear power plant, and his Government believed that 
nuclear power should be considered a CDM technology under the UNFCCC. It also believed 
that the Agency should continue doing its utmost to ensure that nuclear power was given a 
full and fair hearing in multilateral debates within the UNFCCC framework. 
91. His Government attached high priority to ensuring the safety and security of nuclear 
materials and installations, and RomaniaÂs relevant legislation and regulations were being 
brought into line with the latest European Union and Agency standards. Also, the national 
regulatory body (CNCAN) was being strengthened with the help of the European 
Commission and the Agency. 
92. Recommendations made after a full scope IRRT mission in May and an IPPAS mission 
in April were being implemented in the ongoing process of amending RomaniaÂs nuclear 
legislation and regulations. 
93. In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, Romania had joined in 
international efforts to prevent and combat terrorism in all its forms. It had pledged in-kind 
contributions in support of the Agency action plan approved by the Board in March, and his 
Government had recently informed the Secretariat that it was prepared to host a regional pilot 
course on techniques for counteracting threats of nuclear terrorism. 
94. The CNCAN and other competent authorities had reviewed the national legislative 
framework and regulations relating to the safety and security of nuclear materials and 
installations, and new physical protection regulations had been issued. In addition, the 
CNCAN had issued regulations regarding the qualifications of guards and other security 
personnel at nuclear installations in order to increase the effectiveness of response measures 
in the event of a terrorist attack. 
95. In July, an Agency-supported exercise in dealing with illicit trafficking in nuclear and 
other radioactive materials had been held in Romania for the purpose of assessing - inter alia procedures, 
preparedness, communications and co-ordination between various national 
bodies, and measurement capabilities. 
96. Significant progress had been made in RomaniaÂs accession negotiations with the 
European Union, and the adoption by Romania of European Union nuclear safety and 
radiation protection norms was proceeding smoothly. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 18 

97. RomaniaÂs framework law 111/1996 on nuclear safety had recently been amended in 
order to allow the establishment of technical support organizations and the financing of 
regulatory activities with extrabudgetary resources. 
98. With regard to the harmonization of RomaniaÂs nuclear legislation with European 
Union and Agency standards, a draft law on the promotion of nuclear activities and one on the 
safe management and final disposal of radioactive waste and spent fuel had been submitted to 
the European Commission and the AgencyÂs Secretariat for consideration before being 
presented to the Romanian Parliament for approval. 
99. Romania remained committed to fulfilling in good faith all its NPT obligations and to 
further pursuing a responsible nuclear export control policy. It would continue to provide 
every assistance to the Agency with the implementation of its additional protocol and with 
other tasks relating to nuclear non-proliferation. 
100. As to Agency technical co-operation activities, his delegation was grateful to the 
Agency for arranging for the training of Romanian personnel and providing Romania with 
expert services. As in the past, Romania stood ready to support those activities by itself 
providing training - for experts from developing countries - and by organizing regional 
seminars and workshops and sharing information and expertise. His delegation was confident 
that the Agency would continue to make use of the Centre of Excellence on Nuclear Safety at 
the Cernavoda nuclear power plant, the National Institute for Nuclear Research at Pitesti and 
the National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering (IFIN) in Bucharest for 
international and regional training activities. 
101. The National Institute for Nuclear Research was still in the process of converting its 
TRIGA research reactor from HEU to LEU, and his Government hoped that support for the 
InstituteÂs efforts would be provided through the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme. 
102. RomaniaÂs VVR-S research reactor had been definitively shut down, and the 
decommissioning plan was being finalized with support provided through the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme. One important remaining issue was the return to the 
Russian Federation of the reactorÂs spent fuel. It was to be hoped that the SecretariatÂs 
consultations on arrangements for the safe management of research reactor fuel of 
Soviet/Russian origin would have a positive outcome. 
103. His Government, which hoped that the balance between the statutory and the technical 
co-operation activities of the Agency would be maintained, intended to ensure that Romania 
continued to make regular payments to the TCF and towards the Regular Budget and to pay 
the assessed programme costs due from it. 
104. Mr. GAIDUK (Ukraine) said that his country, like many other countries with a 
highly developed nuclear power industry and using nuclear techniques for a wide range of 
purposes, had spent much of the year since the previous General Conference session striving 
to meet new security challenges connected - above all - with the threat of terrorist activities 
directed against nuclear facilities. With 13 power reactors in operation, three being 
decommissioned and two under construction, Ukraine was devoting particular attention to 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 19 

questions of physical protection. It was participating actively in the process of drafting an 
amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material designed to 
include nuclear facilities within the ConventionÂs scope and was supporting the efforts being 
made within the Agency framework to prevent acts of nuclear terrorism. 

105. Nuclear power accounted for about half of UkraineÂs electricity production, and in the 
decades to come it would be a key element of the countryÂs energy policy. Global climate 
change and other problems arising from humankindÂs interaction with the environment were a 
good reason for fresh thinking about the role of nuclear power in the future. 
106. The Secretariat was to be commended for its efforts to ensure that, at the World Summit 
on Sustainable Development, the question of reliable and efficient energy supplies was 
discussed in an objective manner. 
107. The Second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety had shown that the Contracting Parties were raising safety levels at their nuclear power 
plants and that the AgencyÂs efforts to enhance nuclear safety generally were proving 
effective. Ukraine regarded the recommendations and proposals made at the Second Review 
Meeting as an action plan which it would endeavour to implement during both the operation 
and the construction of its nuclear power plants. 
108. Recalling a conference held earlier in the year in Kiev to mark the tenth anniversary of 
the European UnionÂs programme of technical assistance in nuclear safety for CIS countries 
(Tacis), he said that it had highlighted the AgencyÂs role in co-ordinating the efforts of several 
countries and organizations to strengthen nuclear safety in countries of the former Soviet 
Union. Ukraine was grateful to those donor countries which had helped to enhance safety at 
its nuclear power plants. 
109. Referring to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, he said that its closure had not brought 
an end to the serious problems which it posed. Organizations, scientists and engineers from 
many countries were helping to solve those problems, and a number of unprecedented 
projects were being carried out at the Chernobyl site. A decision had been taken to build a 
new, safer confinement structure for the destroyed Unit 4 reactor, and design work had 
started. Also, preparations were being made for the decommissioning of the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant as a whole, with careful attention being paid to nuclear and radiation 
safety. 
110. Ukraine was supporting the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen co-operation in nuclear 
science and technology and applications, especially within the framework of INPRO. The 
results of INPRO would be important for Ukraine, in whose future energy strategy a major 
role would be assigned to nuclear power in helping to ensure the countryÂs energy 
independence. 
111. All Agency technical co-operation projects in Ukraine were directed towards solving 
problems of high priority in the field of nuclear power generation. The most important 
problems for Ukraine at present were connected with the safety of nuclear facilities, 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 20 

equipment life-cycle management, nuclear power plant service life extension and the 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. 

112. Ukraine, which appreciated the importance of Member States fulfilling their financial 
obligations vis-Ã -vis the Agency, had paid its 2002 Regular Budget contribution and its full 
2002 TCF target share in a timely manner. 
113. Ukraine was currently preparing to ratify the protocol additional to its NPT safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. Implementation of the additional protocol would require 
significant resources, but Ukraine would take the necessary steps as expeditiously as its 
economic circumstances permitted. 
114. A major concern with regard to the implementation of the additional protocol would be 
the large quantity of nuclear material still in the destroyed Unit 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant. The problem was a unique one, and the active involvement of specialists from 
the Department of Safeguards in solving it would be essential. 
115. Ukraine, which was a Contracting Party to the Joint Convention, attached great 
importance to the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste given its large nuclear 
power programme and the persisting aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. Dry storage 
facilities were being constructed for UkraineÂs spent fuel, which should solve the mediumterm 
storage problem, and the long-term storage problem was now being examined. His 
country, which would like to see further Member States acceding to the Joint Convention, 
hoped that appropriate attention would be paid to spent fuel and radioactive waste 
management in future Agency technical co-operation programmes and that the First Review 
Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention would be a success. 
116. Ukraine greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs role in helping to strengthen the regime of 
third-party liability for nuclear damage and was a strong adherent to the regimeÂs main 
principles. At the end of 2001, the Supreme Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine had adopted a law 
on third-party liability for nuclear damage and its funding which prescribed a liability 
threshold of 150 million SDRs for the operators of nuclear facilities. 
117. Commending the Director General and the Secretariat on their efforts to strengthen 
international co-operation in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, he said that Ukraine 
would continue to support those efforts. 
118. Mr. ARAUZ AGUILAR (Guatemala) said that the goal of his country - a 
multicultural and multilingual nation - was sustainable development, which it believed it 
could achieve thanks to its abundant natural resources and a population accustomed to 
overcoming obstacles. 
119. His country was engaged in a process of national reconciliation after a war that had 
lasted over 30 years. One of the most serious problems facing it was poverty, and his 
Government was making great efforts to solve it by - inter alia - promoting macroeconomic 
stability, reducing unemployment and achieving a fair distribution of the national income. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 21 

120. The Agency had been supporting those efforts, and the peaceful utilization of nuclear 
energy had enabled Guatemala to make significant advances both in terms of productivity and 
in terms of human welfare. Within the framework of ARCAL, it had benefited from 
numerous national, regional and interregional technical assistance projects focusing chiefly on 
human health, agriculture, radiation protection and geothermal energy applications. 
121. Agency model projects had led to improvements in GuatemalaÂs radiation protection 
and radioactive waste management infrastructures and to the strengthening of the countryÂs 
regulatory authority, as President Portillo had reported to Congress in January. In addition, 
the dosimetric calibration laboratory of the Ministry of Energy and Mines had been upgraded 
to become a reference laboratory for the calibration of radiation detection and measurement 
systems for the whole Central American region. 
122. In the field of human health, medical equipment had been provided, health physicists 
had been trained and radiotherapy quality control programmes had been established through 
Agency technical co-operation projects. A reference centre established with Agency 
assistance at the National Cancer Institute was providing services to nationals not only of 
Guatemala but also of countries such as Belize, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico. 
123. In the field of geothermal energy, the National Electrification Institute had received 
assistance with training in geochemistry and reservoir engineering. It was hoped that the 
power generation capacity of GuatemalaÂs known geothermal areas would ultimately be 
430 MW(e). 
124. Through co-operation between the Agency, FAO, the United States and Mexico, 
complete success had been achieved in controlling the medfly in Guatemala, whose medfly 
rearing facility - which was producing some 1850 million sterile pupae a week - had been 
recognized as a centre of excellence and was receiving Agency fellows from all over the 
world for training in the SIT. 
125. His country was participating very actively in ARCAL projects relating to areas such as 
human and animal health, manufacturing, agriculture and the environment - all having a 
strong social impact and consistent with sustainable development. 
126. Currently there were technical co-operation projects under way in Guatemala on the 
analysis of ecotoxic metals using X-ray fluorescence techniques, on the strengthening of the 
national programme for neonatal hypothyroidism screening and on quality control at a 
radiotherapy centre. All those projects were being implemented through outsourcing, which 
was contributing to the efficiency of their implementation. 
127. Guatemala was supporting efforts directed towards greater integration among 
neighbouring countries through the Puebla Panama Plan, which would create enormous 
opportunities for more than 65 million people. In the energy sector, the electricity grids of 
Mexico and Central America were to be connected, which would open the way for the 
development of cleaner power generation using the regionÂs substantial renewable energy 
resources. Also, the initiative in question would further promote the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy in the region. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 22 

128. In conclusion, he called on all Member States which were carrying out nuclear or 
nuclear-related activities to conclude an additional protocol as soon as possible, so as to help 
prevent the diversion of nuclear material or technology for terrorist purposes or for other 
purposes that might endanger collective security. 
129. Mr. BUTT (Pakistan) said that, following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, 
his country had established robust physical protection systems that were under constant 
review. It was pleased that the Agency had also reacted promptly to the new challenges and 
that so many countries were taking measures to protect their own interests, the interests of 
their regions and the interests of the world at large. 
130. The Agency had an important role to play in that context, but its promotional activities 
should not be allowed to suffer as a result. Pakistan would continue to support those activities 
by, for example, providing training for Agency fellowship holders. 
131. The Agency's technical co-operation activities could make a significant contribution 
towards the establishment of a fairer world based on sustainable economic development - a 
must for lasting peace and security. They had already had an appreciable impact in Pakistan 
in areas such as medicine, agriculture, hydrology and safety. 
132. With more than 30 yearsÂ experience of generating nuclear power under Agency 
safeguards, Pakistan failed to understand why it was being prevented by embargoes from 
acquiring technology and material necessary for increasing plant reliability and efficiency. 
133. His country, which considered need-oriented programmes, capacity-building and 
unhindered freedom to acquire technology for peace and prosperity to be essential, believed 
that a balance should be maintained between the technical co-operation activities and the 
other activities of the Agency. Any attempt to undermine that balance would be counterproductive. 
134. His country also believed that the TCDC concept should be fully implemented and 
would like to see greater synergy between the activities being conducted within the 
framework of RCA, AFRA and ARCAL. It would be hosting the next meeting of 
representatives of countries party to the RCA, in 2003, and it hoped that practical measures 
for achieving greater synergy would be considered at that meeting. 
135. Given its very limited hydro and fossil fuel resources, Pakistan regarded nuclear power 
as essential for helping to meet its increasing energy needs. It therefore welcomed the recent 
positive shift in attitudes towards nuclear power at the international level. It wished to 
construct further safeguarded nuclear power plants and hoped that, to that end, it would 
receive assistance from other Agency Member States. 
136. Pakistan attached great importance to INPRO. Also, it was participating in the Agency 
activities relating to nuclear desalination. With Agency help, it was preparing to build a 
demonstration nuclear desalination facility near the Karachi nuclear power plant. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 23 

137. Pakistan, whose good nuclear safety record had been recognized at the Second Review 
Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, was an active 
member of WANO and the CANDU Owners Group, and it was giving high priority to the 
strengthening of safety culture at all its nuclear facilities. For example, following the 
establishment of an independent Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority reporting directly to 
the Head of Government, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission had strengthened its 
Directorate of Safety, which, besides dealing with nuclear safety and radiation protection 
issues, operated the countryÂs nuclear emergency response co-ordination centre. 
138. Pakistan looked forward to greater co-operation with other countries as regards 
unhindered access to technology in keeping with the spirit of the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety. Embargoes affecting safeguarded nuclear facilities were not only counter-productive 
but also potentially dangerous, for a nuclear accident anywhere was a nuclear accident 
everywhere. 
139. Pakistan, whose safeguards record was immaculate, believed that safeguards could 
contribute significantly to the safety and security of nuclear material. Accordingly, it was 
participating in the international communityÂs efforts to strengthen the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. However, it was concerned about the tendency to 
make new proposals at every meeting of the open-ended group of legal and technical experts 
who were endeavouring to draft an amendment designed to strengthen the Convention. 
140. His country greatly appreciated the work of the advisory groups established with a view 
to improving the AgencyÂs programmes, particularly that of SAGTAC. However, it believed 
that Member States should be kept informed about the work of those groups through regular 
briefings. 
141. The measures taken to overcome the AgencyÂs budgetary problems had sometimes had 
unwelcome consequences. Despite its economic difficulties, Pakistan had always paid its 
dues in full and in a timely manner, and would like to see all other Member States doing the 
same. 
142. Pakistan, whose main basic and applied research centre - PINSTECH - had been 
declared a Regional Resource Unit by the Agency, was pleased that, pursuant to an initiative 
of Pakistan, the United Nations had declared 10 November 2002 to be ÂWorld Science Day 
for Peace and DevelopmentÂ. It hoped that Member States would celebrate that day by 
emphasizing the universality of science and the importance of unfettered access to scientific 
and technological knowledge worldwide. 
143. Both of PakistanÂs nuclear power plants had been operating safely during 2002. The 
Karachi nuclear power plant (KANUPP), which had gone into operation 30 years previously, 
had been operating with an availability factor of around 80%, and the Chashma nuclear power 
plant (CHASNUPP) had very satisfactorily completed its first two years of operation. The 
two plants accounted for only about 3% of electricity generation in his country, but the 
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) was planning to construct further power 
reactors at the KANUPP and CHASNUPP sites. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 24 

144. PAEC had released 41 crop varieties developed by nuclear agriculture research 
institutes in Pakistan. The new varieties had higher yields and were resistant to disease and 
pests, and some of them had already had a marked beneficial impact on PakistanÂs economy. 
145. Salinity control methods developed in Pakistan under Agency auspices were now being 
introduced in ten developing countries. In Pakistan, a project for the restoration of 25 000 
acres of wasteland had been prepared. 
146. PAEC had established in different parts of the country 13 hospitals capable of providing 
nuclear medicine, radiotherapy and chemotherapy services to more than 300 000 patients each 
year. Also, work had begun on the establishment of five new nuclear medicine centres. 
147. Mr. KYRLE (Austria) said that it was imperative that maximum levels of safety 
be achieved and maintained in all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle throughout the world. The 
Agency was to be commended for its intensive efforts to enhance nuclear safety, particularly 
by elaborating nuclear safety standards, rendering safety services to Member States and 
promoting good safety practices. 
148. Since Austria placed special emphasis on the issue of nuclear safety in the context of 
enlargement of the European Union, his country welcomed the substantial progress made 
during recent years in addressing that sensitive issue, especially the agreement reached 
between the European Union and those membership candidate countries which had nuclear 
power reactors in operation regarding the closure of reactors that could not be upgraded to 
comply with European Union safety requirements. In that context, Austria and the Czech 
Republic had in November 2001 concluded an agreement regarding nuclear safety at the 
Temelin nuclear power plant. 
149. The Laeken Council had in December 2001 called for a high level of nuclear safety in 
the enlarged European Union, and a joint approach to nuclear safety in the form of common 
safety standards and practices was needed. 
150. Despite the improvements achieved in the area of nuclear safety, Austria still believed 
that nuclear power was not a politically, socially or technically justifiable energy option, 
given the enormous risks it posed. Also, Austria did not consider nuclear power to be 
compatible with the concept of sustainable development, in view of the ever-increasing 
burdens which it placed on future generations, so that nuclear power was not a viable option 
for combating the greenhouse effect. 
151. Welcoming the results of the Second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, he expressed the hope that the important necessary safety 
improvements identified at the meeting would be duly made by the Contracting Parties in 
question. 
152. The tragic events of 11 September 2001 had underlined the fact that nuclear security, 
the physical protection of nuclear installations and nuclear safety were interrelated. Austria 
was supporting the AgencyÂs endeavours in all three areas. 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 25 

153. The First Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention, scheduled 
for 2003, would be another important step towards a higher level of safety within the nuclear 
fuel cycle as a whole. In that connection, his delegation greatly appreciated the work being 
done on preparing a code of conduct on the safety of research reactors and looked forward to 
the meeting of technical and legal experts at which the first draft of the code of conduct would 
be examined. 
154. Austria welcomed the completion of the conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards, which would allow the Agency not only to verify the non-diversion of declared 
nuclear material but also to draw conclusions about the absence of undeclared nuclear 
activities. To make the integrated safeguards system fully operational, States must now 
ensure that the necessary safeguards agreements and additional protocols were in place. 
Regrettably, the number of additional protocols in place was still well below expectations. 
The Japanese Government was to be applauded for its untiring efforts to promote the 
universalization of the Model Additional Protocol by sponsoring Agency seminars and 
offering to host an international conference in Tokyo in December 2002. 
155. His country did not share the view that the conclusion of additional protocols was 
optional for non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT, convinced as it was that a clear 
legal obligation to conclude additional protocols derived from NPT Article III.1. It was up to 
each State party to make sure that, whenever a change occurred in the safeguards system, the 
additional measures required could be properly implemented by the Agency. 
156. International nuclear security was a prerequisite for nuclear trade and co-operation. 
States parties to the NPT could supply nuclear items only if those items would not be diverted 
for non-peaceful purposes in recipient States, which meant that a State wishing to purchase 
nuclear items must have in place an adequate nuclear security system comprising four 
elements: comprehensive safeguards, including safeguards applied pursuant to an additional 
protocol; an adequate system for physical protection; minimum arrangements for combating 
illicit trafficking; and an appropriate set of export control rules. It was the AgencyÂs task to 
make that clear and to assist States in establishing adequate nuclear security systems. Austria, 
which welcomed the SecretariatÂs strong commitment to enhancing nuclear security and 
particularly the SecretariatÂs action plan for the prevention of nuclear terrorism, believed that 
the fight against terrorism would succeed only if StatesÂ nuclear security systems were 
properly implemented. 
157. With regard to the current efforts to strengthen the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material, regrettably, despite four meetings and agreement on the 
overall objectives, no consensus had been reached on an amendment that would strengthen it. 
On the contrary, there was a tendency to dilute essential parts of the draft amendment, the 
purpose of which was to give clear guidance to countries - particularly developing countries on 
how to design effective and efficient physical protection systems. His country hoped that 
the deadlock would be broken in November, at the next meeting of the open-ended group of 
legal and technical experts convened by the Director General. 
158. His country, which was pleased with the progress made in increasing the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities, was supporting those 

GC(46)/OR.2 
page 26 

activities in the wide area of non-power applications of nuclear energy - applications relating 
to, inter alia, human health, hydrology and the environment. For example, on World Water 
Day, 22 March 2002, the Austrian Development Cooperation had collaborated with the 
Secretariat in demonstrating the importance of nuclear techniques for the sustainable 
management of water resources. 

159. The Agency could count on the continuing support of Austria, which had again paid its 
full TCF target share and would continue to meet its financial obligations vis-Ã -vis the 
Agency. 
ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE CONFERENCE 

(a) 
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA AND ALLOCATION OF ITEMS FOR INITIAL 
DISCUSSION 
160. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the 
agenda for the current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in 
documents GC(46)/1 and GC(46)/1/Add.1. With regard to the allocation of items for initial 
discussion, the Committee had recommended that all the items listed in documents GC(45)/1 
and GC(46)/1/Add.1 be taken up for initial discussion as indicated in those documents. It had 
also recommended that the order of items be as proposed in those documents. 
161. 
The General CommitteeÂs recommendations were accepted. 
(b) 
CLOSING DATE OF THE SESSION AND OPENING DATE OF THE NEXT 
SESSION 
162. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the 
Conference set Friday, 20 September 2002 as the closing date of the forty-sixth regular 
session and Monday, 15 September 2003 as the opening date of the forty-seventh regular 
session, which would be held in Vienna. 
163. Noting that some delegates had suggested that future sessions of the General 
Conference be scheduled for later in September or for early October, he expressed the hope 
that the Secretariat would look into the matter. 
164. 
The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
(c) 
RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 
165. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee, which had had before it 
requests made by Iraq, Georgia and Mali for the restoration of their voting rights, had 
postponed consideration of the requests made by Georgia and Mali until its following 
meeting. As to the request made by Iraq, the Committee had recommended that IraqÂs right to 
vote during the present session not be restored because, in the CommitteeÂs opinion, that 
countryÂs failure to pay the amount necessary in order to avoid the application of 
Article XIX.A of the Statute had not been due to conditions beyond its control.

166. The General CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (resumed) 

167. Mr. PALACIOS (ABACC) said that during the ten years since it had been 
established ABACC had carried out more than 1200 inspections at 75 nuclear facilities in 
Argentina and Brazil, representing a total effort of more than 4400 inspector-days. As a result 
of its accounting and control activities, carried out by a core of ten technical professionals 
with the support of some 70 inspectors seconded by the two countries and costing about 
$20 million over those ten years, it could confirm that during that period both countries had 
fulfilled their commitments under the bilateral Agreement on the Exclusively Peaceful 
Utilization of Nuclear Energy. That demonstrated the seriousness of the work which those 
countries and ABACC were doing to further nuclear non-proliferation. 
168. Moreover, the activities of ABACC and its increasing co-operation with the Agency had 
made a major contribution to the international safeguards system. The two organizations 
were likely to agree soon on guidelines for joint inspection activities at specific facilities, 
which would increase inspection efficiency without detriment to the effectiveness of 
safeguards. Agreement on those guidelines was a pre-requisite for the adoption by the two 
organizations of procedures of the ÂNew Partnership ApproachÂ type. 
169. While significant progress had been made in implementing safeguards under the 
Quadripartite Agreement, the implementation of an additional protocol in the two countries which 
was likely - would pose new challenges. In that connection, it was essential to 
strengthen the channels of communication between ABACC and the Agency so that views 
could be exchanged and, where necessary, corrective action agreed upon without undue haste. 
While substantial progress had been made in that regard during ABACCÂs first ten years, 
there was still room for improvement. 
The meeting rose at 5.50 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. NDAMBUKI (Kenya) welcomed the AgencyÂs additional activities to protect 
against nuclear terrorism. The threat of nuclear terrorism had underscored the importance of 
the NPT. Kenya was a Party to that Treaty and was firmly committed to disarmament. The 
Government had initiated steps for the early conclusion of a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and an additional protocol. In February 2002, his country had acceded to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It had ratified the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and continued to support the establishment of that TreatyÂs global 
verification regime. Moreover, it was promoting the establishment of pro-nuclear safety 
societies to further the peaceful application of nuclear science. 
2. Nearly 80% of KenyaÂs population lived in rural areas and were dependent on 
agriculture for their livelihood. That sector was therefore crucial to the countryÂs economic 
growth. However, it faced constraints owing to soil nutrient depletion, land degradation, loss 
of biodiversity, insect pests and plant and animal diseases. Agency technical co-operation 
activities included the use of nuclear techniques to enhance crop production, monitor nutrients 
and water in soil, and improve the diagnosis and control of livestock diseases. Certain 
projects had focused on the development of improved crop varieties and Kenya was also 
participating in regional projects on use of biofertilizers by smallholders to increase crop 
production and soil fertility and on improving milk and meat production. 
3. Tsetse fly infestation and trypanosomosis were one of the greatest obstacles to food and 
agriculture production in sub-Saharan Africa. Tsetse flies caused estimated annual economic 
losses of US $4 billion. In recognition of the magnitude of the problem, African leaders had 
launched the PATTEC action plan. Much hope was being placed in the SIT whose 
effectiveness in the eradication of tsetse flies had been demonstrated in Zanzibar. He thanked 
the Agency for the support it was giving PATTEC in collaboration with other international 
organizations and African Governments. An Agency technical co-operation project on 
integrated area-wide tsetse and trypanosomosis management in the Lambwe valley in southwest 
Kenya was in progress, to which the Government of Kenya was contributing 8.3 million 
Kenyan shillings per year. However, the geographical coverage of the project was limited. 
His country wished to seek the AgencyÂs help in designing a more extensive project with a 
view to making the whole Lake Victoria region a tsetse-free zone. The Agency should also 
investigate the potential of the SIT for suppressing the malaria-transmitting mosquito. 
Malaria was the leading cause of death in Kenya, particularly among children. 
4. The AgencyÂs human health programme in Kenya covered improvement of the national 
health care delivery system, particularly in the area of diagnosis and radiotherapy. Several 
Kenyan staff had been trained through the AgencyÂs fellowship programmes in that field and 
others were currently undergoing training. 
5. Cancer of the cervix was the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young 
Kenyan women. The Radiotherapy Department of the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi 
was the only public institution providing cancer treatment in the country, but a lack of modern 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 4 

equipment limited its capacity. His Government therefore appreciated the project on early 
diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer which had been undertaken with the support of the 
Agency and technical staff from the Kenyatta National Hospital, the Kenya Medical Research 
Institute, and the University of Nairobi, and which included the upgrading and rehabilitation 
of the Radiotherapy Department at the New Nyanza General Hospital in Kisumu. It hoped 
that the Agency would give priority consideration to KenyaÂs new project proposals for the 
establishment of two other radiotherapy centres which would benefit patients in distant rural 
areas. 

6. Nuclear techniques could play an effective role in redressing water scarcity in Kenya. 
The country was involved in a regional project on the integration of isotope hydrology in the 
water sector, which aimed at developing expertise in water resource management, 
strengthening the skills of operational staff, and establishing regional capacity to provide 
training in isotope hydrology and related fields. 
7. With regard to radiation protection and nuclear safety, a stringent safety culture would 
be an indispensable prerequisite for the successful application of nuclear techniques in the 
21st century. KenyaÂs Radiation Protection Board provided advice to the Government and 
dealt with radiation protection and nuclear safety matters. The Government was revising the 
Radiation Protection Act in order to ensure that it complied with Basic Safety Standards. The 
country was also participating in a successful Model Project on the development of radiation 
protection infrastructure. The Agency had provided the Radiation Protection Board with 
equipment and had assisted with the establishment of an occupational exposure control 
system. 
8. The need for highly qualified personnel assumed great importance as Kenya and other 
developing countries continued to integrate modern nuclear techniques. He thanked the 
Agency for providing Kenyan scientists with training opportunities and encouraged it to 
intensify co-operation in that field. 
9. The Agency could only fulfil its vital role of advancing the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy if all its Member States honoured their financial obligations. That applied also to 
technical co-operation activities, which were dependent on voluntary contributions and timely 
payment of assessed programme costs by recipient countries. His Government had released 
$75 000 towards the payment of its outstanding arrears and its voluntary contributions to the 
TCF, and had also taken steps to pay all its other outstanding dues as soon as possible. 
10. Ms. BECERRIL (Spain) commended the Director General on the swift action 
taken by the Agency to prevent nuclear terrorism following the terrorist attacks of 
11 September 2001. Its speedy response to General Conference resolution GC(45)/RES/14 
had enabled the Board of Governors to approve a series of measures in May to deal with that 
threat. Her country had examined with interest the Director GeneralÂs progress report on the 
work, contained in GC(46)/14, and was satisfied with the scope and timeliness of the 
activities implemented. However, funding based on voluntary contributions could not 
guarantee maintenance of the programmed activities in the medium and long term. Therefore, 
once the most urgent activities had been implemented, the remaining programmed activities, 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 5 

particularly those of a permanent nature, should be funded from the Regular Budget, which 
should not prevent Member States so wishing from making voluntary contributions. 

11. The proposed protocol to amend the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material would be an essential element of the international communityÂs response to the threat 
of nuclear terrorism. Her country hoped the negotiations on that instrument could be swiftly 
concluded so that a diplomatic conference could be held soon. 
12. The Spanish Government, in view of the importance of security of nuclear facilities, had 
already adopted a number of measures to address scenarios in which security might be 
compromised. Spain was participating in international activities to prevent nuclear terrorism, 
and had established a working group of relevant national institutions to carry out in-depth 
analysis of the current situation and consider potential future action. 
13. Spain welcomed the recent elaboration of the conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards, and its adoption by the Board of Governors. However, the slow progress with the 
signature and ratification of additional protocols was, unfortunately, calling into question the 
universality and, consequently, the efficiency and effectiveness of the new safeguards system. 
Furthermore, the delay in the application of integrated safeguards would worsen the already 
difficult financial situation of the Department of Safeguards, since it would prevent the 
planned reduction in routine inspections from being implemented. 
14. In that connection, voluntary contributions, within certain limits and in line with the 
relevant criteria, helped make the Agency more effective; indeed, extrabudgetary 
contributions seemed to be the right approach for funding safeguards activities in 
nuclear-weapon States. However, the current excessive reliance on voluntary contributions 
was obviously undesirable and needed to be corrected both gradually and in the medium term. 
The savings to be made from implementing integrated safeguards and potential new measures 
to rationalize the safeguards system should make up for additional new costs. Spain looked 
forward to seeing the safeguards funding proposals for 2004-2005 that the Director General 
would shortly be drawing up. 
15. Her country welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts in the fields of nuclear safety, radiation 
protection and waste management. The Agency had a particularly useful role to play in the 
area of nuclear safety, as could be seen in the various missions to Spanish nuclear power 
plants. The recent OSART mission to the Santa MarÃ­a de GaroÃ±a plant had involved a major 
effort, confirming the maximum priority that Spain accorded to safety at its facilities. 
16. The second meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had 
been held in April 2002. Two features of the Convention were particularly fruitful: the 
self-assessment element, which prompted Contracting Parties to reflect on their nuclear safety 
status; and the opportunity it provided for broad-based, open information exchange. The 
Convention had also helped reduce the number of incidents since 1999 worldwide, as could 
be seen in the Annual Report for 2001. Her country had voluntarily made a number of 
commitments at the review meeting. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 6 

17. With regard to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, she expressed the hope that, following the 
submission of national reports, there would be a frank debate demonstrating a determination 
to grant that issue the highest priority. The positive outcome of the review meetings pursuant 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety should serve as a good example and help promote 
transparency and information exchange. 
18. During the recent Spanish presidency of the EU, agreement had been reached that the 
high standards of nuclear safety required in the EU should also be applied to candidate 
countries. However, there was still a need to harmonize minimum nuclear safety criteria in an 
expanded EU. Spain appreciated and supported the AgencyÂs initiatives in that area. 
19. With regard to radiation protection, her country strongly supported the AgencyÂs 
initiatives to improve the monitoring and management of radiation sources. During its EU 
presidency Spain had proposed a Council resolution, adopted in May 2002, for the 
establishment of national surveillance and monitoring systems to detect the presence of 
radioactive materials during metal recycling, a step which her country had already taken. The 
Spanish Government had organized seminars in Seville in January 2002 on how to prevent the 
radiation risk from metal recycling, which had been attended by over 60 participants. 
20. The Board had recently adopted the International Action Plan for the Radiological 
Protection of Patients, which was based on the recommendations and conclusions of the 
International Conference on Radiological Protection of Patients in Diagnostic and 
Interventional Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Radiotherapy, held in Malaga in 
March 2001. In addition to hosting that Conference, Spain had actively participated in the 
technical discussions, and later in drawing up the draft action plan. It welcomed the adoption 
of the latter by the Board and was willing to provide assistance to other countries based on its 
experience in that field. 
21. She welcomed the increase in the funding available for technical co-operation activities 
and in extrabudgetary contributions, which reflected the importance Member States attached 
to those activities. Spain was making intensive efforts to increase its TCF contribution. In 
addition, it had contributed $355 000 to footnote-a/ projects over the preceding year and made 
contributions in kind. 
22. Nuclear energy continued to hold a significant place in SpainÂs energy supply, helping 
diversify supply sources, reduce dependency on foreign energy supplies and control 
greenhouse gas emissions. In 2001, Spanish nuclear power plants had produced 
63 715 GWÂ·h, representing 26.9% of total national energy production and approximately half 
of primary domestic energy production in the country. 
23. Spanish nuclear power plant operation was entirely satisfactory both in terms of safety 
and availability. Moreover, radiological environmental monitoring had shown a decrease in 
liquid and gaseous discharges over the preceding few years. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 7 

24. Construction of the spent fuel temporary storage facility at the Trillo nuclear power 
plant was complete. The first two storage containers had been placed in the facility, which 
would provide for the storage of SpainÂs spent nuclear fuel until 2013. 
25. The VandellÃ³s I nuclear power plant was still being dismantled and over 90% of the 
work required to reach level 2 had been completed. That stage was expected to be reached in 
December, when approximately 80% of the site would be available for other uses. The plant 
would then be totally dismantled some 30 years later. The Spanish Government had offered 
to make available an area near to the site for the ITER project. 
26. Mr. ANTONIONE (Italy) welcomed the AgencyÂs action plan on terrorism and 
said his country was currently studying how best to contribute to it. It also supported the 
launch of the G-8 Global Partnership, which was an important tool for preventing terrorists 
from acquiring or developing nuclear or radiological weapons. Italy was ready to work with 
interested countries to co-ordinate, implement and finance counter-terrorism initiatives and 
had reacted promptly on the domestic side by adjusting its legislation and making a 
commitment to supporting the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database programme. 
27. The Italian Government attached great importance to activities related to the 
implementation of the NPT, and to the early entry into force of the CTBT and the 
establishment of the related verification regime. A strengthened safeguards system was vital 
to international peace and security and Italy remained committed to completing the national 
procedures for ratification of its additional protocol within the coming months. The 
competent national authorities were undertaking the necessary preparatory activities for the 
future implementation of the protocol. 
28. New statutory obligations in the safeguards area placed an increased financial burden on 
the Agency, and full implementation of integrated safeguards would need time to reach a 
steady state. During that phase the Agency would have to pay increasing attention to the 
qualitative aspect of safeguards activities and to the signature and ratification of additional 
protocols. In the meantime, implementation of the conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards should help achieve cost efficiency in safeguards activities and greater 
effectiveness. 
29. Italy attached the utmost importance to the universality of the NPT and 
non-proliferation efforts and was therefore disappointed that the Agency was still unable to 
verify the correctness and completeness of the initial declaration of nuclear material made by 
the DPRK. He also urged the Iraqi authorities to fulfil their obligations and allow the Agency 
to implement its mandate under the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, 
which was a prerequisite for returning to a normal situation. 
30. Nuclear safety was of paramount importance for EU Member States. The positive 
outcome of the second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety had confirmed the great contribution that Convention could make to the 
enhancement of nuclear safety worldwide. Italy also attached great importance to research 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 8 

reactor safety and appreciated the efforts made by the Agency in preparing a code of conduct 
for such reactors. 

31. Furthermore, it was in the process of ratifying the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radiation Waste Management and aimed to 
become a contracting party before the first review meeting in November 2003. 
32. He welcomed the efforts made by the Agency to situate its technical co-operation 
programme in the context of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework and 
poverty reduction strategies wherever possible, and expressed the hope that, in future, the 
Agency would refine the selection and design of its numerous projects, sharpening the focus 
of the programme. 
33. Through UNESCO, Italy contributed over 80% of the budget for the Abdus Salam 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, in which the Agency also played an 
important and commendable role. The Centre carried out programmes aimed at promoting 
international co-operation among scientists from all countries to bridge the scientific and 
technological gap between North and South. 
34. The AgencyÂs increasing reliance on extrabudgetary resources, for example to fund 
safeguards activities, was cause for concern because it directly affected the control Member 
States had over the budget, making strategic planning difficult and less efficient. Italy 
supported the efforts of some Member States to restructure the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and 
to reconsider priorities in order to reduce the gap between the tasks assigned and the available 
resources. There was still room for further economies and increased efficiency. 
35. Italy held sixth place among the major contributors to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and 
honoured its financial commitments on time every year. It expected that commitment to be 
reflected by more careful consideration in the SecretariatÂs recruitment policy. For the 
recruitment of high-level and senior staff, in particular, more transparent selection criteria 
would benefit management and would eventually lead to a greater spirit of ownership and 
participation among Member States. 
36. In conclusion, his country remained committed to supporting the Agency in its three 
main areas of activity and in finding ways to cope with its financial difficulties, with a view to 
ensuring that its programmes were fully responsive to high-priority needs. 
37. Ms. MELIN (Sweden) said that the tragic events of 11 September 2001 had 
underlined the importance of international co-operation to combat common threats. There was 
an urgent need to strengthen the international framework and multilateral instruments in the 
field of non-proliferation, disarmament and arms control, and to promote universal adherence 
to and effective implementation of those instruments, since international and national security 
depended on them. The NPT was the foundation for nuclear disarmament and should include 
all States. She welcomed the announcement by Cuba that it intended to accede to the NPT, 
and called on the three remaining States to accede to the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States 
and place their facilities under Agency comprehensive safeguards. It was important to make 
clear progress in that regard before the next NPT Review Conference. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 9 

38. Additional protocols were an integral part of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and 
Sweden was of the opinion that adherence to them was mandatory for a State Party to fulfil its 
obligations under Article III of the NPT. Her country had completed its internal ratification 
procedure and its additional protocol would enter into force as soon as the few remaining EU 
countries had ratified. She urged all States to conclude and bring into force additional 
protocols, and called upon the 50 State Parties to the NPT which had not yet concluded and 
brought into force their mandatory safeguards agreement to do so without delay. She also 
commended the Secretariat on its efforts to encourage Member States to conclude additional 
protocols, which were clearly bearing fruit. 
39. Equally, it was important that the nuclear-weapon States place fissile material 
designated by them as being no longer required for military purposes under Agency and other 
relevant international verification as soon as was practicable. 
40. Document INFCIRC/549 set out guidelines for the responsible management of 
plutonium in all peaceful nuclear activities. Sweden had decided to adopt a policy consistent 
with those guidelines and a Note Verbale to the Director General to that effect was being 
prepared. 
41. An effective national regime for the physical protection of nuclear material was 
essential to prevent diversion of such material and to protect nuclear facilities from sabotage. 
Her country supported the ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material, in particular the negotiations on the adoption of a well defined 
amendment to the Convention to extend its scope to cover domestic use, storage and transport 
of nuclear material, and protection against sabotage. She expressed the hope that the drafting 
of that amendment could be concluded at the next expert group meeting. 
42. Sweden strongly supported the AgencyÂs efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear 
material and radiation sources and had decided to donate 100 000 Swedish kronor to that 
programme. It remained convinced that a combination of national and Agency efforts was the 
best way to combat nuclear terrorism. 
43. The second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety had been held in April 2002. The improvement in the quality of the national reports 
submitted for review was encouraging, as were the significant safety improvements achieved 
in several countries. Her country was equally convinced that the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management had 
great potential for bringing about safety improvements and it looked forward to the first 
review meeting under that Convention which was scheduled for 3-14 November 2003. 
44. Sweden continued to support initiatives aimed at enhancing the application of the safety 
standards developed by the Agency. She commended the quality of the revised nuclear safety 
standards, and the results achieved in the fields of reactor safety and safety of radioactive 
waste management. Orphan radiation sources were an increasing problem and were causing a 
high number of fatal accidents. They were also prone to illicit trafficking and other criminal 
activities. The Agency had achieved laudable results in assisting Member States to resolve 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 10 

that problem, in particular through the implementation of the revised Action Plan for the 
Safety and Security of Radiation Sources and the action taken to revise the Code of Conduct 
on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 

45. The SecretariatÂs drive towards fewer, and thus larger projects had resulted in more 
focused delivery of the technical co-operation programme. Her country strongly supported 
that programme and played an active part in its implementation by providing national experts 
for safety missions and opportunities for scientific visits and training courses in Sweden. She 
noted with satisfaction that the successful Model Projects on strengthening of Member StatesÂ 
regulatory infrastructures had recently been supplemented by similar efforts to upgrade the 
security of radiation sources. 
46. In recognition of the importance her country attached to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
activities, it had pledged its full share to the TCF for 2003. Sweden had repeatedly 
maintained that the first priority with regard to ensuring predictable funding of those activities 
should be to close the gap between the target and actual contributions to the TCF. She 
therefore urged all Member States to pledge and pay their target shares in full and on time, 
and noted with concern that outstanding assessed programme costs currently amounted to 
almost $8 million, indicating a lack of government commitment. 
47. Mr. MONTOYA (Peru) said that, over the preceding year, with Government and 
Agency support, the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute (IPEN) had begun to draw up a 
strategic medium- and long-term plan, which would enable the existing infrastructure of the 
Oscar MirÃ³ Quesada de la Guerra RACSO nuclear centre to be used to promote and diversify 
research into and development of nuclear applications in areas such as materials 
characterization, conservation of PeruÂs extensive archaeological heritage, environmental 
protection and efficient use of water resources. In that connection, improvements had been 
made to the centre, such as the installation and commissioning of a secondary standards 
dosimetry laboratory to provide support for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases and various 
industrial and mining applications. 
48. Owing to the requirements of strategic partners and the national market, IPEN had had 
to investigate new technological application areas with a view to making the production and 
services sector more efficient and competitive. Various mechanisms were being used to 
achieve that objective, such as improving the academic qualifications of scientists and 
technicians, recruitment of experts in nuclear and related fields and training of management 
staff in strategic planning. 
49. Thanks to the rapid assistance provided by the Agency following a fire in Lima the 
preceding December, specialized staff had been trained and a gamma irradiator was on order 
for the IPEN tissue bank. Measures had been taken to help meet the demand for 
radiosterilized tissue. 
50. As part of efforts to expand agriculture in the country, two new varieties of barley and 
kiwicha which had been improved using nuclear techniques would be made available to 
farmers. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 11 

51. In the area of medical applications, IPEN had extended its activities to other hospital 
centres, entrusting them with the national co-ordination of various projects under ARCAL. 
52. In the important field of the dissemination and promotion of nuclear science, IPEN and 
national research institutions, with Agency support, had organized a scientific meeting which 
had been attended by over 600 researchers from Peru and other countries, with the aim of 
analysing and proposing solutions to national development problems from a scientific and 
technological point of view. Those activities were supported by the Peruvian government and 
would continue in January 2003 with an international scientific meeting. Peruvian institutions 
and researchers had also concluded research contracts with the Agency in areas of special 
importance for the country such as the control and eradication of foot-and-mouth disease, 
improvements in the SIT, prevention of neonatal hydronephrosis, evaluation of teletherapy 
methods, improvement of milk production, the determination of traces of heavy metals in 
agricultural products, and determination of lead and cadmium contamination in pregnant 
women living in mining areas. 
53. The country had organized several international events, notably regional training 
courses on a variety of subjects and project co-ordination meetings. Apart from national 
projects, the Agency had also assisted with the Peru-Chile project on eradication of the fruit 
fly; nuclear medicine services in the Peru-Ecuador border region had been strengthened, and a 
Peruvian and Bolivian project on pollution of Lake Titicaca had been completed during the 
year. 
54. The third meeting of the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination Board had been held in Lima 
in May 2002. Peru was currently chairing that body, would be soon be chairing the board of 
representatives and was firmly committed to strengthening ARCAL in preparation for the 
drawing up of the regional co-operation plan for 2005-2010. His country had also 
participated in interregional technical co-operation projects between developing countries. 
55. Peru was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it had received from it. Thirty 
international experts had visited the country over the preceding year, as well as Agency staff; 
over 70 Peruvian professionals had received training; national counterparts had benefited 
from the supply of equipment and materials. 
56. He noted with satisfaction that the Agency had completed the conceptual framework for 
integrated safeguards. The Safeguards Implementation Report for 2001 had concluded that all 
material subject to safeguards had remained in peaceful uses. The Agency had not found any 
discrepancies in the safeguards reports that his country had submitted, or any evidence of 
undeclared activities or diversion of safeguarded material. 
57. It was more important than ever that Member States sign and implement comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols in order to make the integrated safeguards 
regime universal and verification tasks easier. As the first Latin American country to have 
ratified an additional protocol, Peru had hosted a regional seminar to promote the additional 
protocol in Latin America and the Caribbean. The meeting had been attended by 47 delegates 
at director level or above from bodies responsible for nuclear programmes from 26 of the 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 12 

States party to the Tlatelolco Treaty, and two observers from the United States Department of 
Energy. He welcomed the subsequent decision by the Governments of Chile, Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay to sign and ratify an additional 
protocol. 

58. As was recognized in the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards, and recent initiatives to 
protect against the threat of nuclear terrorism, security was a prerequisite for technological 
safety and both those areas needed to be strengthened simultaneously. In doing so, particular 
attention should be paid to the transport of radioactive material and the disposal of radioactive 
waste. He welcomed the fact that, owing to budgetary problems and problems with the 
availability of developing countries, the Agency had allowed for remote input to its 
committees which reviewed safety standards, making for a better geographical and political 
representation. Four Peruvian experts had been included in those arrangements. 
59. Though Peru did not possess any nuclear power facilities, in the interests of greater 
transparency it had submitted a report on the safety of its two research reactors to the second 
review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and was 
following with interest the work on a code of conduct for such reactors. 
60. His country had also participated in the work on the amendment of the Convention on 
the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and had promulgated physical protection 
regulations based on Agency guidelines. It was party to several other related conventions and 
felt that more efforts should be made to increase the number of States party to such 
instruments; the international liability regime, in particular, required substantial improvement. 
In that connection, the publication by the Agency of safety requirements for preparedness for 
and response to a nuclear or radiological emergency was timely and he urged Member States 
to implement them. 
61. With a view to preventing emergency situations and providing assistance, where 
necessary, the Agency should play a major role in establishing consultation, notification and 
information exchange mechanisms for international shipments of radioactive material. Peru 
had welcomed the invitation to participate in the TranSAS mission to the United Kingdom 
and hoped that missions of that type, with the participation of international observers, would 
become more frequent. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that the draft resolution on 
transport safety before the Conference would be adopted by consensus, facilitating the work 
of the international conference on that subject to be held in July 2003. 
62. Mr. STEINMANN (Switzerland), speaking also on behalf of Liechtenstein, said 
that nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation were crucial to international security and no 
effort should be spared to achieve those objectives while there were still disparities in the 
world nuclear order and a risk of horizontal or vertical nuclear proliferation. The AgencyÂs 
important role in that area had been emphasized once again during the first session of the 
Preparatory Committee of the 2005 NPT Review Conference. 
63. The financial constraints affecting all countries, and the AgencyÂs growing operational 
costs had led to major internal rationalization and reorganization. Recently, a group of 
countries had suggested hiring a private management consultancy firm to pursue those efforts. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 13 

However, that did not solve the main problem, i.e. the need to set clear priorities, lack of 
which was causing a high level of core activities unfunded by the Regular Budget. Moreover, 
new and often crucial tasks were being entrusted to the Secretariat with the cautious proviso 
Âwithin the limits of available resourcesÂ. One of the AgencyÂs main statutory tasks -
technical co-operation - was not even financed from the Regular Budget. A balance needed to 
be established between high-priority activities and available resources, otherwise funding of 
targeted statutory activities from extrabudgetary resources would continue to increase and 
more and more Member States would lose interest in the AgencyÂs operations, which would 
be damaging to the Agency and its aims. 

64. The Secretariat had recently expressed its concerns over safeguards financing. The two 
principal aims of developing the integrated safeguards system had been to provide for better 
monitoring of compliance by parties to the NPT with their obligations, and to achieve a 
reduction in the cost and effort involved in safeguards. Already, additional resources were 
needed to set up the new system, and it seemed it would not be easy to predict how many 
inspectors or what equipment would be needed to move from the existing systems to 
integrated safeguards. And as yet, around 30% of the worldÂs civil nuclear reactors were still 
not subject to Agency control, to say nothing of nuclear weapons arsenals! 
65. Currently there were seven States in which the Agency had concluded on at least two 
occasions that all nuclear material was subject to safeguards and being used in peaceful 
activities. The Secretariat should develop and apply integrated safeguards in some of those 
States, which would provide the cost-effectiveness data required to predict the consequences 
of applying the system universally. In addition, other ways of reducing the inspection burden 
should be explored, concentrating on the most probable risks. 
66. Switzerland had always taken very seriously the need to protect its nuclear facilities 
against external attack. Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Government 
had reviewed security precautions at its nuclear facilities and discussed the issue with 
neighbouring States. His Government supported the AgencyÂs proposed activities to protect 
against nuclear terrorism but felt that, in view of the priority Member States attached to them, 
the funding for them should be included in the Regular Budget as of 2004-2005. 
67. In the research and development field, Switzerland was participating actively in INPRO, 
providing staff and facilities from Swiss universities and the Paul Scherrer Institute. His 
Government welcomed the fact that INPRO shared the objectives of the Generation IV 
International Forum, i.e. developing nuclear systems and fuel cycles which would make 
nuclear energy both renewable and sustainable, although it was seeking to achieve them by 
entirely different routes. Switzerland had also joined the latter initiative in February 2002. 
68. The AgencyÂs expertise in monitoring radioactive pollutants in the marine environment 
was well known, but its Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco also monitored 
non-radioactive pollutants. Some consideration should be given to how those resources could 
best be used to ensure the safety of the marine environment in the long term. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 14 

69. SwitzerlandÂs recent accession to the United Nations showed its desire to play its part in 
international politics. 
70. The first consignments of vitrified waste from the reprocessing of fuel elements sent to 
the La Hague reprocessing plant in France had been stored at the countryÂs interim storage 
facility. A plasma torch was being installed to reduce the volume of low-level waste. The 
improvement in radiation safety in the transport of nuclear waste noted in the preceding year 
had been maintained. The Secretariat should consider developing an international framework 
for the transport and storage of high-level radioactive waste, since the Agency was the 
organization most fitted to study the legal and institutional aspects of that issue. 
71. Partly in response to two referendum proposals calling for the closure of the countryÂs 
existing nuclear power plants, a controversial draft law on nuclear energy had been submitted 
to the Swiss Parliament which would allow the building of new plants with no a priori 
restriction on their operating life and prohibit the reprocessing of nuclear fuel once the 
existing contracts had expired. The Swiss people would probably be called upon to give their 
opinion on the two referendum initiatives and the draft law in the coming year. On 
22 September, the population of the canton of Nidwald would have the opportunity to vote on 
the drilling of a tunnel at Wellenberg to serve as a storage facility for low- and 
intermediate-level waste. If the decision went against the scheme, disposal of those types of 
waste could be held up for several decades. 
72. Mr. SHOUKRY (Egypt) said that, since becoming a member of the Agency 
in 1957, his country had been actively participating in all its activities promoting the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy. It was following with interest the application of the one-house concept 
to improve the efficiency of the AgencyÂs programmes and co-ordination of its three main 
areas of activity: technology, verification and safety. The AgencyÂs achievements over the 
years had enhanced Member StatesÂ confidence in its ability to discharge its statutory 
responsibilities while coping with change and meeting new challenges, and he called upon the 
international community to assist the Agency to carry out its work in the best way possible. 
Maintaining a balance between its various activities was vital for it to retain its credibility and 
ensure the continued commitment of Member States. 
73. The world was facing challenges in the areas of energy supplies for sustainable 
development, protection of the environment and combating of climate change, water and food 
supplies and health. Egypt therefore attached importance to the strengthening of technical 
co-operation with the Agency. It had installed its second research reactor with a view to 
developing self-reliance in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in agriculture, industry, 
medicine and research. With the assistance of the Russian Federation and the Agency, it had 
set up a cyclotron, which was to be commissioned shortly, to obtain radioisotopes for use in 
medicine, enhancement of crop production, improvement of the desert environment and 
improving animal production. Its co-operation with the Agency covered, inter alia, irradiation 
of food and surgical instruments, the establishment of a radiation dosimetry laboratory and 
control of the fruit fly using the SIT. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 15 

74. Belonging to both the Arab and the African region, Egypt had made its scientific and 
technical expertise, and its laboratories and facilities available to both those regions. During 
the preceding year, with the help of the Agency, it had organized a number of training 
seminars, scientific visits and workshops in the areas of food security, human health, nuclear 
safety and seawater desalination which had attracted wide participation from Arab and 
African States. It would continue to strengthen such co-operation at the regional level to 
enhance the potential of Arab and African countries. In that context, his country continued to 
attach great importance to AFRA and the PATTEC initiative. 
75. Greater efforts were needed on the part of the Agency to ensure that all nuclear 
installations which were not as yet covered by international safeguards were placed under 
international control. It was unacceptable that a minority of States should remain 
unaccountable. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system was the main pillar of the 
global non-proliferation regime but, unless that system was universally applied, efforts to 
strengthen its would not attain the aim of eliminating the danger of nuclear proliferation. 
76. Egypt had launched a number of initiatives at regional and international level to counter 
the increasing danger of nuclear proliferation. In 1974, it had first called for the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, an appeal that had been repeated several 
times since. Through the Agency, it had continued to call for the application of 
comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East without discrimination. 
Nevertheless, Israel had shown no serious desire to deal with the issue and continued to refuse 
to allow Agency comprehensive safeguards to be applied at its nuclear facilities. That attitude 
had a negative effect on nuclear non-proliferation efforts in general, and in the Middle East in 
particular. 
77. It was incumbent on the international community to ensure that uniform standards were 
applied in the non-proliferation field. His country had supported the suggestion put forward 
during the 44th regular session of the General Conference for the convening of a forum to 
allow countries in the Middle East to benefit from the experience of the other regions in the 
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones and had put forward detailed ideas concerning 
the establishment of such a zone in the region. 
78. With regard to Iraq, Egypt had on many occasions stressed the importance of that 
countryÂs full compliance with all relevant Security Council resolutions. IraqÂs acceptance of 
the return of United Nations inspectors should facilitate the unconditional resumption of work 
pursuant to those resolutions and promote stability in the Middle East. It also showed the 
usefulness and effectiveness of the international communityÂs concerted efforts to deal with 
such challenges. He expressed the hope that agreement would soon be reached on practical 
procedures for the early return of the inspectors so that the economic sanctions would be lifted 
and the suffering of the Iraqi people ended. 
79. The events of 11 September 2001 had demonstrated the urgent need to strengthen the 
AgencyÂs activities and programmes on the protection of nuclear material and facilities from 
the dangers of nuclear terrorism. Concerted national, regional and international efforts were 
needed to meet the serious challenges posed by terrorism to international stability and 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 16 

security. As long as there was nuclear material not subject to international control, there 
would be a danger of such material falling into terrorist hands. Egypt had been actively 
involved in the development of the proposed additional activities and measures to protect 
against nuclear terrorism. In that process, certain criteria needed to be borne in mind. For 
instance, the proposed Agency measures should not replace measures in place at national 
level, nor should StatesÂ responsibility for dealing with security-related problems diminish. 
Moreover, the financing of such activities should be voluntary and should not be allowed to 
impact negatively on technical co-operation activities. 

80. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme was an effective means of promoting 
socio-economic development in developing countries, which was one of the AgencyÂs 
statutory activities. He welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to update its technical co-operation 
strategy. However, attainment of technical co-operation objectives was dependent upon the 
availability of qualified human resources and sufficient, assured funding. His country 
regularly paid its share of the TCF. However, the Technical Co-operation Report for 2001 
revealed that 55 States had not pledged any contribution to that Fund in 2001 and that 
11 States had failed to honour their pledges. Such a situation placed serious constraints on the 
implementation of approved programmes. Since all States had participated in the negotiations 
on the target for the Fund, his country considered that they had an obligation to contribute. 
He therefore urged Member States to discharge their financial obligations in accordance with 
the rate of attainment mechanism established at the 44th regular session of the General 
Conference. 
81. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland) emphasized the need for an integrated global 
response to the threat of nuclear terrorism which minimized the possibility of attacks on 
nuclear facilities and of misuse of radioactive material. The Agency had a central role to play 
in that regard by promoting international co-operation, and by creating and strengthening 
international instruments and encouraging Member States to accede to them. One such 
example was the ongoing work on the proposed amendment to the Convention on the 
Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. 
82. The number of countries which had concluded and ratified safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols was growing yearly, although it was still below expectations. Poland, 
whose additional protocol had been in force since 2000, urged all States which had not yet 
done so to join the AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system as soon as possible. It also 
supported the development and further implementation of integrated safeguards. In addition, 
his country had completed ratification of the CTBT and attached great importance to its entry 
into force. 
83. The Agency also played a leading role in elaborating and implementing legal 
instruments in the fields of nuclear and radiation safety and radioactive waste safety. Poland 
was a party to all conventions in those fields and appreciated the action taken by the Agency 
in response to the preceding yearÂs General Conference resolutions on that issue. Polish 
representatives had participated actively in the preparatory meeting for the Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, and in the second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety. Both Conventions contributed greatly to the strengthening of global 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 17 

safety, but there was still much to do in that field. His country thus looked forward to the 
international conference on safe transport of radioactive material to be held in 2003, and to 
the continuation of work on the development of a research reactor safety enhancement plan. 

84. Poland shared the SecretariatÂs concern over the implications of a potential loss of 
knowledge caused by ageing of the nuclear workforce and decreasing support for university 
programmes in nuclear science and engineering. That phenomenon was unfortunately 
pronounced in countries like his own where the future of the nuclear power programme was 
ill-defined. Adequate levels of nuclear safety and security could not be maintained without 
proper education, research and development. His country therefore fully supported the 
AgencyÂs activities relating to the preservation of nuclear knowledge. 
85. He thanked the Agency and the Government of France for the help they had provided in 
connection with an incident at a Polish oncology centre; some patients who had been 
overexposed in the course of therapy had also been treated in France. That was a good 
example of co-operation under the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear 
Accident or Radiological Emergency. 
86. With regard to technical co-operation, his country was aware of the AgencyÂs difficult 
economic situation and strongly supported further initiatives involving cost-sharing, 
outsourcing and other forms of partnership in development implemented by the Secretariat in 
consultation with Member States. Such efforts could help increase the efficiency of technical 
co-operation and attract new intergovernmental and non-governmental partners. Application 
of the central criterion was a further step towards improving integration of technical 
co-operation projects into national development plans. In that context, it was important to 
requesting countries that technically justified projects which could not immediately receive 
funding from the TCF were classified as footnote-a/ projects since, as well as leaving open the 
possibility that the projects in question could be taken up by other interested Member States, 
that was often essential in enabling the institution involved to continue its efforts to find 
additional funds from other sources either from within or outside the country. 
87. Poland strongly supported a regional technical co-operation programme for Europe. 
Good examples of successful projects in the region were those on the safe operation of 
nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe and the project on physical protection and security of 
nuclear material. Like many other countries in the region, his country was both a donor and a 
recipient and had actively participated in regional and interregional activities, organizing 
training courses, workshops and technical meetings, and offering its research centres for 
training under the auspices of the Agency. With a view to providing better assistance to other 
Member States, Poland had submitted a proposal to the Secretariat in the preceding year that 
the Central Tissue Bank at the Medical University of Warsaw be added to the list of regional 
resource centres in Europe. 
88. The financing of technical co-operation activities should be assured, sufficient and 
predictable, and both donor and recipient Member States should demonstrate their 
commitment to the programme by pledging and paying their TCF target shares and their 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 18 

assessed programme costs in full and on time. Poland strongly supported the application of 
the due account principle and, as ever, it was ready to pledge and pay its share of the target. 

89. He commended the Agency for its public information policy and thanked the Secretariat 
for issuing the Nuclear Technology Review 2002. He also commended the Agency for its 
promotional activities in Johannesburg during the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development which had contributed to global awareness of the AgencyÂs work by 
highlighting the contribution of nuclear applications to human health, agricultural 
productivity, water management, environmental protection and energy production. Poland 
had recently ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In November, a regional public information seminar 
would be held in the country, organized under the auspices of the Agency, to promote the 
benefits of nuclear energy. 
90. In conclusion, he noted that Poland had now completed the ratification procedure for the 
latest two amendments to the AgencyÂs Statute. 
91. Mr. EGLAJS (Latvia) said that the Latvian Radiation Safety Centre had been 
established in July 2001, since which time it had expanded and developed its capacity to 
perform all the tasks imposed upon it by the Latvian Parliament. 
92. His country was working closely with the Department of Technical Co-operation to 
enhance co-operation and transfer of experience in priority areas. As in previous years, 
Latvia had pledged its full share of the TCF. For several years it had also been making 
additional voluntary contributions for priority national projects and engaging in cost-sharing. 
In line with its Country Programme Framework, Latvia had submitted a request for a 
technical co-operation project involving feasibility studies on the use of positron emission 
tomography. Under the relevant regional technical co-operation project, it had enhanced the 
knowledge of its medical experts and upgraded its main cancer treatment centre. 
93. Having gained experience in a number of new activities during 2002, his country had 
initiated international bidding for the full-scale decommissioning and dismantling of its 
research reactor and expected to sign a contract before the end of the year. The first important 
step that had to be completed in 2003 was spent fuel management. An environmental impact 
assessment was being conducted. 
94. The first peer review under the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management was approaching and 
Latvia was working on its radioactive waste management strategy, which included activities 
to enhance the radioactive waste management system which had been in operation for more 
than forty years. His country wished to establish new long-term storage for disused sealed 
sources and was ready to start feasibility studies for deep geological disposal. The lack of any 
international solution for disposal of long-lived sources, and the small quantities of high-level 
waste involved, left small countries with no other option but to investigate the possibility of 
geological disposal. His country would strongly support any activity aimed at providing an 
internationally accepted solution. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 19 

95. LatviaÂs past activities had shown clearly that it viewed non-proliferation as a high 
priority. Combating of illicit trafficking in radioactive and nuclear material and of nuclear 
and radiological terrorism could serve as a good basis for co-operation, as those issues were 
of importance for both developing and developed countries. LatviaÂs first national report 
under its additional protocol had been submitted to the Agency in May 2002. Finally, his 
country was deeply grateful to those countries that were providing assistance in the fields of 
non-proliferation and combating of terrorism, in particular Denmark, Sweden and the United 
States of America. 
96. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey) said that the recent World Summit on Sustainable 
Development in Johannesburg had set numerous targets and timetables for action on a wide 
range of issues, including a number which could be addressed using nuclear science and 
technology. Provided it was given the necessary means, the Agency was well placed to 
contribute to the implementation of those initiatives, which included many aspects covered by 
Agenda 21 and the United Nations Millennium Declaration. 
97. Turkey fully endorsed the objectives of INPRO, namely to support the safe, sustainable, 
cost-effective and proliferation-resistant use of nuclear technology to meet the energy needs 
of the 21st century, and had noted with appreciation the progress made by INPRO Member 
States and the Agency over the preceding year in implementing the project. His country 
welcomed the recent publication of a joint study on innovative nuclear reactor development 
by the Agency, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organization for Economic Co-operation 
and Development, and the International Energy Agency, and supported all efforts to enhance 
co-operation between INPRO and the Generation IV initiative. 
98. His country had always supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the nonproliferation 
regime and verification mechanisms. In that connection, it noted with 
satisfaction the AgencyÂs conclusion that nuclear material and other items placed under 
safeguards had remained in peaceful activities or were adequately accounted for in 2001. 
However, that did not guarantee immunity from the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation and 
the universal application of Agency safeguards was of paramount importance. Turkey had 
already concluded an additional protocol with the Agency and had made its initial declaration. 
Overall progress with regard to the conclusion and entry into force of safeguards agreements 
and additional protocols remained slow. The AgencyÂs safeguards regime was a main 
supporting pillar of global efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the 
failure of the DPRK to implement fully its safeguards agreement with the Agency was a 
source of serious concern. 
99. Turkey had repeatedly called on Iraq to allow the resumption of United Nations 
inspections and to implement in full all relevant Security Council resolutions. IraqÂs recent 
decision to allow the unconditional return of United Nations weapons inspectors could be a 
step in the right direction, and he expressed the hope that the Government of Iraq would fully 
co-operate with the United Nations to fulfil all its obligations under the relevant Security 
Council resolutions without delay.

100. With respect to further activities in support of the non-proliferation regime, his country 
had been actively participating in the open-ended expert meetings which had been working on 
a possible widening of the scope of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material to include domestic use, storage and transport. It hoped a consensus would soon be 
reached on a draft protocol to amend the Convention. It had also recently applied to take 
advantage of the AgencyÂs International Physical Protection Advisory Service in 2003, with a 
view to evaluating its national regulations and applications in the field of physical protection 
of nuclear material and nuclear facilities. 
101. Another related issue was the fight against illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive 
material, in which area Turkey was continuing to upgrade its capabilities. A number of 
Turkish border points were already equipped with radiation detection systems, and 
installations at others were planned as part of an ongoing joint project with the United States 
of America. 
102. Following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the Agency and its Member States 
had responded promptly to the threat of nuclear terrorism, and the lessons learned had been 
embodied in the AgencyÂs planned programme. The transnational nature of terrorism put all 
nations in jeopardy. It was no secret that terrorists had long been trying to acquire nuclear 
weapons and material, and co-operation at international and regional level to counter the 
threat was more vital than ever. To that end, his country had pledged a number of in-kind 
contributions in support of the AgencyÂs programme in that area. It had offered the facilities 
of the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority for regional training courses and seminars organized 
by the Agency, and had offered to organize training programmes and provide experts in the 
fields of radiation protection and illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. 
Furthermore, it had offered the use of the Ãekmece Nuclear Research and Training CentreÂs 
laboratories for sample preparation and destructive analysis of seized nuclear material. 
103. There could be no doubt that the credibility of nuclear technology was very much 
dependent on the strength of safety measures. Turkey welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to 
promote nuclear safety worldwide and was pleased with the progress being made in revising 
the safety standards. 
104. Orphan radiation sources posed a serious threat to public health and carried the risk of 
misuse for potential malicious acts. The problem therefore required prompt attention and 
international co-operation to establish preventative measures for responding to radiological 
emergencies. 
105. In the field of human health and safety, his country strongly supported the International 
Action Plan for the Radiological Protection of Patients and welcomed the implementation of 
the revised Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources. Turkey had actively 
participated in the international action plan developed for the radiological emergency in 
Georgia, and had provided portable radiation detectors and cost-free experts for training 
activities held in Tbilisi. 
106. Another important priority area was the safe transport of nuclear and radioactive 
material. Turkey welcomed the progress made in that area, as envisaged in General 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 21 

Conference resolution GC(45)/RES/10 B, and the agreement reached on the programme for 
the international conference on that subject to be held in 2003. He also encouraged the 
Director General to report the results of that conference to the 47th regular session of the 
General Conference. TranSAS missions were very important for evaluating national 
regulations and helped create an atmosphere of confidence. At his countryÂs request, the 
Secretariat had organized a pre-mission to Turkey in October 2001 and a TranSAS mission 
was scheduled for 2003. 

107. His country had been actively participating in the AgencyÂs regional project on 
harmonization and strengthening of regional preparedness for and response to nuclear 
emergencies, and had evaluated and restructured its organizational and legal infrastructure in 
the light of Agency recommendations and international experience. With a view to 
strengthening regional early notification capabilities, Turkey had signed bilateral early 
notification agreements with some neighbouring countries and was continuing negotiations 
with others, in addition to initiating a similar agreement among Black Sea Economic 
Co-operation Organization countries. 
108. An area of continuing concern was the safety of research reactors and, in that regard, he 
welcomed the AgencyÂs initiation of a range of measures aimed at establishing a 
comprehensive, internationally accepted regime. His country had participated actively in the 
preparation of the Code of Conduct on research reactor safety and believed that, once 
completed, it would contribute to desirable levels of safety in the management of such 
installations. 
109. The second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety had been a success. The number of participants and the quality of the national reports 
was a clear indication of the importance the Contracting Parties attached to achieving and 
maintaining a higher level of nuclear safety worldwide. 
110. Both as a recipient and as a donor, Turkey attached the utmost importance to the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities which were an important element of the sustainable 
development process. The Turkish authorities were satisfied with the progress achieved in 
both national and regional projects in 2001, but believed there was still work to be done on 
both sides to increase the implementation rate. He congratulated the Department of Technical 
Co-operation on its performance, despite the heavy workload, the increased number of 
recipient countries and limitations on resources. His country supported the application of the 
central criterion and noted with satisfaction that nearly 70% of the project requests submitted 
for the 2003-2004 cycle fulfilled that criterion. The reduction in the number of project 
requests should eventually lead to a more focused and streamlined programme and improve 
co-ordination and management of projects. 
111. Several national and regional training programmes had been conducted by the Turkish 
Atomic Energy Authority in the field of radiation protection and his country had made 
significant progress towards establishing a fully operational regulatory system compatible 
with the principal requirements of the AgencyÂs Basic Safety Standards. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 22 

112. Finally, he welcomed the recent consensus on the TCF targets for 2003-2004 and the 
indicative planning figures for 2005-2006. Turkey would be pledging $314 698 to the TCF 
for 2003. 
113. Mr. HENDAOUI (Tunisia) said that his country followed with interest the 
AgencyÂs efforts to assist Member States to develop their capabilities in the area of nuclear 
technology in order to promote their socio-economic development. 
114. The Agency had funded national, regional and international technical co-operation 
projects in Tunisia, and had provided training and scientific equipment. TunisiaÂs Country 
Programme Framework was to be signed during the current session of the General 
Conference. It aimed at enabling the country to establish an advanced technological 
infrastructure for peaceful uses of nuclear techniques. 
115. His country strove to strengthen international scientific and technological co-operation 
with the Agency and all friendly countries, including other Arab countries, both on a bilateral 
basis and through the Arab Maghreb Union and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency. He 
expressed the hope that the Agency would intensify its scientific co-operation with the latter 
organization and help it enhance its activities. 
116. One of the outstanding results of the co-operation between Mediterranean Arab 
countries and the Agency was the regional project on the use of radioisotopes to study marine 
pollution which had been launched in 1999, under which a regional training seminar had been 
held in Tunisia and another in Morocco. In the near future a joint marine expedition was to be 
organized with Algeria, Tunisia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya and Egypt. He expressed the 
hope that the Agency would obtain the support of the European Mediterranean countries, so 
that plans could be prepared for the study and prevention of marine pollution and protection 
of the Mediterranean basin. 
117. Within the African region, Tunisia continued to strengthen its co-operation with all 
countries. It had participated in 11 regional projects during the preceding year, and had 
hosted five workshops in the areas of health, agriculture and industry under AFRA 
programmes, providing training facilities for participating countries. He noted with 
satisfaction that the Technical Centre for the Mechanical and Electrical Industries in Tunisia 
had been chosen by the African countries as the model regional centre for non-destructive 
testing, and appealed to the industrialized countries to continue to support the AFRA 
programme so that it could meet its objectives. 
118. His country was also endeavouring to develop co-operation with all friendly countries 
in the utilization of nuclear techniques in the areas of health, agriculture and industry. The 
French Commissariat Ã  lÂÃnergie Atomique had agreed to install an electron accelerator for 
the treatment of industrial and medical products, and implementation of the project would 
start in the current year. Assistance would also be provided with the development of Tunisian 
expertise in the relevant disciplines. 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 23 

119. Tunisia also endeavoured to meet its financial obligations both to the Regular Budget 
and the TCF. It would be paying its share of the TCF for the following year, and he thanked 
all countries which contributed to that Fund. 
120. The co-operation of all countries in the area of nuclear security was vital to global 
security and to the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear techniques. It was essential 
that all States accede to the various relevant international treaties and instruments and comply 
with their requirements. Tunisia supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear 
security, and the establishment of appropriate international mechanisms to reduce the hazards 
of using nuclear material and to prevent its illicit use. It was also a party to the Pelindaba 
Treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, had worked with the international 
community to strengthen the safeguards system, and belonged to every international regime 
promoting nuclear security, safeguards, and non-proliferation and banning of nuclear tests. 
121. His country was taking the necessary steps to conclude an additional protocol. It looked 
forward to the universal application of the safeguards system and to the total elimination of all 
weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. Thus it was deeply concerned at 
IsraelÂs persistent refusal to accede to the NPT and called upon that country to co-operate with 
the Agency by placing its nuclear facilities under Agency control, facilitating the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
122. Mr. WAETERLOOS (European Commission) said that the nuclear issue was an 
integral part of the wider debate on EuropeÂs security of energy supply. The CommissionÂs 
2001 Green Paper on that subject had provided a frank exchange of views on nuclear energy 
and its future. Although the nuclear question aroused diverging opinions in the European 
Union, very few contributors to the debate had questioned the value of nuclear power 
generation for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The phase-outs and moratoria planned by 
certain EU Member States would, however, not dramatically affect the European UnionÂs 
capacity to achieve its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol since, according to current 
planning, they would have no effect before 2010. However, a total phasing out of nuclear 
power would mean that 35% of electricity production would have to come from renewable 
and non-conventional energy sources. At the same time, considerable efforts in energy 
efficiency would be needed because electricity demand was still rising. Given the technology 
currently available, that did not seem feasible in 10 years. Since nuclear power was therefore 
still unavoidable, continued attention was needed to ensure security of nuclear fuel supply. 
Owing to the long lead times for additional uranium resources to reach the market, the 
Euratom Supply Agency had recommended that the European Union nuclear power industry 
maintain an adequate level of strategic inventories, contract for most of their requirements 
with primary suppliers, and diversify the origins of their supplies. 
123. Given the high priority that the European Union assigned to safety standards for nuclear 
power generation, a major concern for most participants in the Green Paper debate had been 
nuclear safety in an enlarged Union. With ten candidate countries likely to join in the near 
future, and others sure to follow, at least 25 operating nuclear reactors would be added to the 
EUÂs nuclear capacity, making nuclear safety a topic in accession negotiations. The UnionÂs 
methodology for evaluating the safety of nuclear installations was based on Agency technical 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 24 

documents. Applying that methodology, two fundamental conclusions had been drawn 
regarding candidate countriesÂ accession: eight reactors that could not affordably be upgraded 
to the required standard would need to be shut down, and the safety level of others would 
need to be raised. The PHARE support programme had helped candidate countries improve 
the safety of nuclear plants. In addition, the Union had donated over 250 million euros for 
decommissioning efforts in Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia. Over the period 1991-2001, the 
EU had committed over 750 million euros under the Tacis programme to international efforts 
to improve nuclear safety in the Russian Federation and the Newly Independent States, in 
close co-operation with the Agency and with other international donors. 

124. He congratulated the Secretariat and co-operating States on the completion of the 
conceptual framework for integrated safeguards. The full integration of traditional 
nuclear-material-based safeguards activities with additional protocol activities should lead to 
a more effective safeguards system within unavoidable budgetary constraints. 
125. The European CommissionÂs enforcement of the new partnership approach had 
facilitated the implementation of Agency safeguards in Europe, enabling the Agency to save 
resources. More effective and efficient co-operation arrangements between the two 
organizations should be developed so that the European Commission could make equal 
savings, including ways for each organization to make full use of the results of the otherÂs 
activities thus avoiding duplication. The existing infrastructure for Euratom safeguards and 
the IAEA safeguards system could be optimized to avoid double spending and allow the 
Agency to focus its activities on places of real concern. Other regional safeguards systems 
could be developed to achieve similar ends. 
126. The CommissionÂs radiation protection activities were geared to ensure a high level of 
radiological protection for the general public and nuclear industry personnel. One major 
activity was the monitoring of the incorporation of the EU directives on the Basic Safety 
Standards and medical exposure into national legislation, and of candidate countriesÂ 
adaptation of their national legislation to fulfil their obligations under the Euratom Treaty by 
their accession date. 
127. One major conclusion drawn from the Green Paper debate was that the future 
development of the nuclear industry would depend on the provision of a clear answer to the 
problem of the safe management, transport and disposal of radioactive waste. Under its Sixth 
Research Framework Programme for 2002-2006, the European Union had undertaken to 
support nuclear research to improve nuclear safety, radiation protection and radioactive waste 
management, including research on disposal of long-lived waste, and further studies on 
partitioning and transmutation and on other ways of reducing waste generation. Nuclear 
fusion also had an important place in the Framework Programme. 
128. The Commission had always been actively involved in international co-operation in 
nuclear matters and the EU had bilateral agreements with several countries. The Union was 
also actively contributing to the KEDO project and fully supported any initiatives which 
would lead to the DPRKÂs fulfilment of all its safeguards commitments. A Euratom 
delegation was currently meeting in Toronto with delegations from Canada, Japan and the 
Russian Federation for the latest stage of the negotiations on the preparation of an 

GC(46)/OR.3 
page 25 

international agreement for the joint implementation of ITER. Two of the four sites proposed 
to host the project were located in the EU and one of them should be selected. He urged the 
Agency to continue to assist that project. Finally, during the visit of the Director General to 
the European Commission in November 2001, it had been agreed to intensify current 
co-operation in key areas. 

The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. HOANG VAN HUAY (Vietnam) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs 
achievements over the year, which were the result of good co-operation between Member 
States and the Secretariat. In particular, he welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the 
safeguards system so as to maintain the non-proliferation regime and provide the international 
community with the assurance that States were complying with their respective safeguards 
commitments. The conceptual framework for integrated safeguards would, he hoped, 
enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the verification system and reduce the cost of 
inspections. 
2. Vietnam valued highly the technical assistance and expertise provided by the Agency in 
the fields of radiation protection and nuclear safety under the Extrabudgetary Programme on 
the Safety of Nuclear Installations in the South East Asia, Pacific and Far East Countries and 
the regional projects on legislation for safe and peaceful nuclear applications (RAS/9/023), 
national regulatory control and occupational radiation protection programmes (RAS/9/026) 
and development of technical capabilities for sustainable radiation and waste safety 
infrastructure (RAS/9/027). In collaboration with the Member States in the region Vietnam 
had participated in all activities and had hosted a number of workshops and seminars within 
the framework of those projects. 
3. Aware of the need for a strong national nuclear regulatory infrastructure in promoting 
the safe and peaceful applications of nuclear technology, his country had set up the National 
Action Plan on Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety in 2000, which had proved effective 
over the last two years. In addition, he was pleased to report that his country was taking steps 
with a view to becoming a party to the CPPNM. Vietnam was highly appreciative of the 
national and international efforts to combat nuclear terrorism outlined in the Director 
GeneralÂs statement, particularly the measures to improve the security of nuclear and other 
radioactive materials; however, it shared the view of many developing countries that such 
activities should not be carried out at the expense of the technical co-operation programme. 
4. Vietnam accorded great importance to technical co-operation with the Agency aimed at 
strengthening research and development capabilities and promoting the safe and peaceful 
applications of nuclear science and technology in the service of industrialization and 
modernization. A national conference on the evaluation of international co-operation in the 
nuclear field had been held in August 2002 to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of 
international co-operation activities in the period 1998-2002. It had concluded by consensus 
that all technical co-operation projects supported by the Agency had been implemented well. 
The projects had contributed significantly to promoting the social and economic development 
of the country, particularly in the areas of agriculture, human health, groundwater 
management, oil and gas industry, environmental protection and human resources. 
5. In that context, his delegation wished to reiterate its full support for the 1997 Technical 
Co-operation Strategy, which emphasized strong government commitment, high project 
quality and adequate funding as prerequisites for the successful delivery of the technical 
co-operation programme.

6. His delegation was encouraged by the recent positive development trend in nuclear 
power and noted with satisfaction that the nuclear-generated share of the worldÂs electricity 
had increased by 3.9% in 2001 compared with 2000. He urged the Agency to continue to 
assist interested Member States in overall energy planning, in introducing nuclear power into 
their countries, and in managing and improving the safe performance of nuclear power plants. 
7. As a further step towards introducing nuclear power, Vietnam had set up the National 
Steering Committee on Nuclear Power Development to study various aspects of nuclear 
power development in the country. 
8. Mr. HUGHES (Australia) said that the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 had 
highlighted the fragility of the world and the importance of promoting and protecting 
international frameworks which ensured peace and security for all. The heightened concern 
about the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, together with the 
spectre of nuclear or radiological terrorism, had underlined the AgencyÂs pivotal role in 
ensuring the safe and peaceful development of nuclear science and energy. Australia 
commended the Agency for the substantive progress it had made in tackling those issues and 
welcomed the growing support from Member States for the AgencyÂs programmes. 
9. Australia was strongly committed to the three pillars of the AgencyÂs mandate - nuclear 
safety, verification, and technology - and supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to integrate 
the different arms of the AgencyÂs activities in order to present a more unified face to the 
international community. 
10. Australia believed that the global implementation of an effective system of strengthened 
safeguards delivered universal security benefits. The long-term viability of nuclear science 
and energy was inextricably linked to the AgencyÂs ability to offer the international 
community credible assurances that it was preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. 
Without such assurances the nuclear industry would be irreparably damaged and the role of 
the Agency in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology would suffer accordingly. 
11. In AustraliaÂs view the AgencyÂs verification and promotional activities were mutually 
reinforcing in nature: strengthening the credibility of the AgencyÂs verification systems 
promoted confidence in nuclear science and technology, while widening their applications to 
address environmental, health and other development issues promoted acceptance of the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime. The concept of balance between verification and promotion 
which was often invoked did not adequately describe the relationship between the two, which 
was one of mutual dependency rather than tension and exclusivity. 
12. Achieving the wide application of the IAEAÂs additional protocol for strengthened 
safeguards was a priority for Australia and many other countries. Agency safeguards were 
not static and had undergone considerable evolution over the years, with the strengthened 
safeguards system and the conclusion of additional protocols marking the latest stage of that 
evolution. Indeed, the additional protocol represented the new verification standard for NPT 
safeguards. That meant that the IAEA safeguards system, which all non-nuclear-weapon 
States Party to the NPT were obliged to accept, should come quickly to be regarded as 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 7 

comprising both classical safeguards (INFCIRC/153) and strengthened safeguards under the 
additional protocol (INFCIRC/540). 

13. Australia was pleased to have been the first country to ratify an additional protocol and 
the first where integrated safeguards were being applied. The Agency was gaining practical 
experience in Australia with implementing new measures such as unannounced inspections, 
complementary access and managed access which would prove invaluable as integrated 
safeguards were extended to other countries. It would also, he hoped, demonstrate to others 
that integrated safeguards were not burdensome but rather delivered benefits in terms of 
increased efficiency and effectiveness. His delegation urged States which had not yet signed 
and ratified an additional protocol to do so as soon as possible. While there had been an 
encouraging increase in the number of States concluding additional protocols over the 
previous year, there was still a long way to go. Australia therefore welcomed the global 
conference on additional protocols to be hosted by Japan in December 2002 and hoped for 
wide participation in that conference. 
14. It was disappointing that no tangible progress had been made in relation to the 
implementation of the safeguards agreement with the DPRK. As a party to the NPT, the 
DPRK had an unconditional obligation to comply with its safeguards agreement. Since 
delays in verification work might delay delivery of key nuclear components for the KEDO 
light water reactor project likely to be needed in 2005, Australia urged the DPRK to move 
quickly to co-operate fully with the Agency. 
15. With regard to Iraq, Australia welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts and expressed its deep 
concern over IraqÂs non-compliance with United Nations Security Council resolutions 
requiring it to provide the Agency with the access and co-operation necessary to implement 
its Security Council mandate. Regretting that the second and third round of talks between the 
United Nations and Iraq had not led to a resumption of inspections, Australia looked to Iraq to 
co-operate fully with the IAEA and UNMOVIC inspectors in achieving the complete 
implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions, thus demonstrating that it had 
permanently abandoned any intention of developing nuclear weapons. 
16. Concerning threats of nuclear terrorism, the Agency, as the principal focus for 
international co-operation on nuclear issues, had a central role to play. That seemed to be a 
natural extension of the work the Agency already did in the areas of safeguards and the 
security and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. Australia commended the 
Agency on its swift and substantive response to the threat of nuclear terrorism and, as a 
contributor to the newly created Nuclear Security Fund (NSF), urged those Member States 
which had not already done so to contribute financially and in kind. 
17. Australia was aware that many Member States held the view that new nuclear security 
projects should not be given priority over traditional areas of technical co-operation activity, 
but in AustraliaÂs view the security of nuclear and radioactive materials should be a priority 
for all countries, given their widespread use in industry, agriculture and medicine. The use of 
nuclear or radioactive materials by terrorists in one country or other security shortcomings 
would inevitably lead to restrictions on their use in other countries, causing damage to 
national nuclear technology programmes and the welfare of their beneficiaries. Moreover, the 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 8 

additional technical assistance stemming from projects financed from the NSF would be a net 
gain for all members. 

18. Australia was gratified at the progress made in the strengthening of the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, most recently at the technical 
meeting it had chaired in August. There was an obvious need further to improve the control 
of high activity sources as a means of enhancing protection against the risk of radiological 
terrorism. Australia supported the meetingÂs recommendation that, once the current revision 
of the AgencyÂs categorization of radiation sources had been finalized, the Director General 
should convene a group of technical and legal experts to consider revising the scope of the 
Code. 
19. On the other hand, Australia was disappointed at the failure to reach a consensus at the 
meeting of legal and technical experts drafting an amendment to the CPPNM and called on all 
delegates participating in that process to work constructively towards a solution. 
20. The Agency had an essential role in establishing a global nuclear safety culture, 
inter alia through the development of international safety standards. Australia had contributed 
to regional and international efforts to enhance the understanding of how safety culture could 
be implemented in nuclear organizations. 
21. Australia welcomed the outcomes of the second Review Meeting of Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety held in April 2002. While Australia did not have a 
nuclear power programme, as a party to the Convention and an operator of a multi-purpose 
research reactor it benefited from the review process and urged other Member States in a 
similar position to ratify that Convention. 
22. Australia also welcomed the increased focus on the safety of research reactors. As chair 
of the expertsÂ group developing a code of conduct on their safety, it was pleased to be 
playing a key role in strengthening the safety regime. 
23. Turning to the safe transport of radioactive material, he noted that the transfer of nuclear 
technology and the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy depended very much 
on the global transportation of nuclear and other radioactive materials. Nuclear shipments 
had an excellent safety record, underpinned by effective Agency regulations in which 
Australia had every confidence. He welcomed the ongoing dialogue between shipping and 
coastal States and, in particular, the increased transparency shown more recently by the 
shipping States, as illustrated in the recent findings of the TranSAS mission to the United 
Kingdom. He was honoured to accept the responsibility of chairing the 2003 International 
Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material and called on all parties to 
work constructively to ensure that a consensus outcome could be achieved. 
24. Noting the growing span of nuclear science and technology applications which were 
assisting the social and economic development of many countries, he said that the Australian 
Nuclear Science and Technology Organization had been pleased to continue its participation 
in the AgencyÂs co-ordinated research projects. Increasingly important factors in the area of 
nuclear science and technology included the issue of maintaining nuclear knowledge and the 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 9 

efforts to enhance the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme. 
Australia welcomed the strong support for technical co-operation across the AgencyÂs 
membership, as evidenced by impressive real increases in the TCF over the previous few 
years and by significantly higher rates of attainment. Australia for its part had increased its 
voluntary contributions to the TCF to 1.995 million Australian dollars, well above its rate of 
attainment target of 90% for 2003. While remaining committed to the principle of voluntary 
contributions, it stressed the importance of other countries also meeting that target, or at least 
increasing current levels of funding. Australia was also contributing significantly to an 
extrabudgetary project on radioisotope technology for sustainable development in Asia and 
the Pacific and to the RCA. 

25. In conclusion, he assured the Agency of AustraliaÂs strong support in the 
implementation of its programmes and in its efforts to meet new challenges. 
26. Mr. RÃNAKY (Hungary) said that the year 2002 marked the 60th anniversary of 
controlled nuclear fission as well as the 45th anniversary of the Agency. Since the first 
controlled chain reaction, mankind had faced the dual challenge of preventing the military use 
of nuclear energy while exploiting its peaceful potential. In addition, the events of 
11 September 2001 had drawn attention to the responsibility of the nuclear community to 
protect the world against nuclear terrorism -a task that required both national and 
international efforts. 
27. His country commended the Agency on its rapid response to the threat of nuclear 
terrorism and welcomed the leading role it was taking and the new measures adopted. In spite 
of strict budget constraints, his Government was considering making a financial contribution 
to the NSF. While a study of HungaryÂs nuclear installations had revealed that no substantial 
enhancement of physical protection at the nuclear sites was required, Hungary was aware that 
security could still be improved in some areas. Although fewer cases of illegal possession of 
and trafficking in radioactive and nuclear material were being reported in Hungary and the 
neighbouring countries, physical protection and illicit trafficking remained the key issues in 
the fight against nuclear terrorism. In that regard, he urged that the efforts to draft an 
amendment to the CPPNM be brought to a meaningful conclusion as soon as possible. 
28. Hungary was a firm supporter of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and its 
cornerstone, the NPT. It welcomed the agreement between the United States and the Russian 
Federation on a substantial reduction of their nuclear arsenals, although further progress 
would be needed in that area. It would also welcome the early implementation of the 
agreements reached at the 2000 NPT Review Conference and the speedy conclusion of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The Agency was to be 
commended on the elaboration of the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards; 
however, a significant reduction of the risk of nuclear proliferation could not be achieved 
without the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols by 
all States which had the obligation to do so. Hungary had been among the first to sign an 
additional protocol and had fully co-operated with the Secretariat in implementing all its 
provisions during the evaluation of the countryÂs nuclear programme. As Hungary was 
preparing to join the European Union and Euratom, it hoped that the Agency would soon 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 10 

draw its conclusion on the absence of undeclared nuclear material in the country, thereby 
opening the way for the implementation of integrated safeguards. 

29. His delegation was concerned that the AgencyÂs safeguards staff and budget might be 
overburdened by an extension of the strengthened regime to all States; however, it trusted that 
the AgencyÂs experience would enable it to optimize the methods it used. Hungary remained 
committed to the AgencyÂs safeguards support programme, offering its facilities, equipment 
and experts for training courses, and was always ready to support the AgencyÂs inspectors in 
nuclear material verification. It was also providing services in the collection of open-source 
information. 
30. With regard to the second Review Meeting under the Nuclear Safety Convention, he 
noted that Hungary had satisfied the requirements of the Convention. He welcomed the 
improvements achieved by most of the Contracting Parties since the first Review Meeting and 
the conclusions drawn in 2002, which would no doubt help in further enhancing nuclear 
safety, although it would be up to States to put them into practice. 
31. The entry into force of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management was encouraging, and Hungary was 
preparing its national report on the fulfilment of its obligations pursuant to the Convention. It 
looked forward to participating in the first review conference, where it hoped that a wide 
range of States would be represented in view of the high priority of the issue. He urged the 
States that had not yet done so to ratify the Joint Convention as soon as possible. 
32. He expressed appreciation for the work of INSAG and noted the Director GeneralÂs 
intention to review its role and mandate. He also welcomed the decision to reconstitute the 
four safety standards committees. His delegation was convinced that with continuing efforts 
to ensure a high level of safety in the operation of nuclear power plants and the disposal of 
radioactive waste, the expanded use of nuclear power could become acceptable to most 
people. 
33. One of the most important long-term goals with regard to the Paks nuclear power plant 
was to extend the life of its units while meeting the criteria of safety and economy. A 
feasibility study had shown that the plant could continue its operation beyond the 30-year 
design lifetime, and it was planned to extend it by a further 15-20 years. In that connection, 
his delegation hoped that the International Symposium on Nuclear Power Plant Life 
Management, to be held in Hungary in November 2002, would promote a fruitful exchange of 
views on that issue. 
34. Several factors were crucial to the effectiveness of technical co-operation, namely 
ensuring adequate resources, allocating them according to a clear strategy and priorities, and 
selecting projects in an objective manner. Hungary had demonstrated its support for the 
AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities by its 100% record of payment to the TCF. His 
Government had again decided to pledge its full share of the target for 2003 and appealed to 
all Member States to pay their contributions in full and on time. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 11 

35. Believing that well-established regional co-operation was the best way of ensuring 
efficient use of scarce financial resources, his delegation was concerned about the possible 
exclusion of peer review services from regional technical co-operation. The IRRT and 
OSART missions to his country had been of great assistance to it. 
36. Government commitment and meeting the central criterion were of the greatest 
importance in ensuring the quality and relevance of technical co-operation, and he believed 
the CPF which Hungary had recently concluded with the Agency was a good example of the 
increased national leadership which had been recommended by SAGTAC. 
37. His delegation was convinced that the technical co-operation programme had 
contributed significantly to the establishment of safety regimes and had a similar role to play 
in many of the activities planned against nuclear terrorism. Despite differences of view on 
many major issues, the Agency had managed over the years to maintain an appropriate 
balance in its activities, and he was sure it would continue to rise to that challenge in the 
future. 
38. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the Middle East region was 
currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of IsraelÂs aggressive expansionist policies 
against the people in the occupied territories of Palestine, the Shebaa farms and the Golan. 
IsraelÂs military machinery indiscriminately hit children, women and the elderly in disregard 
of charters and undertakings governing international relations in wartime. The Israeli 
Government had not only built settlements in the occupied territories, it had also demolished 
the houses of hundreds of Palestinian families, thus displacing them within their own 
homeland. Young Palestinians were arbitrarily arrested and held without trial. The 
terrorizing practices and systematically discriminatory policies of the current Israeli 
Government against the people under occupation impeded all sincere efforts to find a lasting 
solution to the conflict in the region. 
39. SyriaÂs approach had been to strive for a just and comprehensive peace with restoration 
of ownersÂ rights and a decent life for all parties; that approach remained valid and was 
underpinned by internationally acknowledged resolutions. 
40. In accordance with international law and practices, Syria continued to demand IsraelÂs 
full withdrawal from the Golan and the occupied Arab territories back to the lines of 
4 June 1967, as required by the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid Peace 
Conference terms of reference and the principle of land for peace. However, Israel persisted 
in setting up obstacles to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace. 
41. Israel was also the only nuclear Power in the region and had threatened to use its 
nuclear capability against its Arab neighbours, thereby endangering international security and 
stability. Despite numerous calls from the international community urging it to co-operate in 
establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, Israel had so far refused to do so. 
It was therefore high time the international community put greater pressure on Israel to submit 
to the non-proliferation regime by signing the NPT and a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement and placing all of its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. When the 
Conference took up the agenda item ÂApplication of IAEA safeguards in the Middle EastÂ, 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 12 

therefore, it should adopt a clear resolution calling upon Israel to implement the relevant 
Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and join the NPT. In addition, it should 
draw attention to the power imbalance in the Middle East region resulting from IsraelÂs 
possession of nuclear weapons and the threat that nuclear capability posed to the region and 
the world as a whole. 

42. The Syrian Government opposed and condemned all forms of terrorism, while 
systematically differentiating between terrorism and a nationÂs legitimate struggle against 
occupation and aggression. The international community should hold a conference to define 
terrorism clearly and precisely and to condemn it. The SecretariatÂs efforts to develop 
specific programmes on protection against nuclear terrorism were welcome. All States 
possessing nuclear materials should take prime responsibility for ensuring the security and 
safety of those materials and enhancing the physical protection measures for their nuclear 
installations and materials. Any international measure which fell short of being transparent 
and comprehensive and was therefore applied only selectively rather than universally would 
not have the full impact envisaged. 
43. Over the 45 years since the AgencyÂs foundation, a major challenge had been to 
preserve a proper balance between the AgencyÂs promotional activities and its regulatory 
activities. While zero real growth in the Regular Budget should be maintained, it was 
desirable to explore mechanisms for making technical co-operation resources more assured 
and predictable. 
44. An important development in the West Asian region had been the establishment of the 
new co-operative agreement for Arab States, ARASIA. Five countries, namely Jordan, 
Lebanon, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, had so far joined the agreement, thus 
putting it into force. Those countries had submitted three technical projects addressing 
common development issues in the areas of energy planning, non-destructive testing, and 
quality assurance for nuclear analytical laboratories, and they looked forward to assistance 
from the Agency and from advanced States in the implementation of those projects. 
45. The AgencyÂs role in providing technical assistance for sustainable development and 
improvement of human well-being and security was growing steadily, and his delegation 
supported its approach of fostering technological development by helping Members States to 
acquire capabilities in nuclear science and technology. Regional training centres were 
important in disseminating nuclear culture and producing well-qualified young personnel. 
The strategy which was being followed in the AgencyÂs education and training programme in 
the area of radiation protection involved the development of long-term agreements with 
regional training centres and the establishment of information networks between those centres 
and the Agency. His Government endorsed that approach and had hosted a regional 
postgraduate training course on radiation protection and the safety of radiation sources in 
Damascus for the last three years. In addition, several laboratories in Syria had recently been 
recognized as regional reference centres and were open to trainees from Agency Member 
States. 
46. His Government supported the SecretariatÂs efforts to review the technical co-operation 
strategy. Increasing available resources and rendering them more predictable and assured, 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 13 

inter alia by implementing the ÂRate of AttainmentÂ mechanism, would contribute to meeting 
Member StatesÂ technical co-operation needs. On the other hand, limiting project areas to 
specific topics might prevent developing countries from requesting technical assistance for 
some projects which they considered important. 

47. His country had supported the technical co-operation programme in the past year by 
providing training to fourteen trainees from sister Arab States and accepting five scientific 
visits to the Atomic Energy CommissionÂs laboratories. It had also hosted four regional 
courses and a co-ordinated research meeting in co-operation with the Agency and had offered 
eight of its scientists as experts within the framework of national and regional projects. 
48. Mr. DAINIUS (Lithuania) commended the Agency for its outstanding 
contribution to the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and 
welcomed the SummitÂs emphasis on capacity building and the transfer and use of modern 
technology as prerequisites for sustainable development - with the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy continuing to be an important factor in economic development. 
49. The share of nuclear energy in his countryÂs total energy production was one of the 
worldÂs highest, at 78% in 2001. Lithuania would endeavour to operate its Ignalina nuclear 
power plant safely until it could be closed and decommissioned in accordance with 
internationally recognized practices and safety standards, and with support from the AgencyÂs 
technical co-operation programme. The decommissioning of the Ignalina-1 unit was one of 
the priorities in LithuaniaÂs CPF, as action must be taken well in advance to ensure that 
long-term institutional capabilities and know-how for dismantling and waste management 
processes were maintained without causing any risks to population and environment. 
50. His Government had decided to shut down Ignalina-1 by 2005 in view of its intention to 
join the European Union, and it was relying on financial and technical assistance from the EU, 
the G-7 countries, and other States and financial institutions. An international Project 
Management Unit was already in place at Ignalina to elaborate a final decommissioning plan 
and implement the preparatory stages of the work. Since the first conference of donor 
countries in June 2000, substantial financial assistance had been made available, with the 
Agency providing technical advice and training related to management and safety issues 
including the peer review of safety analysis reports for radioactive waste storage facilities, the 
review of regulations for radioactive waste disposal, and decommissioning practices in other 
Member States. His country particularly valued the AgencyÂs assistance at the 
decision-maker level, which had involved, inter alia, a workshop on decommissioning and a 
visit by Lithuanian members of parliament to the Agency. 
51. He commended the AgencyÂs partnership with Member States to help them in 
formulating energy policies that were adequate, affordable and environmentally friendly. 
Thanks to the AgencyÂs assistance, Lithuania had developed substantial expertise enabling it 
to take well-considered decisions on meeting energy needs. With continued Agency 
co-operation, a comprehensive set of indicators for sustainable energy development would be 
established. A draft updated national energy strategy was under consideration by the 
Lithuanian parliament. While it envisaged closure of Ignalina-2 by 2009, subject to the 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 14 

provision of adequate financial assistance from the EU, it also paved the way for balanced 
assessment of the nuclear and other energy supply options. 

52. Lithuania remained a strong supporter of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and was in 
favour of universal adherence to safeguard agreements and additional protocols. For its part, 
it was fulfilling all its obligations pursuant to its additional protocol, which had entered into 
force on 5 July 2000. However, his delegation was concerned about the slow progress being 
made in concluding additional protocols; it therefore called upon all States that had not yet 
done so to conclude and bring into force such protocols at an early date so that the Agency 
could provide credible assurances of non-diversion of nuclear materials and absence of 
undeclared activities. 
53. In that context, he welcomed the AgencyÂs development of the conceptual framework 
for integrated safeguards. 
54. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 had shocked the world and served as a 
painful reminder that international co-operation and concerted action were needed to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century. Lithuania fully supported the AgencyÂs activities to protect 
against nuclear terrorism, including its new and expanded measures. International legal 
instruments as well as global, regional and national measures should all be used to ensure that 
nuclear materials and technologies did not fall into the wrong hands. Export, import and 
transit control measures should be strengthened. 
55. His Government had co-operated with the Agency and other Member States in recent 
years to improve the national physical protection regime. Its national legislation had been 
amended and the physical protection system at the Ignalina nuclear power plant upgraded. 
Lithuania had received an IPPAS mission in 1999 and, based on the missionÂs 
recommendations, its competent authorities had developed a plan of protection measures 
which was currently being implemented at the regulatory and operator levels. A follow-up 
IPPAS mission was expected later in 2002. 
56. His delegation commended the Agency on its efforts to strengthen the CPPNM, 
including in particular the convening of the open-ended group of legal and technical experts 
to prepare a draft amendment to the Convention. 
57. He welcomed the fact that the second Review Meeting under the Nuclear Safety 
Convention had seen positive trends in nuclear safety reflected in StatesÂ national reports and 
had noted significant progress since the first Review Meeting in 1999. The development of 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes required commitment and adherence by all States to 
internationally accepted nuclear safety standards. The Agency had long been playing a vital 
role in promoting nuclear safety worldwide by developing conventions and standards for 
nuclear safety and radiation protection and by assisting States with their implementation. 
In 2001 the Lithuanian Nuclear Power Safety Inspectorate had received an IRRT mission 
whose recommendations were reflected in an action plan that was to be implemented over the 
next two years. Some of the issues raised by that mission were also addressed in technical 
co-operation projects. A follow-up IRRT mission was due in 2004. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 15 

58. An IPSART follow-up mission had also taken place in 2001 to review the PSA level 1 
and 2 and had concluded that the PSA level 1 was sufficiently comprehensive and its 
documentation adequate while identifying certain areas for further improvement. 
59. The Agency had provided timely assistance to the Ignalina plant and to LithuaniaÂs 
regulatory authority through its extrabudgetary programme on mitigation of intergranular 
stress corrosion cracking in austenitic stainless steel piping of RBMK reactors, which it had 
launched to assist countries operating RBMK reactors to develop effective mitigation 
programmes through technology transfer, training and guidance. 
60. Turning to radiation protection, he said that, in co-operation with the Agency and the 
European Commission, his country had devoted significant resources to strengthening its 
regulatory infrastructure for the control of radiation sources and exposures to ionizing 
radiation. The regional project on development of technical capabilities for sustainable 
radiation and waste safety infrastructure would be successfully completed in the course of the 
year. The Central and Eastern European ALARA network set up in co-operation with the 
Agency to facilitate information exchange among countries with common radiation protection 
problems would also help to sustain the radiation protection infrastructure, as would the steps 
taken to establish a national education and training system and a national training centre for 
radiation protection. 
61. With regard to the security of radioactive sources, his delegation commended the 
Agency on its efforts to provide more guidance and assistance in locating orphan sources, in 
establishing systems for the registration of sources, and in nuclear forensics and the response 
to illegal trafficking in radioactive and nuclear materials. His delegation fully shared the 
AgencyÂs concerns about the radiological protection of patients. 
62. The future of nuclear energy depended critically on the proper management and safe 
disposal of radioactive waste. The competent Lithuanian authorities were working towards 
ratification of the Joint Convention. In July 2001, the Lithuanian Nuclear Power Inspectorate 
had approved regulations to govern pre-disposal waste management at the Ignalina plant. 
Work had begun on preparing regulations for the final disposal of short-lived low- and 
intermediate-level waste to be approved in 2002. The Law on Radioactive Waste 
Management was being implemented, and a strategy comprising general provisions for the 
management of radioactive waste including spent nuclear fuel had been approved. In 2001, 
his Government had also established the Radioactive Waste Management Agency with 
responsibility for the safe management and final disposal of radioactive waste. 
63. In conclusion, given the importance of adequate funding for the AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programme, he was pleased to be able to confirm that his Government was 
prepared to pledge and pay its share of the target for contributions to the TCF. 
64. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile), having congratulated the Republic of Cuba 
on taking the important political decision to ratify the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, said that 
Chile was ready to sign an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement in order to reaffirm 
its permanent commitment to progress on worldwide non-proliferation, to promoting the 
peaceful uses and benefits of nuclear energy, and to increasing public acceptance of that 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 16 

technology. It viewed the additional protocol, which had already been approved by the Board 
of Governors, as an opportunity to build trust between States, and it hoped that the protocol 
could be signed before the end of the current session of the General Conference. 

65. The unilateralism which was becoming a predominant factor in international relations 
did not exactly contribute to the establishment of a productive framework in which the 
interests and needs of developing countries were taken into account. There was widespread 
agreement on the urgent need to return to multilateral action under the auspices of the United 
Nations and its specialized bodies. The United Nations had an indispensable role to play in 
building a climate of trust, in taking specific measures to alleviate poverty and, ultimately, in 
placing humanity and human dignity at the heart of the international communityÂs concerns. 
66. Science and technology, and especially nuclear energy, provided a unique opportunity 
for like-minded countries with common aspirations and expectations to work together to 
achieve those goals. A major effort was therefore needed to underscore the peaceful uses and 
benefits of nuclear energy and to eradicate the perception that nuclear weapons were the basis 
of discussions in the United Nations General Assembly. The nuclear-weapon States in 
particular should be interested in the establishment of mechanisms to highlight the positive 
aspects of nuclear energy. To that end, his delegation wished to reiterate its proposal of the 
previous year1 to include an item on ÂInternational co-operation in the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energyÂ in the agenda of the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly for 
consideration in 2003. In that connection, he thanked the AgencyÂs Secretariat for the 
important contribution it had made towards devising a conceptually convincing and 
diplomatically feasible initiative that would radically alter the public perception of nuclear 
energy, and he urged all States to engage in that wide-ranging undertaking with a view to 
averting the politically and socially destabilizing effects of nuclear proliferation. 
67. The maritime transport of radioactive waste by certain countries without any 
consideration for the concerns of coastal States was in direct contradiction with the general 
principles of international law to protect the environment and also with several legal 
precedents, such as the Âtrail smelterÂ case and the ÂCorfu canalÂ case. Furthermore, the 
climate of tension generated thereby in coastal States could erode international peace and 
security and adversely affect bilateral relations. Chile was not against international trade in 
and transport of radioactive material, but it insisted that a minimum regulatory framework be 
established in which nuclear activities were classified as ÂultrahazardousÂ in accordance with 
international law. As under other international instruments, early prior notification of the 
transport of such materials was the least courtesy which countries affected by such shipments 
could expect. 
68. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was frequently cited as an 
authority in such issues, but without taking into account Part II, section 3 on innocent passage 
in the territorial sea, in particular Articles 19.2(a) and 21.1(f), as well as Articles 192 and 197 
of the Convention. The principal theme of the relevant parts of the Convention was to prevent 
situations which might give rise to accidents and thus might indirectly have an adverse effect 
on mutual confidence. The need for prior and timely notice and a regime of absolute liability 
See GC(45)/OR.4, para. 118. 


GC(46)/OR.4 
page 17 

in the event of an accident was obvious in that context. It had therefore come as something of 
a surprise to hear from legal experts at various formal and informal negotiations that such a 
liability regime was not sufficiently well established in international law, even though its 
basis went back to the 1947 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, the 1972 
Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects, and other 
relevant instruments of international environmental law. In addition to the liability regime, 
there was also the precautionary principle which derived not only from conventions and 
treaties but also from sound practice. In the case of transport of irradiated nuclear material, 
timely prior notification was a key aspect of international practice. Moreover, many 
international bodies were turning to preventive diplomacy aimed at pre-empting conflicts that 
might give rise to tensions and misunderstandings between States and thus hinder more 
effective international co-operation. In a world where half the population lived on less than 
one dollar per day, technical co-operation was vital to address the most essential human safety 
needs, and in a globalized world those needs also affected international security and required 
effective preventive strategies. 

69. In that context, he stressed that science and technology and the peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy provided a valuable instrument for reversing the trend towards international 
inequality. Although there were differences of opinion which the international community 
would have to overcome, nuclear technology offered reasonable solutions to some of the 
worldÂs most pressing problems, particularly in the fields of medicine, agriculture and water 
supply. 
70. The looming threat of nuclear terrorism required the constant attention of the 
international community. A comprehensive and holistic approach was needed to determine 
the most effective means and mechanisms to combat that threat. A unilateral policy would 
not only undermine multilateral relations but would also be short-sighted and inadequate to do 
justice to the complex fundamental issues at stake. His delegation was grateful to the IAEA 
for its reports illustrating the devastating consequences for mankind from terrorism on such a 
scale. Information exchange and other multilateral methods were the most effective 
approach, given that most of mankind categorically and unwaveringly rejected all forms of 
terrorism. 
71. As to his countryÂs own nuclear activities, he was delighted to report that Chile had 
made great strides in the area of sustainable development. In addition to internationally 
recognized achievements such as the eradication of the fruit fly by the sterile insect technique 
a few years previously, progress had been made in human health and in isotope applications 
for the characterization and use of water in the desert region in the north of Chile, where the 
copper and lithium mining industries were concentrated. 
72. Nuclear medicine in Chile had been strengthened by the installation of a modern 
cyclotron at the Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission. The device, which had been wholly 
financed by the Commission itself, was designed to produce short-lived radiopharmaceuticals 
for use in positron emission tomography at two hospitals in Santiago. In addition, Chile 
would be hosting the eighth World Congress of Nuclear Medicine in Santiago at the end of 
the current month. 

GC(46)/OR.4

73. Mr. STRITAR (Slovenia) said that an overview of the important achievements of 
the last year should start with the second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. Bearing in mind the general objective of the Convention, 
namely to achieve and maintain a high level of nuclear safety worldwide, his delegation saw 
the submission of national reports for review as a learning and self-assessment exercise, rather 
than purely a reporting obligation towards the Contracting Parties. Both the first and second 
Review Meetings had proved their value for national nuclear safety programmes and had 
demonstrated the strong commitment of all Contracting Parties to the safety objectives set by 
the Convention. He was sure that the first review meeting under the Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, to be 
held in November 2003, would be conducted in the same effective spirit. SloveniaÂs national 
report on the fulfilment of its obligations under the Joint Convention was being prepared for 
submission in early May 2003. 
74. The Agency had a key role to play in the area of verification and security. Since the 
necessary arrangements under SloveniaÂs safeguards agreement and additional protocol had 
been concluded, verification activities had taken place in 2001-2002 in all nuclear facilities in 
Slovenia to provide assurance that there were no undeclared nuclear materials or activities 
there. He noted, however, that although the AgencyÂs work on negotiating and implementing 
additional protocols had been intensified, only 24 such protocols had entered into force by the 
end of 2001. He therefore urged all States which had not yet done so to conclude safeguards 
agreements with the Agency in accordance with their NPT obligations and subsequently to 
conclude and bring into force additional protocols as soon as possible. 
75. Also highly important were the AgencyÂs activities to improve Member StatesÂ ability 
to protect nuclear and radioactive materials against illegal uses that could pose a proliferation 
threat or endanger health and safety. He welcomed the work which had already been done, 
including the organization of the Stockholm International Conference on Security of Material 
in 2001, the endorsement of a Security Fundamentals document and the preparation of a 
report on ÂMeasures to Improve the Security of Nuclear Materials and other Radioactive 
MaterialsÂ. His country also attached great importance to the strengthening of the CPPNM by 
extending its scope and was participating in the open-ended group of legal and technical 
experts working on a draft amendment to the CPPNM. In support of the AgencyÂs activities 
focusing on protection against terrorist attacks and subnational threats, his Government had 
made a voluntary contribution to the multi-donor NSF established for that purpose. He was 
also glad to report in that context that, in response to an increased need to incorporate a 
Âdesign basis threatÂ as part of the State system of physical protection, a DBT workshop had 
been organized a few days previously in Slovenia. 
76. Slovenia continued to require the AgencyÂs safety review services. A third OSART 
mission to the KrÂko nuclear power plant had already been confirmed for 2003, and a review 
of the Periodic Safety Review programme for that plant and a pilot mission under the new 
Review of Accident Management Programmes (RAMP) service had been carried out in 2001. 
The objective of the RAMP pilot mission had been to review the comprehensiveness, 
consistency and quality of the severe accident management programme for the plant. The 
mission had found that the programme had been successfully developed and largely 
implemented in accordance with Agency guidance and international good practice. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 19 

77. Turning to the area of radiation safety, he welcomed the progress achieved in revising 
the Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources and the Transport 
Regulations. Slovenia was taking an active part in strengthening and harmonizing 
international emergency preparedness and response arrangements for nuclear and 
radiobiological emergencies. In 2001 the AgencyÂs newly developed ORPAS service had 
audited the regulatory and practical implementation of SloveniaÂs occupational radiation 
protection arrangements against the relevant Agency radiation safety standards. 
78. With regard to technical co-operation, he was pleased to announce that Slovenia had, as 
always in the past, pledged its full share of the TCF target for 2003 and fulfilled its financial 
obligations for 2002. It continued fully to support the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
activities and appreciated the assistance provided through technical co-operation projects, 
both current and pending. Where research projects were concerned, eleven out of fifteen 
proposals submitted in 2001 had been approved. 
79. In the last few years, Slovenia had hosted far more technical co-operation trainees than 
it had sent abroad, and the same applied to training courses. Each year Slovenia hosted 
Agency training courses, seminars and workshops, especially in the areas of nuclear power, 
nuclear safety and radiation safety. Slovenian institutes and organizations provided 
on-the-job training and made available their experts for technical co-operation. SloveniaÂs 
commitment to provide in-kind contributions of equipment to the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia to build an early-warning monitoring system demonstrated its strategy of taking 
an active and increasing part in technical co-operation activities. 
80. Among other Agency activities, he welcomed the preparation and publication of safety 
standards. Those standards, together with the conventions negotiated and adopted under the 
auspices of the Agency and the European UnionÂs legal framework, had provided the main 
input for the new Slovenian Law on Protection against Ionizing Radiation and Nuclear Safety, 
which had just been adopted and would enter into force on 1 October 2002. That was only a 
first step, however, since numerous regulations needed to be adopted either by the 
Government or by ministries in the various areas covered by the law. 
81. Mr. RAMAKER (Netherlands) said that much had been done in the fight against 
terrorism since the attacks on the United States of America on 11 September 2001, but much 
still remained to be done, in the nuclear field and in others. The Agency must approach the 
new situation without complacency, with an open mind and creatively. 
82. International co-operation in the nuclear field required mutual trust in a safe and secure 
nuclear environment, underpinned by a fully effective safeguards regime, the standard for 
which in his countryÂs view was the integrated safeguards system developed over the previous 
decade. There was still some way to go in strengthening the global system of nuclear 
non-proliferation, inter alia by promoting universal adherence to both the comprehensive 
safeguards regime and the Model Additional Protocol. Recent progress in that area had been 
slow, but the safeguards regime nevertheless remained an important yardstick for 
co-operation, both substantively and financially. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 20 

83. The necessary balance between the AgencyÂs activities could only exist if the Agency 
was in a position to fulfil all its statutory obligations. However, years of zero growth budgets, 
a disappointing record of contributions payment, and the emphasis on balance at all costs had 
left the Agency close to being unable to provide credible safeguards, as the Director General 
had said himself. If that central goal was put at risk, the very foundations for further 
co-operation would be undermined and voluntary contributions to ensure an adequate 
technical co-operation programme might no longer be readily forthcoming. 
84. In his GovernmentÂs opinion, the traditional insistence on balance between safeguards 
and technical co-operation was too static a concept; it was not an effective tool for promoting 
the work of the Agency, indeed it divided Member States unnecessarily into two opposing 
camps, thus standing in the way of a one-house approach. Instead, since both safeguards and 
technical co-operation were in everyoneÂs interest, his Government favoured flexible, 
results-based budgeting and fundamental debate about effective use of the AgencyÂs scarce 
budgetary resources aimed at developing a new conceptual relationship between the twin 
objectives of international security and technical co-operation in the nuclear field. 
85. Although there seemed to be widespread agreement that the TCF target should be 
increased beyond the original figure of $74.1 million, the Netherlands was not in favour of 
such an increase, since many Member States had not yet paid their contribution in accordance 
with the ÂRate of AttainmentÂ mechanism and many States were greatly in arrears with their 
assessed programme costs. However, his country had not stood in the way of an agreement 
which was clearly favoured by most other Member States. It would continue to monitor 
developments. 
86. The situation in Iraq remained a major concern of his Government. He hoped that the 
recent letter sent by Iraq to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, promising to allow 
the unconditional return of weapons inspectors to the country, would be the first step in the 
full implementation of all the relevant Security Council resolutions. 
87. At present the NSF, set up to finance anti-terrorist activities, relied on an even smaller 
group of contributors than the TCF. Both funds should rank high on every Member StateÂs 
list of priorities. His Government commended the Secretariat for the speed with which it had 
developed the action plan to combat nuclear terrorism, which included practical measures for 
increasing the protection of nuclear materials and their safe and secure storage. The 
Netherlands also welcomed the recent co-operation between the United States of America, the 
Russian Federation, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Agency and the Nuclear Threat 
Initiative. 
88. His Government believed that the action plan should be financed from the AgencyÂs 
Regular Budget. Nevertheless, in view of the urgency of the current security situation, it had 
decided to double its original voluntary contribution to the NSF to Â500 000, of which the 
first instalment would be paid in a few weeksÂ time. 
89. His Government was concerned that the negotiations on the proposed amendments to 
the CPPNM were apparently making little progress. The amendments seemed to be growing 
more limited in scope as the negotiations continued. His Government therefore supported the 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 21 

AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the regime governing the physical protection of nuclear 
materials through practical measures based on the existing rules, regulations and guidelines. 

90. The Netherlands attached considerable importance to improvements in the control of 
sealed highly radioactive sources. Within the European Union alone, approximately 500 000 
such sources had been distributed to various end-users, of which some 100 000 were still in 
use. For some 30 000 sources which were no longer in use, there was thought to be a serious 
risk that they would escape controls. The European Union was currently working to improve 
control of those sources and hoped that the Agency would co-operate with it in that task. 
91. The only remaining nuclear power plant in the Netherlands, at Borssele, had been due to 
close in 2003, earlier than originally planned. However, the new Netherlands Government 
had postponed the closure in view of its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. The 
Government would try to reach an agreement with the owner of the Borssele plant about its 
continued operation, taking into account its scheduled economic and technical lifetime. 
92. In closing, he said that his Government was concerned about maintaining its level of 
nuclear expertise in view of the ageing of the population of nuclear professionals in the 
Netherlands, as in a number of other Western countries. The maintenance and development 
of nuclear knowledge was very important, not only for the continuation of existing nuclear 
programmes, but also for the safe decommissioning of nuclear power plants, the safe storage 
of waste and the response to possible nuclear accidents. His Government therefore called 
upon the Agency to implement the recommendations of the meeting of senior officials on 
managing nuclear knowledge which had taken place in June 2002. 
93. Mr. PRINATH DIAS (Sri Lanka) said that although his country had no nuclear 
power plants in operation and had no plans to use nuclear power in the foreseeable future, it 
was engaged, like many other Member States, in using nuclear technology for a wide range of 
other purposes. Co-operation with the Agency had enabled it to use such technology for 
improving health care facilities as well as agricultural and industrial productivity, with 
considerable benefit to the people of Sri Lanka. 
94. In 2001 the Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) of Sri Lanka had completed, at a cost of 
around $1 million, the construction of a new building to house its laboratories and 
administrative office. The Government had provided funds in recognition of the contribution 
nuclear technology could make to national development. His country was grateful for the 
AgencyÂs technical support in establishing an X-ray fluorescence analytical facility and a 
gamma irradiation facility in the new building. The scientific cadre had been increased 
almost threefold over five years, and there had been a significant rise in government funding 
for recurrent and capital expenditure. The AEA had also been very successful in increasing 
the income it generated: in 2001 it had earned about 40% of its recurrent expenditure, and 
that figure was expected to rise to 50% in 2002. 
95. Sri Lanka had made significant efforts to improve the quality of the technical 
co-operation project proposals submitted to the Agency, selecting them according to the 
central criteria and ensuring that they concerned priority areas of development. Despite 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 22 

financial constraints the Government was providing additional funds to settle the assessed 
programme cost arrears within a reasonable period of time. 

96. The AgencyÂs efforts to make national nuclear institutes self-reliant and self-sustainable 
were appreciated. The programmes of nuclear institutes should be of national relevance, and 
the institutes should establish strong links with potential users of nuclear technology to 
achieve self-reliance and sustainability. Although it did not require Sri Lankan scientific 
institutes to function as commercial establishments, the Government did expect them to be 
cost-effective and to provide services worth the public funds spent on them. The regional 
project on self-reliance and sustainability would further assist the AEA in improving 
cost-effectiveness and income generation by adopting better management strategies. 
97. His delegation also appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the radiation protection 
and waste management infrastructure in Member States. Technical assistance received under 
the interregional Model Project on improving radiation protection and waste management 
infrastructure had made it possible for Sri Lanka to improve its regulatory programme 
significantly. Having achieved milestones 1 and 2, Sri Lanka was making good progress with 
regard to the remaining three milestones, which it hoped to achieve in the near future. New 
radiation protection regulations conforming to the Basic Safety Standards had been 
promulgated and were being implemented. All the radioactive sources in the country had 
been inventoried and procedures prepared for notification, authorization and inspection of 
practices involving radiation and radioisotopes. 
98. The countries participating in the RCA, including Sri Lanka, had reaped considerable 
benefits from it, and his country would continue to take part in RCA programmes and 
activities to the greatest possible extent. He particularly requested the AgencyÂs continued 
support for the RCA project on harmonization of radiation protection (RAS/9/018), which 
was in his opinion important for mutual co-operation among RCA Member States in 
implementing activities outside the scope of the Model Project on radiation protection. 
99. In conclusion, he reaffirmed his GovernmentÂs support for the programmes and 
activities of the Agency, which had been extremely effective in promoting the application of 
nuclear science and technology for development, and without whose assistance developing 
countries such as Sri Lanka would have made very little progress. 
100. Mr. VAPIREV (Bulgaria) said that his country, as a party to the NPT, had always 
supported the AgencyÂs non-proliferation goals and contributed to its safeguards activities. 
The AgencyÂs safeguards system was universal in nature and a key element in ensuring 
confidence among States that nuclear energy was used only for peaceful purposes. 
101. The attacks of 11 September 2001 had rendered even more significant and urgent the 
common efforts required from all States in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation. 
The international community must use all existing international instruments to limit the scope 
of the terrorist threat, inter alia by strengthening and enhancing measures to prevent the 
acquisition of nuclear material and violent acts against nuclear facilities by terrorist groups. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 23 

102. As a current member of the AgencyÂs Board of Governors, his country had repeatedly 
stated its position regarding the crucial role of the AgencyÂs safeguards system in the overall 
anti-terrorist efforts. Further strengthening of the system remained essential to ensure the 
physical protection of nuclear material and to counter nuclear smuggling. His Government, 
willing to share the common responsibility in that priority area, had contributed $15 000 to 
the NSF. 
103. His Government believed that the Model Additional Protocol constituted a key element 
in the safeguards framework, and his country had been among the first to ratify it, as early 
as 2000. At the same time, one could not be satisfied with the slow progress of the 
ratification process. Despite appeals from all sides for speedy adherence to that important 
instrument, the overall number of ratifications stood at 24, with only 6 in 2001. Bulgaria was 
also concerned that some countries had not yet brought into force their NPT safeguards 
agreements and urged them to do so as soon as possible. His Government welcomed the 
development of the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards as a major achievement 
in ensuring efficiency of the safeguards system. Introducing a new approach would give more 
flexibility and, at the same time, ensure greater consistency in the AgencyÂs activities in 
various countries. 
104. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Zangger Committee, his country 
strongly supported the requirement for full-scope safeguards as a precondition for supplying 
nuclear material and equipment and applied that principle strictly in its foreign trade policy. 
105. Nuclear power in Bulgaria contributed significantly to satisfying the energy needs of the 
economy and the population in the country and the region. For ten years the Kozloduy 
nuclear power plant had been providing 44.5% of the average annual electricity produced in 
Bulgaria, and Bulgarian electricity covered around 55% of the constant deficit in the total 
energy balance for the Balkan region, which was seen as a major contribution to stabilizing 
the regionÂs economy. 
106. In the last year there had been several important achievements in the nuclear field, all 
relating to European Union accession requirements. In March 2002 answers had been 
submitted to additional questions from the EU Council of Ministers Working Party on 
Nuclear Safety. The Peer Review Status Report on Nuclear Safety in the Context of 
Enlargement had been submitted to the Permanent Representatives Committee on 5 June 2002 
with a view to the evaluation and conclusions contained therein being taken into consideration 
in the accession process. 
107. The national report presented at the second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in April 2002 had highlighted the substantial progress 
made in 2001-2002. 
108. The Agency expert mission to units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant had 
concluded that all problems regarding the design and operational safety of units 3 and 4 had 
been solved in accordance with the recommendations and suggestions of the Agency, WANO, 
international experts, the plantÂs own experts and international good practice. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 24 

109. In May 2002 the Working Group on Nuclear Safety, which monitored the 
implementation of obligations originating from the Report on Nuclear Safety in the Context 
of European Enlargement, had issued a report based on additional information. The report did 
not include additional recommendations, except to monitor the implementation of plans 
declared by Bulgaria, some of which had already been completed. 
110. The time limits on operation for units 1-4, set in 1999, were based on data about the 
level of safety from the early 1990s and did not correspond to the existing design and 
operational safety of the Kozloduy plantÂs units. All new indications had been that the 
WWER-440/B-230 systems in units 3 and 4 could be modernized, and that had been done at a 
reasonable price. They now reached a level of safety comparable to that of nuclear plants of 
similar age worldwide. There were so far no grounds for early decommissioning of 
units 3 and 4, and requirements regarding their future operation should allow for a technically 
sound and economically viable period. The decision to decommission any unit should be 
based on safety considerations in accordance with international safety practice, taking into 
account economic arguments for maintaining a high safety level, and should not be politically 
motivated. 
111. Noting that his countryÂs efforts over the period 1991-2002 to solve the design and 
operational safety problems of the Kozloduy plant had been strongly supported by the Agency 
and the international community, he thanked the Agency for the safety review mission which 
its experts had carried out in June 2002, documenting the new design status of units 3 and 4, 
and endorsed the AgencyÂs initiative for integrated safety reviews aimed at comprehensive 
assessment of a countryÂs overall nuclear programme. 
112. In June 2002 the National Assembly had adopted a new act on the safe use of nuclear 
energy complying with all relevant conventions ratified by Bulgaria, EU directives and 
Agency safety documents. Under the act, the Bulgarian nuclear regulatory authority had been 
transformed into a Nuclear Regulatory Agency which was institutionally and financially 
independent and had no promotional functions. The Council of Ministers had approved an 
increase in the regulatory staff by 22 expert positions, equivalent to almost 40% of the 
inspectorate. The Nuclear Regulatory Agency was now facing several important challenges, 
the most difficult of which would probably be revising secondary legislation. In line with the 
new act, 22 new regulations had to be developed over two years. 
113. The AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2001 clearly demonstrated the wide range of 
significant achievements in the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the areas of technology, 
safety, verification, security and management. The Agency played an important role in 
establishing a global nuclear safety regime and in providing technical assistance to Member 
States. 
114. Co-operation between Bulgaria and the Agency had continued successfully in 2001. 
His country was grateful to the Secretariat for its assistance in enhancing the safety of 
BulgariaÂs nuclear facilities, increasing and strengthening the capabilities of the Bulgarian 
Nuclear Safety Authority and training Bulgarian specialists. His country in turn participated 
actively in the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, giving high priority to projects 
related to nuclear power, nuclear safety, medicine and the corresponding legislation. Since 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 25 

the previous session of the General Conference his country had contributed $270 000 to the 
TCF. 

115. With financial support from the Agency, Bulgarian nuclear scientists had been able to 
participate in international conferences, symposia and seminars and to exchange experience 
and knowledge with their colleagues from other countries. Bulgarian research institutes and 
laboratories had worked under contracts with the Agency and had taken part in co-ordinated 
research projects, and his country was also participating in the International Nuclear 
Information System, the Incident Reporting System, the Power Reactor Information System 
and other activities. The 30th Consultative Meeting of INIS Liaison Officers had been hosted 
in Sofia in May 2002. 
116. His delegation supported the AgencyÂs proposed budget for 2003, which was well 
balanced with regard to the AgencyÂs priority activities and ensured the implementation of its 
programmes. Bulgaria had met in full its financial obligations to the AgencyÂs Regular 
Budget for 2001 and the TCF, and had reimbursed 8% of the amount of technical assistance 
received. He could announce that BulgariaÂs voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2003 
would be $10 000. 
117. Mr. KANGAI (Zimbabwe) thanked the Agency for its technical co-operation 
activities in his country and expressed the hope that the forthcoming second CPF for 
Zimbabwe (2003-2004) would be as successful as the first. 
118. Though gratified that most of the AgencyÂs programmes in Zimbabwe addressed health 
issues, his delegation was concerned that some important components of the programmes 
could not be implemented for want of adequate radiation protection levels. He therefore 
requested the AgencyÂs expertise to help his country meet requirements in that area. 
119. Other areas of particular importance to Zimbabwe included agriculture, food and 
nutrition, and water resources. 
120. The Agency had been involved in a project with the University of Zimbabwe Medical 
School to improve medical services by introducing in vivo diagnostic procedures at the 
Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare. It had also assisted in the refurbishment of a new 
site for the Nuclear Science Department at Parirenyatwa Hospital. He hoped the Agency 
would continue to offer specialist training to radiographers and nuclear physicians there. 
121. The decommissioning of the old cobalt-60 unit at Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo having 
been completed, his delegation requested that the Agency assist with a new treatment 
planning system and the upgrading of the dosimetry system. 
122. Zimbabwe appreciated the equipment, training and expert visits provided in connection 
with the development of isotope-aided molecular techniques for the early detection, treatment 
and control of the human papilloma virus, which caused cancer of the cervix. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 26 

123. Malaria and tuberculosis were major killers in Zimbabwe, therefore it was important to 
revitalize the project on the detection of drug-resistant malaria and tuberculosis under the 
Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. 
124. Zimbabwe, despite being an agrarian economy, needed to produce more food. To that 
end, it had instituted an equitable land reform programme which it hoped would mean that 
hunger would be a thing of the past. His delegation wished to thank the Agency for its 
involvement in developing bio-fertilizers for increased crop production and soil fertility. 
Although Zimbabwe had been hit by the severe drought which had afflicted southern Africa, 
the project had proved valuable to smallholders and had expanded to include all provinces 
except Matabeleland. 
125. He also hoped for the AgencyÂs help in finding much-needed technical and financial 
support for the groundwater assessment project in Northern Matabeleland. 
126. The AgencyÂs endeavours in assisting Zimbabwe to establish adequate legal 
frameworks for the application of safeguards and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, and the 
work undertaken in the Radiation Protection Unit under the Ministry of Health and Child 
Welfare, were greatly appreciated. His country was committed to setting up an appropriate 
legal framework that would facilitate the peaceful applications of nuclear energy in 
Zimbabwe. 
127. His country was participating in the project on sustainable energy development in 
sub-Saharan Africa and hoped that appropriate plans for sustainable energy would be devised. 
It was also participating in a number of AFRA projects on maintenance of medical and 
scientific instruments, strengthening of waste management infrastructure, development of 
crop varieties, improvement of clinical radiotherapy and tumour marker capabilities, and 
non-destructive testing. Through such projects Zimbabwe was gleaning numerous benefits in 
the form of manpower development and equipment. 
128. Mr. OÂSHEA (United Kingdom) said that the Agency had a crucial part to play in 
preventing terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, both issues to 
which his country attached particular importance. 
129. In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 and at the request of the General 
Conference, the Agency had speedily developed a well-focused and practical programme that 
would make a major contribution to fighting the global scourge of terrorism. In that 
connection, the United Kingdom would contribute Â£500 000, in two instalments, to the 
AgencyÂs work in the former Soviet Union, in addition to its voluntary contribution 
of Â£250 000 to the NSF. He thanked those donors that had contributed and hoped that others 
would follow suit so as to ensure the future viability of the programme. 
130. While responsibility for the security and safety of nuclear and other radioactive 
materials and nuclear facilities lay with Member States themselves, the Agency should 
encourage them to accede to international instruments relevant to the struggle against nuclear 
terrorism and provide specialist guidance on the legal and regulatory steps for such accession. 
He welcomed the AgencyÂs preparation, revision or review of a number of guidance 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 27 

documents and urged Member States to make a substantial input to that work. He also 
welcomed the United StatesÂ proposal to convene a conference to advance work on the 
potential misuse of radiological materials. 

131. He commended the AgencyÂs progress with the application of effective nuclear 
safeguards and the SecretariatÂs continued work with Member States, which had resulted in 
the entry into force of 4 new safeguards agreements and 6 additional protocols and the signing 
of 10 new additional protocols. However, Member States must strive to make speedier 
progress with the conclusion and implementation of such agreements. 
132. Since May 2000, the United Kingdom had had the domestic legislation in place to fulfil 
its obligations under its additional protocol, and had been providing the Secretariat with 
voluntary declarations of the information that would be required once its protocol entered into 
force together with those of its EU partners. 
133. Successful implementation of an additional protocol enabled the Secretariat to draw 
conclusions about the correctness and completeness of a StateÂs safeguards declarations, and 
so provided the basis for implementation of integrated safeguards. In that connection, he 
welcomed the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards presented to the Board by the 
Secretariat in March. His country would continue to work towards the further development of 
integrated safeguards. 
134. His delegation warmly welcomed CubaÂs accession to the NPT and urged all other 
States which had not yet done so to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States. He also 
welcomed CubaÂs ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty, which completed the Latin American 
and Caribbean nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
135. It had been three and a half years since the Agency had been able to fulfil its mandate in 
Iraq, and it could now offer no assurances of IraqÂs compliance with its obligations under the 
relevant Security Council resolutions. Furthermore, the length of time elapsed since the 
Agency had last carried out UN-mandated inspections in Iraq meant that its key task on 
returning to Iraq must be to determine whether IraqÂs nuclear activities and capabilities had 
changed since December 1998. Iraq was aware that it must provide immediate, unconditional 
and unrestricted access to enable the Agency to carry out its mandate, but IraqÂs recent 
behaviour forced his country to view with scepticism its stated intention to do so. 
136. The DPRKÂs continued failure to implement fully its safeguards agreement with the 
Agency caused deep concern. While technical discussions continued at a working level, there 
had been no tangible progress on the verification issues of the completeness and correctness 
of the DPRKÂs initial declaration, despite the AgencyÂs proposal of concrete steps to that end. 
Given that the Agency expected the process to take 3-4 years, that completion of the process 
was essential if the DPRK was to return to full compliance with its safeguards agreement, and 
that full compliance was in turn essential before delivery of the key components of the KEDO 
light-water reactor project, he urged the country to co-operate fully and immediately with the 
Agency on the verification process. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 28 

137. His countryÂs Government and civil nuclear industry took very seriously their 
responsibilities for ensuring safety at nuclear installations, with regard to both the workforce 
and the wider public. The United KingdomÂs stringent regulatory regime imposed high safety 
standards. The requirements of the Nuclear Safety Convention and the Joint Convention were 
fully applied. The United Kingdom called on all States that had not yet acceded to the Joint 
Convention to do so. It fully supported the AgencyÂs active programme to promote high and 
consistent international levels of safety and considered that the work of revising the suite of 
existing safety standards should continue to be given high priority in Major Programme 3. 
138. The United Kingdom would play a full and constructive role in the conference on 
transport safety being organized by the Agency in 2003. As a State involved in the transport 
of nuclear material, both domestically and internationally, the United Kingdom had recently 
welcomed a TranSAS mission. He hoped that other Member States would study the mission 
report, which attested to the existence of effective systems to ensure high safety standards for 
such transport, and that they, too, would make use of that service. 
139. The United Kingdom continued its active participation in the CEG and its development 
of a fully co-ordinated international action plan for the safe and effective management of 
radioactive material from decommissioned nuclear submarines in north-west Russia. It would 
continue to help countries of the former Soviet Union manage their nuclear legacies, but 
hoped that the necessary framework would soon be put in place. 
140. Turning to technical co-operation, he said that the United Kingdom had again shown its 
commitment by paying its full share of the TCF target. He urged others to do likewise. He 
welcomed the AgencyÂs contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 
Johannesburg, at which it had demonstrated its relevance to the sustainable development 
agenda - where much more work was needed to dispel misconceptions, and its participation in 
the inter-agency evaluation of ways in which the United Nations family could achieve the 
Millennium Declaration goals. He recommended a more explicit orientation of the technical 
co-operation programme towards those goals and those of Agenda 21, as well as the 
anchoring of certain Agency interventions more firmly into the United Nations Development 
Assistance Framework and the Poverty Reduction Strategy process. 
141. Regarding key challenges for the future, he recalled that the Agency could pursue its 
important role under the three pillars of its mandate only in active partnership with Member 
States. In its crucial safeguards work the Agency must be able to continue to provide credible 
assurances that nuclear material was not being used to create weapons of mass destruction. 
The development of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technologies - so valuable for 
economic and social development - could not be guaranteed unless those assurances were in 
place. Member States must therefore ensure that they collectively provided the Agency with 
the means to carry out its work to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
142. The United Kingdom was concerned at recent evidence of an increasing shortfall in 
resources for safeguards activities, which had resulted in uniquely high levels of core 
activities unfunded in the Regular Budget and in 2001 had necessitated the equivalent of 
17 extra person-years of work by safeguards personnel in the form of unpaid overtime and 
unclaimed leave. That situation was not sustainable and called for urgent consideration of an 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 29 

increase in Regular Budget funding for safeguards. It was Member StatesÂ duty to ensure that 
the Secretariat had the resources it needed to fulfil its legal safeguards obligations. He 
therefore urged Member States to heed the Director GeneralÂs clear warning that the Agency 
was close to being unable to do so and - provided a convincing case for increased funding was 
made - to ensure that the extra resources were made available. 

143. His delegation was pleased that an agreement had been reached in the discussions on 
the 2003 TCF target figure and wished to express particular thanks to Ambassador Hughes of 
Australia, who had chaired the discussions, for his sterling work. All Member States should 
endeavour to pay their contributions in full and on time so that the Agency could move 
towards achieving its 2002 minimum attainment target. Regrettably, 55 countries, developed 
and developing, had made no TCF pledges in 2001, and a further 11 had not paid theirs, while 
18 had paid only a part. Also, the present level of accumulated arrears on assessed 
programme costs was over $7 million, or around 10% of the value of the technical 
co-operation programme, and a significant proportion of them had been outstanding for a long 
time. That matter should be addressed by the Board of Governors in 2003 when considering 
the question of the future financing of technical co-operation. 
144. The elimination of unnecessary activities was one way of making the Agency as 
efficient as possible. He therefore welcomed its pursuance of his countryÂs request the 
previous year2 for a study to identify areas of potential internal inefficiency. He thanked 
Member States that had supported the initial phase of that work, to which his country had 
contributed Â£75 000, and hoped that other Member States would support the upcoming second 
phase. 
145. In conclusion, he said that the immediate challenge for Member States was to ensure 
that the Agency was equipped to fulfil its safeguards obligations while also pursuing its other 
objectives, and that the United Kingdom pledged its wholehearted support to that endeavour. 
146. Ms. ESPINOSA CANTELLANO (Mexico) expressed her delegationÂs 
satisfaction at CubaÂs recent decision to join the NPT and to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
147. The AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2001 duly reflected its major achievements in the 
promotion of international co-operation on the peaceful use of nuclear technologies and the 
transfer of such technology to developing countries, as well as its efforts towards an effective 
nuclear safety regime and an effective and efficient verification system. However, there was 
widespread concern among Member States with regard to maintaining a balance in the 
resources devoted respectively to technology, safety and verification; the inclusion in the 
Annual Report of a diagram showing the distribution of resources should help to allay such 
worries. 
148. With regard to technical co-operation, her delegation acknowledged the AgencyÂs 
efforts to improve quality and impact. The two phases of the technical co-operation strategy 
had been of great assistance to developing countries in preparing better, more 
See GC(45)/OR.4, para. 11. 


GC(46)/OR.4 
page 30 

socio-economically effective projects, in accordance with their national priorities, and in 
finding new users and involving key institutions in priority areas for sustainable development. 

149. Mexico was a promoter of technical co-operation between developing countries in Latin 
America and continued to support the subcontracting activities encouraged by the Agency and 
regional co-operation mechanisms such as ARCAL. The concept of ÂPartners in 
DevelopmentÂ formed the main basis for MexicoÂs relations with the Agency. In line with the 
state of development of its nuclear sector, Mexico would continue to request Agency 
assistance in certain areas. At the same time, it would continue to place at the disposal of the 
international community, particularly in Latin America, the knowledge and experience it had 
gained in the peaceful applications of nuclear science and technology. 
150. Noting with satisfaction the AgencyÂs progress on important issues such as combating 
disease in Africa and drought in Central America, for which nuclear technologies could be 
crucial, she reiterated her GovernmentÂs desire to collaborate in those efforts through the 
experience of Mexican institutions and experts, especially in isotope hydrology and the sterile 
insect technique. 
151. Mexico shared the concerns expressed during the meeting on managing nuclear 
knowledge in June 2002 with regard to the declining interest among the younger generation in 
studying nuclear science and related subjects at university level and to the aging of the nuclear 
workforce. Given the importance of nuclear science and technology for socio-economic 
development, there was an immediate need to preserve existing knowledge for future 
generations by following an integrated strategy to inform the public, simply, clearly and 
directly, of the great usefulness of nuclear applications. 
152. In that context, her Government, in view of the importance it accorded to public 
opinion, would be launching an information and training programme aimed at various levels 
of government, the media and the education sector, under the AgencyÂs 2003-2004 technical 
co-operation programme. 
153. Turning to the advances made in her country in the past year, she noted that preventive 
maintenance had been carried out on the aluminium pool liner of the TRIGA Mark III 
research reactor at the National Nuclear Research Institute (ININ), thus prolonging its useful 
life. A new digital control console designed and built at ININ had been installed to operate 
the reactor and acceptance tests had been successfully performed. All activities had been 
conducted under ININÂs quality assurance programme, with the approval and supervision of 
the national regulatory body, the National Commission for Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, 
and the application process had been concluded with that body to renew the licence for the 
reactor, which had been in operation since 1968. 
154. Infrastructure modernization had been completed at the new radioisotope production 
plant, which had 16 hot cells for the production of radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals and 
labelled molecules for medical and industrial applications throughout Mexico. The design, 
construction and automation of the cells had been carried out by ININ in line with 
international standards. In July 2002 the regulatory body had approved the operating licence 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 31 

for the plant and documentation had been prepared for certification of the plantÂs quality 
system in accordance with ISO 9001-2000. 

155. The Gamma Irradiation Service was being used to improve various products 
through sanitization, disinfection and/or sterilization. Regular users of the service 
included 200 businesses with nearly 400 products, principally dried or dehydrated foodstuffs, 
medical products, cosmetics and herbal products. The serviceÂs quality management system, 
provided by ININ, had also been certified in accordance with ISO 9001-2000. 
156. With Agency support, Mexico had established its first and only tissue bank at ININ, 
where ionizing radiation was used to sterilize tissues for medical applications in accordance 
with international quality assurance standards and pharmacopoeia regulations. To increase 
the uses of those tissues, agreements had been signed with public-sector health institutions to 
establish clinical protocols for different tissues, including test protocols for the use of porcine 
tissue on large-area burn patients and for dental applications of lyophilized, powdered and 
sterilized bone. 
157. Her delegation acknowledged the AgencyÂs safety activities, particularly the drawing up 
of a code of conduct on the safety of research reactors and the implementation of the revised 
Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources. A regional workshop on the 
safety of radiation sources and the security of radioactive materials had been successfully held 
in Mexico City in September 2002 under the auspices of the Agency. 
158. She reiterated her delegationÂs total support for all measures in the area of radiation 
protection that were designed to promote the application of safety standards to protect health, 
the enhancement of education and training, and the exchange of information and 
co-ordination between research projects. She accordingly welcomed the proposed 
International Action Plan for the Radiological Protection of Patients and offered the services 
of Mexican experts for the implementation phase of the plan. 
159. With regard to safety culture, the seminar on self-assessment training held under 
Agency auspices at the Laguna Verde nuclear power plant in June 2001 had significantly 
contributed to the plantÂs own programme on the same subject, established in 1996, under 
which safety was considered the top priority in providing safe, reliable and economical 
electricity in strict compliance with environmental regulations. 
160. The Laguna Verde plant, with its two units, had been operating successfully at high 
capacity for 19 years. 
161. Mexico had presented the required report to the second Review Meeting under the 
Nuclear Safety Convention, and the two recommendations it had received, relating to the 
regulatory body and the nuclear power plant, were being given due attention. 
162. She congratulated the Secretariat on the steps taken to strengthen safeguards. However, 
in view of domestic economic difficulties affecting many developing countries, including 
Mexico, it was difficult to accept any increase in the AgencyÂs budget to provide extra 
financial resources for safeguards. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 32 

163. Her delegation noted with satisfaction the steps taken against nuclear terrorism and, 
believing that international co-operation should be the main mechanism for the fight against 
terrorism within international organizations and the United Nations in particular, had 
participated actively in drawing up the action plan for the prevention of nuclear terrorism. It 
also continued to play an enthusiastic part in the work on drafting an amendment to the 
CPPNM. In that context, she wished to stress that, even if there were no direct link between 
poverty and terrorism, marginalization and lack of opportunities could produce susceptible 
groups of potential terrorists. Any measure aimed at sustainable development, for example 
strengthening the technical co-operation programme, was therefore important in preventing 
terrorism. 
164. Monsignor BOCCARDI (Holy See) expressed his gratitude to the Director 
General and his staff for their dedicated work and underlined the AgencyÂs valuable 
contribution to the establishment of a global nuclear safety culture, especially through its 
work on radiological protection of patients, monitoring and reduction of occupational 
exposure to radiation and safe management of radioactive waste. 
165. If a global nuclear safety culture was to be achieved, an up-to-date system of training 
and education must be created and universally applied in order to prevent disparities in safety, 
radiation protection and quality assurance between developed and developing countries. 
While it was important to upgrade old equipment, it was surely even more important for a 
culture of nuclear safety to increase awareness of potential dangers accompanying nuclear 
technology. 
166. His delegation believed that the human person was at the centre of all scientific research 
and development. For that reason, it attached great importance to radiological protection for 
patients and caregivers. However, the impact of nuclear technology on the environment was 
also a vital issue. His delegation therefore welcomed the ongoing discussions between the 
Agency and a group of consultants about ethical considerations in protecting the environment 
from the effects of ionizing radiation. Preserving the worldÂs biodiversity was an 
indispensable part of the effort to create a more human world for future generations. The 
regulations governing the use of radioactive and fissile materials were generally strict, but 
must be fully enforced in order to protect humans and the environment. 
167. One of the greatest concerns relating to the safety and security of nuclear materials was 
the increasing problem of orphan sources. The Agency performed an indispensable task by 
helping Member States to set up or strengthen national regulatory infrastructures and 
providing assistance to both institutions and States in emergency situations. 
168. His delegation commended the Agency for its technical co-operation activities in the 
areas of medicine and agriculture. Its work in cancer treatment, diagnostic radiology and 
nuclear medicine helped many people in regions where those forms of diagnosis and 
treatment were not yet widely available, especially in rural areas. In agriculture, the AgencyÂs 
work on the control of pests and diseases, food safety and the use of isotopes in the 
exploration of water resources and the control of pollution in large cities contributed greatly 
to social and economic development in many parts of the world. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 33 

169. If technical co-operation projects were to be successful in the long term, participants 
must adapt the projects to their own regions, develop them further and pass on their 
knowledge to neighbouring countries with similar problems. Such cross-border co-operation 
could have a great impact on the social, economic and humanitarian situation in many 
societies. 
170. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines) said the subject of nuclear terrorism had been very 
much in his countryÂs consciousness since the terrible events of 11 September 2001. He 
appreciated the AgencyÂs vigilance against the threat and the specific measures described in 
document GC(46)/14. 
171. A Philippine action plan for the safety and security of radiation sources had been set in 
motion earlier in the year. The AgencyÂs Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources was being implemented even as regulations continued to be reviewed 
and updated. His countryÂs inspection system had been rationalized to accord greater 
attention to high-risk sources, and a comprehensive up-to-date registry of all radiation sources 
in the country had been completed in August 2002. 
172. The Philippines condemned terrorism in all its forms and was committed to combating 
it in the nuclear field. Being a small country with limited financial resources it was willing to 
consider measures additional to those it was taking independently; however, it hoped they 
could be funded by extrabudgetary contributions rather than displacing priority activities in 
the Regular Budget or departing from zero real growth. 
173. Emphasizing the need for technical co-operation to be financed through predictable, 
adequate and assured funding, he said the Philippines supported the agreement reached on the 
TCF targets for the 2003-2004 biennium and the indicative planning figures for the biennium 
thereafter. His delegation firmly believed that the technical co-operation programme should 
be driven by priorities defined by recipient Member States, according to the principles laid 
down in document INFCIRC/267. Special attention should be given to the development and 
propagation of non-power applications that addressed existing problems, as they contributed 
to the AgencyÂs continuing relevance. 
174. The application of nuclear techniques to harmful algal blooms - better known as Âred 
tideÂ - had been practically unheard of five years previously. The first project on such blooms 
had been funded through the Reserve Fund at the request of his country. The receptor binding 
assay based on nuclear techniques had proved to be superior to the conventional mouse 
bioassay in terms of speed of detection and sensitivity to lower levels of saxitoxins in 
shellfish and was now a nuclear application that was spreading to other places. At the recent 
World Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg, the Agency had presented 
the technology as one of its partnership initiatives in support of Agenda 21. 
175. Agency technical assistance had also facilitated other recent strides in nuclear 
applications in his country, including an 80% increase in neonatal screening for congenital 
hypothyroidism and the establishment of the first positron emission tomography centre in 
South East Asia. By way of a contribution to technical co-operation among developing 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 34 

countries, the Philippines had hosted eight training events and received six fellows and 
scientific visitors in 2001. 

176. His country attached particular importance to radiation safety because medical practices 
involving the use of ionizing radiation were the largest contributor to human exposure to 
radiation from man-made sources. The Philippines was currently engaged in activities under 
milestone 3 of the AgencyÂs Model Project on radiation protection, which were being 
undertaken jointly with the concerned professional groups and associations, and it was 
participating in the regional RCA project on radiation protection, which complemented the 
activities of the Model Project. He had learnt with disappointment that core funding from the 
Agency for the RCA project was to be discontinued, and he wished to request that the 
decision be reconsidered in view of the value of the activities involved, such as 
intercomparison exercises. 
177. Noting the International Action Plan for the Radiological Protection of Patients 
contained in document GC(46)/12, he reported that the recommendations of the 2001 Malaga 
Conference were being implemented in the Philippines, taking into account local 
circumstances. With regard to the goal of dose reduction, Agency guidance documents were 
being used in the review and revision of relevant regulations. 
178. Having participated in the Conference on Occupational Radiation Protection held in 
Geneva in August 2002, his delegation maintained that the few new aspects that had been 
suggested for incorporation into the existing system of radiological protection did not justify a 
major change in the current ICRP recommendations, from the point of view of both 
practicality and ease of adoption, especially in a developing country such as the Philippines. 
179. Ms. BRIDGE (New Zealand) said that the terrorist attacks on the United States of 
America on 11 September 2001 had led to increased emphasis on the physical protection of 
nuclear materials and, indeed, on nuclear safety and security and nuclear safeguards in 
general. The AgencyÂs programme of new and expanded measures against nuclear terrorism 
had rightly occupied a great deal of Member StatesÂ attention over the last year. 
180. New Zealand fully supported the AgencyÂs initiative of establishing the NSF for 
activities to combat terrorism. She was pleased to announce that her country would 
contribute 25 000 New Zealand dollars to the Fund as a demonstration of its commitment to 
the global anti-terrorist effort and its confidence in the Agency. 
181. Two years had passed since the 2000 NPT Review Conference, at which the five 
nuclear-weapon States had undertaken to eliminate their nuclear arsenals. Unfortunately, 
however, little progress had been achieved in that direction. A few days before, at the 
General Assembly, her country and the other members of the New Agenda Coalition had 
expressed their dissatisfaction at that lack of progress, as well as their concern about the 
development of new kinds of nuclear weapons. 
182. The Review Conference had called upon all States to accede to the CTBT, which had a 
critical role to play in the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The New Zealand Foreign 
Minister had been one of the authors of a joint ministerial statement, issued at the General 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 35 

Assembly, in which the ministers had personally committed themselves to working for the 
entry into force of the CTBT as soon as possible. 

183. One of the AgencyÂs most important functions was to implement the safeguards 
agreements entered into by the States Party to the NPT. However, some countries had still 
not signed the NPT at all, and too many others had signed but had not yet concluded 
safeguards agreements. She also urged those countries which had not yet done so to conclude 
additional protocols with the Agency. 
184. There was one country in her region which had both signed the NPT and concluded a 
safeguards agreement, but had failed to fulfil its obligations, namely the DPRK. She called 
upon the Government of that country to allow the Agency to verify the declaration of nuclear 
material dating from 1992, which would allow work to proceed on the KEDO light water 
reactor. There had been recent positive signs that verification might be allowed to proceed in 
the near future. 
185. Her country was likewise concerned that Iraq was failing to fulfil its international 
obligations under Security Council resolution 687 and other associated resolutions. Unless 
Iraq allowed weapons inspectors back into the country, the Agency would be unable to give 
the required assurances that Iraq was fulfilling its obligations under those resolutions. Her 
country welcomed IraqÂs recent announcement that it would allow the weapons inspectors to 
return without preconditions and hoped that it would implement that decision in full and 
without delay. The failure of some parties to the NPT to fulfil their obligations could only 
undermine the Treaty itself and reduce confidence in international processes and the rule of 
law. 
186. One issue which was especially important to her delegation was the safe transport of 
radioactive material. Her Government felt strongly that it had an obligation to protect the 
populationÂs health, the environment and the national economy from the consequences of an 
accident or hostile incident during the transport of radioactive material by sea, no matter how 
small the risk might be. Shipments must be subjected to a comprehensive international 
regulatory regime which satisfied not only the shipping States, but also those States past 
whose shores the shipments were regularly sent and would continue to be sent for at least the 
next 10 years. At present, the shipping States were satisfied, but the coastal States were not. 
Her country was willing to work towards a mutually acceptable solution and looked forward 
to the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, to be held 
in Vienna in July 2003, which she hoped would achieve further progress. 
187. Mr. BADDOU (Morocco) acknowledged the AgencyÂs role in the preparations for 
the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and the contribution it had 
made to its various resolutions, which were a clear expression of the objectives set by the 
international community. 
188. Morocco had adopted a democratic and participatory approach to the threats of drought 
and desertification which it, along with many countries in its region, was facing. Aware of 
the urgent need to protect the environment and biodiversity, it welcomed the role the Agency 
played in that regard and called on the entire international community to fulfil its 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 36 

commitments so as to ensure sustainable development for all. His country was proud to have 
hosted a series of international meetings on those issues, including the seventh session of the 
Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC. 

189. Despite the determination shown by Morocco and the other countries of the South, their 
aspirations to sustainable development remained dependent on a universal sense of shared 
responsibility. If they were to bear fruit, those countriesÂ efforts and sacrifices would have to 
be backed up by a global strategy involving the entire international community. The Agency 
was undoubtedly one of the major organizations that could help to achieve that. He therefore 
encouraged it to continue promoting the appropriate use of nuclear technology and 
applications to assure the sustainable development of those countries. 
190. The tragic events in the Middle East and the unbearable suffering of the Palestinian 
people in particular troubled the universal conscience and aroused serious concerns. With the 
exception of Israel, all the Middle Eastern countries were party to the NPT, and most had 
signed safeguards agreements. It was morally unacceptable for a country to flout all the 
relevant Security Council resolutions, jeopardizing world peace and stability. He called on 
the international community to take the measures necessary for the region to be declared a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
191. His delegation was relieved by the Iraqi GovernmentÂs decision to abide by the relevant 
Security Council resolutions and allow inspections to recommence without preconditions. 
That move would contribute to re-establishing trust in the region and reinforce the role of the 
international authorities in maintaining peace. 
192. Morocco saw the AgencyÂs mandate regarding nuclear security as fundamental and 
supported unreservedly the action plan adopted by the Board of Governors. It had also 
recently transmitted to the Director General the instruments of ratification of the CPPNM. 
193. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy undoubtedly had to comply with Agency safety 
standards, but setting those standards was not enough - they also had to be understood and 
above all implemented. To help the Agency provide the training that would be required, 
Morocco had made its National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology 
available for a graduate course on radiological safety and waste safety for French-speaking 
countries. Morocco would also host the AgencyÂs International Conference on National 
Infrastructures for Radiation Safety in September 2003. Moreover, with the AgencyÂs 
assistance, it had begun drafting a nuclear law which would unify and homogenize the 
existing legal infrastructure and establish a regulatory authority. 
194. Mr. TABIBIAN (Armenia) said that the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 
had revealed a threat not only to the United States of America, but to all the countries of the 
world, a threat which must be met with international solidarity. Among the most potentially 
devastating risks posed by the new situation was that related to nuclear security. The Agency 
must be even more vigilant than before. Nuclear facilities and radioactive materials could 
only be protected if there was maximum co-operation within the nuclear community. As the 
Director General had recently pointed out, the international regime for the physical protection 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 37 

of nuclear material and facilities required further strengthening. His country fully supported 
the AgencyÂs action plan to combat nuclear terrorism. 

195. Nuclear power was one of ArmeniaÂs main energy sources, proving 35% of the 
countryÂs electricity. Over the last decade, in view of a continuous blockade of the countryÂs 
borders by two of its neighbours, Azerbaijan and Turkey, the Government had concentrated 
on resolving its immediate energy supply problems rather than on medium- or long-term 
solutions. 
196. Armenia saw many advantages in nuclear power: it had environmental benefits 
compared with fossil fuels and a predictable cost structure which did not fluctuate with 
variations in fuel prices, and it helped the country to diversify its energy sources. With its 
land-locked situation, lack of domestic fuel sources and vulnerability to pressure from other 
countries, Armenia could not abandon nuclear power unless there was a genuinely reliable 
and affordable alternative. 
197. The Agency was helping his Government to develop a national master plan for energy 
as part of a technical co-operation project on energy and nuclear power planning. His country 
would help the Agency in its turn by specifying user requirements as inputs for research into 
innovative reactor design and more efficient fuel cycle utilization. Such solutions would, he 
hoped, increase the attractiveness of nuclear power, compared with other sources of energy, 
for developing countries such as his own. 
198. Armenia attached great importance to improving the legal framework for nuclear safety 
and non-proliferation. The National Assembly would debate the ratification of an additional 
and a supplementary protocol and the CTBT at its forthcoming autumn session. The 
Government was likewise considering acceding to the Joint Convention. It had already acted 
to improve the safety and security of spent fuel: a dry storage facility, built by the French 
company Framatome and financed by the French Government, had come into operation 
in 2000. 
199. Commenting upon remarks made by the delegate of Azerbaijan in the Plenary the 
previous day3, he said that the Agency owed its effectiveness to its technical and scientific 
competence, the transparency of its operations and the objectivity of its assessments, but also 
to its efforts to remain above political controversy. He was therefore disappointed to note that 
AzerbaijanÂs recent accession to the Agency had not given it a sense of moderation or 
responsibility, but had merely provided it with yet another forum in which to criticize 
Armenia. In reply to AzerbaijanÂs specific accusations about the safety and security of 
ArmeniaÂs nuclear facilities, he could state that the Armenian nuclear power plant and all 
activities related to it had been subjected to the most thorough safety evaluation. Since 1994, 
some 30 missions from the Agency and elsewhere, involving over 100 experts and inspectors 
each year, had examined every aspect of ArmeniaÂs nuclear energy programme. Azerbaijan 
had been invited to join those inspections. Its constant repetition of the same accusations 
could only be a sign of bad faith. 
See GC(46)/OR.2, paras 42-52.

page 38 

200. A recent IRRT mission had assessed the activities of the Armenian Nuclear Regulatory 
Agency and found it to be acting entirely within its mandate. Several of the missionÂs 
recommendations were being taken into consideration. Armenia had presented its national 
report to the second Review Meeting under the Nuclear Safety Convention, which had 
concluded that Armenia had fulfilled all relevant requirements. Measures had also been 
recommended to increase safety at the Medzamor nuclear power plant, and Armenia was 
preparing a safety analysis report with the assistance of the United States Department of 
Energy. The Armenian Government was seeking funds for improvements to unit 2 of the 
plant, and the construction of a new nuclear power plant was under consideration. 
201. Turning to technical co-operation, he said that Armenia had undertaken a number of 
training and other projects with the Agency. Its CPF had been signed in May 2001, and five 
additional projects arising from it would be implemented in 2003-2004. Armenia participated 
in all regional technical co-operation initiatives related to nuclear energy and nuclear safety, 
including the Model Project on national regulatory control and occupational radiation 
protection programmes, which had enabled it to upgrade its national infrastructure 
significantly. 
202. Mr. TAVARTKILADZE (Georgia) welcomed the IAEAÂs continued work in the 
area of radiation safety. Georgia had become a member of the Agency in 1997 and by 1999 
had established, under the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, a 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety Service for the regulation and control of nuclear activities. 
Within a short time and with Agency assistance, laws and documents permitting the effective 
regulation of radiation source management had been drawn up. 
203. One of GeorgiaÂs main problems was the presence of orphan sources. That had led to 
incidents such as the one at Lilo involving caesium-137 sources and the discovery of 
strontium-90 thermoelectric generators in Svaneti where an environmental disaster had only 
been avoided thanks to Agency assistance. Unfortunately it was not known how many other 
such sources might still be in Georgia. An airborne gamma survey of Western Georgia 
in 2000 in conjunction with IAEA and French experts had uncovered an orphan source in a 
residential area. Similar work was also planned for the Abkhazia area under the auspices of 
the Agency and with assistance from France, the United States of America and India; two 
large areas had already been surveyed and several radiation sources rendered harmless. 
204. At the Georgian Academy of Sciences, a detailed plan had been drawn up for bringing 
the research reactor into a safe condition, a project which had succeeded through joint efforts. 
205. The storage of radioactive waste remained a key issue, which the Government planned 
to resolve by establishing a repository in Eastern Georgia. High priority would be given to its 
construction, as over 200 orphan sources were already in temporary storage that did not meet 
minimum international safety standards. Work financed by the United States was currently 
under way to improve the storage conditions. Donor countries such as France and the United 
States, as well as the IAEA, would help to equip the repository, whose construction would 
also help prevent terrorist use of highly radioactive sources. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 39 

206. Georgia was developing a legislative basis for the effective regulation of nuclear and 
radiation activities and had already adopted a law and national standards, based on 
international standards, to govern nuclear and radiation safety, as well as a regulatory protocol 
on licensing. Laws on the transport and storage of radioactive materials had been drafted and 
should be adopted soon. Georgia hoped for continued IAEA support in all areas including the 
development of the infrastructure for a regulatory authority. 
207. Turning to the subject of illicit trafficking, he said that more than 4 kg of smuggled 
uranium had been confiscated in Georgia since 1999. Special attention would be paid to that 
matter, particularly in view of GeorgiaÂs location. In that connection, the existence of some 
separatist-occupied areas which the Government did not control was a cause for concern, 
especially in view of the recent attacks on the United States. Thus Georgia felt a great 
responsibility to the international community to ensure security and hoped to strengthen 
co-operation with all countries and the IAEA in organizing the active prevention and control 
of trafficking in nuclear materials. The Government of Germany, through the IAEA, had 
recently given Georgia a mobile laboratory for radiation monitoring, an example of 
international co-operation to ensure radiation safety in developing countries. Given such 
co-operation, the Great Silk Route, which passed through Georgia, would help bring about not 
only economic development, but also political stability in the entire Caucasus region, and the 
Director GeneralÂs visit to Georgia had encouraged hopes of further fruitful co-operation as 
well. 
208. For its part, Georgia would do everything possible to embark on a payment plan to meet 
its financial obligations to the Agency; the first steps had already been taken. He trusted that 
GeorgiaÂs voting rights would be restored, as that would act as a stimulus for further efforts. 
209. Mr. VARGAS CARREÃO (Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 
Latin America and the Caribbean) welcomed CubaÂs decision to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
That meant that all States in Latin America and the Caribbean would be OPANAL members 
and that the Treaty would enter into force for all the countries in the denuclearized zone 
established by the Treaty. 
210. While the Treaty and its additional protocols ensured the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, preventing what could have become a 
dangerous arms race there and contributing to global peace and security, greater progress 
would be made if a standard in international law could be established as a jus cogens 
prohibiting the use and threat of using such weapons. The Tlatelolco Treaty had set a good 
example, leading to the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones in the South 
Pacific, South East Asia and Africa. The four zones covered some 110 States, over half of the 
international community, and negotiations were under way to establish a fifth zone in the 
Central Asian republics. Mutual co-operation among the zones and with the United Nations, 
the various disarmament fora and the IAEA was needed in order to establish a common policy 
towards potential owners of nuclear weapons. Accordingly, OPANAL believed it would be 
useful and important to hold an international conference of States party to nuclear-weaponfree 
zones, with IAEA participation. 

GC(46)/OR.4 
page 40 

211. The main objective of the Tlatelolco Treaty - to ensure that nuclear materials and 
facilities were only used peacefully - could not be met without an effective system of control, 
safeguards and verification. Such a system was provided for in the Treaty and in the bilateral 
or multilateral agreements with the IAEA required by it. In the spirit of the greater 
co-operation with the IAEA sought by OPANAL, a regional seminar to promote additional 
protocols for strengthened safeguards had been held in Lima the previous year. 
212. OPANAL applauded the efforts made by the IAEA to improve nuclear security in the 
wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001. For its part, OPANALÂs General Conference had 
adopted a resolution calling on the Latin American and Caribbean States to take measures to 
prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear materials for terrorist and other non-peaceful purposes and 
to increase the security of their installations and nuclear material. 
213. OPANAL also welcomed the decision to hold an International Conference on the Safety 
of Transport of Radioactive Material, a matter of great importance to several States in the 
region, and he was sure that the conference would contribute towards filling legislative gaps 
in that area. 
The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. FRANIC 
(Croatia) said that his country had always used nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes and conducted related activities in full compliance with the AgencyÂs goals. 
Supporting the statement made by the delegate of Denmark on behalf of the European Union, 
he said that the 2001 agreement on stabilization and association between the European Union 
and Croatia had given new impetus to mutual co-operation and fostered the harmonization of 
Croatian legislation with EU standards. 
2. Croatia had been among the first countries to bring additional protocols to their 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency into force. It had also been one of the 
first to accept the amendment to Article VI of the Statute and he called on all Member States 
that had not yet ratified that amendment to do so to enable its early entry into force. 
3. Croatia, aware of how important financial contributions were for the Agency to fulfil its 
mandate, had again paid its contributions in full and on time. 
4. He expressed appreciation for the wide range of projects that were being conducted in 
Croatia under the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme. Worthy of special mention 
was the ongoing project on the use of nuclear technology in landmine detection, which could 
make a valuable contribution to demining processes worldwide. Croatia had proposed six 
projects under the technical co-operation programme aimed at making peaceful use of nuclear 
technologies, reinforcing the infrastructure for nuclear and radiological safety, as well as 
combating the illegal use of nuclear material and trafficking therein. Also, it had recently 
concluded a Country Programme Framework, a highly useful project planning tool. 
5. Experts at Croatian research institutions and universities were actively co-operating in 
training activities within the framework of the technical co-operation programme, both at 
home and abroad. He invited the Agency to make greater use of his countryÂs capacity in that 
regard. In future, Croatia intended to focus on education in nuclear sciences and the 
management of nuclear knowledge in order to strengthen its expert base and also to promote 
public interest. 
6. Following protracted disputes over the operation of the KrÂko nuclear power plant 
arising from the new independent status of Croatia and Slovenia, the joint owners of the plant, 
the two countries had signed in December 2001 an agreement regulating the status of - and 
other legal relations in connection with - investments in and the operation and 
decommissioning of the plant. While Croatia had already ratified that agreement, SloveniaÂs 
ratification was still pending. Given the importance of the agreementÂs implications for 
safety, he urged Slovenia to proceed without delay. 
7. Ms. MÃLLER (Germany), having associated her country with the statement 
delivered by the representative of Denmark on behalf of the European Union, said that one 
year after the terrorist attacks on 11 September the Agency was proceeding with its 
comprehensive action plan to counter nuclear terrorism. That action plan would help States to 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 4 

improve and upgrade the physical protection of their nuclear facilities and materials without 
diminishing in any way the primary responsibility of nations in matters of security. Her 
country had provided cost-free experts to the Agency in support of the action plan and it 
hoped to make a major contribution to the special fund in 2003. 

8. The nuclear terrorism threat had had an impact on safeguards. The AgencyÂs safeguards 
system was expected to provide an assurance that nuclear materials remained devoted to 
peaceful purposes and that clandestine nuclear weapons programmes were not being pursued. 
The Agency had an important role to play in preventing nuclear material from falling into the 
hands of terrorists. Her country supported all initiatives to review the Agency's safeguards 
system, to strengthen it further and to make it more flexible and cost-efficient. Germany 
urged all States to make the non-proliferation system universal and effective. 
9. Noting with satisfaction the reports submitted by the Director General in the field of 
nuclear safety, she welcomed the progress made towards the establishment of a research 
reactor safety plan. All States with research reactors should take an active part in enhancing 
that plan. Also, Germany had followed with interest the implementation of the revised Action 
Plan for the Safety and Security of Radiation Sources and appreciated the progress made with 
regard to the safe transport of radioactive materials. It continued to accord particular attention 
to radioactive waste safety management activities and assured the Secretariat of its full 
support in organizing the international conference on safe decommissioning for nuclear 
activities scheduled for October 2002 in Berlin. It was vital that future generations did not 
inherit such environmental liabilities as nuclear waste which had not been properly and safely 
managed. 
10. Education and training in nuclear safety, including waste safety, were also important 
and Germany was determined to maintain the level of its contribution to training courses, 
despite increasing domestic budgetary problems. In spite of those problems, Germany had 
been able to join the consensus on the compromise proposal for the level of funding for 
technical co-operation activities. 
11. Her Government saw an urgent need for quick and sustainable action in the 
management of nuclear knowledge, the eradication of disease-bearing insects in Africa and 
the application of isotope hydrology in Central America. It also supported the INPRO project 
to which it was providing cost-free experts. 
12. In conclusion, she said that Germany would continue its long-standing co-operation 
with the Agency, which would remain the main partner and reference institution for many of 
her countryÂs concerns about safety and security at nuclear installations and the safeguarding 
of nuclear material. 
13. Mr. AL-JANABI (Iraq) observing that Iraq had been positively co-operating with 
the Agency over the years in all its activities, said the Agency should, for its part, comply 
with its obligations under Article II of its Statute. For example, it had suspended approved 
technical co-operation projects and failed to provide any assistance for the decontamination 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 5 

and elimination of the consequences of depleted uranium used in Iraq and for the treatment of 
radioactive waste, activities which were regarded as priority areas for the Agency. 

14. Iraq had fully complied with the requirements contained in paragraphs 12 and 13 of 
section C of Security Council resolution 687(1991). The Director General had stated in his 
report to the Security Council (contained in document S/2001/337 of 6 April 2001) that the 
few remaining questions and concerns did not prevent the Agency from moving to the stage 
of full implementation of the ongoing monitoring and verification plan and that they could be 
dealt with during implementation of the plan. Similar statements had been made in 
subsequent reports by the Director General to the Security Council (document S/2002/367 of 
16 April 2002) and to the General Conference (GC(46)/13). 
15. Experience showed that the best and only way of resolving problems was to hold 
unconditional businesslike discussions, and that was what Iraq had been urging for a long 
time. The United Nations had responded to that call in the present year and three meetings 
had taken place, attended by IraqÂs Minister of Foreign Affairs and a number of high-level 
experts. Thereafter an invitation had been issued to the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC to 
visit Baghdad with a view to arriving at an optimum solution in the matter of finalizing the 
disarmament requirements contained in section C of resolution 687. In spite of IraqÂs good 
will, both the United States of America and the United Kingdom had persisted in waging a 
hostile media campaign on the pretext that Iraq was manufacturing weapons of mass 
destruction using its installations and capabilities, although they knew that those installations 
had been destroyed by them more than once and been subjected to continued inspections and 
monitoring over many years. Nevertheless Iraq had invited the British Government to send a 
technical delegation to visit those installations. The Iraqi National Assembly had also invited 
the American Senate and House of Representatives to those installations together with any 
experts they wished. IraqÂs letter of 16 September 2002 to the United Nations 
Secretary-General about permitting the unconditional return of the United Nations weapons 
inspectors was definite proof of the absence of weapons of mass destruction and of its 
co-operation in implementing the Security Council resolutions. In return, Iraq asked the 
Security Council and the international organizations concerned to discharge their obligations 
towards Iraq under the Security Council resolutions in an effective manner and ensure the 
lifting of the embargo imposed unjustly on Iraq eleven years previously. 
16. The world was trying to eliminate the dangers of nuclear weapons and the threat of their 
use since they created situations of conflict in many regions. The Middle East was unstable 
because of the nuclear threat resulting from IsraelÂs failure to heed legitimate international 
appeals to sign the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
Furthermore, it had undermined the credibility of that Treaty and of the safeguards system 
when in 1981 it had attacked Iraqi nuclear installations under safeguards. That attack had 
been condemned by the Security Council in resolution 487(1981) demanding that Israel place 
its nuclear installations under Agency safeguards. However, Israel had refused to obey that 
resolution just as it had rejected those of the General Conference. The only solution to the 
problem of restoring security in the Middle East was to apply paragraph 14 of Security 
Council resolution 687(1991) and establish a zone free from weapons of mass destruction. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 6 

17. The United States of America was conducting itself according to an immoral code, 
divorced from the logic of international relations and laws and ignoring national sovereignty 
and security. For thirteen years it had been subjecting Iraq to daily attacks against civilian 
installations and inflicting numerous casualties. Was that not a violation of international law 
and of the principle of respect for the sovereignty of States? 
18. Iraq had the right to demand that the Security Council fulfil its obligations by lifting the 
embargo, giving effect to paragraph 14 of its resolution 687(1991) and eliminating from the 
Middle East the Zionist threat posed by IsraelÂs arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and 
development of its spy satellite capabilities. 
19. The AgencyÂs safeguards statements on the physical inventory in Iraq in 2000, 2001 and 
2002 indicated that the nuclear material was secure and that the material inventory was 
consistent with the records. The Agency should therefore resume normal relations and restore 
to Iraq its rights and privileges as a member of the Agency, including implementation of the 
technical co-operation projects approved for 1999-2000 and 2001-2002, which had been 
suspended by an unfair decision dictated by the United States of America and the United 
Kingdom to the Security Council Sanctions Committee. It should also respond to IraqÂs 
numerous requests for assistance not only in cleaning up the contamination resulting from the 
attacks on Iraqi nuclear facilities and the use by United States and British forces of hundreds 
of tons of depleted uranium missiles in 1991, but also for participation by Iraqis in Agency 
training courses. The Agency had referred those requests to the Sanctions Committee, which 
was known for its obstruction of any measure that would benefit the Iraqi people and which, 
succumbing to United States pressure, applied double standards. 
20. The United States was focusing world attention on nuclear terrorism to serve its own 
political interests, forgetting that it was itself a pioneer in the field. It had used nuclear 
weapons in 1945, bombed Iraqi nuclear reactors in 1991 and used depleted uranium during its 
attacks against Iraq in 1991 and Kosovo in 1999 causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. 
21. The continuation of the unjust embargo against Iraq, the persistently hostile attitude of 
the United States and the United Kingdom and the position taken by them on the Sanctions 
Committee had led to import bans on vital medicines and medical supplies, to aggravation of 
the sufferings of the Iraqi people, to more than 1 670 000 deaths - mostly children, to an 
increase in mortality from chronic diseases to 100 752 in 2001, compared to 20 224 in 1999, 
and a higher incidence of cancers owing to serious environmental deterioration. The traces of 
depleted uranium which had been detected by Iraqi scientists in the bodies of martyrs and 
injured only added to the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people. 
22. He hoped that the Conference would shoulder its responsibilities in respect of the 
aspirations of Member States, especially the developing ones which were trying to utilize the 
benefits of nuclear techniques for development and progress, and also that it would reject the 
unfair double standards which the dominant States were imposing on the Agency to achieve 
their hostile political aims.

23. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen), having reiterated YemenÂs strong condemnation of all 
acts of terrorism, said his country supported all international, regional and national activities 
to promote the peaceful applications of atomic energy, nuclear, radiation, transport and waste 
safety, and the strengthening of the safeguards system and its expansion to include all States 
without exception so as to ensure peace and security, justice and equality for all peoples. 
Yemen supported the measures being taken by the Agency to combat illicit trafficking in 
nuclear material and radiation sources and to strengthen the physical protection of such 
material and sources. 
24. He expressed particular concern about the physical protection of primary radiation 
sources, on which subject Yemen had presented a paper at the International Conference of 
National Regulatory Authorities with Competence in the Safety of Radiation Sources and the 
Security of Radioactive Material held in Buenos Aires in December 2000. At the 
International Conference on the Security of Material held in Stockholm in May 2002, Yemen 
had proposed a system of identification of primary radiation sources. At the 45th session of 
the General Conference, his delegation had stressed the need for a new resolution on the 
topic.1 It was therefore a matter of satisfaction for Yemen that it was a co-sponsor with amongst 
others - all the countries of the European Union and the United States of America, of 
a draft resolution on nuclear security, which included a reference to orphan sources.2 
25. Yemen advocated nuclear disarmament, elimination of the causes of tension and the 
promotion of mutual understanding and co-operation between States. It endeavoured to 
remove injustice and to help the weak to secure their legal rights under international law and 
the United Nations Charter. Reaffirming his countryÂs stand against war and military 
intervention, he welcomed IraqÂs declaration about the unconditional acceptance of Agency 
inspectors. He hoped that as a result the present crisis would be defused, reason would 
prevail and the children of Iraq would be saved from the ordeal they had been suffering. 
26. In accordance with its obligations under the NPT, Yemen had recently ratified the 
safeguards agreement it had signed with the Agency in 2000. It considered it important that 
all the worldÂs nuclear installations should be under Agency safeguards. In that context, 
Yemen reiterated its demand that Israeli nuclear activities should be subject to international 
norms and that no double standards should be applied. Recalling the suffering of the 
Palestinian Arab people under the merciless Israeli occupation, he said there was no justice 
when 120 000 olive trees had been uprooted, 3576 homes demolished and 40 000 Palestinians 
expelled in the course of just one year. Nor was it justice to fire bullets at children and 
unarmed people, to deprive civilians of food, water and electricity, to detain people in 
concentration camps, to prevent ambulances from reaching their destination, to wipe out 
Palestinian villages, and to destroy churches and mosques. Israel possessed every weapon of 
mass destruction. 
27. Yemen highly valued the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. In particular, it 
welcomed the establishment of ARASIA, uniting countries with common problems.

28. Mr. KAKODKAR (India) noted that the balance the Agency maintained among 
its statutory functions was central to the universal support it enjoyed. 
29. With reference to the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development, he expressed 
regret that unfounded misconceptions still prevailed about nuclear power. Its great potential 
for meeting long-term worldwide energy needs without any significant environmental impact 
made it an inevitable option in view of the present state of development of energy 
technologies. Policy and opinion makers should realise what a positive contribution nuclear 
energy could make before it was too late. 
30. India, whose people constituted a sixth of the worldÂs population, had accorded high 
priority to the self-reliant development of nuclear power and had a strong indigenous 
capability in all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle. Eight reactors were under construction, 
including four 220 MW(e) and two 540 MW(e) PHWRs of Indian design and 
two 1000 MW(e) WWER units being set up in co-operation with the Russian Federation, 
altogether adding a further 3960 MW(e) to the grid. Construction was ahead of schedule and 
the design, construction and operation of all nuclear power plants in India was currently 
performed by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, one of the best managed 
companies in the country. The 14 units already in operation had registered an impressive 
85% overall average annual capacity in 2001 and had maintained an excellent safety record. 
Four of those reactors had been subject to a WANO peer review. The Indian 220 MW(e) 
units were the smallest commercially competitive units on the market and could be of interest 
to some developing countries. Also, India had signed a contract to supply a small quantity of 
heavy water to the Republic of Korea and its track record with respect to export controls and 
the fulfilment of its international obligations had been so exemplary that India had been 
described as a classic non-proliferator. India was making efforts to accelerate the 
development of nuclear power in the light of the need to reduce global carbon dioxide 
emissions. The restrictive export policies of certain countries could hinder those efforts and 
increase dependence on fossil fuels with the associated damage to the global environment. 
Proliferation concerns regarding external supplies to India were unfounded as such supplies 
would come under facility or supply specific safeguards. 
31. Turning to safety, he said that India had a good track record and the Atomic Energy 
Regulatory Board ensured that safety measures in all activities conformed to international 
standards. The Board had set up its own Safety Research Institute to supplement inputs from 
other national laboratories. Safety could not be divorced from technology, a link understood 
by experts while formulating the Convention on Nuclear Safety. Unfortunately, technologies 
continued to be denied even for systems important to safety. India had been one of the early 
signatories to that Convention and hoped that conditions would soon become conducive for it 
to go ahead with ratification. 
32. INPRO was an appropriate and timely activity to enhance nuclear power for the 
sustainable development of the world. India was convinced that innovative solutions would 
provide superior, cost-effective and comprehensive alternatives to the current approach which 
dealt with technology, safety and safeguards separately. India had taken an active part in 
INPRO and had also provided cost-free experts. The Indian Nuclear Society would dedicate a 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 9 

special session to INPRO during its 2002 annual conference and his delegation was happy 
that several Agency experts would be participating. The time had come for the INPRO 
programme to be funded from the AgencyÂs Regular Budget and not from extrabudgetary 
resources. 

33. The Agency had responded promptly to nuclear security needs following the events of 
11 September 2001, including setting up an Advisory Group on Nuclear Security. Though the 
prime responsibility for the security and safety of nuclear and other radioactive materials must 
rest with States themselves, the AgencyÂs additional activities could contribute meaningfully 
to protection against nuclear terrorism. Care should be taken to prevent undue apprehension 
about the safety of using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
34. India had acceded to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, 
reinforcing its commitment to international instruments against terrorism. Strict physical 
protection measures for nuclear material during its use, storage and transport had been in 
force in India for over four decades and were monitored by a multidisciplinary expert group. 
Those measures were being upgraded as technology advanced. An internal physical 
protection service also existed, with an appropriate human resource development programme. 
35. Orphan sources in many countries were a cause for concern. He was pleased that 
gamma radiation monitoring instruments developed and manufactured in India had been 
useful to the Agency in its operation to recover sources in Georgia. India had collaborated 
with the Agency in providing not only equipment, including an aerial gamma survey system, 
but also expert services for ground and aerial surveys to find orphan sources. 
36. Noting that technical co-operation was vital to the AgencyÂs relevance to many 
developing countries and that the Board of Governors had recently completed its negotiations 
on the TCF for 2003-2004 and the indicative planning figures for 2005 and 2006, he said it 
was essential that the TCF grew at least the same pace as the Regular Budget and that the 
budget formulation process be identical. Needless to say, India had always paid its 
contribution to the TCF target in full and on time. 
37. Knowledge management was an important issue and it was an appropriate one for the 
Agency to address. He had participated in a high-level meeting held by the Agency on that 
topic earlier in the year. It was also the subject of the 2002 Scientific Forum. The nuclear 
knowledge pool in India was very large and was growing in proportion to the development of 
the countryÂs nuclear energy programme. A knowledge-based holistic approach to the nuclear 
technology-society interface was needed. Also, the connections between society, industry and 
the national programme should be visible to higher education students so that they recognized 
the challenges and were motivated to find solutions. The distinction between the benefits of 
knowledge transfer on the one hand and technology transfer, which was subject to 
commercial constraints, on the other, should be made clear. 
38. In conclusion, he said that all technologies had associated problems. However, the 
solutions to those problems also lay in technology. That had already been demonstrated in 
such areas of human endeavour as energy, transport, material processing, food and human 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 10 

health. The work of the Agency demonstrated the immense potential of the use of nuclear 
knowledge and technology for sustainable development, and Member States shared a 
collective responsibility for ensuring the continuity of that work for global peace and 
prosperity. 

39. Mr. FIGUEROA (Argentina) said his country valued its co-operation with the 
Agency, which was a centre of excellence. 
40. Argentina was currently concentrating all of its efforts in the nuclear field on 
preserving - and even improving - the highly trained human and all the other resources it had 
accumulated in the hopes of more domestic favourable economic conditions and a renaissance 
in worldwide nuclear activity in the near future. 
41. The National Atomic Energy Commission had recently considerably increased the 
production of radioisotopes for medical and industrial use, which had previously been 
imported, with a view to satisfying national demand. The production of cobalt-60 sources had 
also increased and were being sold on the international market. Also, the Commission had 
finalized a national radioactive waste management plan which would be submitted to the 
National Congress for approval. It was continuing to implement the six main scientific and 
technological programmes comprising its strategic plan, which included projects and 
developments with respect to nuclear reactors, the fuel cycle, radioactive waste management, 
non-power energy applications and R&D in fundamental sciences and in nuclear related 
engineering and technology. 
42. ArgentinaÂs two nuclear power plants, both of which used domestically produced fuel 
elements and heavy water, were continuing to operate successfully. Although they accounted 
for only 5% of installed power, they contributed approximately 10% of the countryÂs total 
electricity production. 
43. Collaboration under the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme and ARCAL was 
ongoing. Argentina sponsored courses, workshops and scientific meetings, and provided not 
only training for Agency fellows and visiting foreign scientists but also many experts and 
lecturers. 
44. Argentina supported the AgencyÂs nuclear security activities which aimed to prevent 
acts of terrorism. International co-operation was vital to deal with that problem. Adherence 
to the nuclear non-proliferation regime was another essential requirement for better 
international security. In that context, the safety and security of radiation sources and 
radioactive materials was paramount and implementation of the AgencyÂs Action Plan for the 
Safety and Security of Radiation Sources was of great importance. He welcomed the fact that 
the Agency was convening an International Conference on the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material in 2003, which would facilitate international discussion of that issue. 
45. Argentina continued to co-operate actively in areas connected with the strengthening 
and integration of international safeguards. Truly integrated safeguards were essential, and 
not simply a combination of current measures and those included in the additional protocol. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 11 

The Agency should increase its co-operation with regional and national safeguards systems, 
particularly regarding traditional safeguards, in order to obtain a more effective and efficient 
system. 

46. ABACC had continued its verification activities with great success and transparency, 
and Argentina hoped that existing co-operation with the Agency would be strengthened. 
47. Progress had been made with regard to the additional protocol, with highly informative 
meetings having been held in conjunction with the Secretariat on its possible scope in the 
context of the Quadripartite Agreement. Clearly, application of that protocol would require 
due preparation by the parties concerned. 
48. Finally, he requested that there be no increase in the Regular Budget since many 
countries, like Argentina, were experiencing economic difficulties affecting their ability to 
pay contributions to the international organizations. 
49. Mr. BENDJABALLAH (Algeria) said that his country was committed to the 
efforts of the international community to combat terrorism following the events of 
11 September 2001. The African Union, at a high-level intergovernmental meeting on 
terrorism held in Algeria the previous week, had adopted a pan-African plan of action against 
terrorism and had decided to establish a centre for terrorism studies and research in Algiers. 
Algeria supported the AgencyÂs plan in that regard, adopted by the Board of Governors in 
March 2002, particularly the strengthening of measures for better protection of nuclear 
materials and facilities. Commitment by all Member States to the rigorous application of 
nuclear safety and security standards by acceding to and ratifying the relevant instruments 
would contribute to the prevention of nuclear terrorism. However, his delegation believed 
that Agency nuclear terrorism activities should not be implemented to the detriment of 
resources allocated to technical co-operation. 
50. In the light of the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development, Algeria 
commended the Agency's efforts to ensure international recognition of the role that nuclear 
power could play in sustainable development, and to promote the application of nuclear 
techniques in such key areas as water resources, health, agriculture, industry and the 
environment. 
51. Determined to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime, Algeria had just ratified the CTBT and was about to deposit the 
instruments of ratification. 
52. Algeria attached great importance to the Agency's activities in the areas of nuclear, 
radiation, transport and waste safety. In that connection it had begun the process for acceding 
to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and was preparing to ratify 
the Early Notification and the Assistance Conventions. 
53. Concerning technical co-operation, the recent visit of the Director General to Algeria 
had provided an opportunity for identifying ways of strengthening mutual ties and of 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 12 

improving the countryÂs human and material capabilities. That co-operation would be 
strengthened through the preparation of a Country Programme Framework and special 
emphasis was being placed on the management of water resources. 

54. The AFRA programme had developed significantly over the past year. In collaboration 
with the Agency, Algeria had organized several regional events in the areas of human health, 
radioactive waste management, non-destructive testing and the use of research reactors. It 
had also been responsible for organizing the 13th meeting of the AFRA Technical Working 
Group, and was now chairing the steering committee. The AFRA programme could prove an 
enriching and strengthening instrument for NEPAD. 
55. Algeria, which considered the AgencyÂs safeguards system to be one of the surest 
means of preventing the diversion of nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes, confirmed 
its intention to conclude subsidiary arrangements pursuant to its safeguards agreement with 
the Agency as soon as possible. 
56. His delegation deplored the fact that for a number of years there had been no progress 
made in the matter of the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East. That impasse 
had occurred because Israel, unlike all the other countries in the region, refused to accede to 
the NPT and to place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. It was very important 
that the Agency should do all it could to induce Israel to do so. He urged the Director General 
to continue his efforts aimed at organizing a forum for the creation of a nuclear-weapon-freezone 
in the Middle East. 
57. His delegation welcomed the recent developments with respect to Iraq, particularly the 
Iraqi authoritiesÂ readiness to readmit Agency inspectors without conditions. 
58. Algeria, which had already deposited its instrument of acceptance of the amendment to 
Article VI of the Agency Statute, urged all States which had not already done so to proceed 
with ratification in order to speed up its entry into force. 
59. Mr. HASSAN (Sudan), having thanked the Director General for visiting his 
country in December 2001, commended the AgencyÂs promotional work in the areas of 
health, agriculture, industry and water management, and its efforts to combat nuclear 
terrorism by promoting the conclusion of international agreements and compliance therewith. 
Sudan, which condemned terrorism in all its forms, welcomed the progress made on measures 
to protect against nuclear terrorism, as reported in document GC(46)/14. However, it was not 
in favour of financing such activities at the expense, or to the detriment, of the technical 
co-operation programme. 
60. The conclusion and ratification of additional protocols to safeguards agreements under 
the NPT were among the most important items on the AgencyÂs agenda, particularly after the 
events of 11 September 2001, and his country looked forward to progress being made in that 
regard. A universal approach was needed and Israel, the only nuclear State in the Middle 
East, should sign a safeguards agreement. To date it had provided only unconvincing excuses 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 13 

for not doing so. That would strengthen the efforts to establish in the Middle East a zone free 
from weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons. 

61. One factor detracting from the credibility and effectiveness of the international 
organizations was the exercise of a policy of double standards. In that context, his delegation 
welcomed IraqÂs response to the calls made by the Secretary-Generals of the United Nations 
and of the League of Arab States, by the Arab and Islamic countries and by other States to 
accept the unconditional return of the inspectors to carry out their functions. He hoped that 
that step would lead to a final solution based on dialogue and finally remove the spectre of a 
military solution. Sudan called on the Iraqi Government to co-operate with the United 
Nations in the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. It also urged the 
United Nations, the international community and Iraq to work together to achieve a solution at 
without delay that preserved the integrity and sovereignty of Iraq, that did not threaten 
security and stability in the region, and that put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people as 
soon as possible. 
62. Sudan commended the AgencyÂs technical co-operation work, which was particularly 
beneficial to the developing countries. It welcomed efforts to increase the budget of the 
technical co-operation programme and hoped that the latter would be financed from more 
assured resources under the Regular Budget instead of being dependent on donorsÂ 
contributions. He urged the donor countries to contribute more to the TCF and hoped for 
greater contributions from other regional and international funds to support Agency projects 
in developing countries. 
63. Noting the contribution of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme to 
improving capabilities in the areas of medicine, health, water, environmental health and 
nuclear and radiation safety, he said Sudan attached particular importance to regional sterile 
insect technique projects to eradicate the tsetse fly and the planning of a campaign against 
malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in all parts of Africa where they had a negative effect on 
socio-economic development. Its commitment had been demonstrated by the fact that a 
Sudanese technical group had participated in a regional meeting held in Vienna from 29 July 
to 2 August 2002 to discuss the progress of the tsetse fly eradication project. No longer 
affected by war, Sudan and Ethiopia were co-ordinating the start of work on eradication in 
areas near their common border, thus demonstrating that the prospects for regional 
co-operation between African countries were bright. His Government was willing to continue 
hosting African regional meetings under the technical co-operation programme. 
64. It was vital that all Member States met their financial obligation to the Agency. For its 
part and despite its difficult economic situation, Sudan was about to pay half of its assessed 
arrears and intended to pay the remainder before the end of the year. 
65. Mr. WALTHER (Norway) expressed support for the AgencyÂs action plan to 
combat nuclear terrorism. Norway had contributed US $130 000 to activities under that plan 
related to nuclear and radiation emergencies and had made experts available to the Agency. 
He stressed the importance of each Member State taking steps at the national level to secure 
nuclear and radioactive materials and to prepare for emergencies. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 14 

66. The Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention formed the basis for 
international co-operation in the event of a nuclear emergency. As the first step in enhancing 
the implementation of those Conventions, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority had 
convened a meeting in Oslo in May 2002 where a plan of action had been prepared to guide 
competent authorities and international organizations in following up the main 
recommendations from the first competent authoritiesÂ meeting held in Vienna in June 2001. 
His delegation urged other authorities to nominate experts to the working groups and to 
allocate resources to help the groups accomplish their tasks. Norway would be submitting a 
draft resolution to the General Conference on the enhanced implementation of both 
Conventions and hoped it would gain broad support.3 
67. Norway was concerned that the Agency had been unable to provide any assurances 
regarding IraqÂs compliance with its obligations and hoped that the letter from IraqÂs Foreign 
Minister to the United Nations Secretary-General would lead to such assurances being 
provided. 
68. There was a clear need to develop a framework for the protection of the environment 
from ionizing radiation and the Agency could play an important role in such work. In that 
context, Norway supported the omnibus resolution entitled ÂMeasures to Strengthen 
International Co-operation in Nuclear, Radiation, Transport and Waste SafetyÂ.4 
69. The challenges in north-west Russia were among NorwayÂs main concerns in the area of 
nuclear safety. Russia, which was decommissioning a large number of nuclear-powered naval 
vessels and safely conditioning and storing the radioactive waste and spent fuel, needed a new 
infrastructure for that purpose, requiring huge investments. Norway was participating in 
projects in the region and co-operating with the Russian authorities. Under the AgencyÂs 
auspices, a nuclear clean-up strategy for Russia was being drawn up with the co-operation of 
the Russian authorities within the Contact Expert Group. Support and assistance were being 
sought for a spent nuclear fuel and radwaste clean-up at the Andreyev Bay storage site in the 
Murmansk region. Norway had already started several infrastructure projects in the Andreyev 
Bay on a bilateral basis. 
70. Norway, the United States of America, the European Commission and a number of 
European Union countries had since 1999 been working on the establishment of a multilateral 
legal framework for the provision of assistance to nuclear safety-related projects in Russia 
through the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme for Russia. That Agreement 
would be vital for the multilateral funding and implementation of larger nuclear clean-up 
projects in the region and he therefore hoped that it would be concluded as soon as possible. 
71. Norway joined the United States of America in underlining the importance of new and 
expanding co-operation projects to address non-proliferation, disarmament, counter-terrorism, 
and nuclear safety issues. It therefore welcomed the newly established G-8 Global 
3 Subsequently adopted as resolution GC(46)/RES/9.D. 
4 Subsequently adopted as resolution GC(46)/RES/9. 


GC(46)/OR.5 
page 15 

Partnership which had pledged up to $20 billion for such projects and was willing to 
co-operate with the Partnership on nuclear safety and security projects in Russia. 

72. As a coastal nation dependent on the sustainable harvesting of living marine resources 
and on market confidence in the quality of those products, Norway attached great importance 
to the 1998 OSPAR Convention, which provided for progressive and substantial reductions in 
discharges of radionuclides into the ocean. Norway welcomed the fact that several parties to 
the Convention had now submitted their national plans for achieving the objectives of the 
OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances but was concerned that the onset of 
reductions might be deferred for several years. Discharges of radionuclides such as 
technetium-99 would remain high, or even increase, for several years so Norway urged 
Member States which were also parties to the Convention to take the necessary measures to 
reduce their discharges of technetium-99 and other radioactive substances into the marine 
environment sooner rather than later. 
73. Norway attached great importance to the safety and security of radioactive material 
transport, not least because such material was a potential target for terrorist attacks. It was 
also concerned about the effectiveness of liability mechanisms in the event of an accident 
during the maritime transport of radioactive material and called for further efforts to 
strengthen the relevant measures and regulations. 
74. The Model Additional Protocol made an important contribution to the enhancement of 
nuclear non-proliferation. The additional protocol to NorwayÂs safeguards agreement with 
the Agency had entered into force in May 2000 and the Agency had now decided to introduce 
the integrated safeguards system, making Norway the second country after Australia to use 
that system. Given that additional protocols had entered into force for only 28 States, he 
called on more countries to sign additional protocols and to speed up their ratification 
procedures in order to make the enhanced safeguards system as universal as possible. 
75. Export controls were also vitally important to nuclear non-proliferation. The Nuclear 
Suppliers GroupÂs requirement for full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply was a major 
step forward. National export controls were an important means of preventing non-State 
entities and terrorists from acquiring sensitive nuclear material and technology. Norway had 
taken several steps at the national level to strengthen its export control system. 
76. The Agency must continue to play a leading international role in managing and 
implementing legal instruments in the nuclear, radiation and radioactive waste safety fields. 
Norway had participated in the second review meeting of Contracting Parties to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and welcomed the substantial safety improvements made since 
the first review meeting. The Convention and its review process were important instruments 
for enhancing international nuclear safety. The Joint Convention was another important legal 
instrument and Norway looked forward to participating in the first review meeting to be held 
in 2003. 
77. Information exchange and strong international instruments were very important for the 
security of nuclear facilities and materials and other radioactive materials. Norway strongly 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 16 

supported the work being carried out to amend and strengthen the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material and hoped that it would soon reach a successful conclusion. 

78. Norway continued to support the TCF, paying its amount of the share of the target for 
voluntary contributions on time and in full. It urged all other countries to do the same. 
Technical co-operation projects were vital to the recipient countries and were part of the 
global effort to create a better balance between countries with respect to technical 
development. The main focus of activities should be on nuclear applications in such fields as 
agriculture, water resource management, human health and medicine, while nuclear power 
projects should concentrate on safety and security and the problems of waste and spent fuel. 
79. Mr. NOIRFALISSE (Belgium) said the Agency had once again demonstrated 
dynamism and expertise in executing its mandate within the resources available. It would 
continue to play an extremely important role for a long time notwithstanding the decision 
taken by certain countries to move away from nuclear energy in the short or medium term. 
Nuclear applications still provided the only effective solution to certain problems, especially 
in the field of medicine. Also, phasing out nuclear energy generation would have 
consequences for safety, radiation protection, security and non-proliferation. Moreover, 
current research to develop new reactors could open new horizons; reactors which produced 
less waste and were safer, more economical and more proliferation-resistant should mean a 
greater share for nuclear energy within a sustainable context, protecting the world for future 
generations. 
80. The second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety had been a success. It had shown that safety levels had risen in most States and had 
enabled greater transparency regarding national situations and difficulties encountered. The 
comparison of different national practices proved that diverse approaches could be taken to 
achieve common security objectives, a point that should be taken into account in future work. 
81. Safer management of nuclear installations meant paying particular attention to the 
ageing of nuclear power plants and to the preservation of knowledge. The ongoing Scientific 
Forum would be helpful in that respect. 
82. The results of the review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Nuclear Safety 
Convention served as a useful example for the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties 
to the Joint Convention, to be held in November 2003. Belgium was pleased to announce that 
it had ratified the Joint Convention on 2 August 2002. 
83. The NPT was the cornerstone of a universal and responsible security policy and Cuba's 
recent decision to accede to it was therefore encouraging. It was reassuring that, in 2001, the 
Secretariat had found no indication of diversion of nuclear material placed under Agency 
safeguards nor of misuse of facilities, equipment or non-nuclear material placed under 
safeguards. Such assurance was necessary both to develop the peaceful uses of the atom and 
to ensure collective security. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 17 

84. Belgium took note of Iraq's decision to allow the return of United Nations inspectors 
without conditions and saw it as an encouraging response to the efforts of the Secretary-
General to take all possible steps to avoid military action. Belgium continued to hope that a 
political solution could be found which would have a positive influence on relations between 
Iraq and the Agency, allowing the latter to discharge the mandate given to it by the Security 
Council. 
85. It was a matter of extreme urgency that the Agency start verification activities in the 
DPRK. Not only were they a fundamental obligation under the safeguards agreement, but 
they were also a prerequisite for delivery of the main nuclear components under the KEDO 
project. 
86. Belgium continued to attach particular importance to strengthening of the AgencyÂs 
safeguards regime, provided that did not lead to an increase in inspection effort. He therefore 
welcomed the finalization in 2002 of a conceptual framework for integrated safeguards, 
enabling consistent and non-discriminatory application in States with similar nuclear 
programmes. 
87. Belgium urged all States which had not already done so to sign and implement an 
additional protocol as soon as possible. The draft law for the ratification of BelgiumÂs 
additional protocol had been adopted by its parliament and was currently awaiting signature 
by the Head of State. 
88. His country appreciated the Director GeneralÂs swift response to the General 
ConferenceÂs request for a thorough review of the AgencyÂs activities and programmes with a 
view to strengthening work relevant to preventing acts of terrorism (resolution 
GC(45)/RES/14.B). The various measures foreseen by the Agency did not attempt to 
substitute the primary role of States, rather to supplement the measures they had already taken 
or, where necessary, to assist States in identifying and implementing such measures. His 
delegation wished to be regularly informed about implementation of the action plan and its 
budgetary implications. 
89. As an active participant in the work of the expert group responsible for amending the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, Belgium regretted that the group 
had not yet completed its task. He hoped that a consensus would be reached at the groupÂs 
forthcoming meeting in November. 
90. Nuclear electricity generation in Belgium in 2001 was more than 44 TWh (58% of total 
electricity production). The slight fall in production was due to an overhaul outage of 63 days 
at Tihange Unit No. 2. Three steam generators had been replaced in 17 days, something of a 
world record. The operational record of Belgian nuclear power plants remained excellent. 
91. For example, in 2001 the average load factor of all its plants was 88.1%, and on 
31 December 2001 Doel Unit No. 2 had been operating for 1317 days without an emergency 
shutdown.

page 18 

92. Under previously agreed reprocessing contracts, 104 MOX fuel assemblies had been 
fabricated and supplied to two Belgian nuclear power plants. However, the Government had 
now established a moratorium on the conclusion of new contracts and so measures had had to 
be taken to ensure the safe storage of spent fuel. Specialized buildings had been constructed 
at the Doel and Tihange sites; dry storage had been continued at Doel whereas wet storage 
had been chosen for Tihange. 
93. Belgium continued to seek solutions for the disposal of its radioactive waste. The 
storage of low-level or short-lived waste would be integrated into overall regional 
development using local partners in communities willing to accept such waste. With regard to 
medium- and high-level or long-lived waste, the PRACLAY project had demonstrated the 
economic and environmental feasibility of storing waste in clay. 
94. The Belgium Government had recently approved a draft law on phasing out nuclear 
electricity generation. It contained four important provisions: nuclear power plants would be 
decommissioned 40 years after their commissioning date; no new nuclear power plants could 
be constructed and/or put into operation; the electricity and gas regulatory commission 
(CREG) was responsible for supervising the security of the electricity supply and for 
formulating recommendations if that supply was jeopardized; and in the event that the 
security of supply were threatened, measures would have to be taken, without calling into 
question the decision to abandon nuclear energy, except in the case of force majeure. 
95. Following the liberalization of the electricity market, the Government had also taken a 
certain number of supplementary measures to ensure that the provisions for dismantling 
nuclear power plants and managing irradiated fissile material at those plants would, at the 
appropriate time, be both available and adequate. To that end, a draft law had been submitted 
to the Belgian parliament. 
96. The Federal Agency for Nuclear Control, which had become operational on 
1 September 2001, held responsibility in the fields of nuclear safety, radiation protection, 
safeguards and physical protection. Its establishment had allowed regulations in those areas to 
be updated in line with European Union directives and/or relevant international standards. 
97. In conclusion, he said that, in addition to its well-established role as a technical 
organization the International Atomic Energy Agency also had an essential part to play in 
ensuring peace and security in the world. 
98. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) commended the AgencyÂs efforts to promote the peaceful 
uses of atomic energy in the areas of medicine, agriculture, water, food, industry and energy, 
and nuclear non-proliferation and the contribution it made to international co-operation 
through, for example, the Early Notification and Assistance Conventions, and safety issues 
related to spent fuel and radioactive waste management. He also commended the positive role 
the Agency had played at the recent Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable 
Development. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 19 

99. He highlighted eight areas where the Agency should make greater efforts at the regional 
and international levels to enhance international co-operation. Firstly, it should prepare and 
put into effect international plans to strengthen the safety of nuclear material, reactors and 
other nuclear installations. Secondly, it should support training programmes on radiation 
protection by promoting the international action plan for the radiological protection of 
patients contained in document GC(46)/12, support States in their efforts to implement that 
action plan, and make greater efforts in the area of protecting the environment and human 
health against the hazards of radioactive contamination. Thirdly, the Agency should assist its 
Member States in controlling radioactive contamination of foodstuffs, structural material, 
agricultural products and consumer goods and in setting reference limits acceptable to 
consumers and industry. Fourthly, it should continue its training and qualification 
programmes for radiation and nuclear workers to develop their knowledge about radiation 
protection and other relevant areas. Fifthly, it should promote awareness programmes for 
laymen and decision-makers about nuclear energy and applications and co-operate with other 
competent international bodies to that end. Sixthly, the Agency should strengthen 
international co-operation in nuclear security with a view to preventing acts of terrorism 
which might use or be directed against nuclear and radiation devices or installations. The 
control and inspection bodies concerned in Member States needed help in operating radiation 
monitoring units capable of detecting transboundary smuggling or the presence of nuclear 
material that might be used for terrorist purposes. One way of achieving that objective was to 
establish regional or interregional projects on nuclear and radiation safety and security along 
the lines of the model projects on radiation protection and waste safety which were being 
implemented in many regions. While Jordan commended the AgencyÂs efforts in the area of 
combating nuclear terrorism, those activities should not be allowed to have a detrimental 
affect on the technical co-operation programme. Also, they should be financed on a voluntary 
basis outside the Regular Budget. Seventhly, the Agency should increase its efforts in the 
area of the safe transport of radioactive material. Jordan was looking forward to participating 
in the 2003 International Conference on the subject to be held in Vienna in July. Lastly, the 
Agency should continue to provide and ensure prompt assistance to Member States in the case 
of a nuclear accident or radiological emergency. He was grateful to the Secretariat for the 
useful work it had done in that area in the preceding year, enabling States to take appropriate 
protective measures. 
100. As the Agency could carry out its functions only if the necessary financial support was 
provided and it had assured funding for its technical co-operation activities, he urged Member 
States to honour their financial obligations and meet the targets set. 
101. Jordan supported efforts to apply comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in 
the Middle East with a view to establishing a zone free from nuclear and other weapons of 
mass destruction. Israel was the only State in the region which still refused to sign NPT and 
to accept full-scope safeguards for its facilities. That exposed the region to the dangers of a 
race to develop nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and jeopardized international 
peace and security. Jordan hoped that the Director GeneralÂs commendable efforts in that 
regard would meet with success, leading to a strengthening of peace and the non-proliferation 
regime. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 20 

102. Believing that Iraq should comply fully with the relevant Security Council resolutions, 
Jordan welcomed that countryÂs decision to allow an unconditional return of inspectors. It 
was a positive step towards the resumption of a constructive dialogue between the United 
Nations and Iraq, which should lead to the lifting of the sanctions, defuse the present crisis 
and spare Iraq and the region the calamity of war and destruction. 
103. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. 
Jordan had fulfilled all its non-proliferation commitments by signing and ratifying both the 
NPT and the CTBT. Furthermore, it had signed an additional protocol to its comprehensive 
safeguards agreement. He urged all States which had not yet ratified a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement to do so as soon as possible. 
104. He stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities to improve 
the scientific and technical capacities of the developing countries, and to achieve sustainable 
development. In that context, Jordan was looking forward to Agency support for the 
SESAME (Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) 
project, which had been approved by UNESCO as an interregional project. The Bessy-1 
facility had now reached Jordan from Germany and his Government was bearing the full cost 
of construction of a special building. 
105. Welcoming Agency approval of ARASIA, which would help the participating States 
develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and ensure its contribution to sustained 
development, he expressed the hope that the Agreement would fulfil its objectives. 
106. The Arab Atomic Energy Agency provided valuable assistance to its Member States in 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. However, it was suffering from a lack of resources, and 
he hoped that the Agency would provide support and co-operate with that body in order to 
help it implement its programmes. 
107. Mr. AL-ATHEL (Saudi Arabia), commending the AgencyÂs achievements 
in 2001, took note of the SecretariatÂs view that maintaining zero real growth in the budget 
did not allow for any expansion of programme activities. Thus, activities would have to be 
planned and implemented on a realistic basis in line with the financing abilities of Member 
States. 
108. In view of the fact that some advanced countries had given up their nuclear power 
option because of public apprehensions about the safety of nuclear installations and the safety 
of waste management, the Agency must continue both its safety-related work in order to 
restore the credibility of nuclear power and its comparative assessment of different energy 
resources for sustainable development. 
109. The technical co-operation programme was a means whereby the Agency achieved the 
basic purpose for which it was set up. It was a tool for disseminating scientific knowledge, 
transferring technology and creating national capabilities in Member States to facilitate 
peaceful nuclear applications. The method of financing the TCF did not, however, provide an 
assured volume of resources. Financing the TCF from the Regular Budget, as his country had 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 21 

proposed in the past, was a way of achieving that objective. Saudi Arabia, for its part, would 
continue to support the Fund by paying its assessed programme costs, and for 2003 it had 
made a voluntary contribution of $50 000 to the Fund. 

110. While the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the safeguards system and its appeal for 
universal application had met with a positive response from many States, there were still a 
few States which had not yet responded. 
111. In connection with the application of Agency safeguards in the Middle East, his 
delegation shared the Director GeneralÂs regret, expressed in his report contained in document 
GC(46)/9, that he had been unable to fulfil the mandate given to him by the General 
Conference, pursuant to resolution GC(45)/RES/18 and decision GC(44)/DEC/12, to continue 
consultations with a view to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. 
The Director General had attributed that to the prevailing political situation in the Middle East 
and had pointed out that the difficulties in his discussions with the States concerned in the 
region had been due to differences in their views about the mechanisms for nuclear 
disarmament. Nevertheless, the Director General should not relax his diligent efforts. Saudi 
Arabia was confident of a positive outcome once Israel saw reason and refrained from 
opposing world opinion with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. It was 
also difficult to continue the discussions on peace in the Middle East against the background 
of the repression and aggression being carried out by Israel in the Palestinian autonomous 
areas. One effect of the resulting escalation of tension was that it had prevented the meetings 
of the multilateral working group on arms control and regional security from being held on a 
regular basis since 1994. 
112. Over the past year, the Agency had expanded its activities to include the prevention of 
nuclear terrorism, leading to an increase in a number of programme activities and advisory 
services relating to strengthening the physical security of nuclear installations and materials, 
assistance in the prevention of illicit trafficking in nuclear materials, and the safe management 
and disposal of nuclear waste. It was recognized however, that the primary responsibility for 
combating nuclear terrorism lay with States themselves. His country hoped that the necessary 
extrabudgetary resources would be provided for the AgencyÂs action in that regard and 
stressed that those activities should under no circumstances be at the expense of its technical 
co-operation programme. 
113. Mr. LAANEMÃE (Estonia), having noted that the global fight against terrorism 
had dominated the international situation over the last year, said the Agency had an important 
role to play in the fight against nuclear terrorism. His country welcomed the SecretariatÂs 
prompt action in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks to elaborate proposals for 
protection against nuclear terrorism, and applauded those countries which had contributed to 
those activities. The additional activities were not new, simply an extension of existing 
nuclear safety and security activities. Bearing in mind, the AgencyÂs limited resources, the 
Director General should ensure full co-ordination between the relevant departments of the 
Secretariat and, in their turn, Member States should pay their Regular Budget contributions in 
full and on time. 

GC(46)/OR.5 
page 22 

114. His country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs technical co-operation programme, and 
intended to continue paying its contributions to the TCF. Estonia endorsed the key elements 
of successful technical co-operation as set forth in the 2002 Technical Co-operation Strategy 
Review (contained in document GOV/INF/2002/8), particularly Government commitment, 
consultations between Member States and the Agency during the planning stage and the 
conclusion of Country Programme Frameworks. EstoniaÂs Country Programme Framework, 
concluded in October 2001, laid down three priorities: strengthening of the regulatory 
infrastructure and activities; upgrading of radioactive waste management and radiation 
protection; and improving nuclear safety in medicine. His country intended to follow its 
provisions closely. 
115. He welcomed the AgencyÂs ongoing training activities in radiation protection, 
especially the safety of radiation sources and radioactive waste management. His country 
would continue to work towards implementation of the AgencyÂs safety standards in that area. 
116. Estonia continued to participate in the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities. A 
regional training course on nuclear cardiology for nuclear medicine physicians had been held 
in the capital, Tallinn, in October 2001. A regional workshop on the development of national 
legislation to fulfil StatesÂ obligations under the additional protocol had been held, also in 
Tallinn, in January 2002. The regional and subregional scope of the courses had allowed 
participants from different countries to exchange views and learn from both Agency experts 
and one another. Estonia would like to see further training made available in emergency 
preparedness, radiation and waste safety, and nuclear applications in medicine. 
117. Estonia was reviewing its legislation governing various aspects of the use of radioactive 
materials before it entered the European Union. It would fill in any gaps, eliminate 
duplication and bring the legislation into line with the countryÂs international obligations. It 
had received valuable assistance in that task from the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Safety 
Authority, the Swedish Nuclear Non-Proliferation Assistance Programme and the Swedish 
Radiation Protection Institute. 
118. Significant progress had been made in the rehabilitation of the former Soviet nuclear 
submarine training base in Paldiski. The conditioning of solid operational radioactive waste 
and the solidification of liquid operational waste had reached completion. Alara, the company 
in charge of the site, was now dismantling the former liquid radioactive waste processing 
plant. 
119. Estonia was still concerned about storage conditions in the two reactor compartments 
covered by sarcophagi. In 1999, a project on evaluation of management routes for the Paldiski 
sarcophagi had begun under the auspices of the European Union. Experts from Technicatome 
(France) and British Nuclear Fuels Limited (United Kingdom) had prepared an assessment of 
the status of the sarcophagi and proposed four different options for their future management. 
A group of experts would analyse those options and submit a strategy and action plan to the 
Government in due course. 
The meeting rose at 1.00 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his region was in a precarious state and 
co-operation and co-ordination among Member States were therefore essential in the 
international fight against nuclear proliferation. The international community should 
vigorously insist on StatesÂ compliance with their international commitments in that area, and 
efforts should be made to strengthen the AgencyÂs safeguards system. At earlier General 
Conferences, Israel had joined the consensus on the resolution on strengthening the 
effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system and application of the 
Model Additional Protocol, but certain changes introduced in the preceding year had made it 
impossible for it to continue to do so. Consensus on that resolution was more important than 
introducing divisive changes. 
2. The events of 11 September had highlighted the new terrorist threat. Israel knew from 
its own experience how devastating such attacks were, and an alarming correlation had 
emerged between States which were currently seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction 
and those which sponsored terrorism. There was an urgent need for effective measures to 
block the spread of weapons of mass destruction to terrorist groups and to States which 
supported them, and to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and radiation sources by 
reinforcing physical protection. The Agency had an important role to play in that context by 
assisting Member States with the establishment of a comprehensive physical protection 
regime. Israel was proud to have joined 78 other Member States in becoming a party to the 
Convention on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It also supported the AgencyÂs 
programme on nuclear terrorism to which it had contributed financially. Export control 
regimes were another tool for dealing with States which promoted proliferation and supported 
terrorist groups. Israel was currently finalizing its regulations for control of exports of nuclear 
and dual-use items, which were based on the NSG regime. 
3. In the area of nuclear power, a new balance was needed between addressing 
proliferation concerns and further development and improvement. In view of the global 
interest in fostering sustainable energy solutions, nuclear power plants could become more 
attractive. Some important developments had recently taken place in that respect in Western 
Europe and North America, and several reports suggested that nuclear energy should assume 
a growing share of total energy production in the 21st century. Refraining from disseminating 
nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure and technology could help address the proliferation risks 
posed by the growth in nuclear power. The challenge confronting the Agency was 
tremendous and should include not only the promotion of enhanced safeguards, but also the 
development of international arrangements concerning the supply of fresh nuclear fuel, the 
removal of spent fuel, and improvement of both the safety and proliferation resistance of 
nuclear reactors. Israel was confident that the Agency was well equipped to handle that issue. 
4. The agenda of the General Conference was well balanced. However, two draft 
resolutions concerning the Middle East stood out as extraneous to the AgencyÂs Statute and 
mission. Israel had made no secret of its fundamental reservations regarding the language and 
relevance of the resolution on application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East. However, 
it would join the consensus if it was based on consent because it recognized that a 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 6 

nuclear-weapon-free zone could eventually make an important contribution to overall peace 
and security in the region. By contrast, it saw no point and considerable danger in agenda 
item 21 on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat, an item first introduced by Iraq. There had 
been many dangerous proliferation developments in the Middle East and other regions in 
recent years, but none of them involved his country. Israel had neither threatened its 
neighbours nor acted in defiance of international commitments. Any action on that agenda 
item would make it impossible for Israel to join any consensus on the resolution on 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East. 

5. Finally, Israel's Atomic Energy Commission was celebrating its 50th anniversary that 
year and he thanked the Agency for its fruitful co-operation over the preceding 50 years and 
looked forward to positive developments in the forthcoming 50 years. 
6. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that the Agency had a key role to play in 
helping humanity maximize the benefits and minimize the risks from nuclear science and its 
applications. 
7. Her country had been co-operating closely with others to strengthen the global nonproliferation 
regime. The Czech parliament had recently ratified the countryÂs additional 
protocol and full implementation thereof was one of its highest administrative priorities. She 
urged those States that had not already to conclude similar protocols with the Agency as soon 
as possible. 
8. Supplier countries had a responsibility to ensure that co-operation activities did not 
contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and that principle had been reflected in the 
NPT and in the multilateral export control regimes. The NSG and the Zangger Committee 
both played an important role in supporting the NPT and non-proliferation in general, and the 
Czech Republic attached the highest priority to dialogue between the NSG and potential 
nuclear supplier countries, including those operating unsafeguarded nuclear installations. 
9. The Czech Republic supported the AgencyÂs activities aimed at countering nuclear 
terrorism, in particular by strengthening physical protection of nuclear material and facilities 
worldwide. It was considering making contributions in kind and financial contributions to the 
AgencyÂs anti-terrorist activities. 
10. It also hoped that the open-ended group of legal and technical experts would be able to 
conclude its work on a draft amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material by November so that a diplomatic conference could be held to approve it 
before the end of 2002. 
11. Non-power applications of nuclear technology in the fields of human health, food and 
agriculture, and the physical and chemical sciences could bring distinct economic and social 
benefits. Czech organizations and individual experts were actively involved in Agency 
technical co-operation programmes and other Agency-sponsored activities promoting the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and, as in previous years, the Czech Government had again 
allocated additional financial resources to support the AgencyÂs technical co-operation 
programme and had offered voluntary contributions to specific projects in Armenia, Georgia 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 7 

and Ukraine. The efforts that were being made to allocate technical co-operation funds 
efficiently to indispensable activities under major programmes were also appreciated. The 
results-based approach used for planning the 2004-2005 programme and budget was an 
appropriate mechanism for improving financial efficiency. 

12. Nuclear power was an important part of the energy mix in the Czech Republic. About 
20% of the countryÂs electricity was generated by the four units of the Dukovany nuclear 
power plant. Two units were also being commissioned at the Temelin nuclear power plant 
and, when operating at full power, they would double the installed capacity of Czech nuclear 
power plants. Though both units at Temelin had experienced a number of technical 
difficulties in the preceding year, mainly in the conventional non-nuclear part, the first unit 
had reached full power during trial operation in June 2002. 
13. The Czech Government attached the utmost importance to the safety of its nuclear 
installations and its system of nuclear safety assessment continued to be based on the 
principles of independence and transparency. Peer reviews organized by the Agency were an 
important part of the safety assessment structure. Agency missions to the Temelin and 
Dukovany nuclear power plants at the end of 2001 had confirmed the Czech RepublicÂs 
overall good safety record and had generated a number of ideas for further improvements. 
The inputs provided by Member States and the Secretariat, particularly the Department of 
Nuclear Safety and the Department of Technical Co-operation, had been most appreciated. 
14. Her country was concerned over attempts to exclude the AgencyÂs peer review services 
from the regional technical co-operation programme, since they were essential for 
maintaining and developing safety and security levels. The AgencyÂs unique review services 
facilitated exchange of information and results among interested groups, such as regulatory 
authorities or users of similar technology, which was one of the most important missions of 
the regional technical co-operation programme. 
15. Mr. NGANDAJINA (Angola) said that the 46th session of the General 
Conference was especially important for Angola as it was taking place only a few months 
after the end of a 27-year armed conflict in his country. The current climate of peace should 
have a positive impact on the countryÂs socio-economic development. Nuclear science, 
technology and applications could now make a significant contribution towards sustainable 
development in Angola and his Government therefore welcomed the Agency's efforts to 
strengthen its activities in those areas. 
16. Angola had received significant assistance from the Agency with the promotion and 
development of nuclear science and technology, mainly in the area of staff training and the 
elaboration of legislation and radiation safety regulations. However, although some progress 
had been achieved, the nuclear energy sector was still at a very early stage of development in 
his country. He therefore appealed to the Agency and other Member States to help promote 
peaceful applications of nuclear energy in the fields of health, food, agriculture, industry and 
the environment in Angola. 
17. Angola had submitted two new projects in the areas of health and agriculture for the 
2003-2004 technical co-operation programme. It had also requested the extension of the 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 8 

ongoing nuclear physics teaching laboratory project at the Faculty of Sciences of the 
Agostinho Neto University. The new projects included one on tsetse fly eradication. Seven 
out of 18 provinces in Angola suffered from tsetse infestation, which was one of the main 
obstacles to socio-economic development in Africa. The PATTEC action plan, based on use 
of the SIT, could solve that problem and he urged the FAO, WHO and IAEA to work together 
on its implementation. 

18. Angola was grateful to the Agency for the assistance it had provided with the safe 
disposal of abandoned cobalt-60 and caesium-137 radiation sources in radiotherapy 
equipment. 
19. The Angolan Government was planning to approve a legal document during the current 
year on the establishment of a regulatory authority, the headquarters for which had already 
been built. The finalization of legislation and regulations had had to be postponed for 
technical reasons, but it was hoped that that task could be completed in 2003. 
20. Finally, his country also strongly supported the AFRA programme activities. 
21. Mr. GRÃNBERG (Finland) said that the programme and budget for 2004 and 
2005 should not be based on fine tuning of the previous programme; more radical changes 
were needed. Constructive development of the regular programme had for a long time been 
compromised by the balance issue, which had led to a situation where the most important 
statutory activity, verification, was being financed through huge voluntary contributions. 
Even then, many important activities could not be implemented owing to a lack of resources. 
That was not a sustainable solution. Mandatory activities should be financed from the 
Regular Budget. Changes in the overall priorities of activities should be reflected in 
programme development, and there should be enough flexibility to transfer resources to new 
priority activities as needs arose, even between major programmes. In order to maintain the 
credibility of the safeguards system, a fair amount of additional financial resources should be 
allocated to the safeguards budget. 
22. Security, which had long been on the Agency's agenda, had come to occupy a central 
position since 11 September 2001. Terrorism was a threat to all nations in the world, not only 
those which had been openly threatened, and any misuse of nuclear material would have an 
effect on the whole nuclear community. The slow progress of the work to expand the scope 
of the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was regrettable. Clearly, 
much remained to be done with regard to the security of radiation sources, but the Agency 
was doing commendable work on the problem of orphan sources. When assisting Member 
States to acquire radiation sources or develop radiation facilities, the Agency should take their 
security plans and practices into account. 
23. Finland was one of the countries which believed that nuclear energy would have a place 
in future energy production. Thus, the Finnish parliament had in principle accepted a 
proposal to build an additional nuclear power plant unit. The decision had not been easy, and 
an intensive and comprehensive dialogue had taken place between the various stakeholders; 
the nuclear safety authorities had provided factual information, without otherwise 
participating in the discussion. The decision had also not been taken in isolation: two other 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 9 

important related topics had been debated simultaneously in parliament. One of those had 
been the decision-in-principle to construct a final disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel in 
Finland, which parliament had taken almost a year before the decision-in-principle on 
additional nuclear power. The other issue had been the national strategy for achieving the 
Kyoto target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, where energy issues had been central. 

24. The Finnish nuclear power programme had an excellent safety and operational record 
which helped build public confidence. Even in a small country like Finland, safety authorities 
and nuclear power companies had to have their own expertise to rely on, but international 
co-operation was also of great importance. The Finnish authorities, research institutes and 
power companies had made extensive use of the learning possibilities offered by the Agency. 
25. Finally, he welcomed Cuba's decision to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty and to accede to 
the NPT. 
26. Mr. GAISENAK (Belarus) said that, since sustainable development would 
involve a constant increase in energy consumption, the development of nuclear power might 
also speed up despite differing views on that subject. As safety and environmental 
friendliness were of prime importance in that field, his country welcomed the Agency's efforts 
to develop new-generation reactors and fuel cycles under the INPRO project, in which it 
participated as an observer, and hoped that the work of the INPRO Steering Committee on the 
first stage of the action plan would be complete by the end of 2002. The successful 
implementation of that project was of great significance to Belarus because it was considering 
developing its own nuclear power programme. He also noted with satisfaction the significant 
contribution which the Agency continued to make to the use of non-power nuclear 
technologies in science, industry, medicine and agriculture. 
27. The terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 had highlighted the importance of 
security of nuclear and radioactive material. His country highly valued the Agency's efforts 
to combat nuclear terrorism and welcomed the establishment of the Advisory Group on 
Nuclear Security and of the extrabudgetary fund for those activities. However, there should 
be closer co-operation between the Office of Physical Protection and Material Security and 
the Department of Technical Co-operation so as to avoid duplication. At the same time, more 
emphasis should be given to the co-ordinated technical support programmes for the Newly 
Independent States. Experts from Belarus were participating actively in the review of the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and Belarus hoped that a 
diplomatic conference could be held soon. As many countries did not have the institutional or 
financial resources to strengthen their physical protection systems independently, 
international co-operation would be needed. His country was grateful to Japan, Sweden and 
the United States of America for the support they had given with the establishment of the 
physical protection system for the Sosny nuclear centre in 1996. However, support was 
required from donor countries to keep the system operational. 
28. Belarus had been one of the first countries to demonstrate its commitment to the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through its voluntary renunciation of such weapons. It 
had signed both the NPT and a safeguards agreement, under which it fulfilled all its 
obligations as Agency inspections regularly confirmed. It had been a member of the NSG 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 10 

since 2000 and had been one of the first to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, 
to which it urged all States to accede, in addition to placing their activities under Agency 
safeguards. 

29. Improving radiation safety was an important task for all countries. Belarus had a State 
computer system for accounting and control of ionizing radiation sources, and new radiation 
safety standards had been adopted in 2000. New health regulations had also been adopted, 
and X-ray machines had been checked with Agency assistance. 
30. The population of Belarus had suffered and continued to suffer severe health 
consequences as a result of the Chernobyl accident. His country therefore found attempts to 
persuade the international community that the accident had had practically no impact on 
health regrettable. The scale of the consequences exceeded BelarusÂ capacity to address them 
and it was reliant on Agency assistance. Since 2000, the technical co-operation programme 
had included projects on rehabilitation of contaminated land, and he expressed the hope that 
further resources could be mobilized for a regional Chernobyl project, and that the Agency 
would play a more active role in the United Nations inter-institutional task force on 
Chernobyl. He also welcomed the Director General's Chernobyl forum initiative. 
31. His country had ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management 
and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and would be depositing its instrument 
of ratification soon. In accordance with its obligations under that Convention, Belarus had 
established a draft strategy for radioactive waste management which should be approved at 
the beginning of 2003. It also planned to ratify soon the Protocol to Amend the Vienna 
Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage. 
32. Belarus approved of the partnership in development concept and felt that the 
commitment and support of States was essential to the success of projects. It strove to 
contribute to the technical co-operation programme for Europe and was grateful to the 
Department of Technical Co-operation for the attention it had given to BelarusÂ problems. 
33. In conclusion, despite its financial difficulties, his country would do everything possible 
to meet its financial obligations both to the Regular Budget and to the TCF. 
34. Ms. AL-MULLA (Kuwait) said that the AgencyÂs programmes on transfer of 
peaceful nuclear technology should strengthen the scientific and technical potential of 
developing countries through human resource development and activities in the areas of 
protection of the marine environment, waste management, human health, water resources, 
food security and agriculture, thus promoting sustainable development. 
35. Her country valued highly the work of the Agency, UNEP and the WHO on the 
environmental impact of depleted uranium remains in Kuwait. 
36. Energy was a central issue in sustainable development. It was up to States to choose 
what energy source they wished to use. One of the factors that might help promote the 
peaceful uses of nuclear technology and determine the future of nuclear power was the 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 11 

establishment of a balance between different energy sources. Nuclear power should be 
regarded as supplementing and not competing with other sources of energy. 

37. Her country welcomed the outcomes of the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable 
Development, which should be taken into account when defining objectives and concluding 
partnerships to respond speedily to basic needs such as clean water, drainage, housing, 
energy, health care, food security and protection of biodiversity. 
38. The AgencyÂs work under its technical co-operation programme was commendable. It 
should continue to select high-quality projects and, through consultation and co-ordination 
with countries, ensure that quality was maintained. 
39. The TCF was crucial to the implementation of technical assistance projects and Kuwait 
had paid its full share of the Fund for 2002. The purpose of the Fund was to ensure smooth 
execution of the proposed programmes with a view to promoting transfer of technology to 
developing countries and their socio-economic development. She welcomed the fact that 
agreement had been reached on a target for the TCF for 2003 and on indicative planning 
figures, and hoped that that agreement would be adhered to. 
40. Agency training courses and fellowships played a major role in developing national 
capacities in recipient countries. Kuwait was glad to be hosting a regional training course on 
radiation protection and safety of radiation therapy. It welcomed the training plan to be 
implemented by the Marine Environment Laboratory in Monaco in a number of Member 
States, including one event with the co-operation of the Regional Organization for the 
Protection of the Marine Environment in Kuwait. Moreover, it looked forward to the 
implementation of ARASIA and hoped that application of the partnership concept would be 
widened. In that context, she emphasized her countryÂs support for the SESAME project. 
41. The promotion of a global safety culture through the conclusion of international 
conventions under the AgencyÂs auspices helped advance the attainment of safety objectives. 
Kuwait was finalizing steps to accede to the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear 
Accident and the Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological 
Emergency. 
42. Her country attached importance to the AgencyÂs activities to protect against nuclear 
terrorism which covered physical protection of nuclear material and installations, detection of 
and response to illicit trafficking in nuclear material, and prevention of incidents or 
acquisition by individuals or irresponsible parties of nuclear material with potentially 
dangerous consequences. She commended the work of the Advisory Group on Nuclear 
Security and expressed the hope that it would take into account the balance of priorities 
between the AgencyÂs various activities, implementation of the SecretariatÂs action plan, and 
the nuclear security-related components of the AgencyÂs 2004-2005 programme and budget. 
43. On 7 March Kuwait had joined the AgencyÂs safeguards system. On 19 June it had 
signed an additional protocol with the Agency and was taking constitutional measures to 
ratify it. Her country supported the application of comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear 
activities and installations. It was essential that all States in the Middle East, without 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 12 

exception, sign the NPT. Any measure that would help achieve peace and security in the 
region was important and there was strong support from States in the region for declaring it a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone, as a first step towards establishing a zone free from all weapons of 
mass destruction. 

44. It was a matter of continuing concern that the AgencyÂs work in Iraq had been in 
suspension for almost four years. The unconditional return of the inspectors was extremely 
important to verify that there had been no substantial change in IraqÂs nuclear activities and 
capabilities since 1998. As the Director General had emphasized in his report on the issue 
contained in document GC(46)/13, the AgencyÂs inspections in Iraq pursuant to that countryÂs 
safeguards agreement did not serve as a substitute for the verification activities required by 
the relevant Security Council resolutions, nor did they provide the assurances that Iraq was in 
compliance with those resolutions, especially resolutions 687 and 1284. Kuwait had taken 
note of IraqÂs recent declaration permitting the return of the inspectors. She expressed the 
hope that they would be able to return immediately to carry out their verification mission 
without hindrance, and that Iraq would faithfully comply with the relevant resolutions. 
45. Mr. SHANGULA (Namibia) commended the Agency's efforts to foster 
international co-operation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology in developing countries 
and to establish a comprehensive and effective nuclear safety regime and verification system. 
46. He noted the establishment of the Advisory Group on Nuclear Security. The primary 
responsibility for nuclear security rested with individual Member States. Furthermore, the 
funding of activities relating to the prevention of nuclear terrorism should be voluntary. 
47. The recent World Summit on Sustainable Development had set sustainable development 
goals and several of the AgencyÂs activities could make a significant contribution towards the 
attainment of those goals. The Summit had given the necessary impetus to the AgencyÂs 
work in that regard. 
48. The Government of Namibia had adopted Vision 2030, a national development strategy 
which incorporated its Country Programme Framework. Namibia appreciated the assistance 
it had received from the Agency. In the agricultural sector, technical co-operation was aimed 
mainly at eradicating the livestock diseases in the north of the country with a view to lifting 
the ban on animal exports from that region. In the area of water resource development, 
isotope hydrology was being used to identify underground aquifers and improve groundwater 
management. His country was also participating in a study on sustainable development of 
groundwater resources that would provide the data for a regional groundwater model which 
should prove useful when developing national water supply strategies. Technical 
co-operation was also helping Namibia develop an adequate human resource base and 
infrastructure in the nuclear field through the provision of fellowships, the organization of 
scientific visits, supply of equipment and designing of curricula at the University of Namibia. 
49. He commended the Agency on its successful application of the SIT to tsetse eradication 
and called upon it and donor countries, in close co-operation with the WHO and other 
relevant organizations, to seriously consider applying that technique to malaria control. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 13 

50. His Government attached high priority to ensuring the sustainability of NamibiaÂs 
marine resources and had instituted various measures to that end. It shared the growing 
global concern about harmful algal blooms and stood ready to participate with neighbouring 
countries in the proposed project in the Benguela region to monitor the toxins produced by 
marine algae. 
51. He urged Member States and other donors to continue to support the valuable work 
done by AFRA. Namibia was grateful to AFRA for the assistance it had provided in the form 
of equipment, support for radioactive waste management, rehabilitation of an X-ray unit for 
the treatment of skin cancer, assistance with the development of a national strategy for 
promoting nuclear energy and sustainability, expert missions in nuclear medicine and 
workshops, and training events for Namibian nationals. 
52. The Agency had played a pivotal role in the introduction of peaceful uses of nuclear 
technology in Africa and continued co-operation between it, the African Union and the New 
Partnership for AfricaÂs Development was of crucial importance. However, the Agency could 
not perform its statutory and promotional activities unless adequate funding was provided by 
Member States. He therefore encouraged Member States to pay their contributions on time 
and in full. His country had already paid its full share of the TCF for 2002 and 2003 and he 
urged all Member States to do likewise. 
53. Ms. HALL (Canada) welcomed Cuba's formal decision to accede to the NPT. 
54. The previous 12 months had seen the emergence of heightened international concern 
about nuclear security and safety, sustainable development issues, the environment, climate 
change and the security of energy supply. Thus, 45 years after its establishment, the Agency 
was facing challenges which would require it to demonstrate its vision and firm leadership if 
it was to continue to play a key role. 
55. The events of 11 September 2001 had led to renewed concerns about nuclear security 
and safety. The Agency had played an important role in allaying such concerns by informing 
the public about its mandate and activities in an open and transparent manner. Canada 
particularly welcomed the Agency's comprehensive programme to combat the threat of 
nuclear terrorism and would be making an additional contribution in support of the Agency's 
work relating to IPPAS missions. The threat of nuclear terrorism could be successfully 
addressed through the combined efforts of the Agency and individual Member States. It was 
important to acknowledge that nuclear security was the shared responsibility of all States. 
However, to be sustainable that programme should be included in the Agency's Regular 
Budget. It was pleasing to note that the Agency's efforts had provided an impetus to 
complementary initiatives, notably the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of 
Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction in whose development Canada had played a key 
role. 
56. Her country had also been actively involved in the continuing efforts to strengthen the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. The lack of progress in that area 
was frustrating, and she expressed the hope that the next round of negotiations would be more 
fruitful. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 14 

57. The safety and security of radiation sources had attracted much public attention and, as 
one of the world leaders in the export of radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes, 
Canada believed that national regulatory infrastructures needed to be strengthened to ensure 
that such sources were safely and securely managed at all times. It therefore welcomed the 
Agency's work in implementing the revised Action Plan for the Safety and Security of 
Radiation Sources, particularly the recent meeting to identify ways to strengthen the 
international code of conduct on that issue. Protecting such sources against unauthorized use 
should be a priority for all States. 
58. Unrelenting work was needed to strengthen the nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation regime. Her country continued to be concerned that three States remained 
outside the NPT and urged India, Pakistan and Israel to accede to that Treaty as 
non-nuclear-weapon States unconditionally and without delay. 
59. While noting that the Government of Iraq had finally indicated that it would co-operate 
with the United Nations and allow the return of weapons inspectors, Canada continued to be 
concerned that the Agency had not been in a position to implement its mandate in Iraq under 
relevant Security Council resolutions since December 1998. It looked forward to the early 
return of the inspectors, the full co-operation of the Iraqi authorities, and successful 
verification that all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction had indeed been destroyed. Her 
country was also concerned that, although the DPRK was a party to the NPT, the Agency was 
still unable to verify the correctness and completeness of its initial declaration pursuant to its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
60. A strong supporter of the Agency's safeguards system, Canada urged all Member States 
which had not already done so sign and implement a comprehensive safeguards agreement 
and an additional protocol as soon as possible. It acknowledged the Director General's 
concerns regarding the resource challenges faced by the safeguards programme and attached 
high importance to the development of integrated safeguards. The completion of the 
conceptual framework for integrated safeguards at the end of 2001 represented a major 
milestone. Much work remained to be done for integrated safeguards approaches to yield 
effective and efficient implementation at State level, and her country would pursue its work 
with the Agency on the development of such approaches through the Canadian Nuclear Safety 
Commission, including its safeguards support programme and other avenues, as appropriate. 
It also encouraged the Agency to proceed in a timely manner with the application of 
integrated safeguards in States with additional protocols. 
61. Her country was particularly concerned over the problems of poverty and sustainable 
development, and one of the agreements concluded at the Kananaskis Summit had committed 
the G-8 countries to creating partnerships for the promotion of sustainable development at the 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. There, world leaders had 
decided to promote developing countriesÂ access to such basic requirements as potable water, 
energy, health and food security by developing local capacities and using modern 
technologies to combat underdevelopment. Nuclear science and technology could play an 
important role in addressing those renewed commitments. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 15 

62. The AgencyÂs Member States, as parties to the NPT, had an obligation to facilitate the 
exchange of nuclear knowledge and equipment for peaceful purposes. As a strong supporter 
of and major contributor to the Agency's technical co-operation programme, Canada looked 
forward to continued progress in the implementation of the programme's results-based 
management approach. It also encouraged the Agency to focus on continued partnerships 
with regional organizations and on increased reliance on local capacities. Canada had made a 
voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2002 of 2.34 million Canadian dollars. 
63. International concerns regarding security of energy supply, the environment and climate 
change, the replacement and life extension of operating nuclear power plants, improved 
economics and advanced reactor designs all indicated that nuclear power would have an 
increasing role in the future. Advances and new developments in the medical and industrial 
applications of nuclear technologies also continued to be beneficial. Innovation was vital to 
the nuclear industry. One leading example was the advanced CANDU reactor which was 
being designed by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. The objective of the project was to 
respond to a competitive market demand by achieving a US $1000 per kW capital cost and a 
four-year construction schedule. Those developments were directly applicable to the 
Agency's INPRO project, in which Canada had taken a keen interest from the outset and 
which it would continue to support. 
64. In recent years there had been increasing recognition of the need for nuclear knowledge 
management, which was vital to the continued safe use of all nuclear technologies. Canada 
commended the Agency for its efforts to increase awareness of that need and believed that it 
should continue to play a leading role in facilitating exchange of information and experience, 
raising awareness and providing assistance to Member States in that area. Canada was 
introducing a resolution to that effect. 
65. With regard to organizational and managerial issues, for the Agency to meet the 
challenges and respond to the needs of the changing international environment, flexibility in 
internal programme management and resource allocation was essential so that the AgencyÂs 
major programme components could become mutually reinforcing. She noted with 
satisfaction that an external consultant mandated by the Secretariat was currently reviewing 
the Agency's management practices. Canada had always been a strong supporter of that 
initiative and would be making an extrabudgetary contribution to ensure that the 
recommendations made by the consultant were adequately implemented and led to further 
efficiencies and effectiveness, with a focus on results-based management and the use the 
performance indicators. 
66. Mr. CHARRY SAMPER (Colombia) welcomed the announcement by the 
Government of Cuba that it intended to sign the NPT and ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty. 
67. The newly appointed Colombian Government was engaged in unprecedented efforts to 
rationalize operational expenditure with a view to increasing investment and generating 
employment. Its commitment to implementing a broad-based and strengthened social policy 
would necessitate co-operation from international agencies. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 16 

68. Colombia believed in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the application of 
nuclear science and technology for development. Furthermore, as a supporter of the principles 
of collective democratic security and nuclear non-proliferation, it was firmly committed to the 
NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty. It had joined the Agency in 1960 and had benefited from 
Agency technical co-operation programmes at both the national and regional level, mainly in 
the fields of human health, mining, radiation protection, agriculture and nuclear medicine. 
69. Two units within the Ministry of Mines and Energy in Colombia were directly involved 
in strategic planning. As of October 2001, the Nuclear Affairs Group in the Department of 
Energy of the Ministry of Mines and Energy had assumed the role of national liaison office 
with the Agency responsible for co-ordinating and managing the regular technical assistance 
programme. That group was also entrusted with national co-ordination of the ARCAL 
programme and with ensuring compliance with various international treaties, agreements and 
conventions relating to nuclear material, particularly in the fields of nuclear safety, physical 
protection, radiation protection, and safeguards. In that connection, the requisite analysis and 
review had been carried out for the countryÂs Congress to adopt and ratify three important 
nuclear-related international conventions. 
70. Government policy with respect to project proposal and design was guided by national 
development priorities. The programmes for the 2003-2004 biennium demonstrated how 
Agency activities complemented national efforts. 
71. His country was concerned by the continuing imbalance between security and 
technology transfer, the latter of which was of fundamental importance to the developing 
countries. It was essential that a balance be maintained between the three pillars of the 
AgencyÂs activities. 
72. Another matter of concern to Colombia was the transport of radioactive waste. In a 
statement made on 25 July 2002, the Permanent Commission for the South Pacific had 
stressed the importance of complying fully with international standards when transporting 
such waste on maritime routes in the South-East Pacific and of providing timely information 
on the shipping routes to be used and appropriate compensation in the event of an accident. 
73. In the nuclear medicine field, Colombia was making a qualitative leap forward and was 
introducing positron technology. It would require Agency assistance with that venture, in 
particular with the training of personnel in positron emission tomography. It was on a par 
with developed countries in that field and had introduced SPECT gamma cameras. It had a 
large number of nuclear medicine centres (approximately 50) with a modern infrastructure 
and highly qualified staff in both the public and private sectors. However, economic 
difficulties had so far hindered access to more sophisticated systems such as PET. Colombia 
had a group of nuclear medicine experts which regularly provided services for the Agency 
both in the region and beyond. Furthermore, the Agency had frequently requested Colombia 
to provide training in nuclear medicine for fellows from various countries, which it was 
hoping to continue doing. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 17 

74. His country saw the partners in development concept as central to its relations with the 
Agency. The Agency should continue to support national efforts in such areas as nuclear 
medicine, mining, hydrology and human resources training. 
75. Mr. HASHIM (Malaysia) said the financial situation of the Agency was a matter 
of concern as the AgencyÂs legal obligations could no longer be met within the existing level 
of funding. The situation was being compounded by the shortfall in contributions received. 
In addition, the Agency was faced with the challenge of responding to the heightened threat of 
nuclear terrorism. 
76. While it condemned all acts of terrorism, regardless of the motivation of their 
perpetrators, and remained fully committed to the objectives of nuclear non-proliferation as a 
step towards general and complete nuclear disarmament, Malaysia also strongly believed that 
technical co-operation should continue to be one of the main pillars of the Agency, as 
stipulated in Article IV of the NPT. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had recognized that 
the financing of safeguards activities was a common but differentiated responsibility, rather 
than a purely collective one. Account had to be taken of whether a Member State possessed 
nuclear weapons, had a significant nuclear power programme, nuclear fuel processing or 
mining activity, or occupied a designated seat on the Board of Governors, for such States bore 
added responsibilities in that context. 
77. The ultimate solution to the problem of security and prevention of the theft of nuclear 
weapons was the total and irreversible elimination of all such weapons of mass destruction by 
all parties. The Agency should not be involved in any response to the theft of a nuclear 
weapon, as that could be construed as tacit encouragement to the continued possession of such 
weapons of mass destruction, contravening the spirit of its mandate under the NPT. Any theft 
of nuclear weapons had a direct and immediate bearing on international peace and security 
and should be addressed by other multilateral organizations, in particular the Security 
Council, with the Agency acting only on the mandate of the Security Council as required and 
on a specific case-by-case basis. Since the Statute of the Agency and other international 
instruments were generally silent on the matter of the responsibility of the Agency in such an 
event, it would not be appropriate for it to take on such a new, and potentially financially 
prohibitive role of its own accord. 
78. Any effort to curb the terrorist threat, nuclear or otherwise, should be matched by efforts 
to find lasting solutions to the root causes of terrorism. Equal emphasis should be accorded to 
the three main pillars of the AgencyÂs activities, taking into consideration that its nonverification 
activities, particularly those which were supportive of the sustainable socioeconomic 
development objectives of its developing Member States, could also contribute to 
preventing terrorism by making life more meaningful for the beneficiaries. 
79. His country was concerned that the prevailing heightened emphasis on efforts to 
mitigate the threat of nuclear terrorism could lead to a dilution of the AgencyÂs activities 
relating to sustainable development, thereby exacerbating the sense of disenfranchisement in 
less-developed Member States. It was the benefits to be obtained through the AgencyÂs 
technical assistance and co-operation programme that had motivated most of the developing 
countries to join the Agency. The Director GeneralÂs assurance that, while the Agency 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 18 

viewed the improvements in nuclear security as a high priority, they would not be 
implemented at the expense of other existing high priorities in the technical co-operation 
programme, was heartening. He also welcomed the fact that the programmes relating to 
prevention of nuclear terrorism were largely being funded through voluntary contributions. 

80. The level of resources made available was a measure of the general political will to 
support Member States wishing to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The 80.1% 
rate of attainment for the TCF in 2001 was gratifying. Malaysia would continue to meet its 
financial commitments to the Agency in full and on time, including those to the TCF and its 
assessed programme costs, and it was grateful to all Member States that had done likewise. 
81. He expressed the hope that CubaÂs decision to accede to the NPT would encourage 
other non-parties to do likewise, thus bringing closer the ultimate aim of universality of the 
Treaty. 
82. Malaysia also welcomed IraqÂs announcement that it would grant international 
inspectors unconditional access to verify its compliance with the relevant Security Council 
resolutions. He expressed the hope that it might therefore be possible to lift the sanctions in 
the near future to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people. 
83. Mr. SRIWIDJAJA (Indonesia) said that nuclear science and technology and their 
applications not only served as practical problem-solving tools but also contributed towards 
sustainable development and, indirectly, by alleviating poverty, helped combat the rise of 
ideologies linked to terrorism. 
84. When properly managed, nuclear power could provide electricity on a large scale with 
comparatively little environmental impact. Nuclear technology could also make a contribution 
to many aspects of Agenda 21 and the United Nations Millennium declaration ranging from 
human health and agricultural productivity to water management, the environment and energy 
production. 
85. During the National Convention on Nuclear Safety held in May 2002, the President of 
Indonesia had stressed the importance of including nuclear energy in the countryÂs energy mix 
and the need for Indonesia to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Energy 
demand in Indonesia was projected to double by 2025. Public information activities were 
therefore being intensified to promote the benefits of nuclear technology. 
86. Over the preceding year, his country had given high priority to education and capacity 
building, and especially to the development - in co-operation with international 
organizations - of programmes which directly enhanced peopleÂs quality of life. He 
commended the Agency on its technical co-operation programme and the Government of the 
Republic of Korea on the establishment of the Regional Office for the RCA. Technology 
transfer through those mechanisms had enhanced Indonesian scientistsÂ ability to implement 
peaceful uses of the nuclear science and technology in various fields. Indonesia looked 
forward to further fruitful co-operation with the Agency under the technical co-operation 
programme and the RCA. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 19 

87. It particularly appreciated the Agency's efforts to establish a nuclear desalination 
project. That project involved tripartite co-operation between the Agency, Indonesia and the 
Republic of Korea and was expected to become a model for technical co-operation among 
developing countries in the future. 
88. Indonesian scientists and engineers at G.A. Siwabessy had successfully developed 
uranium silicide fuel elements as part of the programme to improve operation of the research 
reactor. An operational test of a full uranium silicide-fuelled core had been conducted 
recently: criticality had been achieved on 27 August 2002 and full power operation at 30 MW 
on 6 September 2002. The operational test should be complete by 18 September 2002. 
Indonesia invited Member States to make use of its multi-purpose reactor and its supporting 
laboratories. 
89. In 19 of its 30 provinces, scientists from IndonesiaÂs National Nuclear Energy Agency, 
BATAN, were continuing to co-operate with provincial and local government, local 
universities, small and medium-sized enterprises, co-operatives and NGOs in disseminating 
and utilizing research products to help people on low incomes overcome the effects of the 
economic crisis. Some provinces had not only incorporated mutant rice varieties and food 
supplement technology in their food security programmes but had also used nuclear 
technology to improve the productivity of arid land. 
90. In addition to establishing a programme for designing and manufacturing nuclear 
medicine instruments, his country continued to develop products for diagnosis and treatment 
for both domestic use and export. Currently, 90% of the national demand for radioisotopes 
and radiopharmaceuticals, excluding long-lived radioisotopes, was supplied from that source. 
Furthermore, renographs, thyroid uptake apparatus, X-ray machines and RIA counters were 
now being made locally and used in hospitals. Tissue bank centres had been established in 
four hospitals, producing a total of 9000 packs used by 30 hospitals in 8 provinces. The 
production of sterilized biomaterial from synthetic material was being clinically tested, a 
National Committee on Radiation Safety had been established and an action plan was being 
put in place to protect patients from radiation contamination. 
91. BATAN was using its non-destructive testing laboratory for quality control of casting 
products for export. It was also developing public awareness campaigns to increase 
acceptance of radiation processing of food, especially raw and frozen products, and packaging 
materials. Nuclear techniques had also been used for troubleshooting at an oil refinery 
installation in West Java and for the fertilizer industry in East Kalimantan. 
92. Nuclear and related techniques had recently been used to study the safety and 
sustainability of the Jatiluhur dam, to investigate water pollution and leakage around a solid 
municipal waste dumping site in co-operation with the government of Jakarta, and to manage 
the Kamojang and Lahendong geothermal fields. 
93. Indonesia was currently launching programmes on reactor ageing, emergency core 
cooling systems, control rod design and engineering, and control instrumentation systems. It 
was also working towards the implementation of integrated safeguards, especially for research 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 20 

reactors and critical assemblies. In so doing, it would be the second country in the world to 
implement integrated safeguards. 

94. His country had ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety and had issued new 
government regulations on the safe transport of nuclear material and the management of 
radioactive waste. Those regulations, in addition to existing regulations, would speed up the 
process of implementing the new International Basic Safety Standards for Protection against 
Ionizing Radiation and for the Safety of Radiation Sources in Indonesia. 
95. An IAEA-Indonesian regional workshop on physical protection and material security to 
combat illicit trafficking had been organized with Agency assistance which had been attended 
by participants from countries party to the South East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone and 
their neighbours, as well as one workshop on the organization and implementation of a 
national regulatory programme for the control of radiation sources and another on radiation 
protection in radioactive waste management. 
96. Indonesia shared some of the concerns of coastal States regarding nuclear transport 
safety, especially the increasing danger of accidents caused by natural phenomena, human 
error or criminal acts. Nuclear security should be one of the world's priorities and he urged all 
parties concerned do their utmost to support efforts to strengthen international co-operation in 
nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. 
97. The Agency's verification system was of the utmost importance to Indonesia. The 
universality, consolidation and strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime, 
including specific steps to reduce nuclear weapons stockpiles, were more important than ever 
for the continuing sustainability and credibility of that regime. 
98. The prevailing political situation in the Middle East, which had prevented the Director 
general from making further progress in fulfilling his mandate pursuant to General 
Conference resolution GC(45)/RES/18, was cause for concern. All States in the region 
should accept the application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities as 
an important confidence-building measure, with a view to establishing a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
99. He welcomed Iraq's announcement that it intended to grant United Nations inspectors 
unconditional access. That decision should be implemented as soon as possible in order to 
prevent the situation in the region from worsening still further. 
100. Finally, in strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the 
safeguards system and application of the Model Additional Protocol, care should be taken to 
ensure that the resources available for technical assistance and co-operation did not decrease. 
101. Mr. PROMPOJ (Thailand) welcomed IraqÂs recent decision to accept the 
unconditional return of United Nations weapons inspectors and expressed support for any 
further actions in that regard within the framework of the United Nations. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 21 

102. He noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs successful work in the fields of nuclear 
non-proliferation, safety and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy over the preceding year. 
Thailand continued to be committed to co-operating with the Agency in strengthening 
technical co-operation among developing counties and it hoped that the benefit States gained 
from the AgencyÂs activities would promote greater global understanding of the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy for sustainable development. 
103. As a strong supporter of strengthened safeguards, his country had established a 
sub-committee on safeguards in March 2002 to consider the verification issue with a view to 
ratifying an additional protocol. An SSAC would be established at a later stage. The 
establishment of collaboration on safety and safeguards issues between the Agency and the 
South East Asia nuclear-weapon-free zone was also one of ThailandÂs priorities. Equally, it 
was ready to co-operate with the Agency and Member States in the implementation of the 
AgencyÂs activities to protect against nuclear terrorism, in particular those on capacity 
building and preparedness in South East Asia. 
104. The restructuring of ThailandÂs Office of Atomic Energy for Peace had been a major 
development. The country was actively participating in two Model Projects on upgrading of 
radiation protection infrastructure (RAS/9/026 and RAS/9/027) to help support the 
re-structuring and develop effective management techniques for the new organization, and to 
assist with the drafting of new nuclear legislation. He called on the Agency to continue 
working closely with Member States to develop national safety regulatory infrastructures and 
to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. 
Thailand appreciated the expertise and resources the Agency provided in that field, but it 
could be more innovative in co-ordinating its technical co-operation mechanisms to optimize 
delivery, inter alia under regional co-operative arrangements. 
105. His country had contributed to technical co-operation programmes by receiving fellows 
and scientific visitors for on-the-job training in the fields of agriculture and medicine. 
Furthermore, 150 copies of a book on tissue banks had recently been donated to the Agency 
for reference and distribution to its Member States. He encouraged the Agency to incorporate 
the areas of safeguards, safety regimes and the peaceful application of atomic energy in 
agriculture, health, education and training in its technical co-operation programmes. It should 
also identify specific programmes on radiation protection infrastructure, quality assurance in 
medical applications, food safety, the application of isotopic and nuclear techniques in 
nutrition research and water resource development, public information and knowledge 
management as part of its core activities. 
106. Finally, Thailand was pledging $180 148 to the TCF for the year 2003. 
107. Mr. HOFFMANN (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive NuclearTest-
Ban Treaty Organization) said that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted 
by the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 had reached universal status 
with 166 signatories, 94 of which had deposited their instruments of ratification, including 31 
of the 44 States whose ratification was required for the Treaty to enter into force. In the 
fifth year of its existence, the Preparatory Commission and its Provisional Technical 
Secretariat were actively preparing for the effective implementation of the Treaty. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 22 

108. The CTBT provided for the establishment of a unique global verification regime 
consisting of an international monitoring system, a consultation and clarification process, 
on-site inspections and confidence-building measures. The data from monitoring stations all 
over the globe were processed and analysed by the International Data Centre in Vienna. 
Member States had the final responsibility for analysing the data. 
109. The programme budgets approved by the Commission since 1997 for establishing the 
monitoring system included the costs of the site surveys, purchase of equipment, installation, 
final certification, and operation and maintenance of the facilities. Thus far, 135 stations had 
been completed and 104 were under construction. 
110. The International Data Centre supported the verification responsibilities of Member 
States by providing the products and services needed for effective global monitoring through 
the establishment and testing of facilities which would receive, collect, process, analyse, 
report on and archive data from the monitoring stations. Its work on the design, 
implementation and management of information security was progressing. 
111. The International Data CentreÂs applications software was being tested under 
near-operational conditions. Reviewed Event Bulletins were issued and, currently, about 
70 stations were contributing to those bulletins, including 33 which were sending data through 
the organizationÂs global communications infrastructure. 
112. The signatory States were interested in acquiring their own copies of the virtual gamma 
spectroscopy laboratory tool. An initiative had been launched to study cosmic-ray effects in 
spectra, and a major project to review the International Data CentreÂs nuclide library had 
begun. Data requirements for noble gas monitoring had been worked out and presented at a 
workshop held in January in Tahiti, and testing of data from the prototype noble gas stations 
was in progress. Work on significantly improving the software for beta-gamma noble gas 
measurements had started and other developments and enhancements of the radionuclide 
monitoring software were already under way. Software integration work had continued in the 
areas of software development, maintenance and configuration management. 
113. The atmospheric transport area had developed strongly. A four-layer concept had been 
formulated with the underlying idea that all computer-intensive work would be done outside, 
at renowned meteorological centres, and at the International Data Centre. Then fairly simple 
post-processing routines would be used to create the products of interest to States, either at the 
International Data Centre or at national data centres. For the first module dealing with 
continuous meteorological data feed, there had been substantial progress towards an 
agreement with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The 
co-operation agreement with the World Meteorological Organization had been a useful 
vehicle in that connection and for the preparation of the global communications infrastructure 
workshop to be held in Vienna in October, which would deal with how the Secretariat would 
obtain independent analyses from worldwide meteorological centres in cases where more than 
one relevant level-5 radionuclide had been detected. 
114. The global communications infrastructure transferred the monitoring data to the 
International Data Centre and disseminated those data and the CentreÂs products to signatory 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 23 

States through a closed and secure satellite communications network. When fully operational, 
it was expected to carry some 11 gigabytes of data daily. The programme of 
very-small-aperture terminal installations had continued. So far, more than 110 such 
installations, out of a planned 234, had been made. Secure internet connections were also 
used as an alternative to such connections. 

115. The preparation of the draft on-site operational manual in 2002 remained a priority task. 
The Secretariat would continue to provide, upon request, all necessary support for that 
process. The eighth on-site inspection workshop, held in Vienna in 2002, had concentrated 
on the preparation of the draft manual, noble gas measurements and the results of a field 
experiment in Slovakia. 
116. The Secretariat had a staff of about 270 from 69 countries, of whom about 170 were in 
the Professional category. There were 46 women in Professional positions. An ad hoc 
steering group on human resources was working on a number of matters of importance to the 
staff. 
117. The Secretariat had continued to play the role of a clearing house, maintaining 
interaction with signatory States on their potential needs and capabilities in Treaty 
technologies, so as to enable the timely establishment and operation of the verification 
system. 
118. Mr. ALEXANDRIS (Greece) said that the threat of nuclear terrorism had 
highlighted the importance of the NPT. Indeed, terrorism multiplied the dangers inherent in 
nuclear weapon proliferation and jeopardized the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Despite its 
sinister appearance, the situation presented new challenges and opportunities to strengthen the 
non-proliferation regime. The complexity of the challenges called for a meticulous 
implementation of the AgencyÂs recommended norms and practices. 
119. Countries which possessed nuclear weapons and fissile material had a special 
responsibility to reassure the international community that measures were being taken to 
prevent proliferation, unauthorized use and criminal activity. At the same time, multilateral 
action was needed to build a universal network against nuclear terrorism. 
120. Greece had always played an active role in all aspects of nuclear safety. It had joined 
the incident reporting system for research reactors, had ratified the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety and had participated in the second review meeting under that instrument. 
121. It supported the AgencyÂs efforts to develop safety standards covering the whole 
spectrum of fuel cycle facilities and to establish and maintain a global safety regime. It also 
noted the Director GeneralÂs interest in decommissioning planning as part of the back end of 
the fuel cycle and encouraged him to step up the AgencyÂs efforts in that regard. 
122. He commended the revised Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radiation 
Sources. The Greek Atomic Energy Commission would be hosting postgraduate courses on 
radiation protection of sources starting the following year. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 24 

123. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to establish a comprehensive 
internationally accepted safety regime for research reactors. An INSARR mission had been 
conducted in Greece to review operational safety aspects. 
124. Greece was especially interested in the AgencyÂs studies on the consequences of the use 
of depleted uranium, since it lay close to places where that material had been detected. The 
Greek Atomic Energy Commission had already collected and evaluated environmental 
samples from neighbouring areas and continued to take part in the United Nations 
Environment Programme in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
125. He welcomed CubaÂs decision to sign the NPT. His country remained committed to a 
universal non-proliferation regime. 
126. Greece welcomed the completion of the conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards, but remained concerned over the slow progress with the conclusion of additional 
protocols. The evaluation of information about a StateÂs nuclear programme was becoming 
an integral part of the safeguards conclusions process. He noted with satisfaction the progress 
made in expanding the AgencyÂs remote monitoring system. The AgencyÂs verification role 
should be strengthened. The changes in the geopolitical environment which had resulted from 
the end of the Cold War, and the recent terrorist activities underscored the need to reinforce 
the role of multilateral institutions. The AgencyÂs verification system was the only system 
available to the international community to monitor and verify nuclear non-proliferation 
commitments. Universal application of safeguards remained one of the basic components of 
international nuclear security. 
127. His country was disappointed at the lack of progress with the drafting of an amendment 
to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. It was voluntarily 
participating in the AgencyÂs illicit trafficking database and was involved in the ongoing 
regional technical co-operation project in Europe devoted to training customs officials, border 
guards and police officers. 
128. Greece appreciated the contribution Agency technical co-operation made to enhancing 
the scientific, technological and regulatory capabilities of participating countries through 
technology transfer and capacity building. Active participation by the States themselves was 
essential to those efforts, and the building of strategic partnerships with Member States and 
other specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations. Greece would be 
contributing its full share of the TCF for 2002 and 2003, amounting to around $750 000. It 
also offered training opportunities in its laboratories for Agency fellowship-holders. 
129. Ms. ÂIAKOVÃ (Slovakia) said that, following the events of 11 September 2001, 
the Government of Slovakia had adopted a package of organizational and technical measures 
to combat terrorism, including enhanced physical protection of nuclear installations. Her 
country welcomed the AgencyÂs quick and comprehensive response to the threat of nuclear 
terrorism. 
130. Slovakia supported the efforts of the group of technical and legal experts that had 
recently met to revise the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 25 

hoped that the negotiations would yield a result which attracted broad adherence by the 
international community. 

131. Encouraging progress had been made in the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the 
effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. To reach the final goal of effective and 
efficient global safeguards, it was of the utmost importance that safeguards were applied on a 
non-discriminatory and universal basis, and that the verification of information was neither 
mechanistic nor systematic. Slovakia had signed a new safeguards agreement with the 
Agency, and an additional protocol which it was preparing to bring into force. She urged 
States which had not already concluded safeguards agreements and additional protocols to do 
so as soon as possible. 
132. Slovakia remained deeply concerned about the implementation of United Nations 
Security Council resolutions relating to Iraq. The full implementation of those resolutions 
without further delay and without any preconditions, including the resumption of Agency 
inspections, was important to the peace and security of the region. 
133. With respect to the implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between the 
Agency and the DPRK, her country recognized the need for continuing inspection activities to 
monitor the freeze, but the issue of the DPRK's initial declaration remained unresolved. She 
urged the DPRK to fulfil its responsibilities under its safeguards agreement without delay. 
134. The completion of the conceptual framework for integrated safeguards was an important 
milestone. Her country stood ready to support the Agency in those activities by working 
closely with SAGSI and in co-operation with other Member States. With regard to the 
implementation of safeguards in Slovakia, all nuclear power plant fuel was stored exclusively 
at the plant sites and all nuclear facilities in the country, as well as all nuclear material, were 
subject to comprehensive safeguards. The countryÂs nuclear regulatory authority performed 
regular inspections at facilities in accordance with the provisions of the Atomic Act. 
135. With regard to the safe use of nuclear energy, over recent years regulators and operators 
had had the opportunity to exchange experience and technical information in a number of 
fora. The Agency played an indispensable role in supporting those activities and in making 
its services available to Member States. Slovakia welcomed the Agency's co-operation with 
other bodies within the United Nations, with the institutions of the European Union and with 
other international organizations, such as the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and the 
World Association of Nuclear Operators. It was the responsibility of the nuclear community 
to promote global nuclear safety and her country therefore strongly supported those Agency 
initiatives which contributed to a global nuclear safety regime through networking, integration 
of its safety evaluation activities, and promotion of adherence to international safety 
conventions. Safety was an essential precondition for the use of nuclear energy in Slovakia, 
which would remain an important source of energy in the medium term according to the 
countryÂs energy plan. The main challenge for future years would be the implementation of 
the nuclear power plant safety improvement and modernization programme, which should be 
complete by 2008. The second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety had commended the positive results Slovakia had achieved in improving 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 26 

the safety of its nuclear power plants. It would have further achievements to report at the 
third review meeting. 

136. The safety of nuclear installations had also been the subject of very useful bilateral 
meetings with neighbouring States. The Centre for Nuclear Safety had been established in 
Bratislava in April 2002 to enhance co-operation in the region. It was being supported by the 
Swiss and Slovak Governments with the aim of creating a network of nuclear safety experts to 
support the regional nuclear regulatory authorities. 
137. SlovakiaÂs nuclear regulatory authority had invited the Agency's International 
Regulatory Review Team to conduct a follow-up review in November 2002 to confirm that it 
had successfully addressed all the review teamÂs findings, and it welcomed the valuable 
insights for further improvements that could be derived from an international peer review. It 
had also been a strong and active supporter of the Operational Safety Review Teams in 
Slovakia and other Member States. Slovakia encouraged all Member States to utilize that 
important safety service to strengthen the operational safety of nuclear power plants further in 
the interests of the safe use of nuclear energy. 
138. The competent Slovak authorities viewed the AgencyÂs expert services an essential part 
of international co-operation which supported the national regulatory decision-making 
process. Like other countries in the region, Slovakia believed that long-term regional 
planning was the best way of accommodating the needs of individual countries effectively and 
efficiently, so the possible exclusion of peer review services from regional technical 
co-operation would be of concern to it. 
139. In the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, her country continued to co-operate 
with over 20 Member States and a number of international organizations, chief among them 
the Agency. One national project on radiochemical facilities for producing medical 
radionuclides was of the utmost importance to Slovakia, which had made a national 
contribution to it of $1.45 million. In future, emphasis should be placed on the transfer of 
nuclear techniques. The recent World Summit on Sustainable Development had emphasized 
the need to reinforce sustainable development efforts. The Agency could make a valuable 
contribution to that work. For example, the application of nuclear techniques in such areas as 
human health and agriculture had clear environmental and economic advantages. 
140. The Slovak Government was also co-operating with the Agency to organize workshops 
for experts from all over the world. Based on the positive feedback from participants, her 
country was prepared to host further Agency activities and would continue to accept 
Agency-sponsored fellows and scientific visitors in order to share its wide-ranging experience 
in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also intended to contribute to the TCF. 
141. Mr. ALI (Bangladesh) said that, of the areas in which his country was already 
deriving benefits from nuclear technology, one in particular required increased Agency 
involvement: the provision of safe drinking water. For some years water drawn from 
underground aquifers had been used to supply 90% of the population with drinking water, but 
Bangladeshi scientists had recently discovered that those aquifers were contaminated with 
unusually high concentrations of arsenic. More than 30 million people were affected, and it 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 27 

was becoming clear that the long-term effects could be much more severe than anticipated. 
Technological support was needed not only to mitigate the problem, but to help understand its 
complex dynamics. Neutron activation analysis and other analytical techniques could be 
useful to detect arsenic concentrations in water, food and human organs, and isotope 
hydrology studies to map groundwater reservoirs throughout the country. He appealed to the 
Agency for urgent help to address the problem. 

142. His country was a party to three major nuclear safety conventions and was determined 
to strengthen its regulations in the radiation, transport and waste safety field. The Agency 
should devote additional resources to safety matters, inter alia in the areas of the nuclear fuel 
cycle and waste management. Nuclear and radiation safety laws and regulations were already 
in place in Bangladesh. The authorities had conducted a survey of ionizing radiation sources 
and was in the process of issuing licenses to regulate their operation. His Government was 
aware of its obligations in respect of the attainment of the milestones relating to personnel and 
workplace monitoring, and of the need to separate regulatory aspects from promotional 
aspects in relation to the use of nuclear technologies. A central radioactive waste processing 
and storage facility was also being developed for intermediate storage of radioactive waste 
generated in the country. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it was providing. 
143. Less than one fifth of the Bangladeshi population had access to electricity, and the 
annual per capita generation of electricity was only about 90 kWh. Energy was crucial to 
sustainable development. Without an uninterrupted power supply it was impossible to make 
headway, especially as energy demand grew exponentially with economic progress. Although 
many countries were phasing out nuclear energy, the inadequacy of its indigenous primary 
energy resources had led Bangladesh to consider building a nuclear power plant to meet its 
growing energy needs. It had attached the highest importance to safety issues at all phases of 
the project, and was looking forward to further collaboration with the Agency. 
144. The Agency technical assistance programme in Bangladesh focused on the countryÂs 
needs. Projects were also being implemented under the AgencyÂs research contract 
programme and he welcomed the thematic co-ordinated research project to promote research 
on nuclear technology in developing countries. Bangladesh was actively involved in various 
RCA projects which were providing opportunities for region-wide sharing of experience. 
Those activities should be extended as they helped countries respond to the challenges of 
development. Member States were taking on greater responsibilities in terms of formulating, 
managing and implementing RCA programmes and projects. The establishment of a regional 
RCA office in the Republic of Korea was a welcome move. 
145. Nuclear technology had great potential for improving socio-economic conditions in the 
developing countries. Reliance on market forces alone would, however, not be sufficient and 
international co-operation and commitment were essential to bring technology to developing 
countries. The Agency should take on a more proactive role in that regard. 
146. As a party to the NPT and CTBT, and having recently signed an additional protocol to 
its safeguards agreement, his Government wished to reiterate its firm and full commitment to 
the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and to the establishment of a lasting global 
nuclear safety regime. Bangladesh remained confident in the future of nuclear energy and 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 28 

looked forward to further collaboration with the Agency, particularly where its promotional 
activities were concerned. 

147. Mr. MURPHY (Ireland) said that his country had long regarded the Agency as a 
key asset in efforts to attain the aims and objectives of the NPT. However, it was also 
opposed to any international expansion of the nuclear industry, including the linking of 
nuclear energy with sustainable development. His Government was not persuaded that 
nuclear energy provided a solution to concerns about global warming, climate change and the 
need for sustainable development. Rather, it felt that the perceived benefits of nuclear energy 
were far outweighed by the public health, safety and environmental risks. Irish concerns had 
been brought into sharp relief only recently, as a shipment of MOX fuel had just passed 
through the Irish Sea. 
148. The horrific events of 11 September 2001 had increased the danger of a major disaster 
occurring at a nuclear power plant. Its own proximity to the United KingdomÂs nuclear 
facilities made Ireland fear the health, safety, environmental and economic consequences of a 
terrorist attack on those facilities. All countries which had rejected nuclear energy firmly 
believed that they should not be exposed to the associated risks and dangers. In the current 
climate, it would be folly for any country to contemplate expanding its nuclear energy 
activities. He commended the Agency on its prompt response in establishing a programme of 
measures aimed at combating the threat of nuclear terrorism. His country would be making a 
financial contribution to the AgencyÂs anti-terrorism fund. 
149. Turning to the transport of radioactive material, he emphasized that the concerns he had 
mentioned earlier were shared by a number of other countries whose coastlines lay close to 
the maritime routes used for such shipments. 
150. The serious risks and the potential for catastrophic damage associated with an accident 
related to nuclear activities, including shipments of radioactive materials, made nuclear 
liability an important issue. His Government was concerned about the effectiveness and 
adequacy of the compensation available under existing international nuclear liability 
instruments. An effective international regime was needed to ensure the provision of 
enhanced and appropriate levels of compensation, and the availability of a speedy and 
impartial mechanism for settling claims. Ireland therefore attached particular importance to 
the forthcoming international transport conference. 
151. Nuclear waste disposal was another area of concern. A solution that would be 
acceptable from both a scientific and public standpoint appeared to be no nearer now than it 
had been at the beginning of the nuclear era. A number of other countries were concerned 
about reprocessing activities and radioactive discharges and waste. The many dangers and 
risks which reprocessing posed to public safety and health and to the environment 
significantly outweighed the perceived economic benefits. 
152. Nuclear energy was simply not sustainable, economically or otherwise, especially when 
one added the high research and capital costs, including decommissioning, and the additional 
security costs, to the aforementioned risk factors. Thus, his Government had initiated legal 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 29 

proceedings under the OSPAR Convention and the United Nations Convention on the Law of 
the Sea with regard to the MOX plant at Sellafield. 

153. In the wider context, existing nuclear reactors which could not be upgraded quickly to 
the highest possible safety standards should be closed and decommissioned. Ireland was 
opposed to any proposals for promoting the expansion of nuclear fission power or extending 
the life of existing reactors already operating beyond their original design lifetime. It strongly 
supported the steps taken by the Agency, the European Union and the Nuclear Energy Agency 
to improve safety standards and promote an effective regulatory regime in the countries of 
Central and Eastern Europe and the States of the former Soviet Union. 
154. In recent years, his country had paid its full share of the TCF and hoped to continue to 
do so. However, it did not wish the TCF to be used for promoting the expansion of nuclear 
energy. At a time when certain developed countries were phasing out their nuclear facilities, 
it would be a mistake to encourage developing countries to include nuclear energy in their 
national energy mix. Ireland supported the AgencyÂs initiatives under the TCF in such areas 
as radiation protection and nuclear safety in developing countries, and staff from IrelandÂs 
national regulatory authority for radiation protection would continue to be directly involved in 
implementing such initiatives. 
155. Finally, his country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs work, especially where it related 
to the creation of a global nuclear safety culture and the enhancement of international 
standards. It would continue to give its full support to activities in those areas. 
156. Mr. SHKOLNIK (Kazakhstan) said that the concept for development of the 
uranium industry and nuclear power which his Government had recently approved reflected 
its intention to develop further uranium ore processing with a view to producing higher 
quality uranium products, including nuclear fuel. Kazakhstan had recently joined the NSG. 
Since first developing a nuclear export control system, it had been guided by the GroupÂs 
recommendations which had been incorporated into its national legislation and regulations. 
157. In regulating nuclear activities, significant attention had always been given in 
Kazakhstan to the control of radioactive material, including the use and movement of ionizing 
radiation sources. With Agency assistance, measures were being implemented to strengthen 
the existing system, combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material, and 
improve efficiency. Nevertheless, effective control of radiation sources remained a serious 
problem in the country and he welcomed the initiative of the Agency, Russia and the United 
States aimed at restoring control over sources throughout the former Soviet Union. 
Weakened control over radioactive material could lead to radiological incidents with an 
impact on the environment and public health. The Agency should consider setting up a 
system to control transfers of radiation sources between States similar to the one in place for 
transfers of nuclear material. His country welcomed the revised Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
158. In June 2002, the Kazakhstan parliament had ratified a seven-year extension to the 
agreement with the United States on the destruction of intercontinental ballistic missile 
launching silos, furthering the efforts to destroy infrastructure associated with weapons of 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 30 

mass destruction and increase control over nuclear activities. Work was under way to 
eliminate the consequences of nuclear testing and to destroy the associated infrastructure, with 
specialists from Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States working in close co-operation. It 
was hoped that Kazakhstan would soon be able to sign an additional protocol, since the 
required procedures had almost been completed. 

159. Research was continuing in the country on nuclear and radiation safety, and work on 
optimization of the nuclear fuel cycle. His country was also interested in participating in 
activities related to innovative reactor technologies. Kazakhstan was also working on 
controlled fusion, and design documentation for a Kazakh materials science tokamak had 
been elaborated. 
160. In conclusion, he confirmed his countryÂs support for the AgencyÂs activities relating to 
the development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, the 
strengthening of the non-proliferation regime and the improvement of safety. 
161. Mr. ABDENUR (Brazil) said that, as a founding Member State of the Agency, 
Brazil had always devoted its best efforts to supporting its statutory mission to accelerate and 
enlarge the contribution of nuclear energy to worldwide peace, health and prosperity. 
Consistent with its commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy - a fundamental 
principle of its foreign policy which was enshrined in its Constitution, Brazil remained 
convinced of the potential benefits to be derived from the responsible use of nuclear 
technology. With its unique body of expertise, the Agency was well placed to provide its 
Member States with valuable inputs and tools for implementing their national development 
policies and goals. He reaffirmed his countryÂs support for the AgencyÂs activities, and for its 
outstanding contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and to the use of 
nuclear energy for sustainable development. 
162. The AgencyÂs role in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and at the same 
time preventing its diversion for the production of nuclear weapons, had taken on even greater 
importance in view of the current prospects for full implementation of the nuclear 
disarmament commitments enshrined in Article VI of the NPT. The preparatory process for 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference had recently been launched, and it was hoped that that 
event would lead to enhanced international peace and security through further disarmament 
and non-proliferation measures. However, there were worrying signs that the objectives of 
Article VI would not be achieved, and that progress would not be forthcoming in other 
fundamental areas of multilateral nuclear disarmament efforts, such as the Conference on 
Disarmament and the entry into force of the CTBT. 
163. Having committed themselves unequivocally at the 2000 NPT Review Conference to 
the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, certain nuclear-weapon States had made no 
genuine effort to fulfil their undertaking and were even indicating that they might consider 
developing new nuclear weapon systems and revising existing nuclear doctrines. Though the 
planned reductions in the number of strategic nuclear warheads deployed by the two major 
nuclear-weapon States was a positive step, the streamlining of nuclear arsenals could not by 
itself induce the international community at large to adopt further nuclear non-proliferation 
measures. Countries such as Brazil, which was fully committed to the exclusively peaceful 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 31 

uses of nuclear energy, could only note with concern that new roles for nuclear weapons were 
being considered. 

164. Global co-operation leading to agreement on effective disarmament measures based on 
verifiable and non-discriminatory obligations was an essential prerequisite for a stable and 
secure international system. He therefore appealed to all nations to step up their efforts to 
reverse the current negative trends by fighting to preserve disarmament and non-proliferation 
agreements and commitments entered into by consensus at international level, and other 
fundamental instruments such as the CTBT which should be brought into force as soon as 
possible. In that context, he welcomed CubaÂs decision to accede to the NPT and ratify the 
Tlatelolco Treaty; those decisions contributed to the universalization of the NPT and had the 
important effect of bringing the last remaining Latin American and Caribbean country under 
the umbrella of the Tlatelolco Treaty, which had established the worldÂs first 
nuclear-weapon-free zone. The New Agenda Coalition, to which Brazil belonged, had 
recently issued an important declaration on its views on disarmament and non-proliferation 
matters in New York. 
165. Brazil remained committed to international efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, 
including possible malicious acts involving nuclear material. It also fully shared the concerns 
about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, which further reinforced 
the need to work towards nuclear disarmament. However, the discussions of measures to 
combat such eventualities should not be allowed to provide any justification, even implicit, 
for StatesÂ indefinite retention of such weapons. 
166. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was a major element of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime based on the NPT, whose universality his country strongly supported. By providing 
assurances as to the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful uses, the safeguards 
system contributed significantly to international security. Brazil welcomed the progress 
achieved in integrating traditional and new safeguards measures, as well as the efforts to 
achieve more effective and efficient safeguards implementation. It was convinced of the 
usefulness of the collaboration between ABACC and the Agency as a means of avoiding 
unnecessary duplication of efforts, and looked forward to continued fruitful co-operation 
between the two organizations. 
167. He commended the Agency on its outstanding work in delivering its technical 
co-operation programme and, in particular, welcomed the initiatives being undertaken to 
address the issue of generation and transfer of knowledge, and preservation of nuclear 
knowledge. Projects should continue to meet priorities identified at national level, in 
accordance with each countryÂs views of its own needs in terms of co-operation for 
development. Priority should be given to projects that related to the AgencyÂs core areas of 
competence. He noted with satisfaction the BoardÂs decision on the very important question 
of the financing of technical co-operation for the coming years and expressed the hope that an 
appropriate balance among the AgencyÂs statutory activities would be maintained. 
168. The ARCAL programme had contributed effectively to identifying, bringing together 
and prioritizing regional interests, and to promoting further interaction and co-operation 
among countries in the region. In the context of the efforts to mobilize nuclear technologies 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 32 

for sustainable development, the components of technical co-operation implementation most 
likely to achieve a cost-effective outcome were TCDC and the further utilization of regional 
resource centres in developing countries. 

169. The future of nuclear energy in national development plans depended on the extent to 
which the publicÂs doubts and fears concerning the safe management, storage, transport and 
disposal of nuclear material, nuclear waste and radiation sources could be allayed. Safety was 
of paramount importance, and Brazil highly appreciated the assistance the Agency provided to 
Member States with the promotion of a safety culture. The international conference on safety 
culture in nuclear installations which was due to take place in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the 
year would lend further momentum to those efforts. 
170. In view of the potential risk to coastal populations and the marine environment, it was 
high time to strengthen the international regulatory framework governing the maritime 
transport of radioactive material and nuclear waste. In tackling the issue, the General 
Conference should seek to build upon agreed concepts and guidelines, so as to address the 
legitimate concerns of countries situated along the routes of such transport operations. Brazil 
appreciated the efforts undertaken by major shipping countries to achieve transparency in 
relation to that issue, in particular the TranSAS mission carried out recently in the United 
Kingdom. Brazil itself had received a TranSAS mission earlier in the year, which should help 
improve specific aspects of the national system for licensing and control of radioactive 
material transport operations. He expressed the hope that the issue would be discussed in a 
comprehensive manner at the forthcoming international conference on the safe transport of 
radioactive material in 2003. 
171. The commencement of operation of the ANGRA II power plant in 2000 had increased 
the national installed nuclear power capacity to 2000 MW, half the power generated in the 
State of Rio de Janeiro. In view of BrazilÂs growing energy needs, feasibility studies were 
being conducted for the ANGRA III power plant; those studies also covered the 
environmental impact and the financial aspects. A new commercial uranium enrichment plant 
was due to be commissioned by the end of 2002. 
172. Brazil also continued to invest in the production of radiopharmaceuticals, seeking 
constant improvements in that area, as well as in the application of nuclear techniques in 
industry, agriculture and the environment. 
173. Mr BORG (Malta) called on the Agency to continue and possibly intensify its 
already considerable activities contributing to sustainable development, in particular by 
promoting technologies which increased productivity in agriculture and enhanced water 
resource management. 
174. His country had noted with interest the progress made by the Marine Environment 
Laboratory in Monaco with the development of new techniques for the detection and study of 
nuclear and non-nuclear marine pollutants both in the laboratory and the field. The possible 
application of those techniques to the Mediterranean Sea should be studied in depth, which 
would require co-operation between the European, African and possibly Asian regions of the 
Agency. Co-operation with UNEP might also be beneficial, and Malta was prepared to 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 33 

collaborate in any way it could. It was also prepared to collaborate in any exercise involving 
the preparation of an emergency response plan for a possible nuclear emergency in the 
Mediterranean. 

175. As a small island State with limited natural resources, Malta relied heavily on 
investment in human resources, which had to be made on a continuous basis, in order to 
secure a decent standard of living for present and future Maltese generations. 
176. The transfer of technology for capacity building played a crucial role in the sustainable 
development of developing countries and small States. With Agency assistance, Malta had 
managed to secure access to nuclear scientific and technological information in the fields of 
treatment planning and quality assurance for radiotherapy, groundwater management, and 
food contaminants of animal origin. 
177. His country was in the process of formulating a national radiological emergency 
response plan which called for a high degree of institutional capacity building and 
co-ordination among the various public entities involved. An advisory committee headed by 
the Civil Protection Department had already been established with the aim of formulating 
such an emergency plan, which should form part of a master plan for the Maltese Islands to 
address nuclear, chemical, biological and other emergencies. In view of the limited local 
experience in the field, Agency technical assistance and institutional capacity building was 
deemed crucial to the project. 
178. Over the coming biennium, with Agency assistance, Malta would be embarking on a 
project aimed at establishing a comprehensive quality control and assurance and patient 
dosimetry system in radiology, including radionuclide imaging at the national general 
hospital. Another project would enhance the development of national capabilities for personal 
and workplace radiation monitoring at the Malta National Laboratory, which was in the 
process of upgrading and relocating. It would also be participating in a number of regional 
projects which promoted training opportunities for government and other officials. 
179. Malta was in the final stages of adopting legislation to regulate the use, management, 
storage and disposal of radioactive substances. That legislation would establish a Radiation 
Protection Board and, once adopted, would put the Government in a position to accede to the 
relevant Agency conventions, including the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear 
Material. 
180. There could be no sustainable development without peace. The AgencyÂs readiness to 
contribute to the resolution of the Iraqi situation in a peaceful manner through the 
implementation of Security Council resolutions should continue to remain a priority. 
181. Although Malta did not possess the necessary expertise to participate in the 
comprehensive review of all Agency activities relevant to protection against nuclear 
terrorism, it appreciated that initiative and commended the Director General for establishing 
an Advisory Group on Nuclear Security. It was confident that the specific proposals 
incorporated in the action plan would contribute substantially to the national measures taken 
by Member States. 

GC(46/OR.6 
page 34 

182. Mr. ERPUL (Turkey), exercising his right of reply, said that he was compelled to 
respond to certain politically motivated and completely unfounded allegations against Turkey 
made by the Armenian representative. The Armenian delegationÂs allegations of a blockade 
by Turkey were not only groundless but a further example of ArmeniaÂs aggressive attitude 
towards some of its neighbours. Turkey had encouraged Armenia to become integrated in 
regional economic arrangements and activities and had invited Armenia to become a member 
of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation Organization. Moreover, the Armenian aviation 
companies ÂArmenian AirwaysÂ and ÂArmaviaÂ both ran several flights a week to Turkish 
airports and used Turkish air corridors for their international connections, demonstrating that 
the allegation of a blockade was false. 
183. His country sincerely hoped that the General Conference would remain a venue for 
exchanging ideas and discussing topics related to the AgencyÂs mandate. 
The meeting rose at 7.15 p.m.

GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (continued) 
(GC(46)/2) 

1. Mr. PEREVET (Cameroon), recalling the tragic loss of life caused by the terrorist 
attacks of 11 September 2001, commended the prompt measures taken by the Agency to 
protect against nuclear terrorism. 
2. Cameroon was committed to promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and to 
strengthening the non-proliferation regime. The NPT was the foundation of that regime and 
he expressed the hope that the ongoing negotiations would enable the international 
community to move closer to full implementation of that Treaty. In that connection, his 
country was looking forward to the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty and to the start of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a treaty banning 
the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
3. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to improve its programme of assistance to Member 
States with the development of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The international 
community had shown an increasing interest in the problems of peace, security, development, 
poverty eradication and protection of the environment in recent years, and the Agency should 
play an ever greater role in those areas. In that context, he welcomed the recent initiative 
aimed at combating the tsetse fly in Africa using the SIT. Eradication of that pest would be a 
decisive factor in reducing poverty and promoting socio-economic development. 
4. Equally, he noted with satisfaction the action taken pursuant to General Conference 
resolution GC(44)/RES/24 on servicing immediate human needs, in particular the 
establishment of a regional technical co-operation programme on use of the SIT to combat the 
malaria-transmitting mosquito. 
5. His country also appreciated the efforts to implement resolution GC(44)/RES/18 on 
strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities and it attached high priority to 
sustainable, self-sufficient programmes with a high socio-economic impact on the rural 
population and with a potential for poverty reduction. It therefore supported the increasing 
number of technical co-operation projects in the areas of human health, animal production and 
health, non-destructive testing and quality control, nuclear science and applications, radiation 
protection and radiation and waste safety which had helped it develop its human resources 
and strengthen its co-operation tools. Thanks to the Agency, Cameroon now had an 
endocrinology laboratory and a gamma camera for diagnosis of cancer. Through its CPF, 
which was currently being elaborated, it was hoping to reorient its co-operation activities in 
line with its national strategy to fight poverty, concentrating on health, public works, 
education and rural development. In line with the AgencyÂs recommendations, his country 
was committed to establishing a legal and regulatory framework for radiation protection and 
radiological safety. The Agency had also helped Cameroon develop its capacities in the area 
of non-destructive testing, enabling it to carry out the testing work for the 
1070 kilometre-long Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline. 
6. As in many other African countries, some regions of Cameroon suffered from an acute 
water shortage. The World Bank had estimated that the availability of renewable water 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 6 

resources would halve by 2025. With the added problems of pollution, desertification and 
deforestation, the country would soon face a serious potable water shortage. In less than a 
century the surface area of Lake Chad had shrunk by 90%, endangering socio-economic 
activities in an area covering part of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and the Central African 
Republic. Thus, his country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs activities on 
sustainable management of water resources. He also welcomed the launch of a regional 
programme on combating desertification and expressed the hope that adequate human and 
physical resources would be made available for those activities. 

7. The Government of Cameroon was making great efforts to settle its arrears of assessed 
programme costs. It had paid its contribution to the TCF for 2002 and had made 
arrangements to ensure regular payment of its share of the TCF and its assessed programme 
costs. 
8. For some time, the international community had been taking a great interest in 
environmental problems and climate change, and the Agency should intensify its work on 
prevention of the risks of radiation emissions, elimination of contamination from ionizing 
radiation sources, and protection of the environment at mining and marine sites. It should 
also look into the possibility of applying nuclear techniques in the area of seismic, volcanic 
and environmental risk management, and in combating HIV and AIDs. 
9. CameroonÂs national institutions were becoming increasingly involved in the activities 
of the AFRA programme. A regional workshop on screening of mutants had been held in 
Doula in June. The programme had also helped his country set up a competitive structure for 
non-destructive testing. Efforts would continue under other parts of the programme such as 
promotion of radiation physics in national hospital training, strengthening of dosimetric 
monitoring of radiation workers, strengthening of national equipment maintenance and repair 
capabilities and of radioactive waste infrastructures. 
10. Mr. BEKOE (Ghana) said that, as the Annual Report for 2001 showed, the 
Agency was consistently and successfully promoting nuclear science and technology, safety 
and verification - the three pillars of its programme - in Member States, bringing them 
significant benefits. 
11. In the area of safeguards, Ghana had participated in the AgencyÂs seminar for African 
States on the role of safeguards agreements and additional protocols, which had been held in 
South Africa in June 2002. It had been one of the first countries in sub-Saharan Africa to sign 
the NPT on 4 May 1970, and the first African country to sign an additional protocol 
on 11 June 1998. It had complied fully with the NPT, and its additional protocol was 
currently before the Ghanaian parliament awaiting approval. As soon as the protocol was 
approved, his country would ratify it; in the meanwhile, it had already started implementing 
its provisions. 
12. Some States had not yet brought into force comprehensive safeguards agreements. 
Since the Agency could only carry out its verification activities where the necessary 
agreements were in place, he urged those States to conclude safeguards agreements with the 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 7 

Agency in accordance with their NPT obligations as soon as possible. The importance of the 
universal application of Agency safeguards could not be overemphasized. 

13. The Agency continued to foster a strong and visible safety regime and its achievements 
to date were impressive. Although the application of safety standards was primarily a 
national responsibility, the Agency should continue to provide all possible assistance for their 
implementation in Member States. It should also continue to assist Member States to 
strengthen their response capabilities in the case of nuclear and radiological emergencies. Its 
recent work on urgent problems associated with the existence of orphan sources, and its plans 
to combat nuclear terrorism were commendable. Training courses on safety-related issues 
should be promoted for countries in the African region. In that regard, he commended the 
Agency for initiating plans to organize an interregional training course in the current year on 
emerging nuclear security issues at the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States. 
14. Ghana had taken particular note of the Department of Technical Co-operationÂs new 
approach aimed at achieving self-reliance and sustainability by taking nuclear technology to 
the market place and developing mechanisms and best practices for working with both the 
private and public sectors. The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission, under the framework of 
AFRA, had identified four key areas where that approach could be applied: research reactor 
utilization, in which field analytical services were being rendered to various industries, 
research institutes, local and foreign universities and public institutions; non-destructive 
testing services for oil refineries, thermal power plants, shipyards and petroleum companies 
both in the Government and private sector; gamma irradiation of food and medical products; 
and tissue culture and plant breeding, where the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences of the 
Biotechnology and Nuclear Agriculture Research Institute was using in vitro and nuclear 
techniques to breed new varieties of various crops. His country was also putting into effect 
policies which would accelerate commercial application of biotechnology to promote 
sustainable agriculture. Business plans and feasibility studies were being prepared, together 
with quality control and quality assurance management plans, so that the Ghana Atomic 
Energy Commission could deliver services and products in a cost-effective manner in order to 
make a socio-economic impact in Ghana. Those efforts should also promote technical 
co-operation among the countries in the region. 
15. His country was grateful for the Agency technical assistance it had received and looked 
forward to even greater co-operation and partnership in future years. The AgencyÂs technical 
co-operation programmes required the commitment and support of all Member States. 
16. The significant support which was being given indirectly through the Abdus Salam 
International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) to the University of Cape Coast and the 
National Centre for Mathematical Sciences deserved particular mention. The ICTP continued 
to provide assistance to the Laser and Fibre Optics Centre at the University of Cape Coast and 
was supporting collaboration between the University and the National Centre for 
Mathematical Sciences on a PhD programme, providing facilities, organizing short-term 
regional colleges and workshops on specific subjects, and assisting visiting scholars from the 
United States of America, Europe and other parts of Africa to participate in those 
programmes. Ghana was also eagerly looking forward to the Director GeneralÂs visit to 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 8 

participate in the commissioning of its second radiotherapy centre, and to discuss the future of 
the AgencyÂs work in the sub-region. 

17. Mr. PALACIOS (Ecuador), welcomed the announcement by the Government of 
Cuba that it intended to accede to the NPT, and its decision to ratify the Tlatelolco Treaty. On 
25 October 2001, his own country had deposited the instruments of ratification for its 
additional protocol and for the ARCAL agreement. 
18. Ecuador had a law regulating the manufacture, use, transfer and transport of equipment 
generating ionizing radiation and radiation sources. Under that law, the Ecuadorian Atomic 
Energy Commission was responsible for the regulation and control of peaceful applications of 
nuclear energy and for applying the code of conduct on radiation safety promulgated in 1978. 
It ran regular radiation protection training courses on ionizing radiation, physical dosimetry, 
biological effects of radiation, practical protection measures and the current regulations and 
performed regular inspections of users of ionizing radiation to check compliance with legal 
requirements. Use of radiation sources in industrial applications had increased over the 
preceding year. Control of and sanctions against breaches had been strengthened. Sanctions 
were imposed by a special judge who was also the Executive Director of the Commission. 
The Commission was also implementing a Model Project on radiation protection developed 
by the Agency. Moreover, Ecuador was monitoring the safety and security of facilities and 
radiation sources through regular inspections. 
19. His country was applying the AgencyÂs Regulations for the Safe Transport of 
Radioactive Material. The Commission issued licences for movements between provinces 
and provided radiation monitoring services where necessary. Ecuador was in favour of an 
international regime for transport of radioactive material covering liability for damage to 
human health or the environment, or any economic loss caused by an accident. Furthermore, 
it was important that coastal states receive prior notification of any maritime transport of 
radioactive material. 
20. Finally, in the technical co-operation field, the Commission was implementing various 
projects relating to the use of nuclear energy in the fields of human health, agriculture, natural 
resources, the environment and human resource training. Ecuador was also participating 
actively in ARCAL and was grateful to the Agency for the support it provided in the technical 
co-operation field which contributed to its sustainable development. 
21. Mr. AL OWAIS (United Arab Emirates) said that nuclear energy had a vast 
potential to benefit mankind, but it also had enormous destructive power. The international 
community should persist in its efforts to achieve optimum use of nuclear energy in peaceful 
applications such as electricity generation, seawater desalination, agriculture, diagnosis and 
therapy etc., and to eliminate the dangers of non-peaceful uses by fully co-operating with the 
Agency. 
22. Since joining the Agency in 1976, his country had been stressing the need to harness 
nuclear energy in the service of mankind, especially in the areas of agriculture, industry and 
health. The United Arab Emirates had five medical centres and four accelerators to treat 
malignant tumours, apart from hundreds of X-ray machines. During the preceding thirty 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 9 

years, the peaceful uses of nuclear energy had wrought many changes in the daily life of the 
people, and his country was making every effort to promote international co-operation in the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, control of the use of radiation sources and radiation 
protection. It had passed legislation, set up the necessary commissions and prepared an action 
plan with Agency co-operation with a view to strengthening control of radiation sources. 

23. Safeguards constituted one of the important pillars of the AgencyÂs work, and the 
United Arab Emirates was a party to the NPT and intended to sign a safeguards agreement. 
However, the Agency should make greater efforts to apply the safeguards system to all States, 
without exception, in particular in the Middle East, and his country would support any move 
to declare the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
24. Increasing use was being made of nuclear technology to meet basic human development 
needs in many areas, and the technical co-operation programme was an important mechanism 
for the transfer of nuclear science and technology. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts in 
that sphere, although the use his country made of Agency technical co-operation was still 
modest. As a centre for the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries, the 
Agency should strive to play a more effective role, especially in nuclear, radiation and waste 
safety and other related areas. The United Arab Emirates was a member of ARASIA, and 
regional co-operation between the members of that agreement should benefit States in the 
region. He expressed the hope that the three ARASIA projects which had been submitted on 
planning of sustainable energy, quality assurance for radioanalytical laboratories and 
non-destructive testing would be approved under the technical co-operation programme. 
25. Concern had recently been expressed regarding the radiation effects of depleted 
uranium used in many peaceful and non-peaceful applications. People could be exposed to it 
through inhalation or ingestion, or through wounds. The Agency should carry out more 
studies of that problem and take appropriate technical measures to reassure the international 
community about the use of depleted uranium. 
26. In conclusion, he called upon all governments, organizations and individuals to 
strengthen international co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
27. Mr. TROJANOVIC (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) observed that, during the 
one year of its membership, his country had continued to establish co-operation arrangements 
with the Agency in all areas, including technical co-operation. It had submitted six projects 
for the 2003-2004 technical co-operation cycle, on safe disposal of spent fuel from the RA 
research reactor, decommissioning of the RA research reactor, safe nuclear waste 
management at the Vinca Institute, improvement of the technical functioning and control 
process and safe disposal of spent elements from the industrial sterilization unit, production of 
radiopharmaceuticals in the Vinca cyclotron, and improvement of the technical characteristics 
of the RB reactor. He was grateful to the Agency for accepting those projects, and for 
approving the provision of financial assistance and computer equipment for the Vinca Nuclear 
Science Institute and the Geoinstitute at the 45th regular session of the General Conference. 
28. Faithful to its commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, his country had, in 
co-operation with the United States, the Russian Federation and the Agency, and with 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 10 

financial support from the Nuclear Threat Initiative, successfully shipped the remainder of its 
80%-enriched fresh nuclear fuel back to its country of origin, Russia, for reduction of its 
enrichment. 

29. At the same time, the preparatory work had been completed for a number of 
programmes relating to the restructuring of the Vinca Nuclear Science Institute. The first 
such programme included the shipment of the unused high-enriched uranium to the Russian 
Federation and, the replacement of the spent fuel storage containers with the ultimate intent of 
removing the spent fuel from Vinca. Others related to the decommissioning of the RA reactor 
and to the construction of a new and safe depository for medium-and low-level material 
outside Vinca. His countryÂs determination to resolve those problems without delay had also 
been confirmed at the basic decommissioning workshop held earlier in the month at Vinca, 
which had been attended by experts from the Vinca Institute, representatives of the State 
authorities and Agency experts. A detailed exchange of views had taken place on the 
optimum professional, safety and financial requirements for decommissioning of the RA 
reactor and a permanent safe disposal site for radioactive material. His country hoped that the 
Agency, the United States, the Russian Federation and other countries and organizations 
would continue to provide assistance with the implementation of those projects. 
30. Yugoslavia had co-operated actively with the Agency inspectors who carried out the 
regular inspections at the Vinca Nuclear Science Institute under its safeguards agreement. It 
had faithfully implemented that agreement over a long period. Furthermore, it was convinced 
that the Model Additional Protocol would improve the application of safeguards and it was 
considering concluding an additional protocol in the near future. 
31. In conclusion, his country had discharged all its financial obligations to the Agency and 
would take steps to settle its financial obligations for 2003 in good time, including its share of 
the TCF for 2003. He expressed the hope that the Agency would allocate greater financial 
resources to programmes which were directly related to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
and to protection of the environment from radiation. 
32. Mr. ABDULAATI MOHAMED (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) thanked the Agency 
for the valuable co-operation his country had received over the years and expressed the hope 
that the projects submitted by his country for the 2003-2004 technical co-operation cycle 
would be approved, in particular those on isotope hydrology and eradication of the fruit fly. 
33. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was active in the nuclear energy field at both regional and 
interregional level. It had hosted many co-ordination meetings and training courses for 
AFRA and the Arab Atomic Energy Agency. In August 2002 it had received an Agency 
mission to review its CPF, and in October 2000 it would be hosting a training workshop on 
inspection of medical equipment and radiation sources organized by the Agency. 
34. His country was interested in co-operating with African States in the production of 
radioisotopes for medical purposes and in the provision of training in radiation protection at 
the Tajoura Nuclear Research Centre. It had also approached the relevant authorities in Sudan 
and South Africa with a view to signing a memorandum of understanding and an agreement. 
It had signed a similar agreement with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 11 

35. He commended the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, 
radiation, transport and waste safety. The radiation monitoring and nuclear safety office that 
had been set up in his country the preceding year had started operations. It was responsible 
for overseeing implementation of the law regulating the use of and protection against ionizing 
radiation, and had actively participated in the technical meetings on detecting and locating 
orphan sources which had been held in July 2002. 
36. Technical co-operation activities relating to nuclear science, technology and 
applications should be strengthened, especially in the areas of water resource management, 
use of the SIT to eradicate the fruit fly and agricultural pests, improvement of livestock 
productivity, radiation therapy, nuclear medicine and other applications which promoted 
socio-economic development in developing countries. The necessary financial resources 
should be made available for training in those techniques and for procurement of equipment, 
instruments and laboratories. 
37. He commended the measures the Agency had taken to protect against nuclear terrorism 
and thanked the Director General for his report on that subject. However, it was important to 
maintain a balance between the AgencyÂs activities with regard to both planning and 
financing, and technical co-operation programmes should continue to be implemented in 
accordance with the priorities set by Member States. Activities relating to protection against 
nuclear terrorism should be funded from a fund set up with contributions from Member 
States. 
38. His country attached great importance to global disarmament and nuclear 
non-proliferation, since nuclear weapons constituted a threat to peace and security. It was 
essential that the safeguards system and the additional protocol be applied universally and 
without discrimination. The first step should be to demand that States possessing weapons of 
mass destruction eliminate them. In their current form, integrated safeguards were 
discriminatory, giving full freedom to the nuclear-weapon States to choose both the procedure 
for the application of safeguards and the sites where they were applied, and thus encouraging 
them to continue to develop armament programmes and to increase their nuclear arsenals. 
The only guarantee for the developing countries against the threat of the use of nuclear 
weapons was the elimination of those weapons by all nuclear-weapon States. He therefore 
called upon all nuclear-weapon States to prepare a programme for the elimination of their 
nuclear arsenals within a definite time-frame, subject to international verification with the 
participation of developing countries, and to halt all nuclear weapon development plans. 
39. The Middle East region continued to suffer from a great security imbalance owing to 
IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons and because that countryÂs nuclear installations were 
not subject to safeguards. The other States in the Middle East were seeking to make the 
region a nuclear-weapon-free zone. All of them except Israel were party to NPT, some of 
them were party to the Pelindaba Treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa, 
and some had signed an additional protocol. Double standards and discrimination between 
States when applying international treaties, agreements, laws and resolutions created an 
atmosphere of mistrust, prompting those States which did abide by international law to 
question its fairness. Peace could not be achieved in the Middle East while the major powers 
supported Israel, allowing the latter to ignore calls for peace and exhortations to sign the NPT, 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 12 

conclude a safeguards agreement with the Agency and open its facilities to international 
inspection. He therefore urged the General Conference to take all necessary steps to ensure 
that Israel complied with the will of the international community. 

40. His country welcomed IraqÂs decision to agree to the return of the international 
inspectors. It was a wise decision, which would help to remove the danger of war and 
destruction in the region. He hoped that all parties concerned would profit from that positive 
move and would resort to peaceful dialogue to resolve any conflicts rather than military 
threats. 
41. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that the Conference would adopt the proposed 
resolution on strengthening the AgencyÂs activities related to nuclear science, technology and 
applications. 
42. Mr. TAVCIOVSKI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) said that his 
country had deposited the instrument of ratification for its NPT safeguards agreement that 
year, thus meeting the constitutional requirements for the entry into force of that agreement 
and the related protocol. 
43. It had also made a significant step towards compliance with international radiation 
safety standards through the promulgation of a new national law on radiation protection and 
safety. An independent Radiation Safety Directorate would be established pursuant to that 
law and regulations covering the essential elements of the Basic Safety Standards would be 
finalized. The continuing support of the Agency would be required to allow the regulatory 
authority to operate at a high level and to build competence in radiation protection. Priority 
was being given to the preparation of other appropriate regulations and codes of practice. 
More intensive training programmes would be held at national level. The ongoing Agency 
projects on quality assurance and control of medical applications were expected to provide a 
sustainable basis for more efficient control of medical exposure. 
44. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia supported the Agency's efforts to 
strengthen its technical co-operation activities, bringing them in line with national 
development goals and priorities. Its new CPF had been prepared with Agency assistance and 
should further improve the already successful co-operation effort. The countryÂs future 
programme would focus primarily on further strengthening the regulatory infrastructure and 
improving the application of isotope techniques in selected areas such as human health, 
agriculture, veterinary medicine, the environment and hydrology. Projects in the next cycle 
would concentrate on diagnosis and treatment procedures in medicine, combating of illicit 
trafficking and low-level waste management. 
45. His country would continue to support the AgencyÂs regional technical co-operation 
programme for Europe. For the forthcoming cycle, it had proposed a project on the control of 
brucellosis in sheep and goats with a view to disseminating technologies developed under 
earlier national projects sponsored by the Agency, and developing quality assurance schemes 
for the certification of milk products as free from brucellosis. The countries that had 
supported the proposal would be invited to a regional workshop at the beginning of the 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 13 

following year. The national Veterinary Institute had already offered its expertise, and 
training for fellows from other countries. 

46. His country also welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear 
and radioactive substances. During the current year, it had hosted a regional training 
workshop for participants from 11 countries in the region with exercises at the Macedonian 
border. It had also initiated efforts to develop the required operating procedures to strengthen 
national capacity for combating illicit trafficking under a national project during the 
forthcoming project cycle. 
47. Mr. AMHA (Ethiopia) said that applications of nuclear techniques in agriculture, 
human health and nutrition, animal reproduction and health, and water resources studies and 
management, had grown steadily in his country over the preceding few years. With Agency 
support, the country had been able to build appreciable infrastructure and manpower 
capabilities, and substantial results had already been achieved in radiotherapy, nuclear 
medicine, groundwater and surface water studies, radiation protection and nuclear 
instrumentation. That had encouraged the Government to commit itself to larger projects. 
48. Although Ethiopia was participating in a number of national and regional projects, its 
main focus in the preceding year had been on two projects. The first of those related to the 
use of the SIT for tsetse eradication in the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. It was of 
immense significance, as 85% of the population depended on agriculture. Tsetse-transmitted 
animal trypanosomosis was one of the most significant and costly diseases in the fertile 
lowlands of Ethiopia. An estimated 150 000-200 000 km2 of the land in the fertile valleys of 
the south, west and north-west of Ethiopia were infested with one or more of the countryÂs 
five known tsetse fly species. As a result, 10-14 million head of cattle and an equivalent 
number of small ruminants were believed to be at serious risk of trypanosomosis. The 
Government had shown its commitment to dealing with those problems by providing trained 
manpower, financing and facilities for the several national and regional tsetse intervention 
projects. The project in question had been initiated four years previously, and it was planned 
to use the SIT as part of an integrated pest management programme. The project activities 
implemented in 2001 to 2002 had included the setting up of an appropriate organizational 
structure, manpower mobilization and training, laboratory and field equipment acquisition, 
suppression of the tsetse population using conventional methods and rearing of a tsetse fly 
colony for release in the field. The results obtained thus far had been encouraging. 
49. His country recognized that tsetse and trypanosomosis were a transboundary problem 
and therefore required co-ordinated efforts in tsetse-infested regions both inside and outside 
the country. Tsetse eradication using the SIT also required adequate involvement on the part 
of the beneficiary country. Ethiopia had played an important role in the establishment of the 
Pan African SIT Forum and PATTEC. It strongly believed that joint international action 
against tsetse constituted a major step towards poverty reduction and it urged United Nations 
organizations active in that field, notably the FAO, WHO and IAEA, to co-ordinate their 
efforts with the PATTEC initiative. 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 14 

50. With support from the Agency, Ethiopia had been applying isotope techniques in water 
resource management activities and had obtained scientific information critical to the 
understanding of groundwater, surface water and geothermal resources in the country. 
Encouraged by those results, the Government was finalizing preparations to launch the 
country's second largest technical co-operation project with assistance from the Agency and 
the United States Geological Survey. The Ethiopian Groundwater Resources Assessment 
Programme aimed at understanding and mapping the hydrogeology of the country. Proper 
understanding and management of water resources were highly important owing to the 
recurrent droughts in that part of the world. 
51. Aware as it was of the need to adhere to a safety regime that could adequately 
support nuclear and related technology transfer in development efforts, Ethiopia had enacted 
the Radiation Protection Proclamation and had established a National Radiation Protection 
Authority in 1993. The latter was now a credible and competent regulatory authority with a 
well functioning and effective regulatory system. Over the preceding three years, Ethiopia 
had been actively co-operating with the Agency under the regional Model Project on 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure. That project had been well tailored to address 
the similarities and differences in participating Member States and had helped establish an 
appropriate radiation protection infrastructure in Ethiopia. His country was committed to the 
further development of a sustainable national infrastructure, to putting in place the best 
protection and safety standards compatible with the socio-economic conditions in the country, 
and to developing a deep-rooted safety culture in applications involving ionizing radiation. 
52. Mr. ZAMBEZI (Zambia) commended the measures the Agency had been taking 
to strengthen its technical co-operations activities, which were critical to the development of 
underdeveloped countries, and to strengthen international co-operation in nuclear, radiation 
and waste safety, which were of cardinal importance in fostering public confidence in the use 
of nuclear science and technology and in avoiding nuclear catastrophes. 
53. Zambia had taken measures to address the problem of illicit trafficking in nuclear 
material and had drafted appropriate legislation which was currently awaiting further action 
by the Government. It was also in the process of concluding an additional protocol and had 
signed and would soon be ratifying the CTBT. 
54. He commended the AgencyÂs programme and budget for 2003 and the continued efforts 
to strengthen the technical co-operation programme. ZambiaÂs CPF should provide an agreed 
basis for a programme of action. 
55. His country continued to build on the level of infrastructure and human resources 
development it had achieved through Agency technical assistance. Since the preceding 
session of the General Conference, tele-linking and tele-diagnosis had been introduced and a 
new gamma camera had been acquired for the Nuclear Medicine Unit of the University 
Teaching Hospital. Future activities would include full tele-linking to the Groote Schuur 
Hospital in Capetown, South Africa, and training of doctors and technicians to ensure the 
sustainability of the project. The neonatal hypothyroidism monitoring facilities at the 
University Teaching Hospital enabled timely remedial measures to be taken and provided 
diagnostic services to adults. Facilities for monitoring drug-resistant tuberculosis and 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 15 

detecting drug-resistant malaria had been set up at the Tropical Diseases Research Centre at 
Ndola with Agency support. Those diseases were a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
the country and the data collected were being used to update the national drug policy. 

56. The plant tissue culture facility continued to offer support for the national potato seed 
supply and food security initiatives, and varieties of cassava were being micro-propagated for 
use as disease-free planting material by farmers in rural areas. 
57. Capacity to monitor industrial aerosols and radon in mines and work places was being 
established and initial sampling had started. That activity would be of benefit in ensuring 
occupational health and safety, especially for those working in the mining industry. An 
expert mission under the project was assisting with the installation of equipment and planning 
of project activities. Zambia appreciated the AgencyÂs continued assistance with the 
strengthening of the local focal point for the International Nuclear Information System (INIS). 
58. His country set a high value on technical co-operation within the framework of AFRA, 
which brought into action teams of experts in a number of fields such as radiotherapy, isotope 
hydrology and nuclear medicine, using the expertise and capacity available within the region. 
Zambia had received AFRA missions on instrumentation, sustainability of nuclear facilities 
and marketing. Zambian scientists and technical staff had participated in training seminars, 
co-ordination meetings and programmes in the fields of isotope hydrology, non-destructive 
testing, renewable energy and the SIT, inter alia. He expressed hope that support for AFRA 
would continue so that the projects scheduled for 2003-2004 could be implemented. 
59. In conclusion, he noted that Zambia would be pledging its full share of the TCF 
for 2003. 
60. Ms. MOLLEL (United Republic of Tanzania) said that her country condemned 
terrorism in all its forms and in the strongest terms, and she appealed to international civil 
society to use every legitimate means to combat such acts, including preventing access by 
terrorists to nuclear material and facilities. 
61. Tanzania was grateful to the Agency for the technical assistance it received from it. 
LDCs, particularly those in Africa, needed appropriate technologies to fight and reduce the 
poverty caused - in particular - by famine and AIDS. Nuclear technologies had a critical role 
to play in development programmes in such fields as tsetse eradication, animal and crop 
improvement, nuclear medicine or radiotherapy, and industry, water resources and mining. 
62. Tsetse infestation, trypanosomosis and the spread of sleeping sickness remained major 
constraints on human health, and livestock and crop improvement across vast areas of 
Tanzania that had a great potential for increased and improved agricultural and animal 
production. Trypanosomosis affected both humans and livestock in over 60% of the country. 
Stockbreeders and farmers were forced to compete for the available remaining 10% of 
tsetse-free grazing land leading to over-grazing and soil degradation. 
63. Tanzania was therefore highly appreciative of the AgencyÂs efforts to help African 
Member States deal with the tsetse problem, particularly through PATTEC. The Agency had 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 16 

assisted Tanzania with the mass rearing and radiation sterilization of tsetse flies for release in 
Zanzibar. Following the success of that operation, similar efforts were being deployed on 
Mafia Island and in the Babati district. Her country was committed to the PATTEC initiative 
and was in the process of establishing a National Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Control 
Committee to facilitate its participation in it. It had already signed a contract with the Agency 
for the mass rearing and supply of sterile flies under project RAF/5/051; under that contract, 
the Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Research Institute in Tanga, Tanzania, would rear 150 000 
female Glossina pallidipes for tsetse control activities in the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia, 
and another 150 000 female Glossina morsitans centralis for similar activities in the 
Okavango delta in Botswana. A colony of 60 000 female Glossina austeni would be 
maintained for the continuation of the Zanzibar activities. 

64. Tanzania was grateful to the United States of America for having provided funds for the 
rehabilitation and fly-proofing of the Tanga facility, which would enable it to mass rear tsetse 
species for the planned eradication activities in Babati and on Mafia island in the United 
Republic of Tanzania. Other countries had also provided welcome support. The SIT had 
already been successful in Zanzibar proving that, when the technique was integrated with 
other environmentally benign technologies, tsetse flies could be completely eradicated. Now 
that Zanzibar was tsetse free, agriculture and livestock improvement activities were on the 
increase. Thus, the SIT was also a major weapon against hunger, disease and poverty. She 
appealed to all those who wished Africa well to support the PATTEC initiative. 
65. Nuclear medicine and radiotherapy were other areas where the United Republic of 
Tanzania had achieved major successes with technical assistance from the Agency. Many 
Tanzanians now had access to improved nuclear medicine and radiotherapy services at the 
Ocean Road Cancer Institute and did not have to go outside the country. That Institute was 
the only cancer hospital and served around 37 million people. Unfortunately, the old 
radiotherapy equipment, which had been rehabilitated with Agency assistance ten years 
previously, urgently needed to be replaced in order to make optimal use of the recently 
introduced treatment planning systems and ensure patient safety. Tanzania hoped that new 
equipment could be bought through the technical co-operation programme on a cost-sharing 
basis. 
66. There had been encouraging developments in the nuclear power field and her country 
welcomed the recent research and development initiatives on low-cost power reactor units 
which would ensure the cost-effectiveness, competitiveness, viability, affordability and safety 
of nuclear energy, and minimize the generation of nuclear waste. Tanzania believed that 
nuclear power should be part of the global clean energy mix, but people in developing 
countries and elsewhere needed the assurance that power reactors could be operated safely 
and cheaply, and that they did not give rise to increased nuclear weapon proliferation or 
long-term spent fuel and nuclear waste disposal problems. She urged the Agency to take a 
leading role in the current vigorous research and development initiatives, and to promote the 
involvement of developing countries in reactor design improvement work. 
67. In the radiation protection field, Tanzania was currently revising its legislation and was 
grateful to the Agency for its input and assistance in the development of the preliminary draft 
bill. Good international co-operation in the current environment of liberalized economies 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 17 

should enable LDCs like Tanzania to derive maximum benefit from nuclear technology, 
including the nuclear power option. 

68. Her country supported all international efforts to avert nuclear weapon proliferation 
through effective nuclear safeguards and measures to combat international terrorism. It also 
hoped to see intensified efforts to conclude a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear weapons. 
69. Finally, she announced that Tanzania would be pledging its full share of the TCF. 
ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS 
(GC(46)/5 and 21) 

70. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General conference had approved a 
procedure whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a 
particular area, no secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas 
where no candidate had been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the 
rational use of the General ConferenceÂs time. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the 
Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, which provided that elections to the Board 
should be by secret ballot, be suspended in respect of those areas for which there was 
agreement. 
71. He was happy to report that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their 
candidates for the vacancies to be filled. 
72. Drawing attention to document GC(46)/5, containing a list of the Agency Member 
States which the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the 
ConferenceÂs present session until the end of the 47th (2003) regular session, he recalled that, 
under Rule 83 of the Rules of Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the 
elective places on the Board which had to be filled. To that end, document GC(46)/21 had 
been prepared; it indicated that the Conference had to elect eleven Members of the Board 
from the seven categories listed. 
73. He took it that the General conference wished to elect Brazil, Cuba and Panama to the 
three vacant seats for Latin America. 
74. Brazil, Cuba and Panama were duly elected. 
75. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Denmark 
and the Netherlands to the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
76. Denmark and the Netherlands were duly elected. 
77. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect the Czech 
Republic to the vacant seat for Eastern Europe. 
78. The Czech Republic was duly elected. 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 18 

79. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Egypt and 
Sudan to the two vacant seats for Africa. 
80. Egypt and Sudan were duly elected. 
81. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Saudi 
Arabia to the vacant seat for the Middle East and South Asia. 
82. Saudi Arabia was duly elected. 
83. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Malaysia to 
the vacant seat for South East Asia and the Pacific. 
84. Malaysia was duly elected. 
85. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect New 
Zealand to the floating seat for Africa/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from 
SEAP to fill. 
86. New Zealand was duly elected. 
REQUESTS FOR THE RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS 
(GC(46)/INF/7 and 10) 

87. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that Mali 
be permitted to vote during the current session of the Conference because it was of the view 
that MaliÂs failure to pay the amount necessary to avoid the application of Article XIX.A of 
the Statute was due to conditions beyond its control. However, it had recommended that 
Georgia not be permitted to vote during the current session because it was of the view that its 
failure to pay the amount necessary to avoid the application of Article XIX.A of the Statute 
was not due to conditions beyond its control. 
88. He took it that the Conference accepted the recommendations of the General 
Committee. 
89. It was so decided. 
90. Mr. AYOUB (Iraq) said that for many years his country had been suffering from 
very difficult conditions which had prevented it from paying its contributions on time. It had 
made a number of requests to the General Conference for restoration of its voting rights, the 
latest of which was contained in document GC(46)/INF/3. That request was justified owing 
to the pressure which was being exerted on Iraq by the United States of America and the 
United Kingdom. However, by comparison with similar cases, his countryÂs request had been 
afforded unusual and unorthodox treatment. Finally, he drew attention to document 
GC(46)/INF/11, the Attachment to which contained a request by Iraq to be allowed to pay its 
contributions in its national currency. 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 19 

91. Mr. RAUTENBACH (Director, Office of Legal Affairs) said that, in a letter dated 
17 September 2002, following the General ConferenceÂs decision on 16 September not to 
restore IraqÂs voting rights, the Iraqi Permanent Mission had requested that Iraq be allowed to 
pay its financial obligations towards the Agency in Iraqi dinars, especially in view of the fact 
that the Agency could use those amounts to cover the costs arising from the resumption of its 
regular activities in Iraq in accordance with the safeguards regime in force since 1999. The 
letter asked that the request be submitted to the General Conference for discussion during the 
current session so that a positive decision could be made thereon. 
92. The General Conference had no power to take such a decision for the following reasons. 
Although various types of financial rules were mentioned in the Statute as requiring General 
Conference approval (e.g. in Articles V.E.8, XIV.G and XIV.F), there was no mention of any 
general function regarding financial regulations. Since such regulations were plainly 
necessary, it followed that, to the extent that that particular function had not been assigned 
specifically to the General Conference, the Board had the power to adopt such regulations 
pursuant to Article VI.F or Article VII.B of the Statute. Under either interpretation, the 
General Conference had no authority in that area. 
93. Of the Financial Regulations adopted by the Board, Regulations 5.02, 5.06 and 13.02 
were relevant to the request made by Iraq. Regulation 5.02 stated that each assessment should 
be established with a component in United States dollars and a component in euros, and that 
those components should be in direct proportion to the respective shares of the Regular 
Budget expenditures linked to the two currencies as approved by the General Conference. 
Regulation 5.06 stated that assessed contributions should be paid in United States dollars and 
euros in the ratio determined pursuant to Regulation 5.02. Regulation 13.02 stated that the 
Board could amend the Regulations or suspend any of the Regulations, subject to the 
provisions of the Statute. From the foregoing it was evident that only the Board had the 
power to amend or suspend the relevant Financial Regulations so as to permit a Member State 
to pay its assessed contributions in local currency. 
94. A number of practical considerations also arose in relation to IraqÂs request. As was 
mentioned in paragraph 13 of Attachment 2 to document GC(46)/INF/6, an arrangement 
already existed for payment of contributions to the Agency in local currency through the 
offices of the United Nations Development Programme, credit being given to the Agency 
when payment had been received in accordance with the Agency's Financial Regulations. 
Furthermore, Financial Rule 105.02 provided that, if a Member State was experiencing 
difficulties in paying its assessed contributions in the ratio or the currencies required pursuant 
to Regulations 5.02 and 5.06, or its advances to the Working Capital Fund in the currency 
required pursuant to Regulation 5.03, the Director of Budget and Finance of the Agency 
should assist the Member State concerned in meeting its obligations for payment in the 
currencies required, any currency exchange costs being borne by the Member State 
concerned. Whether those two possibilities could apply to Iraq depended on whether they 
were prohibited by relevant Security Council resolutions, a question to be decided by the 
Sanctions Committee. If Iraq approached the Agency in connection with either of those 
possibilities, the Agency would take up the matter with the Sanctions Committee.

ORAL REPORT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

95. Mr. MOLTENI (Argentina), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented 
the outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on items 9, 10, 11 and 12. The Committee had 
recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution on the four items in question. 
One delegation had expressed reservations regarding draft resolution A in the Annex to 
document GC(46)7 and draft resolution B in document GC(46)/7/Mod.1, without blocking the 
consensus. 
96. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to take up the items considered by the 
Committee of the Whole. 
The AgencyÂs Accounts for 2001 (agenda item 9) 

97. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page I of 
document GC(46)/6 was adopted. 
The Agency Budget Update for 2003 (agenda item 10) 

The financing of technical co-operation (agenda item 11) 

98. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, draft resolutions A and C in the 
Annex to document GC(46)/7 and draft resolution B in document GC(46)/7/Mod.1 were 
adopted. 
Scale of assessment of MembersÂ contributions towards the Regular Budget (agenda 
item 12) 

99. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution on page 2 of 
document GC(46)/10 was adopted. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (resumed) 
(GC(46)/2) 

100. Mr. NYUNT MAUNG SHEIN (Myanmar) commended the AgencyÂs role in 
building a global nuclear safety culture and its achievements in the areas of nuclear 
non-proliferation, nuclear safeguards, radiation and waste safety, and promotion of nuclear 
science, technology and applications. However, Agency safeguards and verification measures 
should be applied in a non-discriminatory manner and in conformity with the NPT. 
101. The Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, which Myanmar had 
signed in December 1995, had entered into force in 1997. Nuclear-weapon-free zones were 
effective means of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and promoted nuclear 
disarmament. 
102. The AgencyÂs technical co-operation activities played an important role in promoting 
sustainable development in many countries, since nuclear techniques were environmentally 
friendly and nuclear power generation did not cause environmental pollution. The use of 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 21 

nuclear techniques had contributed to his countryÂs development efforts in such areas as food, 
agriculture and health. It had been able to apply radiotherapy and nuclear diagnostic 
techniques, and nuclear techniques for medical research, with Agency assistance in the form 
of equipment, services and training. Technical co-operation projects were also contributing to 
national human resources development, and increased use was being of radioisotopes in 
industry. 

103. Having embarked on a programme of promoting and developing nuclear applications, 
Myanmar was aware of the need for an adequate radiation protection and waste safety 
infrastructure. It had nearly finalized its regulations on the safe use of radiation and atomic 
energy. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it had provided in those areas. 
104. Several countries were at a stage of nuclear technology development comparable to that 
of Myanmar and they deserved the AgencyÂs assistance. He therefore urged that, in preparing 
the technical co-operation programme, priority should be given to projects which benefited 
less developed Member States. He also paid tribute to the AgencyÂs mediating role in 
regional co-operation efforts promoting nuclear science and technology. 
105. Mr. MÃRQUEZ MARIN (Venezuela) noted that, at the most recent series of 
meetings of the Board of Governors, the Director General had said that a balance between the 
AgencyÂs various activities did not necessarily entail identical expenditure but rather full 
attention to each area. Nevertheless, in assigning priorities the interests and needs of all 
Member States should be taken into account. Venezuela recognized the need to strengthen 
the AgencyÂs efforts aimed at preventing terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities or terrorist use 
of nuclear material, and it stood ready to assist those efforts. However, as technical 
co-operation and assistance were so important to developing countries, activities to protect 
against nuclear terrorism should not be allowed to detract from programmes promoting 
sustainable socio-economic development. 
106. Some countries had been pressing for increases in the safeguards budget over the 
preceding year and urging that the hitherto voluntary contributions for anti-terrorist activities 
should become obligatory. However, the real capacity of countries to pay had to be taken into 
account. With the removal of the shielding system, the contributions of the developing 
countries would increase steadily over the coming 15 years. A larger safeguards and 
anti-terrorist component in the budget in addition to that would make contributions unpayable 
for many countries. Thus there was a risk that the Agency could become a select club where 
only a few members had voting rights. It would be hard to convince the governments of 
developing countries that they should dedicate precious resources to the inspection of nuclear 
facilities which most of them did not even possess, or to the prevention of nuclear terrorism 
instead of to education and health. 
107. Venezuela had made an effort to integrate Agency technical co-operation programmes 
into its development plans. Its main aim was to improve the quality of life and 
socio-economic conditions of its population. It had managed to involve large-scale 
development corporations in those activities, removing them from the purely academic 
sphere, with a view to producing concrete results. For instance, the National Petroleum 
Company of Venezuela had been playing an active part in the application of nuclear 

GC(46)/OR.7 
page 22 

techniques in the hydrocarbon industry, and the Venezuelan Guyana Corporation had been 
participating in a project on optimization of the production process in the aluminium industry. 
The latter company had also shown an interest in technical co-operation projects in the areas 
of environmental protection, dam safety techniques, techniques for improving mining, 
extraction, and processing activities, and control of sedimentation in the Apure, CaronÃ­ and 
Orinoco rivers. 

108. Other areas the country was working on were sustainable animal production and 
construction of a secure store for spent used radioactive material. There was also an urgent 
need for investment in equipment and staff in the health sector and for efficient and effective 
control of radiation instruments used in medicine. Furthermore, it was hoped that a seminar 
to disseminate information on non-power applications of nuclear energy could be organized 
early in 2003. 
109. The Agency could also provide valuable assistance with the development of a logical 
and coherent national programme in the nuclear area and the setting up of a single national 
authority for monitoring the security of radiation sources. 
110. Finally, he welcomed Iraq's decision to accept unconditionally safeguards inspections, 
which should pave the way towards a peaceful solution and the removal of the sanctions 
imposed by the United Nations Security Council. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

EXAMINATION OF DELEGATESÂ CREDENTIALS 

1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met earlier in the day to 
examine the credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. 
The report of the Committee was contained in document GC(46)/25. After discussion, the 
Committee had recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 8 of its report, with the reservations and position expressed in the 
report. Since the Committee had met, he had been informed that credentials in proper form 
had been received from 95 Member States, and documents which did not constitute formal 
credentials from 24 Member States. 
2. Mr. SIRRY (Egypt) said that the acceptance by his country of the credentials 
submitted by IsraelÂs delegate should not be interpreted to mean that in his countryÂs view 
Israel included any of the lands occupied by it since 1967, especially Jerusalem and the 
Golan. In his countryÂs view, Israel as a State meant the one with the borders as at 
4 June 1967 and as defined in the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. 
3. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) said that, although his country had not signed the statement 
of reservations regarding the credentials of IsraelÂs delegate made by Arab delegations and 
contained in document GC(46)/23, and in spite of its acceptance of the draft resolution 
contained in document GC(46)/25, its position of principle was that IsraelÂs annexation of 
occupied Jerusalem was illegal and in violation of all relevant Security Council resolutions. 
Jordan abided by General Assembly resolution 169/35 of 1980, in which the General 
Assembly had stated that all administrative and legal measures ensuing from the occupation 
of Jerusalem were null and void and illegal and had called upon all States, specialized 
agencies and international organizations to reject any measures that were in conflict with that 
resolution. 
4. Mr. LAASSEL (Morocco) said that acceptance of the credentials of IsraelÂs 
delegate, issued in Jerusalem, did not prejudge the status, under international law, of 
Jerusalem, as stated in the relevant Security Council resolutions. Morocco, as Chairman of 
the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, wished to reaffirm 
on behalf of that body that the establishment by Israel of its capital in Jerusalem was in 
flagrant violation of international law and of resolution 248 and subsequent relevant 
resolutions of the Security Council. 
5. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the General Conference was prepared to 
adopt the draft resolution contained in paragraph 8 of document GC(46)/25. 
6. It was so decided. 
GENERAL DEBATE AND ANNUAL REPORT FOR 2001 (resumed) 
(GC(46)/2) 

7. Mr. BIN RIMDAP (Nigeria) said that the Agency was continuing to play a crucial 
role as a catalyst of the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes such as socioeconomic 
development. His country was especially interested in applications of nuclear 

GC(46)/OR.8 
page 4 

techniques and radioisotopes in increasing food production, fighting diseases, managing water 
resources and protecting the environment, and it hoped that the Agency would continue to 
help Member States exploit the opportunities which nuclear technology offered. 

8. Insect pests such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies were having a devastating effect on 
humans and livestock in Africa, thus constituting a major obstacle to poverty alleviation. His 
country therefore greatly appreciated the efforts being made by the Secretariat in support of 
initiatives such as PATTEC. It also greatly appreciated the extrabudgetary contributions 
which had been made by a number of Member States and the support being provided by FAO 
and WHO. 
9. Remarkable success had been achieved in the application of the SIT against tsetse flies, 
and his country would like to see the SIT used also in the eradication of mosquitoes. In that 
connection, it was pleased that research into the use of the SIT to combat malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes had begun. 
10. In his country, work on the construction of a multi-purpose industrial gamma irradiation 
facility had just been completed. The facility - the largest of its kind in Africa - would have a 
source with an activity of 3 x 105 Ci (upgradeable to 106 Ci). It was expected that the facility 
would be commissioned in 2003. His Government hoped that the Agency would make use of 
the facility for PATTEC and later for mosquito eradication efforts, thereby benefiting the 
entire region and promoting TCDC. 
11. A project for the installation and operation of a miniature neutron source reactor at an 
energy research and training centre in Nigeria, launched in 1995 on the basis of an agreement 
between the Agency, the China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation and Nigeria 
(represented by the Energy Commission of Nigeria), had proved to be a very successful longterm 
project. 
12. In 1995, his Government had promulgated a nuclear safety and radiation protection 
decree laying the legal foundation for a nuclear regulatory authority. Today, the Nigerian 
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA) was an effective regulatory body independent of all 
promotors of nuclear energy applications. In August, an Agency team had assessed the 
NNRAÂs capabilities and procedures, and the team members had had an opportunity of 
exchanging views with top-level Nigerian policy-makers, who had assured them of the 
commitment of the Government to effective and independent regulation in the nuclear field. 
13. Following that assessment team mission, his Government was confident that the 
Agency would approve the shipment of the fuel for the aforementioned miniature neutron 
source reactor without further delay, and it hoped that the Director General would be able to 
take part in the reactor commissioning ceremony. 
14. Nigeria was deriving considerable benefit from its participation in the Model Project for 
upgrading radiation protection infrastructure in Africa. The NNRA had already achieved the 
first and second project milestones, and it was hoped that the other three milestones would be 
achieved within the next two years. 

GC(46)/OR.8 
page 5 

15. Nigeria continued to attach great importance to AFRA as a mechanism for regional 
co-operation in Africa. However, there was now a further such mechanism, the New 
Partnership for AfricaÂs Development (NEPAD), and his country hoped that the Agency 
would support it. Accordingly, it would in due course submit to the Secretariat a document 
on NEPAD vis-Ã -vis AFRA projects. 
16. His country attached great importance to the technical co-operation activities of the 
Agency, regarding them as major statutory activities. Similarly, it attached great importance 
to nuclear technology transfer for peaceful purposes, regarding it as a fundamental aspect of 
the implementation of the NPT. 
17. His country considered the NPT to be the cornerstone of the global nuclear 
non-proliferation regime, of which the AgencyÂs safeguards system was an essential part. 
Favouring universal adherence to the Model Additional Protocol, it had signed a protocol 
additional to its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency in September 2001. It was 
confident that, with the co-operation of Member States, the Agency would continue to 
maintain public confidence in the safeguards system as a means of helping to ensure global 
peace and security. 
18. After long discussions among Member States, the Board of Governors had reached a 
consensus on a figure of US $74.75 million for the TCF target for 2003. That figure 
represented a numerical increase over the 2002 TCF target, but not a real increase - and the 
needs of developing Member States were still increasing. Nigeria, which intended to pay its 
full share of the TCF target for 2003, hoped that many other Member States would follow 
suit. 
19. In conclusion, he expressed appreciation of the efforts of Mr. Qian in guiding the 
Department of Technical Co-operation. 
20. Mr. BEKHBAT (Mongolia) said that, following the tragic events of 
11 September 2001, his country, which was committed to the elimination of all forms of 
terrorism, attached particular importance to the AgencyÂs activities in the area of nuclear 
security. It appreciated the AgencyÂs continued efforts to strengthen the effectiveness and 
improve the efficiency of the safeguards system, which was an important means of promoting 
nuclear non-proliferation and ensuring the physical protection of nuclear material. It was very 
much in favour of complementing safeguards agreements by additional protocols, and it 
welcomed the completion of the development of a conceptual framework for integrated 
safeguards. 
21. Mongolia had signed a protocol additional to its NPT safeguards agreement with the 
Agency in December 2001, and the constitutional procedures necessary for ratification were 
well under way. 
22. Mongolia considered it important that the efforts being made to achieve universality 
with regard to the conclusion of safeguards agreements and additional protocols continue. 
Also, it was in favour of broadening the scope of the Convention on the Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material. 

GC(46)/OR.8 
page 6 

23. Technical co-operation between Mongolia and the Agency was proceeding well, and the 
projects being implemented in Mongolia - and relating to agriculture, animal husbandry, 
human health, geology, mining and the environment - were helping to promote the countryÂs 
socio-economic development. 
24. The Model Project for upgrading radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure 
was producing good results in Mongolia. Through it, his country had made good progress in 
establishing a legal framework for radiation protection, in strengthening its nuclear regulatory 
authority and in training its radiation protection specialists. 
25. Mongolia, which welcomed the SecretariatÂs activities aimed at forging closer 
partnerships with other organizations and with donor countries, hoped that those activities 
would result in the mobilization of additional funds for Agency programmes. 
26. Mr. FABER (Luxembourg) said that in his delegationÂs view it was essential that 
the group of legal and technical experts convened by the Director General in order to draft an 
amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material complete its 
task soon, so that an amendment conference might be held at the beginning of 2003. His 
delegation would like to see in the draft amendment a provision requiring each State party to 
the Convention to inform every other State of any act of nuclear terrorism which it had reason 
to believe was imminent. 
27. The implementation of protocols additional to safeguards agreements would greatly 
increase the AgencyÂs ability to verify whether States were fulfilling their nuclear 
non-proliferation obligations. His delegation would therefore like to see all Member States 
concluding additional protocols and putting them into force with a minimum of delay. In that 
connection, it believed that the Secretariat and Japan were to be commended for their efforts 
to promote the Model Additional Protocol. 
28. In 1998, following constructive discussions in the course of the General ConferenceÂs 
forty-second regular session, Luxembourg had decided to pay its full TCF target share, and it 
had been paying its full TCF target share ever since. That demonstrated his countryÂs 
awareness of the importance of Agency technical co-operation within the context of nuclear 
non-proliferation efforts. It also demonstrated his countryÂs recognition of the high quality of 
the technical assistance being provided in important areas such as safety, health, agriculture 
and water resources management. His delegation hoped that a continuation of the 
SecretariatÂs sectoral approach in the technical co-operation field would further increase the 
donor base. 
The meeting rose at 3.50 p.m.

REPORT OF THE SCIENTIFIC FORUM 

1. The PRESIDENT invited the Rapporteur, Mr. Ridwan, to present the report of the 
Scientific Forum. 
2. Mr. Ridwan presented the report which is reproduced in the Annex. 
3. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Ridwan for his most interesting report and the 
Secretariat for their excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum. 
The meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and resumed at 12.20 p.m. 

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NPT SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE 
AGENCY AND THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLEÂS REPUBLIC OF KOREA 
(GC(46)/16, GC(46)/L.2 and Add.1 and 2) 

4. Ms. HALL (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(46)/L.2, said that for some ten years the DPRK had not permitted the Agency to 
implement its NPT comprehensive safeguards agreement. The resolution registered deep 
concern over the DPRKÂs non-compliance with that agreement and urged it to comply 
forthwith, notably by allowing the Agency to verify the correctness and completeness of its 
initial declaration. Adoption of the resolution without a vote would send an important signal 
with respect to the international communityÂs resolve to see the DPRK comply with its 
safeguards agreement. Her country had therefore drafted the resolution in consultation with 
other concerned countries, and had taken their views into account in order to attract consensus 
support. The resolution had been widely sponsored by countries from all regional groups, 
reflecting the global nature of the concern over the issue. 
5. Mr. Young-jin CHOI (Republic of Korea) said that for several years the General 
Conference had adopted with overwhelming support a resolution expressing its continuing 
concern over the DPRKÂs non-compliance with its safeguards agreement with the Agency, 
and urging that country to comply fully at an early date. Despite strenuous efforts over the 
preceding year, no tangible progress had been made, and the Agency remained unable to 
verify the DPRKÂs compliance. The DPRKÂs refusal to implement its legal obligations 
constituted a major challenge not simply to the AgencyÂs safeguards system, but to the basic 
framework of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. He strongly urged the DPRK to 
implement its safeguards agreement and to respond positively and promptly to the AgencyÂs 
proposals for the verification of the correctness and completeness of initial declaration. The 
Agreed Framework had served as an important mechanism for addressing that issue and the 
KEDO LWR project was progressing well. Early implementation of the safeguards 
agreement was a prerequisite for the timely delivery of key nuclear components for that 
project and it was therefore essential that the Agency begin its inspection activities without 
further delay. The draft resolution sent a clear message and his country would like to see it 
adopted without a vote. 
6. Mr. ZHANG Yan (China) said that the problem should be solved through 
co-operation and consultation between the parties concerned and strict implementation of the 

GC(46)/OR.9 
page 4 

Agreed Framework, and no steps should be taken which would further to complicate the 
situation. There had recently been a number of positive developments in the region indicating 
that all parties were committed to maintaining peace and stability, and the international 
community should welcome those developments. The Agency should continue to play a 
constructive role. Early completion of the KEDO project would also contribute to the 
solution of the issue. 

7. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(46)/L.2. 
8. It was so decided. 
9. Mr. TAKASU (Japan) stressed that the AgencyÂs safeguards agreement with the 
DPRK remained in force and binding. Japan continued to be concerned that the Agency had 
been unable to verify the correctness and completeness of the initial declaration made by the 
DPRK and that it was thus unable to of provide credible assurance that undeclared activities 
had not been carried out. 
10. Under the terms of the Agreed Framework, the provision of key nuclear components for 
the KEDO LWR project was contingent upon the DPRKÂs full compliance with its safeguards 
agreement. The matter was therefore extremely urgent. If those key components were to be 
delivered in a timely manner, the DPRK would need to take prompt action, and he expressed 
the hope that the Agency would promote co-operation with a view to achieving that end. 
Japan had a strong interest in the success of the KEDO project which benefited peace and 
stability in East Asia. He called on the DPRK to meet the expectations of the international 
community and to take steps to normalize its relations with the Agency, with a view to 
rejoining it in due course. 
11. In the recent Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, the DPRK had declared its 
willingness to comply with all relevant international agreements, including the NPT, its 
safeguards agreement and the Agreed Framework. In the light of that declaration, he urged 
the Agency to hold technical consultations to address verification issues as soon as possible in 
order to facilitate the DPRKÂs full implementation of its safeguards agreement. 
12. Mr. BERDENNIKOV (Russian Federation) said that the DPRK, as a State party 
to the NPT and an IAEA safeguards agreement, had to comply fully with its international 
obligations. That position was reflected in the draft resolution that had just been adopted. 
However, implementation of the safeguards agreement would not be enough in itself to ensure 
non-proliferation in the DPRK. That would require full implementation of the Agreed 
Framework which laid down a timetable for inspections in connection with work on the 
KEDO LWR project. He welcomed the continued constructive dialogue in the region and 
hoped it would have a positive effect on relations between DPRK and the Agency. 
13. Mr. ZHANG Yan (China) said his Government had always held that the Korean 
Peninsula should be free from nuclear weapons. The parties concerned should, on the basis of 
equality and mutual respect, strictly implement the relevant agreements. Dialogue and 

GC(46)/OR.9 
page 5 

consultation, rather than pressure and confrontation, should be employed in seeking a solution 
to any possible differences. 

APPLICATION OF IAEA SAFEGUARDS IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(GC(46)/9, Corr.1, Add.1 and Add.2; GC(46)/L.1, Rev.1 and Add.1) 

14. Mr. SERRY (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(46)/L.1/Rev.1, said that it aimed at reinforcing peace and stability in the Middle East and 
promoting the application of Agency safeguards throughout the region. In 1981 the United 
Nations Security Council had adopted resolution 487 which urged Israel to submit its nuclear 
facilities to Agency safeguards. The objective of creating in the Middle East a region free of 
all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, could not be achieved if Israeli 
facilities were not also subject to safeguards. In continuing to disregard the concerns of Egypt 
and other countries, Israel was failing to contribute towards the common goal of establishing 
peace and security in the Middle East. Moreover, at a time when the threat of nuclear 
terrorism was prompting increasing concern, IsraelÂs refusal to submit its facilities to 
safeguards made it a potentially hazardous source of nuclear material for wrongdoers. Israel 
had repeatedly prevented the adoption of the positive measures contained in the draft 
resolution and Egypt invited the international community, and in particular the General 
Conference, to adopt practical measures to urge Israel to accept the draft resolution, which it 
hoped would be adopted by consensus. 
15. Mr. IBRAHIM (Iraq) said that the international community was aware of the 
significance of applying the Agency safeguards throughout the Middle East. However, efforts 
in that direction were blocked by IsraelÂs refusal to accept safeguards, the only country in the 
region to adopt such a position. Equally, Israel refused to accept other measures, notably 
Security Council resolution 487, and the governments of the United States of America and the 
United Kingdom continued to apply double standards when it came to the implementation of 
Security Council resolutions. Iraq called on the international community to fulfil its 
responsibilities with respect to the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle 
East and urged it to exert sufficient pressure on Israel for that country to adhere to the NPT 
and submit all its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards, declare its nuclear arsenal for 
dismantling under Agency monitoring and abandon the nuclear option once and for all. 
16. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that all countries in the Middle East should accept 
Agency safeguards without exception. The draft resolution was of the utmost importance, and 
his delegation hoped that it would be adopted by consensus. 
17. Mr. SALEHI (Islamic Republic of Iran) said that his country had first called for 
the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974; Israel alone had 
remained unco-operative, consistently shrugging off the call of the international community 
for safety and peace, turning its back on world public opinion and refusing even to allow the 
Agency to inspect its nuclear installations. Such an arrogant attitude could have 
unforeseeable consequences in the region. Adherence to the NPT by all States of the region 
was an essential preliminary step towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East. 

GC(46)/OR.9 
page 6 

18. The PRESIDENT said he took it that the General Conference wished to adopt the 
draft resolution contained in document GC(46)/L.1/Rev.1. 
19. It was so decided. 
20. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that many paragraphs of the 
resolution did not truly reflect the current situation. It referred to talks in the Middle East, but 
Israel was against such talks and even in favour of war. It referred to the multilateral working 
group on Arms Control and Regional Security, which had not met since 1994. It made no 
specific reference to Israel, and did not invite Israel to implement the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system. It was unfortunate that, in spite of all those shortcomings, the resolution had been 
adopted. However, his delegation had accepted the text as it was because it did not wish to 
block consensus. 
21. Mr. TOUQ (Jordan) said that his Government had a vital interest in the 
establishment of a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, 
in the Middle East. Israel was the only country in the region which had not submitted its 
nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards or to any form of international control or inspection, 
and the resolution did not pursue the common goal of freeing the Middle East of the threat of 
nuclear weapons and of establishing lasting peace in the region. Jordan, as one of IsraelÂs 
closest neighbours, was one of the countries most at risk from its nuclear activities and he 
called on the Director General, and those countries that were able to do, so to exert the 
greatest possible pressure on Israel to persuade it to accede to the AgencyÂs safeguards system 
and submit its nuclear installations to international monitoring. Jordan had supported the 
resolution because it did not wish to block consensus. 
22. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his country had joined the consensus on the 
resolution, in spite of its inherent deficiencies, because it recognized that a nuclear-weaponfree 
zone could eventually serve as an important complement to overall peace, security and 
arms control in the Middle East. The resolution contained elements which ran counter to 
IsraelÂs policies, and his countryÂs decision not to block consensus should not be interpreted 
as an indication of its agreement with all the resolutionÂs provisions. Israel had always 
maintained that nuclear and other regional security issues should and could only be dealt with 
in the context of the peace process. Moreover, a regional nuclear-weapon-free zone had to be 
supported by all States in the region and could not be imposed upon regional parties. It was a 
basic premise of any regional security and arms control process that the security margins of 
any participating State should be appropriate to its perception of threat and should not be 
diminished through the process. Any progress involving a decrease in security margins had to 
be based on mutual steps to maintain security. The participation of all States in the region in 
such a process was an essential prerequisite, for the simple reason that reciprocal relationships 
had to prevail for all regional parties. 
23. The sombre experience of Iraq should remind the General Conference of the stark 
realities in the Middle East. Given such political realities, a practical, step-by-step approach 
was the only way forward, beginning with confidence- and security-building measures 
carefully selected so as not to detract from the security margin of any State in the region, 
continuing with the establishment of peaceful relations and reconciliation between peoples,

and dealing in due course with conventional and non-conventional arms control as a 
complement to the process. Such an approach had been successfully adopted in Europe, 
beginning with the policy of peaceful co-existence in the late 1960s and passing through the 
Helsinki process to arms control and disarmament measures. The way to build security was 
to aim high, but to start modestly and move ahead carefully. Recent statements by IsraelÂs 
neighbours were not only discordant with the responsibilities and mission of the Agency; they 
also undermined confidence-building and might make the road ahead even more tortuous. He 
looked forward to a better future of reconciliation, security and peace in the Middle East. 

ISRAELI NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES AND THREAT 
(GC(46)/1/Add.1) 

24. The PRESIDENT said that, pursuant to consultations, it had been agreed that he 
would read out the following statement, for endorsement by the General Conference, which 
was the result of a delicate compromise: 
ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement by the President of the 36th session in 
1992 concerning the agenda item ÂIsraeli Nuclear Capabilities and ThreatÂ. That 
statement considered it desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 37th session. 
The General Conference also recalls the statement by the President of the 43rd session 
in 1999 concerning the same agenda item. At the 44th, 45th and 46th sessions, this 
item was, at the request of certain Member States, re-inscribed on the agenda. The 
item was discussed. The President notes that certain Member States intend to include 
this item on the provisional agenda of the 47th regular session of the General 
Conference.Â 

25. Mr. YOUSSEF (Egypt) said that there was an urgent need for progress in the 
areas of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament in the Middle East owing to the threat to 
peace and stability in the region. Egypt had launched an initiative aimed at setting up a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East in 1974 and had repeatedly called for Agency 
comprehensive safeguards to be applied to all nuclear facilities in the region. Without 
exception, the Arab states had acceded to the NPT and had submitted all their nuclear 
facilities to Agency safeguards. Israel was the only State in the region which had not acceded 
to the NPT and had refused to submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. The final 
document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference had underlined the importance of IsraelÂs 
accession to the NPT and its acceptance of safeguards. Sadly, the international community 
had proved unable to apply its resolutions because one State did not respect them and 
paralysed the efforts of others to make progress. The existence beyond EgyptÂs northern 
border of a nuclear programme that was not subject to Agency safeguards created a dangerous 
situation in the region, which would continue until there was the international will to end it. 
Meanwhile, doubts would be created as to the effectiveness of the safeguards system and 
genuine non-proliferation efforts. The international community should face up to its 
responsibility to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. The fact that the item 
had been on the agenda of the General Conference for so many years demonstrated its 
continuing importance and its direct link with the AgencyÂs work and objectives as set out in 
Article II of the Statute.

26. The PRESIDENT asked whether the Conference was prepared to endorse the 
statement he had read out. 
27. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 
28. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the request that Israel accede to 
the NPT and submit all its nuclear facilities to the Agency safeguards was fully in accordance 
with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. The international community had 
not brought the same pressure to bear upon Israel to implement relevant Security Council 
resolutions as it had done upon other States in the region. It was a matter of vital importance 
that Israel be required to abandon the nuclear option and thus enable a nuclear-weapon-free 
zone to be established in the Middle East. If the international community wanted stability in 
the Middle East, it would have to eliminate the imbalance of forces in the region resulting 
from IsraelÂs possession of nuclear weapons. He expressed the hope that the topic would 
receive the attention it deserved at the 47th regular session of the General Conference. 
The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.

Report to the forty-sixth regular session of the IAEA General Conference 
from the fifth Scientific Forum 

1. The 5th Scientific Forum, organized during the 46th regular session of the IAEA 
General Conference, took place in the Austria Center, Vienna, on 17-18 September 2002, and 
focused on three topical issues: Nuclear Power -Life Cycle Management; Managing Nuclear 
Knowledge; and Nuclear Security. Each of the three sessions consisted of presentations by 
leading experts in the field, followed by panellistsÂ comments and then discussions with 
participants. Also each session was moderated by a leading expert in the respective field. 
2. The discussion on Nuclear Power - Life Cycle Management was devoted to two subtopics, 
namely Life Extension of Nuclear Power Plants and Decommissioning. The nuclear 
industry is, at present, at a crucial juncture, where it has to decide about the future of the first 
generation of nuclear plants, which are approaching the end of their licensed service life. At 
the same time, long term experience and new advances have established that it is possible to 
extend the life of nuclear plants beyond their initially licensed life by another 20-30 years. 
While some utilities and regulatory bodies have already gone ahead with license renewal or 
extension, many others are still exploring various possibilities concerning these processes. 
3. The session addressed key issues, concerns and trends in the life cycle management of 
nuclear power plants Â from construction to operation and then to decommissioning. 
Measures to cope with ageing plants, licence renewal, expected growth in electricity demands 
and the need to find sustainable long term solutions for closed or ageing nuclear facilities 
were presented, including examples of experience from FORATOM, Japan, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, the Russian Federation and Hungary. 
4. Life extension is considered to bridge the gap between ageing and new plants and 
between energy demand and supply. It is technically feasible, economically attractive and 
able to be regulated successfully. Nuclear power plants are capital intensive and therefore 
extension of their operating life will provide a very significant financial advantage besides 
avoiding new generation capacities. The cost of an NPP life extension, according to Russian 
experience, is around US $160Â200/kW installed capacity, while in the US the process costs 
10 Â 15 M US$ per unit, excluding any cost of additional hardware since plant upgrade is not 
part of the licence renewal process. 
5. Information from the European CommissionÂs Green Paper on the Security of Energy 
Supply and current policy development indicates that the potential growth of the European 
Union together with the reduction of nuclear energy as plants reach the end of their life would 
lead to an increase in CO2 emissions by 31% and a dependency for the enlarged Union on 
imported energy of 60%. In the United States, ten licences have been renewed to permit a 
60 year operational life; nearly half of the existing plants have submitted licence renewal 
applications and many more were expected to do so.

6. For decommissioning, it is not efficient or reasonable for each country to develop its 
own technologies and approaches. The costs of decommissioning are high and may place a 
heavy burden on national budgets. The most cost effective approach includes the use of 
proven practices rather than each organization developing new techniques. Decommissioning 
should be a key consideration in the design of new facilities, which would save much time 
and effort and reduce the risks of exposure during decommissioning. 
7. It is essential to recruit and maintain a strong and highly skilled workforce to ensure 
secure, safe and economic future licence renewal and plant decommissioning operations. The 
motivation of this workforce should be a major concern of the facility management. This 
should ensure that the operational culture of the plant is maintained at a high level as the plant 
is seen to be reaching the end of its economic life, and plant activities involve restoring the 
environment rather than creating energy. 
8. The IAEA could act as a catalyst to enable the dissemination of experience in licence 
renewal and decommissioning activities to all Member States. In addition, the IAEA should 
identify proven practices in licence renewal and procedures that have been demonstrated, to 
achieve efficient review of applications. The IAEA should produce guidance on the scope of 
safety and environmental reports in support of licence renewal and on standards and proven 
practice required to achieve safe and economic operations during decommissioning. The 
issues arising from this session require further consideration. It is proposed that these issues 
are presented to SAGNE (Standing Advisory Group on Nuclear Energy), TWG (Technical 
Working Group) on Plant Life Management and the proposed TGDE (Technical Group on 
Decommissioning) so that advice can be sought and given on future actions to be taken. 
9. The second session of the Forum focused on Managing Nuclear Knowledge and served 
to re-enforce the view that nuclear knowledge is a timely subject of strategic importance. It is 
an issue that concerns all Member States that use nuclear technologies for either power or 
non-power applications. It needs to be addressed to ensure the continued safe use of these 
technologies. 
10. Throughout the discussions, participants, keynote speakers and panellists strongly 
endorsed the key findings from the meeting of senior officials on Managing Nuclear 
Knowledge held in June 2002, in particular with regard to: 
Ã± 
the urgency of the problem, 

Ã± 
the clear understanding that all nuclear technology and its innovation relies on 
nuclear knowledge, and 

Ã± 
the importance of addressing succession planning and preserving knowledge. 

11. It was the consensus view that preserving and enhancing nuclear knowledge is a topic 
on which the Agency is well suited to take a leading role, particularly in terms of promoting 
Member StatesÂ increased awareness of the issues involved, and in facilitating international 

GC(46)/OR.9 
Annex 
page 3 

and regional collaboration. A proposal was made for the Agency to establish, as soon as 
possible, a working group to address these issues, including giving practical advice on both 
the programme and its implementation. Also, participants emphasized that this new activity 
needs to be equipped with sufficient resources and funding, and that extrabudgetary 
contributions by Member States as well as resources from the Regular Budget would be 
needed. 

12. The moderator of the session noted that a resolution on "Knowledge Management" 
would be submitted to the General Conference. The very large number of Member States 
co-sponsoring this resolution in the Committee of the Whole clearly shows the great 
importance Member States assign to that topic. 
13. Problems were identified and possible innovative solutions proposed, including long 
distance education, clusters and networks and a knowledge management portal. Now, it is 
time to take action and to give increased attention to knowledge management activities in the 
Agency, notably in terms of funding and resource allocation. 
14. In the session on Nuclear Security, the keynote speakers spoke on issues related to risk 
assessment, the control of radioactive sources and new approaches to protecting nuclear 
material and facilities. It was noted that security was not a new concern for the nuclear 
industry, which had long considered the threat of theft of [special] nuclear material and 
sabotage. Extensive measures had already been taken in the field of physical protection. 
Furthermore, nuclear power plants have the strongest defensive capabilities to be found in the 
commercial world: the result of inherent defensive capabilities arising from designs to 
withstand extreme events. Nonetheless, further measures are needed to improve security 
measures, to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and to refine the assessment of potential 
threats. 
15. Identifying and evaluating potential threats and the consequent assessment of risks have 
an added impetus since the events of last September. Preventative measures result from an 
assessment of the threat and risk. To these could be added precautionary measures, which 
address the consequences of an event without being able to fully assess the risk that it will 
occur. Security assessment is not like establishing a safety case, which could rely on 
redundancy and sound scientific knowledge, separation and diversification, and identification 
of common mode failures. 
16. It was noted that there was a distinction to be made between threats which should be 
addressed by the State (e.g. aircraft hijacking, or attacks involving significant military 
capabilities), and those which are facility related (e.g. a direct assault on a nuclear plant by a 
small group), which would be the subject of the Design Basis Threat and are the responsibility 
of the operator. The boundary between the two is not clear and must be clarified. 
17. The session also considered the competing interests of maintaining public access to 
information with the need to protect information. But confidentiality must also be maintained 
to avoid providing assistance to an attacker.

18. On the issue of radiological sources and their potential to be used in radiological 
dispersion devices (RDDs or Âdirty bombsÂ) the session considered the risks and 
consequences. The difficulties in Kazakhstan of identifying and controlling radioactive 
sources provided a case study in the problems of other States, which found themselves in a 
similar position. The issues are lack of effective controls, lack of detection equipment, 
imperfect application of established procedures, and lack of appropriate intergovernmental 
agreements. The solutions included enhanced accountancy and legislative frameworks for 
radiation sources, increased physical protection of sources, improved international 
co-operation on combating illicit trafficking and better response measures. The session 
recognized a need to establish Âcradle-to-graveÂ control of radiological sources and that the 
issue of orphan sources could be solved by ensuring that there was an appropriate ÂgraveÂ for 
sources which had outlived their usefulness. 
19. Ideas for enhancing physical protection measures on both a regional and a global scale 
were proposed. The former included establishing regional networks to exchange information 
and experience among States. The latter included establishing a list of priorities, which would 
include revising INFCIRC/225 and developing new security recommendations, along the 
same lines, for the protection of radiological sources. Such sources are covered by safety 
guidance but not security guidance covering physical protection. The session recognized the 
threat of terrorist use of RDDs and the priority of establishing security measures applicable to 
the radiological sources, which offered the greatest threat. The session also noted a proposal 
for an International Conference to discuss the threat posed by the potential misuse of 
radiological materials. Facilities in need of enhanced protection might also be prioritized; 
assistance may be available under the G8 initiative. Other ideas included creating a 
multilateral security co-operation system, which intended to facilitate the exchange of 
information, measures to improve co-operation among nuclear regulators, security forces and 
intelligence agencies, tagging and tracking the movement of radioactive sources and financial 
incentives for operators to improve physical protection measures at nuclear facilities. 
20. The 5th Scientific Forum addressed three key issues for the nuclear community. In 
order to ensure the security of nuclear materials, it is necessary to continue safe and economic 
nuclear operations with the retained knowledge for the future. Proposals have been made for 
several actions by the Agency and these are commended to you.
