19. Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East 
(GC(48)/18 and Add.1, GC(48)/L.1) 

1. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt), introducing the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.1, said 
that EgyptÂs repeated calls for the application of comprehensive safeguards in the Middle East 
reflected its commitment to the non-proliferation regime. The non-submission of nuclear facilities in 
the region to comprehensive Agency safeguards detracted from the credibility of the non-proliferation 
regime and made it difficult to promote mutual confidence between countries and peace and security. 
Moreover, any progress towards the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East 
would require the application of comprehensive safeguards. 
2. For the past 30 years, Egypt had sought to achieve a new security framework in the Middle East 
through the United Nations General Assembly, the Agency and the NPT Review Conference, as well 
as the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference. Unfortunately, no tangible progress had been made. The 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone was a prerequisite for a permanent security framework in 
the region. 
3. Egypt welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to hold a forum on experience relevant to the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. It hoped that all parties concerned 
would participate, in particular Israel. 
4. The draft resolution contained the same language as resolution GC(47)/RES/13 adopted 
in 2003. He expressed the hope that its adoption by consensus would engender a commitment to 
implement it and called upon all countries to take the necessary steps to facilitate the establishment of 
a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, urging Israel to adhere to the NPT and to place all of 
its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards. The international community, in 
particular those countries with a permanent seat in the Security Council, should honour their 
responsibilities and deal with all risks of nuclear-weapon proliferation in the same fashion, and the 
Director General and the Secretariat should make every effort to implement the letter and the spirit of 
the draft resolution. 
5. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) said that his country attached great importance to nuclear 
non-proliferation and the application of international safeguards in the Middle East. Israel was the 
only State in the region that had not acceded to the NPT and had not concluded a safeguards 
agreement or signed an additional protocol. That was an abnormal state of affairs and his country 
failed to see why the solution to that problem should be linked to a non-existent peace process. At the 
very least, negotiations were needed, a move which Israel had constantly rejected. The Arab region 
would continue to call for the application of safeguards in the Middle East until that demand was met. 
Accordingly, the item should be retained on the agenda until the matter was resolved. He expressed 
the hope that he would live to see that day. 
6. Mr. KODAH (Jordan) said that his country attached great importance to the application of 
safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East. Regrettably, despite his praiseworthy efforts and 
visits to countries in the region, the Director General had been unable to achieve any progress on that 
issue. 

GC(48)/OR.10 
17 September 2004, Page 2 

7. Israel should accede to the NPT, conclude a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an 
additional protocol, and refrain from taking any measures which would hinder the achievement of that 
goal. 
8. Jordan had repeatedly stressed the need to make the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction. The establishment of such a zone would greatly strengthen the international 
non-proliferation system and help promote peace, security and well-being in the region and the world. 
9. Mr. HOSSEINI (Islamic Republic of Iran), noting that the establishment of a nuclearweapon-
free zone in the Middle East had been on the agenda of the United Nations for 30 years, said 
that his country had always supported that goal, having launched the initiative in 1974. Unfortunately, 
Israel had hindered efforts to achieve that objective over the years. That countryÂs unsafeguarded 
nuclear facilities constituted a real threat to international peace and security. The international 
community should urge Israel to become a party to the NPT and place its unsafeguarded facilities 
under comprehensive Agency safeguards without delay. 
10. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference was ready to adopt the draft resolution contained 
in document GC(48)/L.1 without a vote. 
11. It was so decided. 
12. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that, as in the past, his delegation had joined the 
consensus on the resolution on the application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East although 
numerous questions remained about many of its paragraphs. It was not sufficient to refer, as did 
operative paragraph 4, to ongoing bilateral Middle East peace negotiations which, in fact, had been 
halted for a number of years since Israel had refused to resume negotiations. His country also had its 
reservations about the activities of the Multilateral Working Group on Arms Control and Regional 
Security which had been unable to improve security or build confidence in the Middle East. Equally, it 
could have blocked consensus by referring to IsraelÂs position, cited in paragraph 10 of the Director 
GeneralÂs report contained in document GC(48)/18, that it would not sign a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement or address regional security issues in isolation from the regional peace process. His country 
did not believe that the issue could only be considered as part of phase II of the Âroad mapÂ. The 
resolution just adopted did not even mention Israel explicitly. 
13. He called upon Israel to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency 
safeguards without conditions or delay. The confidence-building measures aimed at establishing a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone called for in operative paragraph 7 could not begin until Israel acceded to 
the NPT and placed its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards as a sign of its good intentions. 
Moreover, there could be no confidence-building as long as Israel continued to occupy the territories 
of some of the countries in the region. Israel committed daily acts of aggression against the Palestinian 
people, violating their human rights. Civilians were being killed and their land illegally taken from 
them on the pretext of fighting terrorism. The international community had to stop applying a double 
standard and address the legitimate concerns about the future of the Middle East and the threat posed 
by IsraelÂs military nuclear capability, its refusal to join the AgencyÂs safeguards system except under 
certain conditions and its utter contempt for all international decisions on the subject. 
14. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that his country had joined the consensus on the resolution because it 
recognized that a nuclear-weapon-free zone could eventually serve as an important complement to the 
overall efforts to achieve peace, security and arms control in the region. However, it had made no 
secret of its fundamental reservations about the language and current relevance of the resolution and 
had formally distanced itself from its modalities. 

GC(48)/OR.10

15. The basic premise of any regional security and arms control process was that the security 
margins of any participating State should not be diminished during the process and that the threat 
perception of all participating States should be adequately addressed. Two criteria had to be fulfilled: 
firstly, the participation of all States in the region in such a process was a prerequisite for meaningful 
progress because non-participants continued to pose an undiminished threat; secondly, steps involving 
security margins had to be mutually applied in a manner that did not hamper the security of any 
regional participant. Those two criteria were very difficult to fulfil in the Middle East given the open 
conflicts and stark realities still prevailing in the region. Like others, Israel had taken note that three 
States in the region were or had been in breach of their international commitments regarding their 
nuclear activities. 
16. Thus, only a practical, step-by-step approach to the nuclear-weapon-free zone issue would be 
effective. The process should begin with confidence- and security-building measures, carefully 
selected so as not to reduce the security margins of any State. After building trust, and establishing 
peace and reconciliation and good-neighbourly relations among all parties, the time would be ripe to 
move towards regional security and arms control arrangements covering missiles and conventional, 
chemical, biological and, ultimately, nuclear weapons. Israel hoped that process would culminate in 
the establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic 
missiles. Mutual verification arrangements and effective enforcement measures were indispensable to 
guarantee an acceptable level of confidence that the commitments States had undertaken were not 
breached. 
17. The applicability of that gradual approach was borne out by the vast experience gained in 
similar processes in other regions. The way to build security was to aim high but start modestly and 
move ahead carefully. 
18. The statements that had just been made by some of IsraelÂs neighbours were not only at variance 
with the AgencyÂs responsibilities and mission, they also undermined confidence-building and might 
make the road ahead even more tortuous. 
19. Ms. SANDERS (United States of America) said that her country was pleased that the General 
Conference had once again been able to achieve consensus on the resolution on the application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, all parties involved having thereby demonstrated their 
understanding that only through patient negotiation and confidence-building could the difficult 
challenges of the Middle East be successfully addressed. The United States had joined that consensus 
on the understanding that, as in the preceding year, the only action taken under agenda item 20 would 
be an endorsement by the General Conference of a short statement by the President noting that the 
item had been discussed. 
20. She welcomed the Director GeneralÂs intention to convene a forum on experience gained in 
other regions regarding the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. It was her countryÂs 
understanding that that forum would be an information and discussion event only and not a forum for 
negotiation.

20. Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat 
(GC(48)/1 and Corr.1 and Add.1) 

21. The PRESIDENT said that it had been agreed in consultations that he should read out the 
following statement for endorsement by the Conference: 
ÂThe General Conference recalls the statement by the President of the 36th session in 1992 
concerning the agenda item Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat. That statement considered it 
desirable not to consider that agenda item at the 37th session. 

ÂThe General Conference also recalls the statement by the President of the 43rd session in 1999 
concerning the same agenda item. At the 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th and 48th sessions, this item was, 
at the request of certain Member States, re-inscribed on the agenda. The item was discussed. 

ÂSeveral Member States requested that this item be included in the provisional agenda of the 
49th regular session of the General ConferenceÂ. 

22. The Conference endorsed the Presidential statement. 
23. Mr. AL-RIYAMI (Oman)1, speaking on behalf of the Arab Member States of the Agency, said 
that an item on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat had been included in the agenda of the General 
Conference for many years and the Conference had adopted resolutions calling on Israel to submit its 
nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. In 1992, the Conference had not addressed the item because of 
the peace process then under way in the Middle East. The peace process having stalled as a result of 
Israeli policies, since 1998 the Conference had taken up the item in response to the request of Arab 
countries. In submitting the item, the Arab countries were seeking to address a situation which was 
unfair and unhealthy. 
24. Israel was the only country in the region with undeclared nuclear operations not under 
international control. Flagrantly disregarding the wishes of the international community, it refused to 
accede to the NPT or to submit its nuclear facilities to comprehensive safeguards, whereas the Arab 
countries had always been ready to take practical steps to free the Middle East region of nuclear 
weapons. 
25. Owing to IsraelÂs intransigence, the statement by the President had been merely procedural in 
nature and did not go to the heart of the issue. The Arab States had refrained from submitting a draft 
resolution on the item in the expectation that a strong and balanced statement would be made by the 
President. They had submitted a draft for such a statement which referred to all the resolutions on 
nuclear non-proliferation adopted by the Agency and other international bodies, recalled the positive 
steps taken since the 2003 General Conference including LibyaÂs voluntary renunciation of its nuclear 
capabilities, and stressed how important it was for Israel to accede to the NPT and submit all its 
nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. The Arab countries were very disappointed at the 
intransigence of the other parties and the PresidentÂs negative response to their positive initiatives. The 
PresidentÂs statement, which was identical to the one read out in 2003, was not balanced or conducive 
to achieving a consensus. Its acceptance by the Arab States was an enormous concession. It was not 
acceptable that all positive developments in the area of non-proliferation should be ignored or that the 
Speaking under Rule 30 of the Rules of Procedure 


GC(48)/OR.10 
17 September 2004, Page 5 

international community should give its blessing to Israel remaining outside the safeguards system. An 
attitude of indifference to nuclear proliferation undermined the AgencyÂs credibility. Israel should 
submit its nuclear facilities to Agency safeguards. 

26. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) said that, in recent years, the international community had been 
preoccupied by a number of threats to international peace and security related to nuclear proliferation. 
It had unfortunately not adopted the same attitude in IsraelÂs case as it had in other cases of nuclear 
proliferation. IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and place its nuclear installations under safeguards 
created doubts about the credibility of the non-proliferation regime, posed a serious threat to security 
in the region and constituted a basic obstacle to achieving a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
The Israeli nuclear threat had to be confronted. 
27. It was regrettable that the amendments that the Arab States had attempted to introduce in the 
Presidential statement, stressing the importance of Israel responding to international efforts to 
establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone, had not been accepted. The political developments in the region 
invalidated IsraelÂs argument that its nuclear capability was necessary for it to defend itself against 
countries possessing weapons of mass destruction. The assertion that Iraq was a threat to IsraelÂs 
security was unfounded, as events had shown that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction. 
Libya had renounced its nuclear programme and, at the current point in time, it was not possible to 
infer that Iran possessed a nuclear military programme. 
28. A political solution to the problem had to be found. However, with the exception of a few 
encouraging statements, the international communityÂs response had been disappointing. There 
appeared to be strong support for non-proliferation in relation to other countries, such as Iraq, the 
DPRK, Libya and Iran, but not in the case of Israel. The time might well come when that attitude 
would be regretted. 
29. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) expressed regret at the lack of progress that had been made with 
respect to the issue under discussion. Though his country had not blocked the consensus, the 
Presidential statement was not an appropriate response to the realities of the region. Israel posed a real 
threat, and not just to countries in the region but to international peace. It was the only State in the 
Middle East that did not abide by international law and double standards were being applied. He 
wondered how much longer such a situation would be allowed to persist. 
30. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that he was concerned at the lack of attention being 
given to IsraelÂs nuclear capabilities. That country was continuing to develop its nuclear military 
capability despite repeated international calls to accede to the NPT and place all its nuclear facilities 
under Agency safeguards. Furthermore, the international community had failed to subject Israel to the 
kind of pressure that other States had been subjected to. 
31. Israel posed the real nuclear threat in what was one of the worldÂs most tense regions and his 
country had hoped that the General Conference would adopt a resolution highlighting IsraelÂs lack of 
respect for international law, and the imbalance of power in the region created by its possession of 
weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Equally, his country was also concerned that 
an environmental catastrophe could be caused by IsraelÂs nuclear reactors which were not subject to 
international control. 
32. The action taken by General Conference did not address the concerns of the Arab States and he 
called on the international community, in particular the nuclear-weapon States, to take a balanced and 
non-selective approach to the problem which respected all peoples, preserved national sovereignty and 
avoided double standards.

33. Mr. EL-MISSLATTI (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), stressed the importance of ridding the Middle 
East of weapons of mass destruction. In December 2003, his country had announced its intention to 
renounce voluntarily all its programmes related to the production of prohibited armaments and it had 
adhered to most international conventions on weapons of mass destruction. As such, it hoped to serve 
as a model. 
34. Israel was one of a number of countries that had a strategic belief in nuclear weapons. It 
continued to develop and produce such weapons and refused to adhere to the NPT. Furthermore, the 
threats it made were designed to keep the balance of power tilted in its favour. Its actions threatened 
peace and security not only in the Middle East but in the world in general. All countries in the region 
should abandon weapons of mass destruction and use the peaceful applications of nuclear technology 
to promote economic and social development. 
The meeting was suspended at 4.50 p.m and resumed at 7.15 p.m. 

Â Oral report by the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole 
35. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic), Chairman of the Committee of the Whole, presented 
the outcome of the CommitteeÂs deliberations on agenda items 13, 14, 15 and 17. 
36. Under item 13, measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation and 
transport safety and waste management, the Committee recommended that the Conference adopt draft 
resolution D contained in document GC(48)/L.5. 
37. Under item 14, nuclear security Â measures to protect against nuclear terrorism, the Committee 
recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.6. 
38. Under item 15, strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, the Committee 
recommended that the Conference adopt the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.7. 
39. Under item 17, strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards 
system and application of the Model Additional Protocol, the Committee had reached agreement on 
the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.8 with the exception of one operative paragraph. 
40. The PRESIDENT invited the Conference to take up one by one the items regarding which the 
Chairman of the Committee of the Whole had just reported. 
Measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation and transport 
safety and waste management (agenda item 13) (resumed) 

41. As recommended by the Committee of the Whole, the draft resolution contained in document 
GC(48)/L.5 was adopted.

Strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the safeguards system 
and application of the Model Additional Protocol (agenda item 17) 

44. Mr. DE VISSER (Netherlands), speaking on behalf of the sponsors, invited the Conference to 
consider the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.8 
45. The PRESIDENT said that there had been a request for a separate vote on operative paragraph 3 
of the draft resolution and he put that paragraph to a vote by show of hands. 
46. There were 81 votes in favour of operative paragraph 3 and two against, with one abstention. 
The paragraph was adopted. 
47. Mr. SHARMA (India) said that, as a founder member of the Agency, India had consistently 
attached great importance to the organizationÂs safeguards activities and had participated 
constructively in meetings on strengthening the effectiveness and improving the efficiency of the 
safeguards system. The value and success of the Agency were attributable to the meticulous way in 
which it had carried out its tasks in accordance with its mandate, without getting bogged down in 
extraneous issues. The main purpose of additional protocols and strengthened safeguards was to 
enable the Agency to detect undeclared, clandestine nuclear activities and facilities in States that had 
concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements in compliance with their obligations under the NPT. 
48. India was therefore disturbed by the persistent practice of introducing language into draft 
resolutions like the one currently before the Conference which threatened to upset the delicate 
compromise worked out in 2000. The chapeau to the operative part of resolution GC(44)/RES/19, 
which had been the result of difficult negotiations, had enabled India to join the consensus on that 
resolution. In 2001, a paragraph contradicting the spirit of the chapeau had been added to the 
corresponding resolution and that paragraph now appeared as operative paragraph 3 of the draft 
resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.8. Despite his delegationÂs efforts, it had not been possible 
to resolve the concerns which arose from that contradiction. 
49. As his country had made clear at the preceding session of the Conference, the signing of a treaty 
was a Member StateÂs sovereign decision and IndiaÂs membership of the Agency did not impose upon 
it any obligations beyond those contained in the Statute. Any resolution which ran counter to the 
Statute in spirit was unacceptable to his country. Accordingly, his delegation had had no option but to 
vote against operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution. 
50. Mr. NAQVI (Pakistan) said that operative paragraph 3 did not take into account the different 
safeguards obligations of different Member States and thus failed to observe a key point of 
international law, as well as contradicting the chapeau of the operative part of the draft resolution. His 
country therefore found operative paragraph 3 unacceptable and had voted against it. 
51. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(48)/L.8 as a whole. 
52. It was so decided. 
53. Mr. DE VISSER (Netherlands), speaking on behalf of the sponsors of the resolution, said that it 
had been possible to accommodate almost every request and remark made during the lengthy 
negotiations on the draft. However, no agreement had been possible on the issue of compatibility of 
decisions relating to safeguards with the relevant provisions of the Statute. The sponsors of the 
resolution wished to state explicitly that they recognized the importance of all the provisions of the 
Statute. 

GC(48)/OR.10 
17 September 2004, Page 8 

54. Mr. HANIFF (Malaysia), speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and 
supported by Mr. VIEIRA DE SOUZA (Brazil), said that the NAM attached great importance to the 
effectiveness and strengthening of the safeguards system, as well as to the maintenance of an 
appropriate balance between the AgencyÂs verification and other statutory functions. It had worked in 
good faith to achieve a consensus on the resolution just adopted. In the meetings of the Board of 
Governors during the preceding week, it had expressed its serious concern over the complications 
which might arise if no clear distinction were made between Member StatesÂ legal obligations under 
their respective safeguards agreements and their voluntary commitments. Moreover, voluntary 
commitments should be entered into for a specified period and should cease to be binding once the 
relevant requirements had been met. Other members of the Board of Governors had shared those 
views. Member States should respect the fundamental principle that resolutions and decisions on 
safeguards issues should be compatible with the relevant provisions of the Statute and the rights and 
obligations of States under relevant treaties and their own safeguards agreements. 
55. Ms. AMIN (Egypt) said that the safeguards system provided the international community with 
essential assurances regarding StatesÂ commitment not to use nuclear energy for non-peaceful 
purposes. Egypt therefore urged all States without exception to accede to the comprehensive 
safeguards system, which was the only way of strengthening the credibility of the non-proliferation 
regime both regionally and internationally. 
56. Her country had signed and ratified the NPT and had concluded a safeguards agreement with 
the Agency, which it would implement in full. It had not signed an additional protocol, though it 
welcomed that instrument as an additional element which enhanced the credibility of the safeguards 
system. However, it was opposed to new initiatives which yielded no useful result. The safeguards 
system would have no value as long as a certain State in the Middle East failed to respect its 
obligations. Egypt was not prepared to take on further commitments if other States would not agree to 
take action in their turn. Questions related to weapons of mass destruction had to be settled in a 
balanced and integrated manner. 
57. She welcomed the fact that the General Conference had adopted the resolution on safeguards by 
consensus but expressed regret that two States had voted against operative paragraph 3, a paragraph 
which clearly reflected the desire for a universal safeguards system. 
58. Mr. ELOUMNI (Morocco) commended the Ambassador of Finland for the leadership he had 
provided in the informal working group that had worked on the draft resolution. Morocco had signed 
its additional protocol on 22 September 2004. The safeguards system should be universal in extent and 
fully implemented, with all facilities subject to inspection, in order to preserve its credibility. 
59. Mr. GASHUT (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya) thanked the Ambassador of Finland for chairing the 
informal working group and commended the representative of Malaysia for his patience during the 
negotiations. His country had supported the resolution. It had implemented a number of measures in 
the safeguards area, which the Board of Governors had acknowledged.

Report on contributions pledged to the Technical Cooperation 
Fund for 2005 
(GC(48)/26/Rev.3) 

60. The PRESIDENT said that, by 6 p.m. on 23 September 2004, the contributions pledged by 
Member States to the Technical Cooperation Fund had amounted to US $6 490 395, or 8.37% of the 
target for 2005, which was 4.15% lower than the percentage of the target for 2004 pledged by the 
same point in the preceding year. 
61. Since then, pledges made by Bangladesh ($7750), Belarus ($13 175), Brazil ($400 000), 
Burkina Faso ($1550), China ($1 535 275), Denmark ($537 075), Zambia ($1500) and Zimbabwe 
($5425) had brought the total to $8 992 145, or 11.6% of the target. 
62. He urged those Member States which had not yet done so to make their 2005 pledges, and to 
pay their contributions in full at the earliest opportunity, so that the Secretariat could submit a 
proposed 2005 technical cooperation programme to the meeting of the Technical Assistance and 
Cooperation Committee in November based on reasonably assured resources, and subsequently 
implement the approved programme without hindrance or uncertainty. 
Â 
Closing of the session 
63. The PRESIDENT noted that 50 ministerial-level delegations had attended the General 
Conference, which was an indication of the great importance Member States attached to the AgencyÂs 
work. There had been 105 speakers in the general debate. 
64. Mr. TAKASU (Japan) commended the President on his leadership and efficient handling of the 
proceedings of the General Conference. A number of difficult issues had arisen during the session, but 
the PresidentÂs balanced and fair approach had brought delegations together to achieve a consensus. 
As a result of recent events, the Agency was receiving increased international attention and higher 
expectations were being placed on it. Member States had every reason to be pleased with the 
achievements of the General Conference. 
65. Mr. NÃMETHY (Slovakia), speaking on behalf of the Eastern Europe Group, said that, under 
the PresidentÂs able leadership, the General Conference had helped strengthen the framework for 
technical cooperation, safety and security of nuclear installations and material, science and technology 
and safeguards. The safeguards system and additional protocols were the most essential elements of 
the AgencyÂs work. He expressed the hope that the resolutions and decisions of the forty-eighth 
session would contribute to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. In conclusion he 
thanked delegations for their cooperation and spirit of compromise, the Secretariat for their excellent 
work and the President for his personal commitment to the success of the Conference. 
66. The PRESIDENT thanked the preceding speakers for their kind words. Serving as President of 
the General Conference had been an honour for him and his country. He thanked all delegates for the

Opening of the session 
1. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT declared open the forty-eighth regular session of the General 
Conference. 
2. In accordance with Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, he invited 
delegates to observe one minute of silence dedicated to prayer or meditation. 
All present rose and stood in silence for one minute. 

3. The TEMPORARY PRESIDENT said that the Agency had made significant progress in the 
areas of nuclear technology, safety and security and verification since the forty-seventh regular session 
of the General Conference, and he commended Member States on their achievements in the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energy during the fiftieth anniversary year of Atoms for Peace. 
4. Through international efforts there had been steady progress in improving the safety, economics 
and proliferation resistance of nuclear technologies, which were playing an indispensable and 
expanding role in promoting sustainable development and enhancing human well-being and security. 
In that regard, it was essential to ensure compliance with international safety standards with a view to 
minimizing risks. Commendable progress had been made in the management of spent fuel and 
radioactive waste, the transport of radioactive materials and the prevention of nuclear terrorism. 
5. Through impartial, effective and credible verification activities and the implementation of a 
safeguards system strengthened Â inter alia Â through the universalization of the additional protocol, 
the Agency had enhanced its capacity to meet challenges to the non-proliferation regime. Nonetheless, 
further efforts were needed in order to enlarge the contribution of nuclear energy to worldwide peace, 
health and prosperity.

10. The PRESIDENT thanked all delegations for supporting his nomination. He expressed gratitude 
to his predecessor, Mr. Takasu, for his able guidance of the previous session of the General 
Conference. 
11. Since becoming a Member State, in 1957, Hungary had consistently demonstrated its strong and 
active commitment to the AgencyÂs goals and activities. 
12. Recent years had seen a dramatic increase in the AgencyÂs public profile and in the importance 
accorded to the Agency by the international community. Since the forty-seventh session of the General 
Conference, nuclear-related developments had increasingly come to the forefront of public attention, 
and the agenda for the forty-eighth session included issues which Â as never before Â were 
recognized as having a direct impact on the lives and well-being of millions of people. The rapid 
development and dissemination of nuclear technology and knowledge opened up new and promising 
opportunities for sustainable development, but they also presented new challenges. Since the previous 
session of the General Conference, the Agency had made great progress in promoting Â and 
providing assurances of Â the safe and peaceful utilization of nuclear technology for social and 
economic development, continuing to serve as a valuable and versatile instrument from which 
Member States had benefited irrespective of their priorities. In an age when global challenges 
demanded intensified interaction among States, international organizations had an indispensable role 
to play in finding global solutions. The key objective at the General ConferenceÂs current session 
should be to make the Agency an increasingly effective tool of multilateral cooperation. 
13. Turning to item 1 of the provisional agenda, Election of officers and appointment of the General 
Committee, he recalled that, pursuant to Rules 34 and 40 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference 
normally elected eight Vice-Presidents, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole and five 
additional members of the General Committee Â resulting in a General Committee of 15 members. 
14. He proposed that the delegates of Canada, Chile, Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, the Russian 
Federation, Spain, Yemen and Zimbabwe be elected as Vice-Presidents; that Mr. Othman (Syrian 
Arab Republic) be elected as Chairman of the Committee of the Whole; and that the delegates of 
Burkina Faso, Mexico, Poland, Switzerland and Turkey be elected as additional members of the 
General Committee. 
15. The PresidentÂs proposals were accepted. 
16. The PRESIDENT further proposed that the General Conference deal with items 2, 3, 4 and 6 
pending receipt of the General CommitteeÂs recommendation on the provisional agenda. 
17. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
2. Applications for membership of the Agency 
(GC(48)/5, GC(48)/21 and GC(48)/22) 

18. The PRESIDENT drew attention to documents GC(48)/5, GC(48)/21 and GC(48)/22 containing 
applications for membership by the Republic of Chad, the Republic of Togo and the Islamic Republic 
of Mauritania, respectively. The three applications had been endorsed by the Board, which had also 
submitted three draft resolutions for adoption by the General Conference. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 3 

19. He took it that the Conference wished to adopt the three resolutions. 
20. It was so decided. 
3. Message from the Secretary-General of the United Nations 
21. Mr. ABE (Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs) read out the following message: 
ÂI am pleased to send my best wishes to the 48th General Conference of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency. The IAEAÂs role in helping to maintain international peace and 
security is as vital today as at any time in its history. The Agency is an important catalyst in the 
promotion of a culture of safety and security in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The 
international community recognizes the AgencyÂs independent, technically competent and 
impartial verification of global non-proliferation efforts. 

ÂThe work of the IAEA is helping to meet many of the biggest challenges facing the world 
today Â from combating climate change to preserving the environment, from feeding and 
protecting the health of the worldÂs growing population to supplying the water and energy 
needed for sustainable economic growth and development. I welcome the AgencyÂs efforts in 
these fields, and I urge it to develop further the use of nuclear techniques for sustainable 
development. 

ÂI wholeheartedly support the IAEAÂs work to strengthen nuclear safeguards and to encourage 
the conclusion of additional protocols to safeguards agreements. In this context, I again call for 
the early resumption of the AgencyÂs safeguards activities in the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic 
of Korea. I also call upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to further cooperate with the Agency in 
fully resolving outstanding issues regarding its nuclear programme. 

ÂIt is also my hope that the forthcoming 2005 Review Conference of the States Parties to the 
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will bring about renewed commitments to 
all treaty obligations, including progress in achieving adherence to comprehensive safeguards 
by all States Parties and in further promoting the importance of the additional protocol. 

ÂThe ongoing conflict in the Middle East and its potential for escalation is a source of great 
concern. I therefore commend the recent efforts of the IAEA to work towards the application of 
full-scope IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, in furtherance of the goal of a nuclear-weaponfree 
zone in the region. 

ÂI also fully share the deep concern of many over the risk of terrorists acquiring and using 
nuclear devices or radioactive materials. Keeping nuclear weapons out of such dangerous hands 
is a sine qua non of global security. I therefore urge all Governments to work closely with the 
IAEA in taking stronger measures to ensure the physical protection, safety and security of 
nuclear and radioactive materials, as well as relevant equipment and technology. 

ÂThis 48th General Conference offers a renewed opportunity to address some issues of core 
concern to the international community in a forthright manner. I urge all Member States to seize 
this opportunity, and I wish you a successful outcome.Â

4. Statement by the Director General 
22. The DIRECTOR GENERAL said that every year brought new challenges and opportunities, 
and for the Agency the previous twelve months had been no exception. The outlook for nuclear power 
was evolving, with increasing attention being paid to its benefits as an environmentally clean source of 
electricity, but with concerns remaining with regard to waste disposal, safety and security. Nuclear 
applications related to human health, agriculture and other areas were increasingly contributing to 
global sustainable development initiatives, and the Agency had redoubled its efforts to support those 
initiatives by improving the efficiency and extending the reach of its technical cooperation 
programme. Global cooperation in matters of safety and security had resulted in good progress, but 
there was still much to be done. In the area of verification, the AgencyÂs activities were at the centre of 
efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, and the Agency had continued to prove its ability to conduct 
objective and credible safeguards Â but it still faced a number of difficult and unresolved situations, 
and the international community had begun to focus on how to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. 
23. The year 2004 marked the 50th anniversary of civilian nuclear power. With 439 power reactors 
worldwide, nuclear energy continued to account for about 16 per cent of the worldÂs electricity 
production, keeping pace with the steady growth in the global electricity market. 
24. Near-term growth in nuclear capacity continued to be centred in Asia and Eastern Europe, 
owing to a combination of factors, including the rise in electricity demand, the existence of a welldeveloped 
industrial infrastructure, and the lack of indigenous alternatives in some countries. 
25. Projections for the longer-term future varied widely, depending on what assumptions were used. 
Factors shaping the current debate included the growth in electricity demand, the emphasis on 
combating climate change, and the way in which a given nation balanced the risks associated with a 
nuclear energy accident against other risks Â such as air pollution or energy dependence. Clearly, not 
every country shared the view that improved economics and safety performance warranted a revival of 
nuclear power. Those were complex matters of legitimate debate, and it was important for the Agency 
to provide comprehensible and accurate information to ensure that the benefits and risks of nuclear 
technology were clearly and fairly understood. 
26. A factor key to the future of nuclear power was the degree to which advances in evolutionary 
and innovative reactor and fuel cycle technologies were implemented, to address safety, waste and 
proliferation concerns and considerations of economic competitiveness. More than 20 Member States 
were involved in national and international projects to develop advanced and innovative reactor and 
fuel cycle designs, ranging from water reactors to liquid-metal-cooled fast reactors to acceleratordriven 
systems. 
27. The AgencyÂs International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) 
had completed 14 case studies in seven countries, to test and provide feedback on the methodology Â 
published in 2003 Â for assessing innovative nuclear energy systems. In December 2004, the INPRO 
Steering Committee would begin to examine potential directions for INPRO Phase II, such as 
coordinated R&D initiatives that would build on INPRO results to date. 
28. Regarding the long-term management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, progress continued to 
be slow, but steady. At the International Conference on Geological Repositories held in 
December 2003 in Stockholm, experts had agreed that the majority of technological issues had been 
satisfactorily addressed, but that social issues Â such as public acceptance and political endorsement 
Â were still problematic. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 5 

29. The Agency was continuing to assist Member States in developing waste management and 
disposal strategies, and he welcomed the renewed interest in multinational approaches to spent fuel 
management and disposal. More than 50 countries now had spent nuclear fuel Â including fuel from 
research reactors Â stored at temporary sites, awaiting disposal or reprocessing. It was encouraging 
that the Russian Federation had expressed interest in an international approach to spent fuel storage 
and reprocessing and had agreed to work with the Agency in giving consideration to its feasibility. 
The Agency intended to hold a conference in Russia in 2005 to discuss ways of moving forward with 
international cooperation on such an initiative. 
30. The concept of multilateral control or oversight over proliferation-sensitive parts of the nuclear 
fuel cycle Â specifically, those related to the enrichment of uranium and the separation of plutonium 
Â had been the subject of many studies and initiatives over the years. Recent non-proliferation and 
security challenges made it important and appropriate to revisit the subject. A few months previously, 
he had appointed a group of senior experts to look into various options for multilateral control. The 
group could focus initially on how to guarantee the supply of technology and fuel for nucleargenerated 
electricity and how to set up one or more international repositories for spent nuclear fuel. 
The Agency could play an important role in that regard, particularly as a guarantor of supply Â a role 
envisaged under the Statute. The group planned to submit a report in March 2005 on the results of its 
study. 
31. A major part of the AgencyÂs scientific and technical work involved the transfer of peaceful 
nuclear technology in a variety of fields. Many applications were proving important for social and 
economic development. Through both its regular programme and its technical cooperation 
programme, the Agency provided expertise, training and equipment to Member States to build up their 
technical capabilities and support their national development programmes. 
32. An excellent example was the application of nuclear technology to one of the basic elements in 
human survival: the food supply chain. Over the previous four decades, the use of isotopes and 
radiation in food and agricultural R&D had yielded rich results: millions of hectares of higher-yielding 
crops all over the world; disease-resistant plants developed through radiation-induced mutation, 
providing economic benefits worth billions of dollars every year to the worldÂs farmers; improvements 
in livestock production and health based on immunoassay technology; the control and eradication of 
many insect pests using the sterile insect technique (SIT); and huge savings in fertilizer applications 
by using isotopes to optimize nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere to improve crop production. 
33. Cancer was a major health problem all around the world, and the number of cancer cases was 
rising, especially in developing countries. To increase public awareness of the problem and to increase 
the capacity of the Agency Â together with WHO Â to assist States in providing cancer treatment 
and care, the Agency had launched the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT), endorsed 
by the Board in June 2004. PACT would seek to attract funds and resources from both governmental 
and non-governmental sources and to extend the limited capacity of the AgencyÂs existing technical 
cooperation programme for cancer treatment. 
34. The AgencyÂs mosquito-rearing laboratory at Seibersdorf was continuing to explore the use of 
the SIT against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Colonies of African mosquitoes had been 
established, and R&D work would shortly begin on mass-rearing, radiation sterilization and the 
development of genetic sexing strains. 
35. Another crucial factor in development was access to safe drinking water Â a basic necessity 
unavailable to more than one sixth of the worldÂs population. Isotope hydrology was being used in a 
broad variety of Agency technical cooperation projects to map underground aquifers, detect and 
control pollution, and monitor the safety of dams. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 6 

36. The safety and security of nuclear activities around the globe remained key elements of the 
AgencyÂs mandate. Nearly two decades after the Chernobyl accident, it was gratifying to see that 
tangible and sustained benefits had been derived from the efforts of the Agency, with its emphasis on 
defence in depth, risk management and international cooperation, its concerted drive to upgrade 
facilities with older design features, its assistance to developing Member States in establishing solid 
radiation protection infrastructures, its emphasis on safety and security in transport and Â particularly 
in recent years Â its dual focus on strengthening physical protection at nuclear facilities and 
enhancing the security of nuclear material and radioactive sources worldwide. Considerable progress 
had been made through those efforts. Nevertheless, maintaining an effective and transparent global 
nuclear safety and security regime remained a matter of high priority. 
37. Traditional indicators of safety at nuclear installations Â for example, the frequency of 
unplanned shutdowns, the availability of safety-related equipment, or the number of actuations of 
reactor protection systems Â had shown that such facilities had become far less susceptible to events 
that challenged their safety. However, a number of issues of concern remained. 
38. The development and adoption of legally binding international agreements had proven to be a 
powerful mechanism for enhancing safety worldwide, and the Agency was continuing to encourage 
wide adherence to the various conventions of importance for nuclear safety and security. 
39. The AgencyÂs safety missions and peer reviews were in high demand. The Agency was still 
assisting some Member States with safety upgrades at older installations with design vulnerabilities. 
As more Member States considered extending operating licences, the Agency was also paying 
increased attention to services that could identify and address equipment ageing and relevant 
operational issues. As the global acceptance of Agency safety standards approached, safety reviews 
would be integrated into fewer categories and increasingly focused on the review of national selfassessments. 
40. The effective use, safety and security of research reactors and the management of research 
reactor fuel continued to be areas of Agency emphasis. In November 2003, at an international 
conference on research reactors held in Chile, the Agency had heard from designers, users and 
regulators about ways to improve the utilization of research reactors, strengthen physical security, 
improve the sharing of expertise and enhance the AgencyÂs research reactor safety assistance missions. 
In March 2004, the Board had approved a Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors Â as 
part of an international effort to harmonize the laws, policies and safety practices related to research 
reactor management and operation. 
41. In May 2004, the United States Secretary of Energy had visited Vienna to announce an 
expanded Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), with the objective of securing, removing or 
disposing of nuclear and other radioactive materials around the world that were vulnerable to theft. On 
18-19 September, a conference had been held in Vienna to further define the GTRI and seek broader 
international support for achieving its goals. The Agency was Â together with the Russian Federation, 
the United States of America and other countries Â considering how the GTRI could support its 
activities in the field in question. 
42. Another area of Member State concern and Agency focus had been the safety of transport of 
radioactive material. In March 2004, the Board had approved actions addressing issues such as denials 
of shipments, the transport of orphan sources, emergency response to transport incidents, 
communication and liability. In addition, a revised version of the AgencyÂs Transport Regulations had 
been approved by the Board in June 2004. 
43. The pace and scope of the AgencyÂs nuclear security-related activities had continued to 
accelerate and expand. Within a relatively short time, much work had been done on assessing the

20 September 2004, Page 7 

security needs of Member States and providing the necessary training. Since September 2001, more 
than 50 security-related assessment missions and over 60 training events had taken place, involving 
Member States in every region. While significant work remained to be done in developing 
international guidelines and recommendations, the greatest emphasis was now being placed on 
addressing the needs for actual improvements, including equipment needs. 

44. The verification challenges that the Agency had faced in the past year further underscored the 
importance of its role in combating proliferation and the urgency of providing it with all the means 
necessary means for performing its verification responsibilities in an effective and credible manner. 
45. Since the previous General Conference session, the number of States with additional protocols 
in force had increased appreciably Â from 36 to 60. Also, a number of NPT safeguards agreements 
had entered into force, bringing the total number of States with such safeguards agreements in force to 
150. 
46. Despite those welcome developments, there remained 42 States party to the NPT that had not 
yet fulfilled their Article III obligation to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreements with 
the Agency, and 133 States did not have additional protocols in force. 
47. The AgencyÂs verification activities in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya during the past year had 
confirmed that, for many years, Libya had pursued a clandestine programme of uranium conversion 
and enrichment. Starting in the early 1980s and continuing until the end of 2003, it had failed to meet 
its obligations under its safeguards agreement Â with respect to the reporting of nuclear material 
imported into Libya, the subsequent processing and use of the material, and the declaration of facilities 
and other locations where the material had been stored and processed. Moreover, Libya had received 
documents providing information on the design of nuclear weapons. 
48. The AgencyÂs assessment to date, made with LibyaÂs cooperation, was that the declarations of 
Libya concerning its uranium conversion programme, enrichment programme and other past nuclearrelated 
activities appeared to be consistent with the information available to, and verified by, the 
Agency. That was welcome news. However, some questions related to the acquisition of material and 
technology Â including the origin of uranium contamination on some equipment Â still needed 
further investigation in order for the Agency to verify the completeness and correctness of LibyaÂs 
declarations. The Agency would continue to pursue these questions as part of its routine inspection 
activities in Libya. 
49. The Board had continued to devote considerable attention to the implementation of the NPT 
safeguards agreement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and had adopted several resolutions urging Iran, 
inter alia, to demonstrate full cooperation and transparency in enabling the Agency to deal with open 
questions and unresolved issues. In December 2003, Iran had signed an additional protocol and had 
been acting as if the protocol were in force, pending its formal ratification in accordance with IranÂs 
constitutional requirements. 
50. His most recent report dealt with two interrelated but distinct sets of issues Â the first related to 
the AgencyÂs verification of the compliance of Iran with its legal obligations under its NPT safeguards 
agreement, and the second related to the AgencyÂs monitoring of IranÂs voluntary undertakings to 
suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities as confidence-building measures requested by 
the Board. 
51. Regarding the first set of issues, the Agency was making steady progress in understanding the 
nature and extent of IranÂs nuclear programme. No additional undeclared activities on the part of Iran 
had come to light during the period in question. The Agency had gained access to requested locations. 
Also, Iran had provided new information in response to Agency requests, although in certain instances 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 8 

the process needed to be accelerated. While in some cases information had been provided promptly, in 
other cases information had regrettably been provided quite late. 

52. As a result of the AgencyÂs investigations, some previously outstanding issues had reached the 
point where any further follow-up needed would be carried out as part of routine safeguards 
implementation. 
53. Two issues remained central to understanding the extent and nature of IranÂs nuclear 
programme: the origin of uranium contamination found at various locations in Iran, and the extent of 
IranÂs efforts to import, manufacture and use centrifuges of both the P-1 and the P-2 design. The 
Agency had made some progress in understanding both issues, but additional investigation was 
needed. 
54. With regard to confidence-building measures that the Board had requested be in place until 
certain conditions were met, Iran had in June reversed some of its earlier decisions regarding the 
suspension of some enrichment-related activities. He had continued to stress to Iran that, during the 
current delicate phase while work was still in progress on verifying its past nuclear programme, and in 
the light of serious international concerns surrounding that programme, it should do its utmost to build 
the required confidence through the Agency. 
55. Iran therefore needed, as the Board had made explicitly clear the previous week, to continue to 
accelerate its cooperation, pursuing a policy of maximum transparency and confidence-building, so 
that the Agency could bring the remaining outstanding issues to resolution within the next few months 
and provide assurance to the international community. That was clearly in the interest of both Iran and 
the international community and should trigger a comprehensive dialogue among all interested parties 
on all the underlying issues. 
56. The situation in the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea (DPRK) continued to pose a 
serious challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. As he had reported repeatedly to the Board, 
since 1993 the Agency had been unable to implement fully its comprehensive NPT safeguards 
agreement with the DPRK. The Agency had never been allowed by the DPRK to verify the 
completeness and correctness of that countryÂs initial, 1992, declaration Â specifically, to verify that 
the DPRK had declared all the nuclear material subject to Agency safeguards under its NPT 
safeguards agreement. Since December 2002, the Agency had not been permitted to perform any 
verification activities in the DPRK and could not therefore provide any level of assurance about the 
non-diversion of nuclear material. 
57. The three rounds held so far of the Six-Party Talks involving China, the DPRK, Japan, the 
Republic of Korea, Russia and the USA were steps in the right direction. As he had stated before, the 
Secretariat remained ready to work with all parties towards a comprehensive settlement that would, 
inter alia, provide assurance to the international community that all nuclear activities in the DPRK 
were exclusively for peaceful purposes. 
58. Pursuant to the mandate given him by the General Conference, he had continued his 
consultations with the States of the Middle East region on the application of full-scope safeguards to 
all nuclear activities in the Middle East, and on the development of model safeguards agreements. 
Once again he regretted to report that he had not been in a position to make progress on those fronts. 
59. In addition, the General Conference had asked him to organize a forum on the relevance of the 
experience of regions with existing nuclear-weapon-free zones Â including confidence-building and 
verification measures Â to establishing such a zone in the Middle East. On the basis of his 
consultations with States of the region, including those which had taken place during his recent visit to 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 9 

Israel, he intended to organize such a forum early in 2005, and further consultations were in progress 
to that end. 

60. The AgencyÂs recent experience of verifying undeclared nuclear programmes had yielded a 
number of important lessons, the most important of which was perhaps that verification and 
diplomacy, used in conjunction, could be effective. When inspections were accompanied by adequate 
authority, aided by all available information, backed by a credible compliance mechanism and 
supported by international consensus, the system worked. The Iraq experience had demonstrated that 
inspections Â while requiring time and patience Â could be effective even when the country under 
inspection was providing less than active cooperation. 
61. However, the experience of the Agency in Iraq before the first Gulf War and its recent 
experience in Iran and Libya had also highlighted the importance for verification of the additional 
protocols, which provided the Agency with significant additional authority as regards both information 
and physical access. Without the authority provided by additional protocols, the AgencyÂs ability to 
draw conclusions was for the most part limited to the non-diversion of material already declared. 
62. Perhaps the most disturbing lesson to emerge from the AgencyÂs work in Iran and Libya was the 
existence of an extensive illicit market for the supply of nuclear items, which had clearly thrived on 
demand. The relative ease with which a multinational illicit network had been set up and operated 
demonstrated clearly the inadequacy of the present export control system, which relied on informal 
arrangements that were not only non-binding, but also limited in membership, and in which many 
countries with growing industrial capacity were not included. 
63. A related lesson concerned the accessibility of nuclear technology. The technical barriers to 
mastering the essential steps of uranium enrichment Â and to designing weapons Â had eroded over 
time, which inevitably led to the conclusion that the control of technology, in and of itself, was not a 
sufficient barrier against further proliferation. 
64. In addition to the steps he had already outlined Â including exploring the feasibility of 
multilateral control over sensitive portions of the nuclear fuel cycle, supporting efforts to secure and 
protect nuclear material, and the conclusion of additional protocols by all States Â it was important to 
work collectively in addressing the sense of insecurity and instability that persisted in many countries 
and regions. It was instructive that nearly all nuclear proliferation concerns were in areas of longstanding 
tension. 
65. Both the value and the limitations of the AgencyÂs verification role needed to be recognized. 
The Secretariat could bring to closure questions of compliance with legal and technical requirements, 
but the long-term value of its efforts depended on the extent that they were followed by the political 
dialogue among concerned States necessary for addressing the underlying issues of insecurity and for 
building confidence and trust. 
66. As more developing countries became Member States of the Agency, the number of countries 
that benefited from assistance through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes continued to 
grow. In the current year, a record number of Member States Â 111 Â were participating in national, 
regional and interregional projects. 
67. In order to ensure the effectiveness of technical cooperation programme management, the 
Secretariat was continuing to apply the Âcentral criterionÂ, which sought to ensure government 
commitment to a given project, to assist States in developing country programme frameworks (CPFs), 
to formulate thematic plans highlighting nuclear technology benefits in key areas, to expand its 
partnerships with key organizations and to encourage cost-sharing on the part of recipient States. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 10 

68. His overview of the past year had highlighted achievements and challenges in all areas of 
Agency activity Â and had reflected the dynamic nature of the AgencyÂs programme in anticipating 
and responding to change. Whether a specific activity contributed to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime, to enhancing the transfer and application of nuclear technologies or to ensuring 
safety and security in their use, the Agency remained committed to responding to Member StatesÂ 
needs and priorities. As always, the AgencyÂs success was crucially dependent on the shared 
commitment and partnership of Member States Â particularly in providing the required authority, 
cooperation and funding. He trusted that their support would continue. 
6. Contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund for 2005 
(GC(48)/20) 

69. The PRESIDENT said that the Board had, on 14 September 2004, recommended a target figure 
of US $75 million for voluntary contributions to the TCF for 2005. The early pledging and payment of 
contributions to the TCF greatly helped the Secretariat in planning the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programmes. He therefore urged delegations in a position to do so to notify the Secretariat during the 
current session of the contributions that their governments would be making to the TCF for 2005. He 
would report at the end of the session, under a later agenda item, on the contributions that had been 
pledged so far, which he hoped would represent a substantial percentage of the target figure. 
7. General debate and annual report for 2003 
(GC(48)/3) 

70. The PRESIDENT said that, in order to avoid prolonged afternoon meetings (or a night meeting, 
the cost of which would be more than $16 000), he took it that the Conference wished to authorize 
him, under Rule 50 of the Rules of Procedure, to limit the duration of speeches to 15 minutes. 
71. It was so agreed. 
72. Ms. OLAMENDI (Mexico) said that the actions taken by the Agency during 2003 in response 
to the enormous challenges which it had faced confirmed the importance of its contribution to peace 
and prosperity the world over. 
73. Disarmament, non-proliferation and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons would 
continue to be prime objectives of the foreign policy of Mexico, which believed that as long as nuclear 
weapons existed anywhere the risk of their being used would persist. 
74. The disturbing international situation called for concerted and effective responses. Besides the 
problems stemming from the existence of nuclear weapons, there were new threats to individual safety 
and life. The non-fulfilment by certain countries of obligations arising out of their safeguards 
agreements and the NPT, the discovery of an illicit market in sensitive nuclear technologies and 
equipment, and the possible use of nuclear weapons, technologies and materials by terrorist groups 
opened up a whole new scenario. 
75. There was no denying the danger of non-State actors Â many linked to organized crime Â 
gaining access to the materials and technologies necessary for developing nuclear weapons. Nor could 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 11 

it be denied that States had not achieved the goals set in the NPT and other international nonproliferation 
instruments. The risk of proliferation would decline substantially if the complete 
elimination of nuclear weapons were achieved in a transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
What did not exist could not proliferate. The forthcoming NPT Review Conference would provide an 
ideal opportunity for once again Â and for all time Â making the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons a goal. Mexico would like to see all countries that had not yet acceded to the NPT joining in 
the international communityÂs efforts and all countries that had acceded to it fully meeting their 
commitments as regards disarmament, non-proliferation and the promotion of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. 

76. The Agency efforts to build and operate a safeguards system that effectively supported the 
nuclear non-proliferation regime would never be sufficient without the political will of States. Mexico, 
like other countries, had done its best in the area of non-proliferation, complying fully with the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. 
77. Despite economic, educational, health and welfare problems, her country had on 29 March 2004 
signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency and was well on the way to 
ratifying and implementing it. 
78. For countries like Mexico, fulfilment of the additional obligations would require substantial 
human and financial resources. However, her country Â like other developing countries Â was 
prepared to allocate scarce resources to the strengthening of non-proliferation measures. Its attitude 
contrasted with the attitude of those States which, although possessing adequate resources, preferred 
not to follow suit, thereby negating the efforts being made to eliminate the nuclear threat. The nuclearweapon 
States and the non-nuclear-weapon States possessing or receiving nuclear technology, 
equipment and materials should fulfil their obligations in a reliable manner. It was necessary both to 
ensure technology transfer for the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to join together in countering the 
threat posed by the possibility of terrorist or organized criminal groups gaining access to nuclear 
weapons. 
79. Mexico, which attached particular importance to the Agency activities in the field of nuclear 
applications, believed that they could make a substantial contribution to the attainment of the goals set 
at the World Summit on Sustainable Development and in the Millennium Declaration. It would like to 
see further information campaigns on the benefits of nuclear applications such as the campaigns 
relating to cancer radiotherapy and the search for sustainable water resources. The Agency should take 
maximum advantage of the increased attention being paid by the media and society to its 
non-proliferation activities in order to make the benefits of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy 
widely known. 
80. In that connection, her country particularly appreciated the AgencyÂs activities directed against 
insect pests and would like to see the Agency continuing its support for the further development of the 
SIT and other complementary techniques. 
81. Mexico considered the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes to be the best means of 
enabling developing countries to enjoy the benefits of peaceful applications of nuclear techniques and 
thereby to improve the living conditions of millions. It would therefore like to see those programmes 
strengthened, technically and financially, through efforts comparable with those being made in the 
safeguards area. 
82. Mexico, which was convinced of the importance of amending the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), stood ready to continue participating in efforts to bring 
about a consensus among the contracting parties. It also stood ready to continue supporting the 
AgencyÂs efforts to promote universal implementation of the international instruments on the physical 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 12 

protection of nuclear materials and facilities and of radioactive sources as one of the measures to 
prevent nuclear terrorism. 

83. Mexico, which remained committed to the Agency and to the NPT, believed, like many other 
developing countries, that it was important to increase the benefits derived from the peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy. It would therefore like to see a balance established between security 
and the obligation to promote the widest possible exchange of the equipment, materials and scientific 
and technical information necessary for the peaceful use of nuclear power, in accordance with 
Article IV of the NPT. 
84. The present international situation called for the fulfilment of the provisions of the NPT and for 
new commitments that might go beyond the letter of that instrument. There was a need to build 
confidence, and confidence was built on the basis of genuine and full commitments that made for 
effective responses to old and new threats. In isolation, security, peace, development and well-being 
meant nothing to people like those of Mexico; it was only together that they made a difference. 
85. Mr. ABRAHAM (United States of America) began his statement by reading out the following 
message from President Bush: 
ÂI send greetings to those gathered for the 48th General Conference of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. During this critical time in our history, the collaborative efforts of the 
international community to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons are vital to advancing 
peace and prosperity around the world. In the past year, we have witnessed major successes 
against proliferation: LibyaÂs historic decision to renounce weapons of mass destruction and 
longer-range missile programmes; the dismantling of the worldÂs most dangerous proliferation 
network; the unanimous call by the United Nations Security Council for all States to criminalize 
proliferation; and accelerated progress in securing and reducing nuclear and radioactive 
materials. 

ÂWe must do everything in our power to combat the proliferation of nuclear and other weapons 
of mass destruction, and strengthening the IAEA is an important part of these efforts. We must 
also make certain that those States in full compliance with their non-proliferation obligations 
can benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The United States applauds the AgencyÂs 
work in safeguards and verification, and we will continue to work to ensure that you have the 
tools necessary to accomplish your critical mission. 

ÂBest wishes for a successful conference.Â 

86. Associating himself with President BushÂs wishes, he said that the General Conference was 
meeting at a time of great challenge. Terrorists must be prevented from acquiring a nuclear weapon, or 
the materials to make one, so the lives of millions of people might depend on the AgencyÂs work. 
87. Three years previously, the most massive terrorist attack in history had struck down thousands 
of his fellow-citizens. It had not been the first mass murder of innocent civilians, and sadly it had not 
been the last. The terrorists had struck again, in Bali and then in Madrid. Just a few weeks previously, 
they had committed perhaps their most repulsive act Â the deliberate targeting and barbaric slaughter 
of hundreds of schoolchildren in Russia. And most recently, they had claimed yet more victims Â in 
and around the Australian embassy in Jakarta. He extended his countryÂs condolences to the 
Australian, Indonesian, Russian and Spanish peoples for the tragedies they had suffered. 
88. Again and again, the terrorists had made it clear that they would stop at nothing. In his view, 
however, the inhumanity of the attack in Beslan was an indication that the terrorists were feeling 
increasingly desperate. The civilized world had responded to the outrages committed against its 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 13 

citizens, and progress was being made in driving the terrorists from their sanctuaries, exposing their 
networks, interdicting their cash flows and denying them the most terrible weapons which they sought. 

89. A vital part of the ongoing effort was identifying and securing nuclear and other radiological 
materials at risk around the world. That was why, four months previously, he had Â on behalf of the 
United States Â announced the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), designed to respond to the 
ever-changing proliferation threat. Through the GTRI new measures were being taken, at the 
international level, to identify, secure and remove and/or facilitate the disposal of vulnerable nuclear 
and other radiological materials and associated equipment that posed a threat to the international 
community as expeditiously as possible. The response from countries all around the world had been 
immensely gratifying. Some countries had requested further information, some had offered varying 
levels of support and some had stated that they were intensifying their efforts to secure materials that 
terrorists might seek. On 18Â19 September over 500 people representing more than 90 countries had 
met in Vienna for the first GTRI PartnersÂ Conference Â a very successful event that had lent further 
impetus to the GTRI. 
90. The day after the GTRI had been launched, he and the Director of RussiaÂs Federal Atomic 
Energy Agency, Mr. Rumyantsev, had signed an agreement relating to the Russian research reactor 
fuel return programme. Pursuant to that agreement, more than a dozen countries were now eligible to 
receive, from the United States and other countries, financial and technical assistance in shipping their 
fresh and spent research reactor fuel to Russia for safe and secure management. 
91. In July, the United States and Romania had signed an agreement to facilitate the return of spent 
HEU fuel to Russia. In August, the United States had cooperated with Germany on the return of 
US-origin material from three research reactors in Germany to the United States. On 9 September, 
weapons-usable fresh HEU had been repatriated from Uzbekistan to Russia. Clearly, progress in 
securing dangerous material was being made within months Â not, as some had predicted, only in the 
course of decades. 
92. In addition, significant non-proliferation success had been achieved in the case of the Libyan 
Arab Jamahiriya, which had voluntarily abandoned its pursuit of nuclear weapons, permitted Agency 
inspections and facilitated the removal of its nuclear weapons components. LibyaÂs actions and the 
international communityÂs positive response demonstrated that the path towards international 
acceptance and mutually beneficial partnership was a straightforward one. Cooperating with the 
Agency in its non-proliferation efforts did not mean that the access of a country to energy or the 
countryÂs political sovereignty would be undermined. Rather, such cooperation opened the door for 
international support and led to the provision of tangible benefits by the world community, which was 
eager to respond to positive action. 
93. He hoped that such cooperation would ultimately be forthcoming from the Islamic Republic of 
Iran. As a party to the NPT, Iran had accepted legally binding obligations. For almost 20 years, 
however, it had acted in a manner contrary to those obligations, secretly building sensitive nuclear fuel 
cycle facilities for weapons purposes. The Board of Governors had said that Iran must cease its pursuit 
of nuclear weapons, suspend its enrichment activities and answer all of the BoardÂs questions. It was 
essential that Iran now cooperate fully and immediately with the Agency as requested. 
94. Since September 2001, the world community had come to understand more clearly the threats 
posed by international terrorism. For its part, the United States had realized that there was a need to do 
more to control nuclear technologies, and it was doing more. In February, President Bush had called 
for strengthening of the laws and international controls introduced for the purpose of preventing 
proliferation and had proposed that the Security Council require all States to criminalize proliferation, 
enact strict export controls and secure all sensitive materials within their borders. He had noted that 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 14 

there was a consensus among nations that proliferation could not be tolerated, but had emphasized that 
such consensus meant little unless it was translated into action. He had proposed seven measures for 
strengthening the international efforts being made to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction Â measures addressing the urgent need to step up law enforcement against proliferators, 
to increase assistance with the securing of deadly materials, to tighten up the controls on nuclear 
transfers and to enhance the ability of the Agency to fulfil its verification mission. 

95. Furthermore, the United States and its G-8 and European partners had proposed several 
measures for strengthening the Nuclear Suppliers Group and Agency controls. They were calling for: 
universal adherence to the additional protocol, which would mean the reporting of all imports and 
exports of items on the Nuclear Suppliers GroupÂs Âtrigger listÂ and would provide the Agency with an 
important tool for ensuring that safeguarded nuclear activities remained peaceful and were not used as 
a cover for illegitimate activities; establishment of the additional protocol as an essential new standard 
in the field of nuclear supply; the enactment of strict controls on the spread of enrichment and 
reprocessing technology; and the creation of a special Board committee focusing on safeguards and 
the establishment of the principle that States under investigation should not pass judgement on their 
own cases in the Board or the special committee. 
96. Besides the focus on nuclear technology, steps had been and were being taken to substantially 
improve the security of nuclear materials. For example, the timeline for securing 600 metric tons of 
weapons-usable material in Russia and the Newly Independent States had been accelerated and site 
security was being upgraded in cooperation with RussiaÂs Navy and Strategic Rocket Forces. 
97. In that connection, he hoped that the process of amending the Convention on the Physical 
Protection of Nuclear Material would be completed soon. 
98. The AgencyÂs safeguards needed to be made more focused, flexible and effective, with new 
technologies used for detecting undeclared materials and activities. 
99. It was also important, as President Bush had stressed and the discovery of the A.Q. Khan 
network had shown, to pay more attention to the people with access to nuclear materials and 
technologies. From the fact that there were individual profiteers trading in nuclear weapon designs and 
the associated equipment it was clear that the nuclear threat did not derive from sovereign States 
alone. A.Q. KahnÂs network had been broken up and, working with others, the United States was in 
hot pursuit of the remaining elements. Recently, authorities in South Africa had discovered eleven 
hidden containers with uranium enrichment equipment components Â a discovery related to recent 
arrests made by German and Swiss authorities. 
100. Both in the United States and in other countries, there had been cases of individuals releasing 
highly sensitive information on nuclear technology. In confronting that challenge, it was important to 
remember that the overwhelming majority of those working in the nuclear sector were honest and 
hardworking. However, the possibility of some individuals abusing their positions for illicit purposes 
Â because of their political beliefs, because of financial need, because they were being coerced or for 
some other reason Â could not be ignored. States must confront the challenge individually and, 
through the Agency, collectively. 
101. The United States was proposing to cooperate with other Member States in bringing nuclear 
industry representatives and government representatives together for the purpose of ensuring that 
export control laws were complied with and that appropriate enforcement action was taken when they 
were not. Such a partnership would seek to thwart the black market trade in the constituent parts of 
humankindÂs most deadly technology while helping to make the benefits of that technology available 
to all those wishing to use it responsibly. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 15 

102. Working together, countries could build a global commercial environment that would protect 
competitive advantage and at the same time make the business community more aware of its 
responsibilities. However, the entire nuclear industry would had to cooperate Â particularly uranium 
miners and millers, reactor designers and builders, nuclear fuel fabricators and suppliers, nuclear fuel 
service providers and providers of dual-use technologies needed in the nuclear fuel cycle, as they were 
the targets of black marketeers. They would have to be involved in the effort to develop best practices, 
in order to protect themselves and the world at large. 
103. To expedite that effort , the United States Department of Energy would assist the Secretariat and 
Member States in countering criminal networks and also assist the Secretariat in helping Member 
States to enhance their export controls and regulatory infrastructures. Ultimately, however, the effort 
would have to be a global one, for the challenge was a global one Â to prevent the proliferation of 
nuclear materials, technology and expertise and thereby deny nuclear weapons to madmen and 
murderers. 
104. It was difficult to conceive of a more urgent task given the carnage and devastation inflicted by 
terrorists in so many parts of the world. By attacking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the 
terrorists had revealed the scope of their ambition; by targeting children in Beslan they had revealed 
the depth of their depravity. 
105. It was to be hoped that the day would never come when terrorists carried out an attack with a 
nuclear weapon. However, hope was not enough. All States should cooperate more closely and work 
tirelessly in order to ensure that such a day never came. 
106. Mr. DE VISSER (Netherlands), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that the 
candidate countries Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia, the countries of the Stabilization and 
Association Process Â Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro Â and Iceland and Norway aligned themselves with the 
statement which he was about to make. 
107. The European Union welcomed the fact that the General Conference had approved the Republic 
of Chad, the Togolese Republic and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for membership of the 
Agency. 
108. In June 2003, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union (EU) had reiterated 
their commitment to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by deterring, halting 
and Â where possible Â reversing the expansion of proliferation programmes worldwide. In 
December 2003, they had agreed on the EU Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass 
Destruction1, which reflected their conviction that a multilateral approach to security was the best way 
of maintaining international peace and stability. 
109. In June 2004, the European Union had noted that the objectives of the Proliferation Security 
Initiative complemented the objectives of the EU Strategy. 
110. In April 2004, the European Union had welcomed Security Council resolution 1540, which it 
would like to see fully implemented by all States. It looked forward to fruitful cooperation between the 
Agency and the committee established pursuant to that resolution. 
111. The European Union continued to regard the NPT as the cornerstone of the global nonproliferation 
regime and its Article VI as the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. It 
considered a nuclear non-proliferation regime of universal character and supported by a strong system 
See document INFCIRC/631. 


GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 16 

of international safeguards to be a prerequisite for collective security. Recent challenges to the nonproliferation 
regime had emphasized the need to strive for universal adherence to and for full 
compliance with the NPT. The European Union, which was fully committed to the NPT and the three 
mutually reinforcing pillars on which it was based, would continue its efforts to ensure that the 
authority and integrity of the NPT were maintained. 

112. The international safeguards system of the Agency was a technical instrument essential for 
attainment of the political goal of sustaining an environment in which there could be peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy without the diversion of nuclear material and the concealment of nuclear activities for 
nuclear weapons development purposes. 
113. At the third session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 NPT Review Conference, held in 
April 2004, the responsibility of the Agency to further strengthen its international safeguards system 
had been strongly underlined. The member countries of the European Union recognized the continuing 
need for a properly funded safeguards system that was both effective and cost-efficient, and therefore 
credible, robust and complied with. 
114. The universal conclusion and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and of 
additional protocols to them were a prerequisite for a credible safeguards system. In particular, the 
measures provided for in additional protocols were crucial to strengthening the AgencyÂs ability to 
detect undeclared nuclear activities and give assurance regarding the absence of such activities. In that 
connection, the European Union agreed with the Director General that additional protocols must 
become standard for all States parties to the NPT. It therefore regretted the fact that the number of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols in force remained well below 
expectations and would like to see many more States bringing comprehensive safeguards agreements 
and additional protocols into force. 
115. The Secretariat was to be commended for stepping up its efforts to encourage and facilitate the 
conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It should continue with 
the qualitative improvement of the safeguards regime by implementing and further developing the 
conceptual framework for integrated safeguards. For its part, the European Union had initiated a series 
of measures to promote the acceptance of additional protocols. 
116. Full compliance with NPT safeguards agreements was fundamental, and challenges to full 
compliance with them should be addressed in a manner that upheld the integrity of the NPT and the 
authority of the AgencyÂs safeguards system, with referral by the Agency to the Security Council 
when necessary. 
117. The European Union, which continued to deplore the announcement made by the Democratic 
PeopleÂs Republic of Korea (DPRK) in January 2003 of its intention to withdraw from the NPT, 
would like to see the DPRK completely, verifiably and irreversibly dismantling any clandestine 
nuclear weapons programme it might have. It remained firmly resolved to help bring about a peaceful 
solution, through negotiations, to the DPRK nuclear issue. It welcomed the dialogue taking place 
within the framework of the Six-Party Talks and looked forward to the fourth round of the Six-Party 
Talks, which had been agreed upon in June 2004. 
118. The DPRK should come unconditionally into full compliance with all its relevant international 
commitments. In particular, it should comply with its NPT safeguards agreement by Â as a first step 
Â allowing the return of Agency inspectors and the re-introduction of the necessary containment and 
surveillance measures at its nuclear facilities and the full implementation of all necessary safeguards 
measures at all times.

119. As regards implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
the European Union was pleased that the Agency seemed to be acquiring an increasingly 
comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of IranÂs nuclear programme. However, it was 
seriously concerned about the number of issues which Â after two years Â were still awaiting 
clarification. While appreciative of the fact that Iran had continued to act as though its additional 
protocol was in force and had been cooperating with the Agency in a manner which enabled the 
Agency to continue its verification activities in most areas, the European Union would like to see Iran 
bringing the additional protocol into force soon. 
120. The European Union was dismayed that Iran had in June 2004 reversed some of its earlier 
decisions regarding the voluntary suspension of its uranium enrichment-related activities Â a 
suspension which the European Union considered to be essential for confidence-building. In the 
European UnionÂs view, the production of feed material was an enrichment-related activity and 
confidence-building was a process on which all parties should embark with good will and with a view 
to achieving a positive outcome beneficial to all. If Iran sincerely wished to enter into a new mode of 
co-operation with the European Union, it should ensure that confidence-building proceeded without 
interruption. Moreover, it should heed the resolution adopted a few days previously by the Board Â 
particularly the part regarding the full suspension of all its enrichment-related activities. 
121. The Agency was to be commended on its preparations for resuming verification activities in 
Iraq as soon as the situation there allowed it to carry out such activities safely and securely. 
122. The European Union had taken note of the fact that the Director General had the previous week, 
in the Board, expressed serious concern about the non-reporting by the Republic of Korea of uranium 
conversion and enrichment and plutonium separation activities which it should have reported pursuant 
to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. In that regard, the additional protocol had demonstrated 
its effectiveness as a verification tool, and the European Union greatly appreciated the promptness 
with which the Secretariat and the Republic of Korea had undertaken to resolve the issue. It expected 
the Republic of Korea to co-operate pro-actively with the Secretariat in resolving the issue and looked 
forward to the BoardÂs consideration of a Secretariat report in November 2004. 
123. The European Union, which had taken note of document GC(48)/18 entitled Application of 
IAEA Safeguards in the Middle East, welcomed the Director GeneralÂs intention to convene a forum 
on the relevance of the experience gained with existing nuclear-weapon-free zones (NWFZs) to the 
establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. 
124. The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction represented a 
challenge of paramount importance to the international community. While primary responsibility for 
nuclear security rested with States, the Agency had an essential role to play in preventing nuclear 
terrorism. Following 11 September 2001, the Agency had with minimum delay reoriented and 
reinforced its activities relevant to protection against nuclear terrorism, and the European Union was 
strongly supporting those activities. It would like to see all Member States making voluntary 
contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund (NSF) and welcomed the thought being given to ways of 
putting the NSF-financed activities on a surer footing. 
125. The Director General and the Secretariat were to be commended for helping Member States to 
establish and maintain stringent security frameworks for nuclear installations and materials. The 
European Union welcomed the progress being made in implementing the nuclear security action plan 
approved by the Board in March 2002 and the important role being played by the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programmes in the upgrading of nuclear safety and security in Member States. 
126. The European Union welcomed the increase to 105 in the number of States parties to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CCPNM) and would like to see all States 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 18 

that had not yet done so acceding to the CCPNM. Also, it was in favour of the convening of a 
diplomatic conference to amend the CCPNM. In the light of the increased threat of nuclear terrorism, 
it was important that the CCPNM be amended soon. 

127. The European Union, which welcomed the adoption of the revised Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, agreed that there was a need to establish adequate national 
arrangements for controlling the import and export of radioactive sources worldwide. In 
December 2003, it had adopted a Directive on the control of high-activity sealed sources and orphan 
sources, which was a legally binding instrument that set up a control system ensuring radioactive 
source traceability within the European Union Â thereby preventing such sources from being lost Â 
and providing for action to recover existing orphan sources. 
128. The European Union would like to see all countries strengthening their regulatory controls of 
the high-risk radioactive sources within their territories and observing the principles contained in the 
Code of Conduct. It stood ready to support the efforts of the Secretariat to assist Member States in 
developing national strategies for the safe and secure management of radioactive sources and to 
cooperate, when and as appropriate, in detecting and locating orphan sources and facilitating their 
subsequent management. 
129. The illicit trade in highly sensitive nuclear technology was a matter of serious concern for the 
European Union, which was committed to strong national and internationally coordinated export 
controls as a complement to NPT obligations. Recent revelations, particularly those regarding the 
A.Q. Khan network, had highlighted the need for all Member States to step up their efforts to tackle 
illicit trafficking and procurement networks and address the issue of the involvement of non-State 
actors in the proliferation of technology related to weapons of mass destruction. The European Union 
welcomed the AgencyÂs activities in support of StatesÂ efforts to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear 
and other radioactive materials and would like to see all States taking appropriate measures to combat 
such illicit trafficking. 
130. The European Union welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative in appointing an international 
expert group to consider possible multinational approaches to the front and back ends of the nuclear 
fuel cycle.2 In its view, the groupÂs final report Â expected in February 2005 Â would be important 
for the consideration of major aspects of nuclear security. Any resulting decisions should be such as 
not to create new dividing lines among States parties to the NPT; they should be balanced and in line 
with the fundamental bargain underlying the NPT. 
131. The European Union greatly appreciated the holding of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative 
PartnersÂ Conference on 18 and 19 September and endorsed the findings. 
132. Although nuclear safety was a national responsibility, international cooperation in the nuclear 
safety area was indispensable. The European Union therefore attached great importance to the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the peer review mechanism for which it provided. It also attached 
great importance to the Joint Convention and considered the first Review Meeting of the Contracting 
Parties Â held in November 2003 Â to have been a success. In its view, peer reviews carried out 
pursuant to the Joint Convention would be important for increasing safety in the management of spent 
nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, and it would like to see many more countries acceding to the Joint 
Convention. Furthermore, the European Union welcomed the adoption by the Board, in March 2004, 
of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. 
See document GOV/OR.1095, para. 55. 


GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 19 

133. It also welcomed the BoardÂs approval in March 2004 of the Action Plan for the Safety of 
Transport of Radioactive Material and hoped that implementation of the Action Plan would help to 
maintain the excellent record of safety in radioactive material transport. The member countries of the 
European Union would continue cooperating with other Agency Member States and with the 
Secretariat in the effort to further improve regulatory and operational practices in the radioactive 
material transport field. The European Union, which would like to see more States making use of 
TranSAS, welcomed the findings and general conclusions of the TranSAS mission to France that had 
taken place in May 2003. 
134. The European Union greatly appreciated the work being done by the International Expert Group 
on Nuclear Liability (INLEX), to which member countries of the European Union were contributing. 
135. The European Union, which welcomed the Action Plan on the Decommissioning of Nuclear 
Facilities approved by the Board in June 2004, hoped that implementation of the Action Plan would 
contribute to the sound planning and management of decommissioning projects. 
136. The European Union was following closely the development of projects relating to innovative 
reactors and fuel cycles that might result in new approaches to safety, non-proliferation and the 
minimization of nuclear waste. 
137. In the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, it had been stated that every effort 
should be made to ensure that the Agency had the financial and human resources necessary for 
carrying out its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation. The European Union welcomed 
the steps being taken by the Secretariat to improve the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in the 
interests both of recipient and of countries, particularly the application of detailed criteria in project 
selection and evaluation. 
138. The European Union also welcomed the increasing emphasis on helping recipient countries to 
improve safety at their nuclear installations Â including ones being decommissioned Â and the 
security of nuclear installations and of nuclear material and waste and other sources of ionizing 
radiation. A beneficial transfer of nuclear knowledge, equipment and material could take place only in 
an environment where nuclear and radiation safety and security were ensured, which meant firm 
commitments by recipient countries. In that connection, cooperation between countries, especially 
within the framework of the AgencyÂs regional assistance programmes, should be encouraged. 
139. The European Union welcomed the efforts of the Director General to increase efficiency and 
effectiveness and hoped that the Secretariat would continue striving for management improvements Â 
inter alia through the clearer definition of cross-cutting activities. In that connection, it attached great 
importance to the recommendations relating to technical cooperation and the interaction between the 
Department of Technical Cooperation and other departments that had been made by the Office of 
Internal Oversight Services and by the previous External Auditor, Sir John Bourn, to whom it was 
grateful for his eight years of valuable service to the Agency. 
140. As regards the financing of the AgencyÂs activities, the package proposal agreed upon by the 
Board in July 2003 had provided for a much-needed increase in resources. The member countries of 
the European Union accounted for a substantial part of the Regular Budget, Nuclear Security Fund and 
TCF contributions, and European Union continued to be of the view that commitment to the work of 
the Agency was expressed Â inter alia Â by the fulfilment, at least, of financial obligations vis-Ã -vis 
the Agency. A situation where some Member States allowed arrears to accumulate and thus let others 
finance the work of the Agency was unsustainable. 
141. In the European UnionÂs view, if the agreements reached regarding the TCF targets for 2005 
and 2006, national participation costs (NPCs) and the rate of attainment were honoured by Member 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 20 

States, adequate funding for technical cooperation in the next few years would be assured. The 
Secretariat should explore ways of ensuring that technical cooperation monies were spent first and 
foremost in those developing Member States which had contributed to the TCF and had no NPC or 
assessed programme cost arrears. 

142. The European Union looked forward to early harmonization of the Regular Budget programme 
cycle and the technical cooperation programme cycle. 
143. In an increasingly interdependent world, States had not only to ensure their own and each 
otherÂs nuclear security and safety, but also to continue ensuring Â and enhancing Â the access of 
everyone to the benefits of the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy. The Agency was uniquely placed 
to facilitate the attainment of those goals, and it could count on strong support from the European 
Union. 
144. Ms. XINGWANA (South Africa), congratulating Chad, Togo and Mauritania on being 
approved for membership of the Agency, expressed the hope that the increased representation of 
African countries would enable Africa to make a further meaningful contribution to the fulfilment of 
the AgencyÂs statutory mandate. 
145. South Africa, which was currently celebrating ten years of democracy and freedom from 
oppression, had, since its reintegration into the global community, adopted a principled policy 
regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. It had consistently called for universal 
application of the provisions of the NPT, mindful of the bargain struck during the negotiation of the 
NPT whereby the non-nuclear-weapon States parties, while undertaking to forgo nuclear weapons, 
would have the inalienable right to utilize the atom for peaceful purposes. 
146. At a time of escalating terrorism and of attempts by some to undermine international efforts to 
promote global peace and security, the Agency remained pivotal not only to the cause of Atoms for 
Peace, but also to non-proliferation as a means of ridding the world of weapons of mass destruction. In 
South AfricaÂs view, the very existence of such weapons constituted a major threat to humanity, and 
the only real guarantee of the non-use of nuclear weapons was their complete elimination for all time. 
During his State of the Nation address earlier that year, President Thabo Mbeki had committed South 
Africa to securing a successful outcome of the 2005 NPT Review Conference. South Africa would 
work relentlessly to secure a successful outcome and hoped that all States parties to the NPT would 
cooperate in the interests of strengthening the NPT. 
147. South Africa, which was confident that the Secretariat would enable Member States to rise to 
the challenges faced by them, was grateful to the Director General for his efforts to increase the 
efficiency of the Secretariat, ensuring that it remained responsive to the needs of Member States. It 
was also grateful to the members of the Secretariat for their professionalism and their dedication to the 
cause of Atoms for Peace. It would remain steadfast in its commitment to the work of the Agency and 
the ideals embodied in the Statute. 
148. Her country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance with the establishment of a regional 
centre for radiation protection training in South Africa and welcomed the reinstatement of the 
postgraduate education courses in radiation protection in South Africa, from which many African 
countries would benefit. 
149. South Africa was continuing to play a leading role in AFRA Â for example, by organizing 
training courses and by making specialist teams available for missions throughout the African 
continent. Activities designed to enhance the self-reliance of national nuclear institutions in Africa 
would continue to receive its special attention. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 21 

150. South Africa, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs Technical Cooperation Strategy, 
believed that the Agency, through its technical cooperation activities, could make a substantial 
contribution to the ongoing efforts to achieve accelerated but sustainable socio-economic development 
in Africa in line with the Millennium Development Goals and with the strategic objectives of NEPAD. 
151. In pursuing the peaceful utilization of nuclear technology, the South African Government was 
committed to the empowerment of women so that they could participate meaningfully at all levels of 
the nuclear sector. The South African Women in Nuclear (WINSA) had developed into a formidable 
organization which was ensuring that gender equity existed in practice. 
152. South Africa was continuing its Agency-supported efforts to develop technology for the safe 
and secure management of radioactive sources in developing countries. A project for demonstrating 
the suitability of the borehole disposal of disused sealed radioactive sources was nearing completion, 
and South Africa was sure that the transfer of the technology to interested parties would commence 
within the next year. An Agency-supported project on the conditioning and safe storage of spent highactivity 
radioactive sources which could pose a security and safety risk had reached the stage where a 
prototype facility was being constructed and would be tested in the near future. 
153. On 4 April 1984, the Koeberg nuclear power station had first fed electricity into the national 
grid, and the power station had been operating without any major incidents since then. Also, it held the 
South African record for uninterrupted power plant operation: 454 days. 
154. South Africa attached great importance to the AgencyÂs nuclear, radiation, transport and waste 
safety programmes, and experts from South Africa were participating in the work of NUSSC, RASSC, 
TRANSSC and WASSC. It welcomed the Secretariat initiatives designed to promote the use of 
Agency safety standards, particularly by Member States just developing nuclear and radiation safety 
infrastructures. 
155. South Africa had compiled Â and transmitted to the Secretariat Â a national report for 
consideration during the third Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, due to take place in April 2005. In compiling the report, it had taken account of the general 
observations, recommendations and conclusions contained in the report on the second Review 
Meeting and of relevant changes in the management of nuclear safety in South Africa. 
156. South Africa, which welcomed the progress made in implementing the AgencyÂs Plan of Action 
to combat nuclear terrorism, was supporting the global anti-terrorism campaign under way within the 
United Nations framework and contributing to the efforts of regional organizations and of 
international organizations like the Agency in that connection. 
157. Given its principled policy regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, South 
Africa, which also had concerns relating to the proliferation of conventional weapons, was fully 
committed to prohibiting the manufacture, acquisition, transport and use of weapons mass destruction 
and their means of delivery, not only by States but also by non-State actors. It considered effective 
systems of nuclear material accountancy and control to be essential for maintaining the security of and 
preventing illicit trafficking in such material. 
158. As regards innovative nuclear technology, licensing activities relating to the Pebble Bed 
Modular Reactor (PBMR) had continued. South AfricaÂs regulatory authority was currently reviewing 
the PBMR safety case as part of a comprehensive and systematic licensing process in which public 
participation was provided for. 
159. South Africa was now a member of INPRO, the success of which it would endeavour to help 
ensure. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 22 

160. As regards the attainment of safeguards inspection goals in South Africa, further to what had 
been reported by the delegate of South Africa to the General Conference in 20023 her country had 
made excellent progress in characterizing nuclear material in waste drums. Scanning of the waste 
drums in question, containing HEU-contaminated material, would be completed by the end of 
October 2004. 
161. In September 2003, an agreement relating to a Member State Support Programme (MSSP) for 
Agency safeguards had been entered into between South Africa and the Agency. The main focus of 
the MSSP was initially on the development of safeguards technology for the PBMR by South Africa in 
cooperation with other Member States and the Secretariat. Currently, two projects were proceeding as 
planned. 
162. South Africa, which had consistently called for the universal implementation of additional 
protocols, was particularly pleased with the dramatic increase in the number of African countries 
which had signed additional protocols and hoped that the additional protocols in question would be 
ratified soon. It would like to see all Member States that had not already done so signing and ratifying 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols with a minimum of delay. 
163. South Africa continued to be concerned at the lack of progress regarding the application of fullscope 
Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East. At the same time, it was pleased 
that the United Arab Emirates had in October 2003 brought into force a comprehensive safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. It would like to see all countries in the region that had not already done 
so, including the eight Middle East States parties to the NPT that had not already done so, bringing 
into force comprehensive safeguards agreements without further delay. 
164. South Africa hoped that the envisaged Forum on Experience of Possible Relevance to the 
Creation of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East would, through an exchange of 
information on relevant experience gained with NWFZs in other regions, contribute to the efforts 
under way in the Middle East region to establish there an NWFZ tailored to its realities. 
165. In conclusion, South Africa believed that the AgencyÂs mandate was far too important to be 
diluted by narrow interests. It was incumbent upon everyone to continue upholding the principles on 
which the Agency was founded. 
166. Mr. AGHAZADEH (Islamic Republic of Iran), having welcomed the General ConferenceÂs 
approval of Chad, Togo and Mauritania for membership of the Agency, recalled that Article II of the 
Statute required the Agency to seek Âto accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to 
peace, health and prosperity throughout the worldÂ and that the Agency was authorized by Article III 
to Âencourage and assist research on, and development and practical application of, atomic energy for 
peaceful purposesÂ. 
167. Under Article IV of the NPT, all parties undertook Âto facilitate, and had the right to participate 
in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information 
for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.Â It was essential to note that, according to the same article, 
nothing in the NPT should be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all parties to it to develop 
research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination. 
168. A fair review of developments since the Agency had been established and the NPT had entered 
into force revealed the regrettable fact that the promotional provisions of the Statute and the NPT had 
not been implemented, either in the letter or in the spirit. The Islamic Republic of Iran had therefore 
See document GC(46)/OR.1, para. 108. 


GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 23 

had no choice but to depend on its own resources and manpower in exercising its inalienable right to 
use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 

169. For more than a quarter of a century, despite sanctions, discrimination, deprivation and an 
eight-year imposed war, his country had stood on its own feet and struggled for independence and 
sustainable development. Unjustified continuous sanctions relating to items important for the peaceful 
utilization of nuclear energy, and even to items of humanitarian importance, had left the Islamic 
Republic of Iran with no option but national mobilization for self-sufficiency. Remarkable 
achievements relating to various peaceful applications of nuclear technology and to various stages of 
nuclear fuel production were the result of decades of huge investment by his country and of huge 
scientific efforts by outstanding Iranian experts. The Islamic Republic of Iran would not permit any 
interruption in or interference with its indigenous nuclear programme, which was purely peaceful and 
which it would not give up at any price. 
170. Some provisions of the resolution adopted by the Board of Governors on 18 September 2004 
were contrary to the letter and spirit of the Statute and the NPT, and some called for action going 
beyond the fulfilment of safeguards obligations. In the resolution, there was no clear distinction 
between voluntary and obligatory measures. Moreover, calling upon a Member State to suspend or 
stop activities such as uranium conversion and enrichment and the construction of a research reactor 
designed to produce radioisotopes for use in medicine, agriculture and industry Â activities in no way 
prohibited by the Statute and the NPT Â would only lower the esteem in which the Agency, which 
had been established to promote peaceful applications of nuclear energy, was held. The inalienable 
rights of Member States were at stake. 
171. The international community could rest assured that all of his countryÂs nuclear activities were 
for peaceful purposes. At the same time, it should know that his country was determined to continue 
those activities without interruption, under the surveillance of the Agency in accordance with its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency and the additional protocol thereto. 
172. Mr. MOTEGI (Japan), having welcomed the General ConferenceÂs approval of Chad, Togo and 
Mauritania for membership of the Agency, said that the international nuclear non-proliferation regime 
was facing serious challenges. The DPRK nuclear issue and other nuclear non-proliferation issues had 
become more acute, especially since the discovery of the existence of an underground nuclear 
proliferation network. Strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime had become one of the most 
important tasks facing the international community. 
173. At the same time, the importance of nuclear power as an energy source that was not only stable 
but also helping to prevent global warming had increased. Moreover, the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy in areas such as medicine, agriculture and industry were contributing to social and economic 
development. 
174. Japan therefore believed that the AgencyÂs role in both strengthening the international nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and promoting peaceful uses of nuclear energy was becoming increasingly 
important. Strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime was one of the most important pillars of 
his countryÂs foreign policy. The next NPT Review Conference was due to take place in 2005, the 
60th anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan. In 2005, the international community 
would be presented with an opportunity to renew its commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and 
nuclear disarmament. 
175. For its part, his country, the only country to have been a victim of atomic bombs, would 
continue to uphold its three non-nuclear principles Â not possessing nuclear weapons, not producing 
them and not permitting their introduction into Japan. 

GC(48)/OR.1 
20 September 2004, Page 24 

176. It was the responsibility of the entire international community to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime by closing all loopholes. Japan shared the concerns reflected in the 
non-proliferation proposals put forward by President Bush of the United States of America and in the 
Director GeneralÂs initiative regarding multilateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle. However, 
account would have to be taken of peopleÂs desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 
177. Strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system was essential for strengthening the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. Japan was therefore continuing to promote the universalization of model 
protocols. So far, however, only 60 States had additional protocols in force Â an unsatisfactory 
situation. Japan would like to see all States which had not yet done so bringing additional protocols 
with a minimum of delay. 
178. The implementation of integrated safeguards in Japan had begun the previous week Â for the 
first time in a country with large-scale nuclear activities. It was hoped that a good example would be 
set for other countries, and also that the implementation of integrated safeguards would lead to the 
more efficient use of the AgencyÂs limited resources. 
179. The DPRKÂs nuclear programme posed not only a threat to peace and stability in north-east 
Asia, but also a challenge to the international non-proliferation regime. The DPRK should comply 
fully with all its obligations under the NPT and other relevant international agreements and 
immediately dismantle all its nuclear programmes under credible international verification. It was 
essential that a peaceful solution to the DPRK nuclear issue be achieved through the Six-Party Talks 
process, and Japan hoped that the fourth round of Six-Party Talks would be held soon. 
180. His country, which was concerned about the fact that there were still unresolved issues relating 
to the undeclared nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran, had been urging Iran to take the 
steps which the Board had called for in various resolutions, including the one adopted on 
18 September 2004. In order to dispel international concerns about its nuclear activities, Iran needed to 
be more transparent, and prompt ratification of the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement 
with the Agency would be helpful in that connection. 
181. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was to be commended for its decision to abandon its programme 
for the development of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, and for increasing its 
cooperation with the international community. Japan hoped that other countries of nuclear 
proliferation concern would follow LibyaÂs example. 
182. Japan understood that the Republic of Korea was cooperating with the Agency in a transparent 
manner, and it appreciated that countryÂs attitude. At the same time, with the importance attached by it 
to maintaining the credibility of the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards system, it was paying close 
attention to what the Director General had described as Âa matter of serious concernÂ. Japan expected 
the Republic of Korea to continue cooperating with the Agency in a transparent manner, in order that 
the matter might be clarified. 
183. Since the tragic events of 11 September 2001, the threat of nuclear terrorism had become an 
important issue for the international community. In JapanÂs opinion, the Secretariat was to be 
commended for the initiatives launched by it in that connection. His country hoped that a conference 
to amend the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material would take place soon, and it 
would continue participating in the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) in an appropriate 
manner, bearing in mind the findings of the GTRI PartnersÂ Conference held on 18 and 
19 September 2004. 
184. The Agency was playing a significant role in the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, 
particularly by promoting medical, agricultural, industrial and other applications of radioisotopes in 

GC(48)/OR.1

developing countries through its technical cooperation programmes. Japan had consistently paid its 
full TCF target share, and it would like to see all other Member States doing the same. It would also 
like to see all recipient countries acting on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility. 

185. Nuclear power was very important for Japan, which was continuing to develop a nuclear fuel 
cycle. His country was currently drawing up a long-term nuclear energy R&D programme for which it 
was seeking to obtain public acceptance through the involvement of all stakeholders. 
186. Japan attached great importance to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor 
(ITER) project and hoped that the six ITER project parties would soon arrive at a consensus decision 
on a site. Its offer to host the ITER project at a site near the town of Rokkasho still stood. 
187. In August 2004, an accident involving a gush of steam due to a pipe burst had occurred at a 
Japanese nuclear power plant. It had not been a nuclear accident, but, with workforce fatalities, it had 
certainly been a tragedy. His country, which was fully aware of the importance of safety at nuclear 
power plants, would do everything necessary in order to prevent similar accidents from occurring. 
Also, it would continue to cooperate with the Agency in its nuclear safety initiatives. 
188. The smooth transport of radioactive materials was indispensable for the peaceful utilization of 
nuclear energy. As regards the international transport of such materials, which was based on the right 
of free navigation provided for in international law, Japan was taking the most stringent safety 
measures in accordance with standards set by the relevant international organizations Â and it had 
requested an Agency TranSAS mission. 
189. The Agency needed adequate financial resources if it was to carry out the role expected of it. 
Japan had accordingly supported acceptance of the Regular Budget for 2005, including the envisaged 
increase in resources for safeguards. However, it would like the Secretariat to continue its efforts to 
improve efficiency in budget management, by prioritizing projects and reducing costs. 
Â Restoration of voting rights 
190. The PRESIDENT drew attention to the Statement of Financial Contributions to the Agency as 
at 17 September 2004, contained in document GC(48)/INF/14, which included a table indicating those 
Member States which had lost their voting rights by virtue of application of Article XIX.A of the 
Statute. He said that communications had been received from four of those States Â Afghanistan, 
Armenia, Iraq and Kazakhstan Â requesting that their voting rights be restored. Those 
communications were contained in documents GC(48)/INF/12, INF/11, INF/9 and INF/10 
respectively. He proposed that, in accordance with past practice, the requests be referred to the 
General Committee for initial consideration. 
191. The PresidentÂs proposal was accepted. 
The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.

General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (continued) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Mr. RUMYANTSEV (Russian Federation) said that the past year had been a difficult one and 
the world was facing new challenges. Only a month before, a terrible tragedy had taken place in the 
southern Russian town of Beslan. It was still difficult to comprehend such an appalling crime against 
the most defenceless in society Â children. That and other acts underlined the barbarism and 
inhumanity of terrorism, which posed a threat to security, democratic values and fundamental human 
rights and freedoms. Those acts had demonstrated once again that terrorism knew no bounds and had 
no religious or moral principles. The international community should unite in the fight against it. The 
threat would increase many times over if terrorists were able to get their hands on WMDs. Nuclear 
terrorism and the covert spread of nuclear material and technologies were a real risk that Russia, 
together with other countries, was making every effort to counter. His country had been one of the 
initiators of Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation, which aimed to strengthen 
international cooperation in the fight against illegal trafficking in WMDs, their means of delivery and 
the technologies and materials associated with their production. 
2. In June 2004, the G-8 Sea Island Summit had adopted an action plan on non-proliferation, 
containing a list of measures aimed at strengthening international WMD non-proliferation regimes and 
preventing WMDs and their components from falling into the hands of terrorists. Particular stress was 
placed on exercising restraint with regard to the export of sensitive nuclear technologies, equipment 
and materials. The plan also referred to the role of the Agency in countering the new threats and 
challenges of terrorism, including the disclosure of undeclared uranium enrichment activities in States 
Party to the NPT. His delegation noted that the Director General had recently established a group of 
experts to examine possible solutions to problems concerning sensitive elements of the nuclear fuel 
cycle. Another important step was the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, proposed in May 2004 by 
the United States Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative 
International PartnersÂ Conference, held recently and organized by the Russian Federation, the United 
States of America and the Agency, had demonstrated the importance and timeliness of that initiative. 
The Russian Federation and the United States were already working together on several programmes 
in that connection. 
3. In May 2004, a United States-Russia agreement on cooperation for the repatriation of 
Russian/Soviet produced research reactor fuel to the Russian Federation had been signed in Moscow. 
Implementation of the agreement would facilitate nuclear non-proliferation efforts and make high 
enriched materials inaccessible for illegal trafficking. So far, fresh fuel had been transferred from 
research reactors in Serbia and Montenegro, Romania, Bulgaria, Libya and Uzbekistan, and transfer 
from Ukraine and the Czech Republic was under discussion. Spent fuel transfer from Uzbekistan and 
Serbia and Montenegro was under way. The Russian Federation was actively participating in 
implementing an Agency-Russia-United States initiative to improve the security of radioactive sources 
in countries of the former Soviet Union. 
4. The AgencyÂs safeguards system had been tested over the past year, and the Agency had 
demonstrated its ability to fulfil its statutory functions by carrying out highly professional inspections. 
The revelation of a network of firms involved in illicit trading in nuclear materials, equipment and 
technologies required decisive action from the international community, principally to strengthen the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system. The additional protocol was the most effective way to increase the 
transparency of StatesÂ nuclear activities and his delegation urged all countries that had not done so to 
sign one at the earliest opportunity. 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 2 

5. The year 2004 marked the 50th anniversary of the start-up of the worldÂs first nuclear power 
plant in Obninsk. To celebrate the event, the International Conference on Fifty Years of Nuclear 
Power Â the Next Fifty Years had been organized by the Agency and the Federal Atomic Energy 
Agency in Moscow, with the participation of more than 400 people from 39 countries, including the 
Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Fradkov, and the AgencyÂs Director General. The President of the 
Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, had noted in the address he had sent to the Conference that atomic 
energy was a growing sector which actively promoted socio-economic progress in many States. The 
first nuclear power plant may have had a small output by modern standards, but it had been enough to 
pave the way for the large-scale use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Fifty years on, nuclear 
power was undoubtedly a highly developed and technologically advanced field, supplying around 17% 
of the worldÂs electricity. Since 1954, atomic energy had expanded and in some countries now made a 
significant contribution. Work was being carried out on renewing licences for extending the operating 
lifetime of nuclear power plants, and innovative reactor designs with improved economic and safety 
performance indicators had been developed. Many countries were planning to expand their nuclear 
power programmes based on existing designs. It had been suggested at the Conference that the Agency 
undertake a comparative study of the risk factors associated with electricity generation from various 
sources worldwide, which would provide valuable information on future requirements and help to 
define a strategy for global energy development. The ConferenceÂs main conclusion had been that 
nuclear energy could and should become the basis of an energy system, for sustainable, 
environmentally friendly, economically viable and socially acceptable human development in the 21st 
century. 
6. Scientific research and experimental design work on new atomic energy systems would be most 
effective if carried out on the basis of international cooperation, combining the resources of all 
participating States. The future of atomic energy depended on successful international cooperation 
under the auspices of the Agency, which was uniquely placed to undertake that task. At his meeting 
with the Director General in June 2004 in Moscow, President Putin had underlined the importance that 
the Russian Federation attached to the Agency. He had said that Russia had always supported its 
activities, that it had become a prestigious and powerful organization fulfilling a vital role and 
exercising great authority, and that it acted professionally and without political motivation. Russia 
would continue to do its utmost to support the Agency. 
7. The efforts aimed at increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the AgencyÂs safeguards 
system and to develop integrated safeguards were important. The Russian Federation was willing to 
participate in establishing a special safeguards committee reporting to the Board of Governors. 
8. As part of RussiaÂs process of administrative reform, the former Ministry for Atomic Energy 
(Minatom) and the Federal Nuclear and Radiation Safety Authority (Gosatomnadzor) had been 
replaced by the Federal Atomic Energy Agency (Rosatom) and the Federal Service for Environmental, 
Technological and Nuclear Supervision (Rostekhnadzor), respectively. Greater vigilance than ever 
would be exercised over all issues connected with the safe use of atomic energy. Also, his country 
would continue to support all Agency efforts to strengthen international cooperation on nuclear and 
radiation safety. Of particular importance in that regard was the safety of radioactive sources and the 
strengthening of national controls over licensing and permits for work involving such sources and their 
production, accounting systems, transport, and import and export. Russia had informed the Agency in 
writing of its political commitment to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and supported the AgencyÂs efforts to develop a global export control regime for radioactive 
sources. 
9. All countries needed to preserve and use their accumulated knowledge of nuclear technologies 
in the establishment of nuclear energy systems and the associated safety culture. He expressed 
satisfaction with the AgencyÂs activities to preserve nuclear knowledge and said that Russia was 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 3 

collaborating in a number of projects on that topic with the Agency. That work had begun well, 
judging by the results not only of the International Conference on Nuclear Knowledge Management: 
Strategies, Information Management and Human Resource Development, held in Saclay, France from 
7 to 10 September 2004, but also of the AgencyÂs working groups on the subject. His country 
supported international efforts aimed at developing international criteria and standards for nuclear 
education and also the World Nuclear University. 

10. The first nuclear power plant with its five megawatt output had become the symbol of a new 
energy era in the 20th century. Large-scale peaceful use of atomic energy could and should become 
the symbol of the 21st century. 
11. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China) said that, in the 20 years since his country had joined the Agency, 
it had actively supported the AgencyÂs activities to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and 
safeguards in accordance with the Statute. It had cooperated with the Agency and its Member States in 
the areas of nuclear power, the nuclear fuel cycle, nuclear safety, radiation protection, nuclear 
technology applications and training. It was estimated that, by 2003, China had sent more 
than 2000 people to other Member States for training and scientific visits and had received much 
expert help through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. That had had a positive impact on 
nuclear power development, the establishment and improvement of a nuclear safety regulatory system 
and the application of nuclear technologies in his country. In return, China made very effort to support 
Agency activities by means of human, material and financial resources. Also, by the end of 2003, it 
had made voluntary contributions totalling $13 million, had provided training for and expert services 
to other Member States and hosted more than 200 Agency meetings. It had actively participated in 
RCA activities and was the leading country in nuclear agronomy cooperation, contributing to regional 
development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
12. He announced that his Government had decided to make an extrabudgetary contribution to the 
Agency of $1 million in support of technical cooperation for developing countries and for 
strengthening nuclear security. 
13. China was an unswerving supporter of the non-proliferation of WMDs, including nuclear 
weapons and their means of delivery, as a means of maintaining international and regional peace and 
stability. It was in favour of the comprehensive ban and complete destruction of nuclear weapons and 
took an active part in international cooperation aimed at non-proliferation. In recent years, his 
Government had taken effective measures to prevent proliferation and nuclear terrorist activities. 
14. China supported the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
safeguards regime. In 2002, it had been the first nuclear-weapon State to ratify an additional protocol 
to its safeguards agreement and, in 2003, it had produced a White Paper entitled ChinaÂs Nonproliferation 
Policies and Measures. Having confirmed its commitment to the Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources in March 2004, China had drawn up corresponding laws 
and regulations and established a national regulatory system. It had played a constructive role in 
drafting revisions to the CPPNM and hoped that signatory States would soon reach agreement on 
those amendments. 
15. ChinaÂs accession to the NSG in May 2004 was further evidence of its support for a multilateral 
non-proliferation regime. It had joined all the relevant international organizations and had signed all 
the international treaties and conventions with respect to nuclear non-proliferation. China would fulfil 
its international commitments conscientiously and ensure that its domestic laws were in compliance 
with international practice. That included its regulations on nuclear materials export control and on 
nuclear dual-use materials and related technology export control, which were currently under revision.

16. With regard to the nuclear issues in the DPRK and the Islamic Republic of Iran, China 
maintained that they should be resolved peacefully through diplomatic and cooperative means. China 
believed that the Korean Peninsula should be free from nuclear weapons in order to ensure peace and 
stability. A peaceful settlement of the issue through dialogue and negotiations would satisfy the 
DPRKÂs legitimate concerns for safety and was in the interests of not only those directly involved but 
also the region and the international community. His Government would continue its efforts to 
promote the six-party talks on the matter. With regard to Iran, China believed that the matter should be 
resolved, through dialogue, in the framework of the Agency. 
17. Nuclear power was an important part of ChinaÂs energy strategy and its share of the total energy 
supply was increasing. By July 2004, there were 9 units in operation on mainland China, with a total 
installed capacity of 7010 MW(e). Construction of the Tianwan nuclear power plant, scheduled to go 
into operation in 2005, would raise that capacity to 9130 MW(e). Nuclear power accounted for more 
than 13% of the total electricity supply in the Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces and had made a 
considerable contribution to local economic and social development. The units were operating under 
good safety conditions and radiation in the surrounding areas had been kept to the natural background 
level. In an attempt to accelerate nuclear power development, the Chinese Government had recently 
approved the construction of two more 1000 MW(e) PWR units each in Sanmen, in the Zhejiang 
province, and Lingao, in the Guadong province. Proposals for the Yangjiang project in Guangdong 
and the expansion of Qinshan Phase II in Zhejiang were under review. Preliminary figures suggested 
that ChinaÂs nuclear power capacity would reach at least 36 000 MW(e) by 2020, accounting for 4% 
of the countryÂs total installed capacity. Nuclear power was becoming particularly important in coastal 
areas where the economy was developed and there was a high demand for electricity. 
18. China planned to adopt advanced technologies to ensure high safety levels and economic 
performance in its nuclear power plants. Although its basic aim was to achieve self-reliance in the 
construction of its large-scale plants, it would look favourably on competitive suppliers from all 
countries. 
19. The worldÂs first nuclear power plant in Obninsk had ushered in the era of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy in the 1950s. The Agency had always played a positive role both in that domain and in 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. China hoped that it would maintain a balanced 
development of both activities as mandated in its Statute so that nuclear energy could continue to 
benefit mankind. 
20. Mr. RUSKO (Slovakia) said that, as the recent terrorist attacks in Spain and the Russian 
Federation had shown, issues relating to international terrorism and WMDs regrettably still dominated 
the international agenda. In spite of the unprecedented efforts of the international community in the 
fight against those threats, there was still a long way to go. 
21. Global non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the fight against nuclear terrorism required 
strong international support, cooperation and a willingness to find solutions. The recent challenges to 
the NPT regime demonstrated that it must be applied universally. Slovakia called on those States not 
party to the NPT to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States. His country continued to support the 
AgencyÂs programme on strengthening the effectiveness and improving the cost efficiency of the 
safeguards system through the development of integrated safeguards. As a new Member State of the 
European Union, Slovakia had completed its constitutional requirements with regard to the entry into 
force of a safeguards agreement and additional protocol. He urged the significant number of States that 
had not yet done so to sign and bring into force safeguards agreements and additional protocols 
without further delay. 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 5 

22. His Government attached great importance to the revision of the CPPNM and welcomed the 
Director GeneralÂs initiative to convene a diplomatic conference with a view to amending that 
Convention. 
23. There were encouraging results with regard to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Many more 
Member States were now recognizing the important role of nuclear energy in ensuring energy 
independence and promoting the health and prosperity of mankind. The AgencyÂs work in that area 
was indispensable. 
24. The safe use of nuclear energy was of the utmost importance and was the responsibility of the 
entire nuclear community. In recent years, regulators and operators had been exchanging experience 
and technical information on nuclear safety related matters in a number of forums. The Agency had a 
crucial role to play in supporting those activities and making its services available to Member States. 
Slovakia supported cooperation by the Agency with other bodies in the United Nations system, with 
institutions of the European Union and with other international organizations, such as the OECD/NEA 
and WANO. 
25. Nuclear energy remained an important source of energy in Slovakia in the medium term and 
safety was a prerequisite for its use. On the basis of operational performance, regulatory assessments 
and inspection results, the national nuclear regulatory authority considered the operation of all nuclear 
installations in Slovakia to be safe, reliable and in line with the relevant regulations and international 
good practices. The Agency was the most appropriate organization for the establishment of safety 
standards and for providing safety services, which ensured essential independent feedback. 
26. In its more than 10 years of Agency membership, Slovakia had participated in a number of 
national, regional and interregional technical cooperation projects. As a new member of the European 
Union, it felt that technical cooperation would remain one of the most important areas of cooperation 
with the Agency and would welcome a transition period of two years within that new framework 
before becoming a donor. As in previous years, Slovakia would continue to provide experts and 
training facilities and accept fellows and scientific visitors sponsored by the Agency. Technical 
cooperation relating to safety, strengthening the regulatory infrastructure, long-term nuclear power 
plant operation, decommissioning and nuclear medicine was an important source of information 
transfer and necessary for strong national development. Slovakia had, in cooperation with the Agency, 
successfully implemented a national project for the development of a nuclear medicine centre and 
would appreciate continued support from the Agency in similar projects that were being planned for 
the future. 
27. Mr. VALECA (Romania) said that nuclear power generation made an important contribution to 
the national electricity supply in his country. To enhance systematic planning in the nuclear sector, his 
Government had adopted a CPF, in line with Agency recommendations. 
28. Economic growth in Romania in recent years would inevitably lead to an increase in demand for 
power and so the Government had important decisions to make about the further development of the 
Cernavoda nuclear power plant. A consortium, comprising Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
(AECL), Ansaldoenergia (Italy) and the Romanian company Nuclearelectrica, was constructing 
Cernavoda Unit 2, which was scheduled to enter commercial operation at the end of 2006. The project 
would be partly financed by a Euratom credit. Nuclear fuel, heavy water supplies and nuclear 
equipment covering over 50% of the investment would be provided from the national infrastructure. It 
was planned to build Cernavoda Unit 3 on the basis of a public-private partnership using bilateral 
financing agreements such as BOT (build-operate-transfer). The first stage of the feasibility study had 
been completed by Nuclearelectrica, AECL, Ansaldoenergia and Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power 
(Republic of Korea), and the second stage was scheduled for mid 2005. As a result of the high 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 6 

standards of nuclear safety achieved at Cernavoda Unit 1, extension of its operating licence had been 
approved. An OSART mission to the plant was planned for 2005 and would be another step towards 
achieving excellence. 

29. Romania, which was concerned about the threat to global security posed by vulnerable nuclear 
and other radioactive material, was determined to participate in all international initiatives to prevent 
terrorism. It would therefore continue to support the actions initiated under the NPT safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols. In that context, Romania endorsed the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative launched by the United States of America and welcomed Agency participation in several 
associated programmes. One such, a footnote-a/ project financed by the United States and the 
Romanian Governments, was for the conversion of the TRIGA research reactor at Pitesti from HEU to 
LEU. Romanian funds for the project were available, a contract had been concluded for the 
manufacture and delivery of the LEU fuel and 400 TRIGA fuel rods were scheduled for delivery 
by 2006. The Pitesti reactor was one of the most powerful TRIGA research reactors in the world used 
in post-irradiation materials research and radioisotope production. Its radioisotope programme for 
medicine and industry had been developed in cooperation with the national laboratories of the 
USDOE. 
30. The decommissioning plan for the Romanian VVR research reactor, which had been shut down 
in 2002, was in progress. The fresh fuel had been shipped to the Russian Federation in 2004 on the 
basis of a successful partnership between the Agency, the United States, the Russian Federation and 
Romania, and an agreement had been signed between the USDOE, the Romanian Nuclear Agency and 
the Romanian regulatory authorities in July 2004 as the first step towards the return of the spent fuel. 
That showed the great potential of international partnership projects. 
31. Expressing gratitude to the Secretariat for the continuous support offered through its technical 
cooperation programme, he said he hoped that the Agency would continue to use Romanian nuclear 
facilities for its cooperation projects. Romania was considering a follow-up to the successful regional 
pilot course on techniques for counteracting nuclear threats that it had organized in conjunction with 
the Agency in February 2003. The course was evidence of RomaniaÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs 
action plan on nuclear terrorism. Also, his country had contributed more than $50 000 to the Nuclear 
Security Fund. 
32. Following the IPPAS mission to Romania, work had started on upgrading its nuclear physical 
protection systems. Also, as a result of the INSARR mission to Romania, a national project on 
research reactor safety had been initiated. 
33. The European UnionÂs approach to nuclear non-proliferation took into account the dynamic, and 
not necessarily purely military, character of the nuclear threat and emphasized the need for a new 
strategic culture in the international problem-solving process. Regional security was a key issue that 
should be achieved through local solutions in the framework of bilateral and regional agreements. 
34. In the light of that, Romania had stepped up its efforts to bring its nuclear legislative framework 
into line with the latest European Union and Agency standards. Its law on nuclear safety had been 
amended so as to allow the establishment of technical support organizations and to create greater 
financial flexibility in using extrabudgetary resources. Also already in place was a law on the 
promotion of nuclear activities and the peaceful use of nuclear energy, which established the 
governmental body for coordinating both internal and external cooperation in the nuclear domain. To 
ensure nuclear and radiation safety it was essential to develop an effective and efficient regulatory 
framework and instruments and to provide the necessary human resources and the associated 
supporting and technical infrastructure. A process was therefore under way, with the support of the 
Agency and the European Union, to strengthen the national regulatory bodyÂs activities. The new 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 7 

national agency for radioactive waste management (ANDRAD), established under a law adopted 
in 2003, was at the institutional development stage. RomaniaÂs nuclear strategy also included 
measures to ensure that its nuclear sector had the human resources it needed, which included graduate 
and post-graduate training programmes. 

35. Finally, he said that Romania would assist and support the Agency with respect to the 
implementation of its additional protocol, which was in force, and any other nuclear non-proliferation 
tasks in accordance with the AgencyÂs Statute. 
36. Mr. AL-ATHEL (Saudi Arabia) welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to preserve nuclear knowledge 
and skills and commended the progress already made in promoting training courses in universities and 
specialized scientific institutions with a view to bringing forth a new generation of professionals in all 
relevant branches. 
37. With regard to nuclear applications, he stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs assistance to 
developing countries in drawing up development plans that focused on promoting technology transfer 
and building scientific, technical and supervisory expertise in such key areas as agriculture, food, 
health care, chemical applications, water supply and environmental protection. He urged the Agency 
to seek more effective ways of identifying the requisite funding sources and to encourage 
Governments to share the costs of development projects. The most realistic and practical way of 
ensuring the predictable and timely financing of the TCF, and hence the full implementation of the 
technical cooperation programme, would be to make the Fund part of the AgencyÂs Regular Budget. 
38. In the area of nuclear security, he noted with satisfaction the AgencyÂs measures aimed at 
preventing nuclear and radiological terrorism and at dealing with incidents involving illicit trafficking 
in nuclear materials as well as the development of a database on such trafficking. 
39. The inspections conducted by the Agency in the context of the NPT and its safeguards 
agreements were effective and credible. It was regrettable that the AgencyÂs appeal to some States 
with advanced nuclear programmes to accede to the NPT and to apply comprehensive safeguards had 
fallen on deaf ears. He was particularly concerned about the situation in the Middle East, where the 
Agency had been unable to implement resolutions adopted by previous sessions of the General 
Conference and by other relevant international bodies aimed at making the Middle East a NWFZ. He 
called on the Agency to redouble its efforts in that regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia attached 
great importance to the goal of non-proliferation and reiterated its call for a zone free of all WMDs, 
especially nuclear weapons, comprising all States in the Middle East without exception, because of the 
threat posed by such weapons to international security and peace. 
40. Saudi Arabia, as a party to the NPT and a non-nuclear-weapon State, had begun negotiations 
with the Agency on the conclusion of a comprehensive safeguards agreement. 
41. With a view to combating nuclear terrorism and preventing the proliferation of nuclear 
materials, Saudi Arabia had stepped up national oversight and supervisory measures, using appropriate 
technology. He drew attention in that context to the AgencyÂs technical and advisory role in 
developing national capacities and legislation pertaining to oversight and to the security of radioactive 
sources. 
42. With respect to peaceful applications of nuclear energy, he expressed satisfaction at the ongoing 
cooperation between his country and the Agency in nuclear education and medical, agricultural and 
industrial applications, although the number of projects had declined in recent years. 
43. Mr. BOUTALEB (Morocco) reiterated his countryÂs commitment to the AgencyÂs statutory 
objective of using atoms for peace and to the AgencyÂs three pillars: verification, safety and security, 
and technology transfer. The Agency could contribute, within its sphere of competence, to 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 8 

consolidating world peace and security, achieving sustainable development and protecting the 
environment. To that end, it must be given not only the necessary assistance and financing, but also 
the political and moral support of all Member States. 

44. The AgencyÂs verification work played a vital role in preserving international peace and 
security. The latest NPT Review Conference had reaffirmed that the Treaty, of which the AgencyÂs 
safeguards system was the essential instrument, was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. 
45. Alive to the need to ensure respect for international legality, Morocco had supported all 
initiatives to limit the proliferation of WMDs, and it had encouraged all activities aimed at achieving a 
world free of nuclear weapons and at setting up a credible verification system under the AgencyÂs 
auspices. The credibility of the safeguards system was based not only on its ability to detect illicit 
activities but also on its universal, transparent and just implementation. With that in mind, Morocco 
called on all States which had not already done so to accede to the NPT and the AgencyÂs safeguards 
regime without delay so as to ensure universality and not leave breaches, which jeopardized progress 
made in the area. 
46. Morocco had been one of the first States to ratify the NPT and to conclude a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement with the Agency. In 2000, it had ratified the CTBT and the CPPNM. It had also 
contributed to the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen safeguards and had signed the Pelindaba Treaty 
creating a NWFZ in Africa. Also, it had been one of the first countries to notify the Director General 
of its acceptance of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, and it was 
working actively to put in place the infrastructure needed to apply the CodeÂs provisions. His 
delegation was pleased to announce that Morocco was about to sign an additional protocol to its 
safeguards agreement with the Agency, thereby once again demonstrating its transparency and 
commitment to non-proliferation and nuclear safety and security. 
47. His Government shared international concerns about the persisting threat of the deployment of 
nuclear weapons in the Middle East. Morocco, which had actively supported GC(47)/RES/13 on the 
application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East, was disappointed that no substantial progress had 
been made towards its implementation. Israel was still refusing to adhere to non-proliferation regimes 
and to submit all its nuclear facilities and activities to Agency safeguards. That attitude constituted a 
serious obstacle to the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East and the achievement of a just and 
lasting peace, the sole guarantee of safety and security. Israel should consider adhering to the NPT 
without delay and accepting Agency control and verification of all its nuclear facilities. If all the 
nuclear facilities and activities in the region were under Agency safeguards, confidence would be built 
and efforts to establish a NWFZ facilitated. In that connection, Morocco supported the Director 
GeneralÂs efforts to hold a forum with the participation of all the countries of the region in order to 
learn from the experiences of other regions in establishing such a zone. 
48. The threat of nuclear terrorism must be taken very seriously. All States should receive the 
cooperation they needed to put in place nuclear security infrastructures. To prevent the malicious use 
of nuclear energy, Morocco appealed to all countries to work closely with the Agency on both the 
physical protection of nuclear materials and equipment, and on the fight against illicit trafficking. 
49. The Moroccan authorities attached importance to the creation of a national nuclear strategy, 
with the AgencyÂs assistance, for setting up the legislative and regulatory infrastructure needed for the 
peaceful and safe use of nuclear energy. His delegation welcomed the developments in the field of 
safety since the 47th General Conference. They were crucial to public acceptance of nuclear energy. 
Morocco supported the activities being carried out to promote the safety culture concept and 
encouraged the Secretariat to pursue its efforts in that area. Training and the exchange of information 
were essential in that regard and Morocco, as part of its cooperation with the Agency, continued to 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 9 

provide training in radiation protection to specialists from French-speaking Africa. A second postgraduate 
course was due to begin in Rabat in October. 

50. Member States must provide adequate financial resources so that the Agency could meet the 
ever-growing needs of the developing countries. Also, it was particularly important to maintain the 
delicate balance between the AgencyÂs statutory activities. He urged all Member States to honour their 
financial commitments to the Agency and contribute generously to the TCF so that the financing of 
cooperation was adequate, predictable and assured. He reiterated MoroccoÂs support of the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, which enabled the international community to benefit from the 
contribution of atomic energy in such socio-economic areas as health care, hydrology, agriculture and 
energy. Interest was growing in nuclear power as the cost of traditional energy resources rose. 
51. Although adopted by the Board of Governors in 1998, the amendment to Article VI of the 
Statute had still not entered into force. To date, only 36 countries, including Morocco, had deposited 
their instrument of acceptance of that amendment, which aimed to strengthen the representativity, and 
thus the authority, of the Board of Governors. The slow rate of acceptance was delaying its entry into 
force, and that was prejudicial to the ideals of the democratization of international bodies. His 
delegation urged the Member States to deposit their instruments of acceptance so that the amendment 
could enter into force as quickly as possible. 
52. Mr. BONOU (Burkina Faso) said that the objectives of the NPT were being weakened by the 
pursuit of WMDs, which was putting international security under increasing threat. Burkina Faso 
welcomed the measures the Agency had already taken to prevent nuclear or radioactive materials 
being used for criminal or terrorist purposes, particularly through the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources. His country was an active member of the group of friends 
promoting the additional protocol and had co-organized with the Agency a regional seminar, held in 
Ouagadougou in February 2004, on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons for member countries of the 
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The 
ECOWAS countries had been urged to adhere universally to the AgencyÂs strengthened safeguards 
system as a confidence-building measure in support of the non-proliferation regime. Burkina Faso 
welcomed the decisions taken by Algeria, Benin and Mauritius to sign additional protocols, and itself 
supported the proposed amendments to CPPNM. 
53. A bill on radiation protection would shortly be placed before the Burkina Faso parliament as 
part of national efforts to improve the legislative and regulatory infrastructure in that field. In spite of 
its limited resources, Burkina Faso made an effort to contribute to the TCF and was an active 
participant in AFRA activities. It welcomed the considerable support given by the Agency with a view 
to achieving sustainable development and greatly appreciated the training that had been given to its 
own officials. It strongly supported the African GroupÂs draft resolution on the development of the SIT 
for the eradication of malaria and, like some other countries in the west and north Africa subregion, 
was concerned about the appearance of migratory locusts which threatened crops and pastures. It 
would be highly desirable for the Agency to give its support to the countries concerned in finding a 
lasting solution to the problem. 
54. In conclusion, he thanked the Director General for all the work the Agency had done in support 
of world peace and security and urged Member States to collaborate closely to that end. 
55. Mr. TULUB (Ukraine) said that in his country the development of nuclear energy formed the 
basis for meeting the demands of a growing economy. A high priority for Ukraine, which had 
14 nuclear power units in operation, was to improve the reliability and safety of its nuclear reactors 
and to resolve issues concerning the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 10 

56. 2004 had seen the start-up of new units at the Khmelnitski and Rovno nuclear plants, each with 
a capacity of 1 million kW(e). Ukraine was grateful to all the international organizations that had 
collaborated in their construction, including the EBRD and Euratom. That achievement was important 
not only for his country, but also for the entire nuclear power community, as it showed renewed trust 
in nuclear energy and in UkraineÂs nuclear power development programme. 
57. Ukraine adhered strictly to its nuclear safety obligations and was implementing programmes to 
modernize, and enhance the safety of, its power plants. Also, it had passed a law on financing the 
decommissioning of nuclear facilities. UkraineÂs third national report, submitted under the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety, showed the significant work it was carrying out to improve safety with efforts 
focusing particularly on the safe operation of nuclear power plants, extending their operational lifetime 
on the basis of adequate safety levels, the safe storage of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning the 
Chernobyl plant and transforming the Shelter into an environmentally safe system. The forthcoming 
Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Nuclear Safety Convention would show how much 
progress had been made in raising nuclear and radiation safety levels in nuclear power plants since the 
second Review Meeting. His delegation appreciated the AgencyÂs activities in the safety area, 
including the establishment and review of safety standards, which were used as the basis for UkraineÂs 
domestic regulatory documents. 
58. Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the effectiveness of its safeguards system. In 
the light of new threats to security, all Member States should make every effort to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and the diversion of nuclear technologies for military purposes. The 
NPT was a key instrument in preventing nuclear proliferation. UkraineÂs decision to renounce its 
nuclear arsenal and accede to that Treaty ten years previously had been an important contribution to 
strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and increasing global security. An important 
element in that regime was the additional protocol and Ukraine was taking steps to ratify its additional 
protocol. Implementing the additional requirements under the protocol would incur substantial costs 
and he appealed for help from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme in that regard. 
59. Concerned about the new global security threats, Ukraine called for wide international 
cooperation in preventing the use of nuclear and radioactive materials for terrorist purposes. It upheld 
the conclusions of the Global Threat Initiative International PartnersÂ Conference just held in Vienna 
and had also contributed to the Nuclear Security Fund. Ukraine appreciated the AgencyÂs activities in 
support of international initiatives to increase the security of nuclear and radioactive materials and 
prevent illicit trafficking in them and was in favour of strengthening the system for the physical 
protection of nuclear material. That was a matter of particular significance for Ukraine, which held 
large quantities of fuel-holding masses in the destroyed Chernobyl nuclear power plant and of 
radioactive material in the Chernobyl zone. The AgencyÂs participation, along with wide international 
cooperation through bilateral and multilateral programmes, should be enough to resolve the complex 
problems posed at the Shelter site and in the Chernobyl zone. Ongoing Agency technical cooperation 
projects in Ukraine were providing considerable help in solving those problems. 
60. Ukraine had declared its endorsement of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources. Measures it was undertaking to strengthen the security of radioactive sources 
included the creation of a State system for registering, accounting for and controlling sources, 
legislative changes aimed at strengthening export control and also at strengthening the requirements 
for the physical protection of ionizing radiation sources. Ukraine also supported the expansion of 
Agency activities under its action plan for the safety and security of radiation sources. 
61. Coping with the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and decommissioning the Chernobyl 
nuclear power plant remained priorities for Ukraine and accounted for a significant part of the State 
budget. Many foreign companies had been helping in the work and their efforts were greatly 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 11 

appreciated. However, there had been serious problems, in particular a substantial delay in 
construction of the spent nuclear fuel storage facility, which had led to significant additional costs. His 
delegation asked the donor countries to the EBRD Nuclear Safety Account to provide aid to solve the 
problem. Although the Shelter was close to becoming an environmentally safe system, the building 
costs exceeded the resources available through the Chernobyl Shelter Fund. Such a large and complex 
project needed guaranteed resources for its completion. Ukraine had fulfilled all the obligations it had 
undertaken to shut down the plant in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Ottawa. He trusted 
that the countries of the G-7 and the European Union would do the same and, in particular, that 
additional resources for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund would be mobilized in the near future. 

62. The results of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme demonstrated the AgencyÂs 
capacity to respond efficiently to the needs of its Member States. The programme enabled Ukraine to 
benefit from the best experience and expertise in the world, and also to share its own experience with 
other Member States. The regional coordination meeting held in May had identified issues requiring 
special Agency attention, namely management of equipment operating lifetime in nuclear power 
plants, decommissioning of nuclear power plants, preservation of nuclear knowledge and experience, 
the safety of research reactors, physical protection, and radioactive waste management. 
63. Ukraine also supported the AgencyÂs activities to strengthen cooperation in the nuclear science 
field. In the long term, nuclear energy would play a key role in the energy supplies of many countries, 
including Ukraine. It was therefore very important to lay the foundations for future development, in 
particular through INPRO. 
64. Mr. KORBI (Tunisia) said that cooperation with the Agency in developing the science and 
technology sector and in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear technology was a high priority for his 
country. 
65. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had helped fund projects in the framework of 
national, AFRA and international programmes, and had provided Tunisian nationals with training 
opportunities to develop their expertise in a variety of fields. He noted in that connection that the 
Technical Centre for the Mechanical and Electrical Industries in Tunis had been declared a regional 
oversight centre for the AFRA group. Tunisia counted on the AgencyÂs continued support for the 
development of its scientific and technological expertise in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, inter 
alia under the countryÂs technical cooperation programme for 2005Â2006. 
66. Tunisia also continued to pursue peaceful scientific and technological cooperation with other 
Arab States, bilaterally and within the Arab Maghreb Union and the League of Arab States. He urged 
the Agency to collaborate more closely with the Arab Atomic Energy Agency, which had its 
headquarters in Tunis, since the two bodies shared the same goals and principles. 
67. In line with its aspiration to make the Mediterranean a zone of peace and solidarity, Tunisia had 
hosted the 5+5 summit, which had forged closer political, economic, social and cultural ties between 
States on the two shores of the Mediterranean. Tunisia would also host the 2005 World Summit on the 
Information Society, which would provide a further opportunity to close the North-South digital gap. 
68. As the first State to ratify AFRA, Tunisia had hosted seminars and training courses in 
cooperation with the Agency, which had provided valuable support for AFRA projects. He noted that 
30 of the 34 African Member States of the Agency were now AFRA members and he urged donor 
Member States to support its programmes. 
69. He was pleased to announce that Tunisia had honoured its obligations to the Agency by paying 
its assessed contributions for the current year and was on schedule with the payment of its arrears in 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 12 

respect of technical cooperation projects. He called on all Member States to pay their contributions so 
that the Agency could fully implement its programmes. 

70. Expressing support for the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear safety and security, he urged 
all States to join the relevant international instruments, to comply with their provisions and to take 
action against illicit trafficking in nuclear materials. Tunisia had acceded to the Pelindaba Treaty and 
had been working towards strengthening of the safeguards regime, non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and a ban on nuclear testing. He reiterated TunisiaÂs willingness to sign an additional 
protocol aimed at strengthening the safeguards regime and to comply fully with its provisions. He 
noted with satisfaction that an increasing number of States had ratified such a protocol or expressed 
their intention to cooperate with the Agency to that effect. 
71. Tunisia was concerned at IsraelÂs continued refusal to accede to the NPT and called on that 
country to place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards in accordance with relevant resolutions 
as a contribution to confidence-building and to the Middle East peace process. Tunisia also reiterated 
its support for the establishment of a NWFZ in the Middle East. 
72. International solidarity was the best way of countering all forms of extremism and fanaticism. 
The Agency could play a major role in that regard through the dissemination of skills, knowledge and 
technology transfer, by supporting national capacity-building in developing countries, especially in the 
areas of food security, water resources management, human health and environmental protection, and 
by its activities to promote continued advances in nuclear science and research, and the prevention of 
terrorism. 
73. Mr. BAHRAN (Yemen) expressed support for the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen international 
cooperation in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
74. Areas of particular interest to Yemen with respect to nuclear and radiation security and safety 
were the security and safety of radioactive sources, waste safety and the safety of transport of 
radioactive materials. The safety and security of radioactive sources were two sides of the same coin 
and a basic prerequisite for the development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. He also drew 
attention to strengthening of the international safeguards regime and its application to all States in the 
interests of justice and equality. Yemen supported the AgencyÂs measures to combat illicit trafficking 
in nuclear materials and other radioactive sources. The Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources was an important document and the guidance it contained could serve in the 
medium and long term as the basis for international instruments that would close the present gap in 
international law in that area. Although it would not be easy to achieve agreement on such an 
instrument, it should be possible through joint action and clarity of purpose. Yemen, whose interest in 
the subject dated from the late 1990s, had joined with other countries in submitting a number of draft 
resolutions on the safety and security of radioactive sources. Its goal was to protect human beings and 
the environment from a variety of hazards, including the risk of illegal acts for malicious purposes. 
75. Yemen also attached importance to the transfer of appropriate nuclear technology to the 
developing countries for peaceful economic and social purposes related, amongst other things, to 
agriculture, industry, medicine, hydrology, the environment, energy production, water desalination and 
scientific research. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities had a direct impact on peopleÂs daily 
lives and on the prospects for future generations, and he urged Member States that could afford to do 
so to step up their contributions to the technical cooperation programme. In Yemen, Agency assistance 
had made possible the establishment of the countryÂs first cancer radiation treatment centre. Also, he 
called on the Agency to increase its support for ARASIA. 
76. His country was a strong supporter of general nuclear disarmament and elimination of the 
nuclear threat to people and the environment in accordance with the NPT. All nuclear facilities in 

GC(48)/OR.2 
20 September 2004, Page 13 

every country should, without exception, be placed under the AgencyÂs international safeguards 
regime. Thus, Israel should accede to the NPT and sign a safeguards agreement and additional 
protocol. Israeli nuclear activities constituted a major threat not just to the region but to the whole 
human race; that was an open secret and a staple news item in the local, regional and international 
media. Standards of nuclear safety and security in Israel were the lowest in the world because that 
countryÂs Government was concerned only with war and destruction and was indifferent to peace. 

77. Mr. CHRISTENSEN (Denmark) said that efforts should continue to be made to strengthen 
international cooperation in preventing the spread of WMDs, especially into the hands of terrorists. 
That challenge had to be at the top of the global agenda. 
78. A universal nuclear non-proliferation regime backed by a strong international safeguards system 
was an essential basis for efforts to pursue nuclear disarmament and to maintain collective security. 
Denmark considered that the additional protocol should become the standard for all countries that 
were parties to the NPT, and therefore strongly encouraged all non-nuclear-weapon States to sign and 
bring into force their respective safeguards agreements and additional protocols. While the NPT 
acknowledged the inalienable rights of all parties to it to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes in conformity with Articles I and II of the Treaty, it had to be absolutely clear that possible 
misuse of civilian nuclear programmes for military purposes must be excluded. Effective verification 
was a prerequisite, and hence it was of the utmost importance that all States Party to the NPT 
subscribe to the full range of verification instruments, in particular those of the Agency. The case of 
IranÂs clandestine nuclear programme and the AgencyÂs continuing efforts to gain a full understanding 
of it proved how necessary those measures were. The resolution adopted by the Board 
on 18 September 2004 on implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, contained in document GOV/2004/79, should be heeded, especially the need for Iran to suspend 
all its enrichment-related activities. 
79. Denmark, which attached a high priority to nuclear safety, commended the Agency for the way 
in which it had quickly reoriented and reinforced its activities regarding protection against nuclear 
terrorism. However, it had to be emphasized that it was the responsibility of States engaged in 
peaceful nuclear activities to make sure that they were conducted within the highest possible safety 
standards. In the contest of the threat of nuclear terrorism, his country supported the convening of a 
diplomatic conference to amend the CPPNM. Also, it welcomed the various international initiatives to 
identify, control, secure, recover or facilitate the disposal of vulnerable high-risk nuclear and other 
radioactive material, including the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
80. Denmark also welcomed the action plan on the decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The 
decommissioning of DenmarkÂs nuclear research reactors and related facilities would begin in the 
autumn of 2004 and take 15 to 20 years. In preparing for it, the Danish authorities had relied on 
recommendations and advice from the Agency. It looked forward to sharing its experience with others 
as the process went on. Denmark also welcomed the action plan for strengthening the international 
preparedness and response system for nuclear and radiological emergencies. 
81. Denmark, which had demonstrated its support over the years by paying its contribution to the 
TCF in full and on time, considered that the agreement reached on the level of the Fund for the next 
two years constituted a good basis for technical cooperation. Technical cooperation activities must be 
demand-driven and enjoy strong financial and substantive support from the recipient countries, which 
must also ensure that such activities took place in an environment of verifiable nuclear and radiation 
safety as well as nuclear security. 
82. Mr. GONZÃLEZ ANINAT (Chile) said that, as a country that supported global and verifiable 
disarmament, Chile had signed or acceded to all the instruments relating to the non-proliferation of 

GC(48)/OR.2

WMDs. It shared the views of other States in the Latin American and Caribbean region regarding the 
use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes in that international non-proliferation instruments should 
not be used to restrict the freedom for research and development of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. The NPT presented certain difficulties to Chile since the mere possession of nuclear 
weapons implied a degree of instability and a threat not compatible with the United Nations Charter. 

83. Chile was also party to a number of international instruments in the areas of nuclear and 
radiation safety, assistance in the event of an emergency, civil liability for nuclear damage and the 
physical protection of nuclear material. As a ratifying State of the CTBT, it called on all States to 
commit themselves to that Treaty in the interests of confidence-building and a safer international 
environment. 
84. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was contributing more and more to sustainable 
development in the areas of power generation, food, agriculture and human health. The Chilean 
Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) was playing an important role in the promotion and control of 
nuclear energy in Chile. One achievement had been eradication of the medfly using the SIT, leading to 
savings of $200 million each year. 
85. As many countries were discovering, nuclear power could be used to guard against an energy 
deficit when conventional sources no longer sufficed or prices on the international market were too 
volatile. However, a number of complex technical aspects had to be addressed, such as the acquisition 
of radioactive material for nuclear fuel fabrication, the recycling of waste fuel and the treatment of 
radioactive waste. The fact that waste, however it was treated, remained radioactive was a cause for 
concern. 
86. With regard to the maritime transport of nuclear material, there was as yet no effective way of 
recovering nuclear material spills on the high seas or of recovering containers. Other matters of serious 
concern included liability in the event of an accident and environmental damage. Chile had engaged in 
a number of diplomatic initiatives to improve international standards for such transport and 
recommended that transporting countries take every possible step to ensure that cargoes were as safe 
as possible using, as a minimum, Agency and IMO safety standards. There was a need to improve the 
relevant legislation and to approve international standards relating to the transport of radioactive 
materials, in particular as regards contamination of the marine environment, timely and appropriate 
information on maritime routes, including the frequency of their use and the amount of cargo in each 
shipment, the communication of contingency plans in the event of an accident, and the undertaking of 
commitments to recover radioactive waste in the event of spillage or loss. Furthermore, verification 
mechanisms should be put in place to ensure adherence to the safety standards and a liability regime 
established for nuclear damage. The action plan for the safety of transport of radioactive material 
approved by the Board of Governors in March 2004 had incorporated some of ChileÂs ideas, such as 
liability for damage in the event of an accident, timely notification and the application of more 
rigorous standards for transport safety. The subject should be included on the agenda of the General 
Assembly with a view to the convening of a diplomatic conference to negotiate a legally binding 
instrument on the international transport of radioactive material consistent with the provisions of the 
Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
87. One of the most pressing challenges for the international community was the strengthening of 
verification under the international disarmament instruments. For Agency safeguards that was 
achieved through the additional protocol to NPT safeguards agreements. Chile, for its part, had signed 
and ratified an additional protocol. It would assist in any way it could to increase the universality of 
the additional protocol in line with the relevant action plan. It was time to move on to elaboration of 
the second phase of that action plan. In the current climate of terrorist attacks and heightened security 
concerns there was a greater need for control over arms production and sale, including sensitive or

dual-use technologies and products. Chile had supported a number of initiatives in that regard, such as 
Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) relating to measures to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear, 
chemical or biological weapons, their means of delivery and related materials. It had also participated 
in the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), an international response to the growing challenge posed 
by WMDs. 

88. Turning to technical cooperation, he said that nuclear technologies were having an economic 
and social impact in Chile in such areas as health, agriculture, industry, mining, fishing, water 
resources and the environment. For example, new diagnostic techniques were being used to study and 
evaluate the impact of agricultural pesticides on the environment and human health and to improve 
agricultural produce. Furthermore, the Institute of Innovation in Mining and Metallurgy had developed 
two prototypes of instruments, currently being tested, to measure the copper content in extraction 
processes. In addition, nuclear techniques were being used to combat the harmful marine algal blooms 
known as red tide and, in the health area, to diagnose cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Chile had 
also benefited from Agency fellowships, scientific visits and workshops. The increasing professional 
and technical competence of its citizens was being recognized with the number of foreign fellowship 
students increasing to 29 in 2003Â2004. ChileÂs proposals for technical cooperation projects for 
the 2005Â2006 biennium aimed to increase its foreign trade potential in order to gain access to the new 
markets that had been opened up through recent free trade agreements with the European Union, the 
United States of America and the Republic of Korea. 
89. Chile was one of the first countries to implement the new payment mechanism, the national 
participation costs (NPCs), for the 2005Â2006 biennium. It would also be making a significant 
contribution to the TCF for 2005. 
90. Nuclear power would grow in importance to meet future energy challenges provided that steps 
were taken to address the perceived obstacles, namely the possession of nuclear arsenals, which 
reduced confidence in the peaceful uses of nuclear power, new policies which, in clear contradiction to 
international law, considered the use of nuclear power to repel possible armed attacks, and the 
potentially catastrophic consequences for humanity of nuclear terrorism. Public acceptance was vital, 
and the Agency should make every effort to highlight the benefits of nuclear technologies and reverse 
entrenched public perceptions. Chile would support the convening of a conference at an extraordinary 
session of the General Assembly to that end. 
The meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.

5. Arrangements for the Conference 
(a) Adoption of the agenda and allocation of items for initial discussion 
1. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the agenda for the 
current session consist of all the items on the provisional agenda set forth in documents GC(48)/1 and 
Corr.1 and Add.1. With regard to the allocation of items for initial discussion, the Committee had 
recommended that the items listed in those documents be taken up for initial discussion as indicated 
there with the exception of item 21, Elections to the AgencyÂs Staff Pension Committee, which should 
be taken up first in the Committee of the Whole. It had also recommended that the order of items be as 
proposed in those documents. 
2. The General CommitteeÂs recommendations were accepted. 
(b) Closing date of the session and opening date of the next session 
3. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had recommended that the Conference set 
Friday, 24 September 2004 as the closing date of the forty-eighth regular session and Monday, 
26 September 2005 as the opening date of the forty-ninth regular session, which would be held in 
Vienna. 
4. The CommitteeÂs recommendation was accepted. 
Â Restoration of voting rights 
5. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee, which had had before it requests made by 
Afghanistan, Armenia, Iraq and Kazakhstan for the restoration of their voting rights, had postponed 
consideration of the requests, and of any other such requests received, until its following meeting. 
7. General debate and annual report for 2003 
6. Mr. KOVACHEV (Bulgaria), having welcomed the General ConferenceÂs approval of Chad, 
Togo and Mauritania for membership of the Agency, said that his delegation attached great 
importance to the positions expressed in the statement presented by the delegate of the Netherlands on 
behalf of the European Union and of Â inter alia Â the candidate countries, including Bulgaria. 
7. Since the beginning of the nuclear age, the risks of nuclear proliferation had changed Â and 
grown. For more than thirty years, the NPT had played a crucial role in deterring nuclear proliferation, 
and the Agency had remained an independent body indispensable for maintaining the effectiveness of 
the NPT regime. The importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards system had been underlined in the 
Preparatory Committee for the 2005 NPT Review Conference. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 2 

8. Bulgaria was strongly committed to strengthening the AgencyÂs safeguards system and hence 
the NPT regime. As a country with operating nuclear power plants, it was cooperating closely with the 
Agency on issues relating to nuclear security and the physical protection of nuclear material. It had 
ratified an additional protocol to its NPT safeguards agreement in 2000 and had submitted to the 
Agency an initial declaration pursuant to the protocol. It would like to see all other States doing the 
same and welcomed the efforts being made to speed up the conclusion of comprehensive safeguards 
agreements and additional protocols. 
9. Bulgaria considered that minimizing the risk of nuclear terrorism should be a top priority for the 
international community. It was therefore in favour of multilateral control over the nuclear fuel cycle 
and of urgent practical measures to strengthen the security and physical protection of nuclear material 
and facilities. Also, it believed that the trade in nuclear material and equipment for civilian purposes 
should be subject to strict export control regulations. It commended the efforts being made by many 
Member States to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material, and in that regard 
it welcomed the findings of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative International PartnersÂ Conference. 
10. The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) was extremely 
important for preventing nuclear proliferation and minimizing the risk of nuclear terrorism, and 
Bulgaria hoped that the process of amending it would be completed soon. 
11. His countryÂs nuclear power reactors were doing much to meet the demand for electricity both 
within Bulgaria and in nearby countries. Over the past ten years, the Kozloduy nuclear power plant 
had been accounting for 40Â47% of the average annual electricity generation in Bulgaria. 
12. In November 2003, the Working Party on Nuclear Safety of the European CouncilÂs Atomic 
Questions Group had reviewed the implementation in Bulgaria of recommendations regarding the 
Kozloduy nuclear power plant made in 2001 and 2002. It had concluded that BulgariaÂs Ministry of 
Energy and Energy Resources and Nuclear Regulatory Agency and the management of the Kozloduy 
nuclear power plant had provided sufficient information on the implementation of the 
recommendations and that all of the recommendations were being adequately addressed by the 
responsible authorities and implemented according to plan. It did not consider that a further 
implementation review was necessary. 
13. At the end of 2002, the Bulgarian Government had decided that a study should be carried out 
regarding the feasibility of resuming the construction Â at a site near the town of Belene Â of a 
second Bulgarian nuclear power plant. Since then, the feasibility study and an environmental impact 
assessment had been carried out. After a public discussion in March 2004, it had been concluded that 
the construction of a second nuclear power plant in Bulgaria had strong support at all levels. In 
April 2004, the Bulgarian Government had given its approval for the resumption of construction 
activities at the Belene site. According to the implementation schedule, they would be resumed 
in 2005 and commercial operation of the first unit of the Belene nuclear power plant would start 
in 2010. 
14. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes were a smoothly functioning mechanism for 
the transfer of technology to developing Member States, thanks largely to the SecretariatÂs success in 
increasing the effectiveness of the programmes and the efficiency with which they were managed. 
15. Technical cooperation between Bulgaria and the Agency, especially in the area of nuclear 
safety, continued to be a matter of high priority for his country, which was particularly grateful to the 
Department of Technical Cooperation and the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security for 
providing assistance with the safety upgrading of nuclear facilities, with the development and 
application of new technologies in the nuclear energy field and with the strengthening of the Bulgarian 
Nuclear Safety AuthorityÂs capabilities. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 3 

16. Bulgaria was taking an active part in the AgencyÂs regional technical cooperation programme 
for Europe, giving high priority to nuclear power and nuclear safety projects. 
17. With the AgencyÂs financial support, Bulgarian nuclear specialists had attended international 
conferences, symposia and seminars and exchanged ideas with colleagues from all over the world. 
Also, Bulgarian institutes had, through contracts and agreements, taken part in the AgencyÂs 
coordinated research activities. 
18. In addition, Bulgaria was participating in the International Nuclear Information System, the 
Incident Reporting System and the Power Reactor Information System. 
19. In BulgariaÂs view, the proposed Regular Budget for 2005 was well-balanced and would ensure 
full implementation of the AgencyÂs programmes. In spite of financial difficulties, Bulgaria had met in 
full its obligations in respect of the Regular Budget for 2003 and would be contributing US $10 000 to 
the TCF for 2005. 
20. Mr. POLOZHANI (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), having welcomed the 
approval of Chad, Togo and Mauritania for Agency membership, said that terrorist attacks like those 
of 11 September 2001 and the recent one in southern Russia had highlighted the global threat of 
terrorism and the need for cooperation among all States in meeting it. As far as the threat of nuclear 
terrorism was concerned, his country was placing particular emphasis on preventing the illegal 
possession of and illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material. It had installed radiation 
monitoring equipment at all of its border crossings, but some of the equipment needed upgrading and 
further training was needed for customs and law enforcement officers. 
21. In that connection, his country welcomed the fact that, within the framework of the European 
UnionÂs Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, it had been identified as a 
potential recipient of European Union support provided through the Agency. 
22. With the AgencyÂs assistance, his country had made significant progress towards compliance 
with international radiation safety standards. A law on protection against ionizing radiation protection 
had been passed and the establishment of an independent radiation safety directorate was expected to 
be completed by the end of the year. His country was looking forward to receiving further Agency 
assistance, with the focus on the drafting of regulations and a code of practice. 
23. His country, which was participating very actively in the AgencyÂs regional technical 
cooperation programme for Europe, was concerned about the future of the regional project relating to 
national regulatory control and occupational radiation protection programmes, from which it had 
derived significant benefit. It hoped that the project would continue, in one form or another, as it 
needed further assistance in strengthening its arrangements for the regulatory control of radioactive 
sources. 
24. His country, which would soon be hosting a training course Â for participants from seven 
countries Â on the use of immunoenzymatic and molecular techniques for the diagnosis of brucellosis 
in cattle, sheep and goats, greatly appreciated the support which the Agency had provided for efforts to 
combat that zoonotic disease. 
25. The new projects being proposed by his country for the next technical cooperation programme 
cycle related to nuclear medicine, food safety standards and radiation protection. They were in full 
compliance with the Country Programme Framework signed in December 2003. 
26. Despite national budgetary restrictions, his country, which greatly appreciated the assistance 
provided through the Department of Technical Cooperation, had met its financial obligations vis-Ã -vis 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 4 

the Regular Budget and had made several contributions to the Technical Cooperation Extrabudgetary 
Fund, to which it would be paying US $100 000 for use in the next technical cooperation programme. 

27. Mr. WRIGHT (United Kingdom) said that the Agency was playing an essential role in helping 
to ensure global nuclear safety and security and that it could continue to count on the United 
KingdomÂs support in all areas of its work. The United Kingdom regularly paid its Regular Budget 
contributions and TCF target shares in full and on time, and it would like to see all other Member 
States doing likewise. 
28. The events of the past year had again highlighted the increasing risk of nuclear proliferation. 
In 2003, the United Kingdom had been among those States which had stressed the importance of the 
Agency being able to meet the growing challenge through safeguards and other means. It was to be 
hoped that the European Commission would strengthen its links with the Agency in the coming year in 
the safeguards area. 
29. The Agency had done well to meet a growing verification workload within the constraints of its 
budget. But it could not be expected to continue forever doing more within the same constraints. 
Serious consideration needed to be given to further strengthening the Department of Safeguards. The 
Regular Budget increase agreed in 2003 would deliver some of what the Department badly needed, but 
more could and should be done. 
30. The United Kingdom had made a further voluntary contribution in support of the AgencyÂs 
safeguards activities. In addition to the Â£560 000 already provided through its Member State Support 
Programme, it had donated Â£1.1 million in support of the IAEA Safeguards Information System 
re-engineering project. That amount would not be enough on its own, however, and his delegation 
therefore hoped that other Member States would support the project. 
31. Additional protocols were essential if the Agency was to discharge its safeguards 
responsibilities effectively. However, the rate of entry into force of additional protocols was still 
disappointing. All Member States that had not yet done so should bring an additional protocol into 
force, as a matter of urgency. 
32. The lessons from the discovery of the A.Q. Khan procurement network were beginning to be 
clear. The Agency was uniquely well placed to combat such international networks, and all Member 
States should assist it in its efforts. The United Kingdom was already assisting it. In addition to the 
provision of information to the Agency as called for by its additional protocol, the United Kingdom 
was maintaining a close informal dialogue with the Agency in order that the Agency might derive 
practical benefits from its national experience in, for example, the area of export controls; other 
Member States should do likewise. 
33. On 19 December 2003, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had announced that it would dismantle its 
WMD programmes Â the first time a regime had agreed voluntarily to dismantle its WMD 
programmes under international supervision in a transparent process. The United Kingdom had 
cooperated closely with Libya, the United States and the Agency to facilitate the removal from Libya 
of sensitive nuclear-related equipment and material, and at LibyaÂs request it had provided advice and 
technical assistance throughout the dismantlement process. 
34. The United Kingdom congratulated the Agency on its thoroughness in investigating LibyaÂs 
past non-compliance and commended Libya for the corrective measures it had taken. The case of 
Libya demonstrated that, where there was genuine transparency and full cooperation, problems of 
nuclear proliferation could be resolved through diplomacy and negotiation. It was to be hoped that the 
small number of remaining questions would be quickly answered, so that it would soon be possible to 
consider closing the file on Libya.

35. As regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, the United Kingdom was pleased that in the Director 
GeneralÂs view the Agency was making steady progress towards understanding that countryÂs nuclear 
programme. However, there were still serious questions outstanding. His delegation regretted the fact 
that in the Director GeneralÂs view IranÂs cooperation had not been sufficiently proactive. Iran should 
give the Agency the information and access which it required in a timely manner. That was a matter 
not of simply meeting legal obligations but also of demonstrating a willingness to enable the Agency 
to fulfil its task and so provide the international community with the assurances which it needed about 
the peaceful nature of IranÂs nuclear programme. It was now over two years since significant doubts 
had been openly raised about the purpose of IranÂs nuclear programme, and the United Kingdom 
looked forward to being able in November to reach conclusions about its purpose and decide whether 
any further steps were required. 
36. Iran should also ratify the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement without delay. 
Ratification would contribute to the process of rebuilding the international communityÂs confidence in 
IranÂs nuclear programme Â confidence that had been shattered by IranÂs conducting, over an 
extended period, clandestine nuclear activities. 
37. The immediate full suspension of all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including 
commissioning tests and any other production-related activities at the Esfahan Uranium Conversion 
Facility, remained of the utmost importance The United Kingdom was therefore deeply concerned that 
Iran had never fully suspended all such activities and had instead shown contempt for the BoardÂs 
opinion by going back on previously announced commitments. International confidence was not 
something to be turned on and off like a tap. 
38. It is not the United KingdomÂs intention to limit the right of Member States under the NPT to 
benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as long as the right was exercised in strict 
compliance with NPT obligations. Nor did the United Kingdom consider that the suspension of 
activities was among the legal obligations of Iran or of any other Member State, and it was convinced 
that the resolution adopted by the Board on 18 September 2004 did not contain such an implication. It 
regarded that resolution as a final call for full, verifiable suspension. If Iran failed to heed the call, 
there might in November be no option but to seek the political backing of the Security Council. 
39. In March 2005, the Agency would be holding the International Conference on Nuclear Security: 
Global Directions for the Future in London. That event would provide an important opportunity to 
review the response to the threat of nuclear terrorism and identify future challenges. The United 
Kingdom hoped that Member States would make the most of that opportunity. 
40. Mr. KYRLE (Austria) said that serious challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation regime in 
recent years had highlighted the importance of the verification of the compliance of States parties to 
the NPT with their NPT obligations by the Agency, an organization which Vienna was proud to host. 
41. One of the key elements of nuclear security was the physical protection of nuclear material and 
of nuclear facilities. The AgencyÂs guidance documents on physical protection had served their 
purpose well. However, the only legally binding instrument, the Convention on the Physical Protection 
of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), was of very limited scope and did not meet current needs. Austria had 
therefore strongly supported the Director GeneralÂs initiative in convening experts to consider possible 
amendments to the CPPNM and welcomed the results of the expertsÂ March 2003 deliberations. In 
close consultation with a number of like-minded countries, Austria had prepared an amendment 
proposal which, in its view, should enjoy very broad support. In May 2004, it had, on behalf 
of 25 States parties to the CPPNM, submitted the proposal to the Director General, requesting him to 
convene a diplomatic conference pursuant to CPPNM Article 20. His delegation was confident that 
many States parties would respond positively to the Director General in that respect, so that the 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 6 

Secretariat would be able to go ahead with making the necessary arrangements for the diplomatic 
conference. 

42. In the past twelve months, the Board of Governors had dealt extensively with the nuclear 
proliferation challenges posed by the DPRK, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Libyan Arab 
Jamahiriya. The cases in question had clearly demonstrated that it was of utmost importance for the 
Agency to be able not only to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material, but also to provide 
assurances regarding the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities. 
43. Austria, which had applauded the adoption of the Model Additional Protocol in 1997 and the 
development of integrated safeguards, believed that, in order to implement integrated safeguards, the 
Agency needed greater legal authority. Although heartened by the significant increase during 2004 in 
the number of additional protocols in force, it shared the Director GeneralÂs view that more needed to 
be done. Furthermore, 43 countries parties to the NPT had not even concluded comprehensive 
safeguards agreements with the Agency as required by the NPT. 
44. In AustriaÂs view, for non-nuclear-weapon States parties to the NPT, the conclusion of an 
additional protocol was not optional Â it was a legal obligation. His country would therefore like to 
see all such States that had not yet concluded an additional protocol concluding one without further 
delay. 
45. Nuclear security was a precondition for nuclear cooperation and trade. A State party to the NPT 
might supply nuclear items to other countries only if it was sure that an appropriate level of nuclear 
security existed in those countries. Comprehensive Agency safeguards were the first condition. 
Beyond that, an appropriate system of physical protection for nuclear material and nuclear facilities 
had to be in place, in combination with a minimum set of measures for combating illicit trafficking. In 
addition to those internal security arrangements, appropriate export control requirements were needed 
in order to ensure that supplied nuclear items were not re-exported from the recipient countries 
without the necessary controls. 
46. Many countries with insignificant nuclear activities lacked the experience necessary for 
devising and implementing national nuclear security system. The Secretariat and Member States with 
the necessary experience should assist those countries in closing security gaps. The threat of nuclear 
terrorism could be combated successfully only if adequate nuclear security systems were properly 
implemented all over the world. 
47. It was worrying to learn from the Nuclear Safety Review for the Year 2003 that, despite 
abundant operating experience, avoidable events continued to occur at nuclear facilities. The Agency 
should continue to help improve the exchange of operational experience among Member States. 
48. Austria greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts in strengthening the global nuclear safety 
regime. The challenge for the coming years was to accelerate the acceptance of the AgencyÂs safety 
standards. Since the safety standards should serve as global reference for the protection of people and 
the environment, their content should be transformed into legally binding rules. While collaboration 
with the nuclear industry could yield useful results, the safety standards should not be geared to the 
needs of the nuclear industry, but to the goal of gradually increasing nuclear safety worldwide. 
49. Austria welcomed the BoardÂs adoption of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research 
Reactors. It also welcomed the results of the first Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Joint 
Convention, which had underlined the importance of transparency for confidence-building. It hoped 
that future review meetings would show that further progress had been made as regards transparency. 
50. The operation of nuclear power plants in the vicinity of national borders created a risk to the 
populations of other countries and necessitated the establishment and maintenance of expensive 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 7 

off-site emergency preparedness infrastructures. Countries which had nuclear power programmes 
should cooperate closely with nearby countries which did not, particularly by providing necessary data 
and participating in joint planning for emergencies. The Czech Republic and Austria were already 
cooperating closely in that respect, and a number of other countries in the region had expressed an 
interest in joining in their cooperative efforts. 

51. Austria, which regarded technical cooperation as an integral part of the AgencyÂs activities, was 
pleased with the progress made in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programmes. While remaining sceptical about the power applications of nuclear 
energy, it fully supported the AgencyÂs activities relating to non-power applications. 
52. Austria very much appreciated the work done by the Director General and his staff in the past 
year, in particular the AgencyÂs verification activities. Austria would continue to lend its full support 
to the Agency. 
53. Mr. MATOUQ (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), having thanked the Agency for the technical 
assistance which his country had received through it in recent years, said that his country had adopted 
a consistent position on weapons of mass destruction in the United Nations General Assembly, the 
Agency and the Disarmament Commission, calling for their complete elimination. It had voluntarily 
abandoned programmes that might have led to the production of internationally prohibited weapons 
and had acceded to a number of relevant treaties, including the Pelindaba Treaty, the CTBT and the 
CWC. Since December 2003, it had reported all relevant nuclear activities to the Agency and was 
cooperating fully in the investigation of those activities by the Agency and a joint United States-
United Kingdom team, acting as if the additional protocol signed by it was already in force. As a 
result, the investigations had been proceeding at a record pace. 
54. His country, which stood ready to resolve any further questions that the Agency might raise, 
would welcome assistance from Member States with advanced nuclear technology in enhancing its 
capacity to use nuclear energy for peaceful, development-related purposes. 
55. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was located in an extremely tense region, and for national security 
reasons it therefore hoped that the international community Â and especially those States which had 
backed its December 2003 initiative Â would do their utmost to bring all nuclear activities in the 
region under effective international safeguards. 
56. At the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) International PartnersÂ Conference held 
on 18 and 19 September 2004, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had presented a working paper in which it 
had stressed the need for a robust mechanism to counter illicit trafficking in nuclear and other 
radioactive materials. It stood ready to participate in the development of such a mechanism. 
57. Political tensions in the Middle East and the associated danger of the use of weapons of mass 
destruction were a source of deep concern to most of the international community, as attested by a 
series of resolutions in which the General Assembly has, since 1974, been calling for the 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and for all States in the region to 
accede to the NPT and place all their nuclear activities under Agency safeguards. Israel, which had 
possessed nuclear weapons for years, refused to accede to the NPT and was pursuing a policy of 
nuclear intimidation and blackmail on the pretext of maintaining a balance of power. The international 
community should pressure Israel into abandoning that policy. 
58. In his speech on the thirty-fifth anniversary of LibyaÂs September 1969 revolution, Colonel 
Muammar al-Qadhafi had stressed that it was not enough just for the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to 
abandon its programmes for the development of weapons of mass destruction. Other States, from the 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 8 

United States of America to China, should follow its example, because the possession of such 
weapons constituted a form of terrorism. 

59. Mr BAZOBERRY (Bolivia) praised the way in which the Director General was dealing with 
various sensitive issues and his commitment to the principles of international peace and security laid 
down in the Charter of the United Nations. Under his leadership the Agency had won increased 
international prestige. 
60. Events endangering humanity, particularly in the 20th century, had given rise to a collective 
desire to ensure a future of peace Â not destruction. However, barbaric new players on the 
international stage were seeking to sow destruction everywhere. The Secretary-General of the United 
Nations had recently stated that the world was facing more threats to peace and security now than ever 
before. A major threat to peace and security was poverty. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for 
example, poverty affected 220 million people and one and a half million children died every year 
owing to shortages of safe water. 
61. That was why his country attached great importance to the AgencyÂs support for nuclear 
applications in medicine, agriculture and Â above all Â water resources management. At present, 
Agency technical cooperation projects relating to radiotherapy and pesticide residue monitoring were 
under way in Bolivia, which had proposed, for the 2005Â2006 technical cooperation cycle, projects 
relating to water resources management in the Cochabamba valley, foot-and-mouth disease diagnosis 
and the analysis of contamination due to industrial activities. His country was very grateful for the 
technical assistance provided to it through the Agency. 
62. Bolivia, which was currently the ARCAL Vice-President, would in May 2005 host the fourth 
meeting of the ARCAL Technical Co-ordination Board, which it hoped would lead to the 
strengthening of ARCAL through the drawing-up of an integrated strategic plan. In October 2004, 
Bolivia would host a regional seminar on the detection and control of radioactive materials organized 
by the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security for countries belonging to the Andean Community. 
The subject of the seminar was very relevant to the efforts under way to combat the threat of 
international terrorism, and Bolivia attached great importance to the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative and other such efforts. 
63. The Bolivian Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology was compiling an inventory of all 
radioactive sources in Bolivia for the purposes of keeping track of such sources and securing those no 
longer in use. 
64. Bolivia had been one of the first countries to write to the Director General expressing its support 
for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and its intention to follow 
the guidance contained in the Code of Conduct. 
65. Mr. GARCIA (Philippines), having congratulated Chad, Mauritania and Togo on their being 
approved for membership of the Agency, said that his delegation had participated in the GTRI 
International PartnersÂ Conference held on 18 and 19 September 2004, the purpose of which had been 
to build international support for national programmes for dealing with high-risk nuclear and other 
radioactive materials that posed a potential threat to the international community, and it would like to 
see close coordination between the GTRI and the relevant Agency programmes. 
66. His delegation would also like to see the Agency continuing, together with the GTRI partners, 
to promote the use of civilian research reactors in developing countries in order that such countries 
might benefit more from peaceful uses of the atom. 
67. The Philippines welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the safety and security of radioactive 
sources. The Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI), guided by the Code of Conduct on the 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 9 

Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, had developed an action plan for the safety and security 
of radioactive materials that was being implemented as part of the countryÂs efforts to combat security 
threats due to weapons of mass destruction. Also, the PNRI, together with a task force for the security 
of critical infrastructure, with national security agencies and with the Office of Civil Defence, was 
revising the National Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan (RADPLAN) in the light of the 
threat of terrorist activities. 

68. Under the radiological threat reduction programme of the United States Department of Energy, 
the security of the PNRIÂs critical radiation facilities and of category 1 and 2 sources in 23 hospitals 
was being upgraded. 
69. In 2003, the Philippines had benefited from an IPPAS mission and from Agency assistance with 
the management of disused radiotherapy sources from hospitals. 
70. As an archipelagic State, the Philippines was very concerned about safety in the maritime 
transport of radioactive material and very interested in advancing the dialogue between shipping States 
and coastal States like itself. It welcomed the BoardÂs approval of the Action Plan for the Safety of 
Transport of Radioactive Material and was supporting the implementation of the Action Plan. 
71. His country, which had incorporated the requirements of the AgencyÂs Transport Regulations 
into its relevant national legislation, would like the Secretariat to give high priority to training courses 
on the safe transport of radioactive material for persons from developing archipelagic States. 
72. The Philippines would like to see the DPRK reversing its decision to withdraw from the NPT 
and resuming cooperation with the Agency. A strong advocate of a diplomatic solution to the DPRK 
nuclear issue, it was following with interest the Six-Party Talks process. At the same time, as a 
member of ASEAN, it believed that the Chairmen of the ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN 
Standing Committee could play a useful role in the dialogue with the DPRK. 
73. Recalling with approval the statement made the previous week in the Board by the Governor 
from Malaysia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement regarding the implementation of the NPT 
safeguards agreement of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he said that, in his delegationÂs view, Iran had 
been actively responding to the international communityÂs requests Â made through the Agency Â 
for information about its nuclear programme. At the same time, it would like to see Iran further 
intensifying its cooperation with the Agency, so that all remaining issues might be resolved, and 
immediately ratifying the additional protocol to its NPT safeguards agreement. 
74. The Philippines, which, as a State party to the NPT, attached great importance to the inalienable 
right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, including the production of electric power, 
believed that the question of IranÂs nuclear programme should continue to be addressed within the 
framework of the Agency, as the Agency was not yet in a position to draw definitive conclusions 
regarding Â in particular Â the source of the HEU and LEU contamination found in Iran and IranÂs 
activities relating to P-2 centrifuges. In that connection, it greatly appreciated the professionalism and 
impartiality with which the Director General and his colleagues were carrying out their 
responsibilities. For the present, it was extremely important that Iran continue to implement voluntary 
confidence-building measures as called for by the Board in the resolutions which it had adopted 
on 18 June and 18 September 2004. 
75. For developing countries like the Philippines, technical cooperation was a key aspect of 
membership of the Agency, which should further strengthen the focus on developing Member StatesÂ 
needs and priorities. 
76. Recalling that the Board had the previous week approved a proposal made by himself and the 
Ambassador of Mexico, as co-chairs of a working group established by the Chairman of the Board, 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 10 

regarding the TCF target for each of the years 2005 and 2006 ($77.5 million), he said that his country, 
which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities receiving adequate 
political and financial support, would, despite the severe austerity measures which it was having to 
take, do its best to pay its share of the TCF target for 2005 soon. 

77. His country, which welcomed the AgencyÂs increasingly active role in promoting the use of 
nuclear technology in cancer therapy, had in 2003 hosted Â in partnership with the Agency Â a 
meeting on the management of liver cancer, at the first hospital in south-east Asia to have a positron 
emission tomography (PET) facility. It was very interested in the ideas regarding the establishment of 
centres of excellence for cancer radiotherapy outlined in the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy 
and looked forward to working with the Secretariat on the formulation of plans for the establishment 
of such centres. 
78. A law providing for widespread neonatal screening had recently been passed in the Philippines, 
which was grateful to the Agency for the support provided by it, which had facilitated that important 
legislative step. 
79. The results of a number of regional and national projects on air quality management had been 
drawn upon by his countryÂs Department of Environment and Natural Resources in preparing a 
national air quality status report for use in the drafting of a national clean air act. 
80. Through participation in an RCA project on access to clean drinking water, the Philippines was 
gaining a better understanding of the processes whereby its aquifer systems were recharged and 
increasing its ability to use isotopic and chemical techniques in groundwater flow modelling. It hoped 
to receive assistance during the 2005-2006 technical cooperation cycle in using isotopic techniques to 
improve water resources management and protection. 
81. The PNRI was planning to establish a national environmental isotope laboratory that would Â 
inter alia Â enhance the countryÂs self-reliance in the field of isotope hydrology. The main piece of 
equipment at the laboratory would be an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, and it was hoped that the 
Agency would share Â with the Philippine Government Â the cost of acquiring it. 
82. The Philippines, which had over the years benefited greatly from technical cooperation with the 
Agency, was confident that the Agency would rise to the challenges of the future. 
83. Mr. EIKAAS (Norway) said that in recent years the challenges to the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime had underscored the importance of full compliance with the NPT and the need to work actively 
towards universal adherence to it. The response must be to continue strengthening the NPT, its 
verification instruments and other non-proliferation mechanisms. 
84. His country welcomed United Nations Security Council resolution 1540, in which all States 
were called upon to take more effective measures to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. Full implementation of the resolution was of paramount importance. All States must do 
everything in their power to prevent non-State actors from acquiring such weapons. Norway 
appreciated the readiness of the Secretariat to assist the AgencyÂs Member States in implementing 
resolution 1540. 
85. Norway would like to see the 42 States parties to the NPT which had not yet done so concluding 
comprehensive safeguards agreements with the Agency. It was concerned that only 83 States had 
concluded additional protocols and that no more than 60 of those were in force. It expected that 
the 2005 NPT Review Conference would make additional protocols mandatory under Article III of the 
NPT. Some States parties might need guidance in concluding and implementing additional protocols. 
The Secretariat was to be commended for offering such guidance. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 11 

86. The next step should be to implement integrated safeguards widely. In 2002, Norway had 
become one of just a handful of countries where they were being implemented. It hoped that States 
with more complex fuel cycles than NorwayÂs would follow suit, and was pleased that integrated 
safeguards were now in place in Japan. 
87. Norway continued to be of the view that the Democratic PeopleÂs Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
was bound by its NPT obligations. The DPRK should completely dismantle its nuclear weapons 
programme promptly and in a verifiable and irreversible manner and comply with all those 
obligations. A solution must be found through dialogue, full account being taken of the AgencyÂs 
verification mandate. 
88. Norway was pleased that the Agency was making steady progress towards fully understanding 
the nature and extent of the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It appreciated that 
Iran, since signing an additional protocol in December 2003, had been acting as if the protocol was in 
force, but it would like to see Iran ratifying the additional protocol without delay. 
89. Iran should continue to accelerate its cooperation and pursue a policy of maximum transparency 
and confidence-building, so that the outstanding issues could be resolved soon. It should heed the 
resolution adopted by the Board of Governors on 18 September 2004 and, in particular, completely 
suspend all of its enrichment-related activities. 
90. The recent developments in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya were promising, and the international 
community should continue encouraging Libya to persist with its new, positive course and Â inter 
alia Â to ratify the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
91. Over the years, a number of important instruments relevant to nuclear safety and security had 
evolved within the Agency framework, and it was up to Member States to strengthen them and to put 
them to good use. A case in point was the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material 
(CPPNM), which needed to be adjusted in order to make it more effective against nuclear terrorism. 
Norway had long been calling for universalization of the CPPNM, and it was among those countries 
which had proposed the convening of a diplomatic conference in accordance with CPPNM Article 20. 
92. The adoption of the revised Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources 
had been an important landmark, and Norway would like to see all Agency Member States 
implementing it. 
93. There was an obvious need to explore ways of tightening the controls over the most 
proliferation-sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, and therefore Norway welcomed the 
establishment of an expert group to consider possible multinational approaches to the front and back 
ends of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
94. Norway had on a number of occasions expressed its support for the European UnionÂs Strategy 
against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Invaluable as they were, the international 
instruments developed within the Agency framework could benefit from being complemented by 
important regional non-proliferation initiatives. 
95. Norway had been the first country not belonging to the G-8 to contribute to the G-8 Global 
Partnership. Its focus was on the safe handling and storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste 
in north-western Russia. 
96. The Proliferation Security Initiative was another very useful response to new proliferation 
challenges. Norway was taking an active part in it and was also a partner in the Global Threat 
Reduction Initiative recently launched by the United States Secretary of Energy. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 12 

97. However, while international instruments and programmes were essential in combating the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, efforts by individual countries were decisive. The 
development of an adequate regulatory infrastructure in every State was crucial. The Agency should 
continue its important support for the establishment of regulatory authorities with the necessary 
powers in those Member States which still lacked them. 
98. The safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste was critical from an environmental 
perspective as well as from a safety perspective. Norway would therefore like to see many more 
Member States acceding to the Joint Convention and doing so in time to participate in the second 
Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties. 
99. His country, which considered the establishment of international safety standards to be essential 
for the safe operation of nuclear installations, believed that it would be useful if the Secretariat 
produced Â before the end of 2004 Â a report showing which Agency safety standards had been 
changed and how. 
100. In 2003, an International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) team had visited 
Norway and reviewed its nuclear security legislation and the security arrangements at its nuclear 
research facilities. The mission had been very useful, and Norway believed that many Member States 
could benefit from IPPAS. 
101. Norway had played a leading role in efforts to improve cooperation in nuclear and radiological 
emergencies and had agreed to chair the National Competent AuthoritiesÂ Coordinating Group 
(NCACG). It intended to provide resources for implementation of the International Action Plan for 
Strengthening the International Preparedness and Response System for Nuclear and Radiological 
Emergencies that had been approved by the Board of Governors in June 2004. In that connection, it 
was concerned about the SecretariatÂs heavy dependence on extrabudgetary funding for activities 
aimed at improving international cooperation in the area of emergency preparedness and response. In 
its view, greater consideration should be given to those activities in the regular programme and budget 
formulation process. 
102. Norway would like to see further efforts being made to improve the international regulations 
relating to the maritime transport of radioactive material and believed that, to that end, there must be a 
dialogue between shipping States and coastal States. It welcomed the BoardÂs approval in March of 
the International Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material and the work done so 
far by the International Expert Group on Nuclear Liability (INLEX). 
103. Norway also welcomed the initiatives taken by the Agency to promote radiotherapy and other 
medical uses of ionizing radiation in developing countries, such as the Programme of Action for 
Cancer Therapy (PACT). 
104. Today, millions of people depended on the benefits of nuclear technology in order to improve 
their quality of life. All countries had a responsibility to ensure that the present generation and future 
generations enjoyed those benefits, safely and securely. The Agency had a crucial role to play in that 
regard, and it could count on NorwayÂs continued support. 
105. Mr. ADAMOWITSCH (Germany) said that the past year had once again demonstrated the 
importance of the Agency as an essential partner in the international non-proliferation discussion. The 
Director General had mastered a difficult period in a circumspect manner, and the Agency had thereby 
strengthened its worldwide reputation as a cornerstone of global peace and stability. 
106. His country welcomed the renunciation by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya of its clandestine 
nuclear programme. The Agency was to be commended on its continuing efforts to verify LibyaÂs 
intentions and the dismantling of equipment in Libya. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 13 

107. Germany was continuing to support the verification efforts of the Agency in Iraq, including its 
efforts to complete its assessment of IraqÂs pre-war nuclear activities. 
108. The DPRK should live up to its non-proliferation commitments. Germany hoped that the Six-
Party Talks would lead to a diplomatic solution enabling the Agency to resume its verification 
activities in the DPRK. 
109. As for the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the resolution adopted by the 
Board on 18 September 2004 provided the framework for the weeks ahead, and Germany expected 
Iran to comply with that resolution in all its aspects. It was of crucial importance that Iran make use of 
the time until the next session of the Board to actively cooperate with the Agency in clarifying all 
outstanding issues and to fulfil all requests made by the Board. An unequivocal commitment by Iran to 
suspend all its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities was of key importance. Full suspension 
was indispensable for building confidence, and confidence-building by Iran was decisive in the current 
Agency-centred process. It was equally indispensable for the diplomatic process regarding Iran which 
had been started by Germany, France and the United Kingdom. 
110. Germany welcomed the current deliberations regarding further strengthening of the international 
non-proliferation regime, and it considered the reform ideas outlined in recent months by the President 
of the United States of America and that countryÂs Secretary of Energy and by the Director General to 
have been important contributions. The recent establishment by the Director General of an 
International Expert Group on Multilateral Approaches to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle had been a very 
significant measure. 
111. Germany was of the opinion that additional protocols should become the new international 
non-proliferation standard and that the Nuclear Suppliers GroupÂs guidelines should be tightened up 
accordingly. While open to further strengthening of the international non-proliferation regime, it 
believed that, rather than a further comprehensive international agreement, it might be more 
productive to consider specific, focussed solutions to the problems that were currently being faced. 
112. The process of additional protocol ratification was still too slow, and Germany welcomed all 
efforts to speed it up. The Model Additional Protocol had been unanimously approved by the Board 
and the General Conference, and it should therefore be a matter of self-respect for every Member State 
to bring an additional protocol into force as soon as possible. In that context, it was of great 
importance that further progress be made with regard to the entry into force of the Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and in the negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
113. One of the most important developments of recent months in the field of nuclear safety had 
been the adoption of the Action Plan for the Development and Application of IAEA Safety Standards 
and of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. In that context, Germany particularly 
welcomed the fact that in future the AgencyÂs safety guides would not only represent international 
good practice but also Â and increasingly Â reflect best practice. 
114. In many countries Â and not only in those which were phasing out nuclear power generation Â 
the preservation of nuclear knowledge had become a crucial issue, and Germany appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts to help preserve it. The Agency databases in the fields of nuclear safety, radioactive 
waste management, and nuclear power plant ageing and long-term operation were essential, and the 
recently established World Nuclear University would no doubt also be useful. 
115. Technical cooperation was one of the main pillars of the Agency and an important part of a 
stable international nuclear framework. In that context, nuclear applications relating to food quality 
and safety, insect pest control and human health continued to be of great importance, and Germany 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 14 

very much welcomed the fact that the Agency was planning to hold a conference at which the issue of 
de-mining would be addressed. 

116. Germany was pleased with the progress made by the Agency in implementing its nuclear 
security programme and the initiative taken by the Director General regarding amendments to the 
Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) and the convening of a 
diplomatic conference to amend the CPPNM. Also, it welcomed the fact that close links had been 
established between the AgencyÂs activities directed against the threat of nuclear terrorism and 
international initiatives such as the European UnionÂs Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of 
Mass Destruction and the G-8 Global Partnership. It would continue to make the services of technical 
experts available in support of those Agency activities. 
117. Mr. TABIBIAN (Armenia) said that his country would continue to support the work being done 
by the Agency in combating nuclear terrorism and promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 
work which called for fairness, diligence, objectivity and solidarity. 
118. Armenia was receiving from other Member States and from the Agency technical and financial 
assistance that was critical for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of its Metzamor nuclear power 
plant. Recognizing the benefits of its membership of the Agency, it had concluded with the Secretariat 
an agreement regarding a payment plan for the elimination of arrears in the payment of contributions 
towards the Regular Budget. It was meeting its payment plan obligations and was therefore looking 
forward to the restoration of its right to vote in the General Conference. 
119. Since the restart of unit 2 of the Metzamor nuclear power plant, in 1995, Armenia had hosted 
several safety missions and had been making constant safety improvements at the plant, and it 
intended to improve safety there still further. 
120. In November 2003, a review of the design safety of the Metzamor nuclear power plant had led 
to the conclusion that the condition of the plant was consistent with the requirements specified in 
IAEA-TECDOC-640 and that the progress being made in strengthening the safety features of the plant 
was satisfactory. 
121. His Government had concluded with the Department of Technical Cooperation an agreement 
regarding a country programme framework that pinpointed ArmeniaÂs needs in areas such as physical 
protection, radioactive waste management, nuclear energy legislation and regulation, and nuclear 
applications in medicine. 
122. The Agency had provided valuable support for an energy and nuclear power planning study for 
Armenia whose results, published in IAEA-TECDOC-1404, would no doubt facilitate further planning 
in ArmeniaÂs energy sector. His Government hoped that the Agency would follow up the study by 
examining the long-term feasibility of the nuclear option for Armenia, which was very concerned 
about the question of energy independence given its precarious energy supply situation and its 
geopolitical situation: it lacked domestic oil and gas reserves, and its hydropower resources were 
under great strain; and its borders were subject to a blockade, and the transit routes on which it had to 
rely were vulnerable. Armenia could not afford to ignore the continuing potential of nuclear power 
generation. 
123. Not every country saw things ArmeniaÂs way. There were countries which thought globally and 
wanted to minimize global risks through the elimination of nuclear power plants which they 
considered potentially dangerous. No doubt their intentions were good, but small countries like 
Armenia could not always think globally, even if committed to minimizing global risks. Armenia was 
receiving energy-related assistance from a number of those countries, some of which wanted it to 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 15 

renounce nuclear power generation and were offering it inducements to do so. However, expecting 
Armenia to do so was neither reasonable nor fair. 

124. Then there were countries, most of them near to Armenia, which were concerned about issues 
such as accidents that might affect them and hence about regional emergency planning and 
management. Armenia was not indifferent to those issues, particularly given its small geographic size 
and its relatively small population. It was therefore continuously striving to improve safety at the 
Metzamor nuclear power plant and cooperating with others wherever possible. In addition, it remained 
fully committed to seeking alternative sources of energy. 
125. Finally, there was a neighbouring country which was portraying ArmeniaÂs energy-related 
activities as posing security threats connected with nuclear terrorism, illicit trafficking in nuclear 
material and radioactive waste disposal. The tone and volume of that countryÂs propaganda varied 
from season to season, but his delegation was encouraged by the fact that recently the Agency had not 
been used by that country as a forum for disputes over bilateral problems. 
126. Armenia, which remained committed to the NPT, had on 28 July 2004 ratified the additional 
protocol to its NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency. 
127. Since 11 September 2001, Armenia had, in order to ensure adequate physical protection of the 
Metzamor nuclear power plant, amended its relevant legislation and tightened up its nuclear regulatory 
regime. It hoped to participate in activities financed from the Nuclear Security Fund. It intended to 
follow the guidance contained in the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources, and it had informed the Director General of its intention. 
128. Armenia, which would welcome a visit by the Director General, needed help in consolidating 
and preserving the technical skills which it had acquired through the Agency. Those skills should not 
be wasted. 
129. Mr. BUGAT (France), having congratulated Chad, Togo and Mauritania on their having been 
approved for membership of the Agency, said that the international community was facing major 
challenges in connection with the honouring of non-proliferation commitments. Also, in the face of 
terrorism risks it was having to mobilize in order to ensure the security of nuclear and other 
radioactive material and of sensitive nuclear facilities. As regards non-proliferation commitments, the 
international community needed to strengthen the international non-proliferation regime, of which the 
NPT should remain the cornerstone. NPT commitments should be honoured, with no diversion for 
non-peaceful purposes of nuclear material and equipment supplied for peaceful purposes pursuant to 
NPT Article IV. The inalienable right Â enshrined in Article IV Â of States parties to the NPT to 
benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was not questioned by France, which recognized their 
contribution to development, but that right should not be allowed to result in such diversion. 
130. In order to prevent nuclear proliferation, there needed to be stricter control of the transfer of the 
most sensitive nuclear material and equipment, with universal application of the relevant regulations, 
while those States which honoured their commitments should enjoy greater access to non-sensitive 
nuclear technologies and material and the associated services. Also, the international community 
should acquire the means to react effectively when non-proliferation commitments were not honoured 
and should ensure that the procedure for withdrawing from the NPT was not abused by States wishing 
to free themselves from their international obligations. 
131. In the months ahead, the international community would, particularly within the framework of 
the forthcoming review of the functioning of the NPT, have to demonstrate its ability to adapt to the 
current challenges to international security while upholding the principles on which the NPT was 
based. France hoped that the 2005 NPT Review Conference would result in strengthening of the NPT 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 16 

and in progress towards full implementation of all its provisions, and it had formulated some proposals 
to that end. 

132. In that context, France would follow with interest the work of the International Expert Group on 
Multilateral Approaches to the Nuclear Fuel Cycle established by the Director General. 
133. Two years after the clandestine nuclear activities of the Islamic Republic of Iran had been 
revealed, the nuclear programme of that country remained a cause for concern. International 
cooperation had resulted in progress: after the Tehran declaration by the Iranian Government and the 
Foreign Ministers of Germany, the United Kingdom and France, the Iranian Government had 
announced that it had decided to adopt a policy of full transparency and full cooperation with the 
Agency; it had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency and started 
to implement it provisionally; and it had announced that it would suspend all its enrichment-related 
and reprocessing activities. However, the cooperation on the part of the Iranian authorities had been 
far from complete. Important questions relating to past and present activities in Iran remained 
unanswered. Iran had still not ratified the additional protocol, and it had several times reneged on 
commitments, particularly with regard to the extent of the suspension of its enrichment-related 
activities. With the attitude displayed by it, Iran had failed to restore the international communityÂs 
confidence in the reliability of its commitment to non-proliferation. In order to restore that confidence, 
Iran should meet the repeated demands of the Board without reservation or delay, particularly by 
ratifying its additional protocol and fully suspending its enrichment-related and reprocessing activities. 
134. The situation regarding the DPRK was also continuing to give cause for serious concern. 
France, which deplored the actions taken by the DPRK that were seriously challenging the nonproliferation 
regime, welcomed the efforts to arrive at a peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue 
being made within the Six-Party Talks framework. It hoped that the fourth round of Six-Party Talks, 
which had been planned for the end of September, would take place soon. 
135. Fortunately, the situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was more satisfactory. Having 
pursued programmes for the development of weapons of mass destruction for some years, the Libyan 
authorities had decided to terminate them and had adopted a policy of full transparency and active 
cooperation. That had been a positive development, which could pave the way towards the 
establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East at some time in the 
future. It appeared, however, that LibyaÂs nuclear programme had benefited from an international 
network of illicit traffickers in proliferation-sensitive technology, and that was a new cause for 
concern which the international community must address. 
136. Over and above the verification obligations which it had pursuant to its safeguards agreement 
with Iraq, the Agency still had a role in ensuring the implementation of relevant Security Council 
resolutions relating to that country. France would like the AgencyÂs mandate to be re-examined, as 
provided for in resolutions 1483 and 1546, so that the role of the Agency might be confirmed. 
137. France remained committed to helping to bring about the entry into force of the CTBT and a 
start of negotiations in the Disarmament Conference on a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
138. As regards verification of the fulfilment of NPT obligations, France believed that strengthened 
and integrated Agency safeguards, which depended on a State concluding both a comprehensive 
safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, should become the standard, not only for ensuring 
maximum credibility of verification but also for demonstrating the commitment to the NPT of States 
parties. Accordingly, it had, in cooperation with various partners and in close consultation with the 
Agency, for several years been engaged in diplomatic activities designed to bring about the universal 
conclusion of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. Specifically, it had been 
undertaking diplomatic initiatives in francophone countries in Africa and the Indian Ocean region, and 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 17 

it welcomed the fact that several African States had recently brought into force or signed 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. FranceÂs own additional protocol had 
entered into force on 30 April 2004, at the same time as those of its European partners. 

139. Given the risk that nuclear or other radioactive materials could be used for terrorist purposes, 
the international community had taken steps, wherever necessary, to increase the already substantial 
protection accorded to nuclear activities. While States bore the primary responsibility for the 
protection of such activities, they needed to be able to cooperate effectively with one another. The 
Agency had an important role to play Â pursuant to its Statute Â in helping to ensure the security of 
nuclear materials and facilities, and France was supporting the implementation of the nuclear security 
action plan approved by the Board of Governors in 2002. It was providing both financial and technical 
support, particularly through activities conducted in cooperation with the Agency. 
140. On the basis of the work of a technical and legal expert group convened by the Director 
General, Austria had Â with the support of 24 countries, including France Â submitted to the 
Director General a proposal for amending the CPPNM. France would like all States party to the 
CPPNM to write to the Director General requesting the convening of a diplomatic conference to 
examine the amendment proposal. 
141. France, which intended to support the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) launched by 
the United States and Russia, welcomed the success of the GTRI International PartnersÂ Conference 
held on 18 and 19 September 2004. 
142. International action aimed at increasing the safety and security of radioactive sources had 
received considerable impetus from the International Conference on Security of Radioactive Sources 
held in Vienna in March 2003 (the Hofburg Conference) and the G-8Âs Evian Summit, as reflected 
particularly in the AgencyÂs programmes for strengthening controls over radioactive sources and 
promoting implementation of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
In 2003, FranceÂs Atomic Energy Commission had, at the request of the authorities of CÃ´te dÂIvoire 
and within the framework of an Agency technical cooperation project, removed the radioactive 
sources contained in an irradiation facility in Abidjan. It intended to carry out such activities 
elsewhere. 
143. France was engaged in preparations for the International Conference on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources due to be held in Bordeaux in 2005 under the auspices of the G-8. 
144. The importance of the AgencyÂs verification and nuclear safety and security activities should 
not overshadow the uses of nuclear techniques in fields such as human health, food and agriculture, 
water resources management and environmental protection within a context of sustainable 
development Â fields where the Agency had an essential role to play in responding to the legitimate 
peaceful needs of Member States. France had consistently supported the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programmes, providing the services of experts, accepting Agency fellows for training, 
especially in radiation protection, undertaking numerous activities within the framework of AFRA and 
ARCAL, and financing many footnote-a/ projects. 
145. France was aware of the difficulties encountered in the financing of technical cooperation 
projects and considered it vital that the resources of the TCF be assured in the most predictable 
manner possible. It had consistently paid its full TCF target share and would like to see all other 
Member States doing the same. 
146. The Convention on Nuclear Safety had led to progress in many areas, and France would like to 
see all those States with nuclear facilities which were not yet parties to the Convention ratifying it as 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 18 

soon as possible. France had already submitted its national report for consideration at the third Review 
Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Convention, which it would try to help make a success. 

147. France, which was pleased that the first Review Meeting of Contracting Parties to the Joint 
Convention had gone well, believed that only very wide accession to the Joint Convention would lead 
to general confidence in the quality of the management of the back end of the nuclear fuel cycle. 
148. Following the International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, 
which had drawn attention to the high level of safety achieved in radioactive material transport, France 
was supporting the implementation of the Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive 
Material. In doing so, however, it was concerned that basic security considerations should be borne in 
mind and that the provisions of the law of the sea should not be questioned. In the interests of 
transparency, France had requested a TranSAS mission which had taken place from 22 March 
to 2 April 2004. The conclusions had been very positive, the TranSAS team identifying 12 good 
practices which could serve as models. 
149. As regards the international transport of radioactive material, France and its partners had 
embarked upon a dialogue designed to ensure maximum transparency, providing countries with all the 
assurances which they requested and also with specific information of use to them. Again in the 
interests of transparency, the report on the aforementioned TranSAS mission to France had been made 
public by the Agency at the request of the French authorities. 
150. Nuclear power generation was clearly continuing to experience a revival of support in countries 
which had opted for it as an electricity supply source that would ensure the sustainable development of 
their economies. The recognized advantages of nuclear power generation were that: it ensured greater 
energy supply security and provided protection from the effects of abrupt variations in the prices of 
fossil fuels; it helped to limit greenhouse gas emissions; and, where it was competitive, it promoted 
sustainable development and helped to raise living standards. Against that background, the Director 
General and the French authorities had proposed the holding of a ministerial-level international 
conference on nuclear power for the 21st century; the conference would be held in Paris in April 2005. 
151. For over thirty years, France had been pursuing a diversified energy supply policy which was 
based largely on nuclear power generation and through which it had achieved a high level of energy 
independence. In 2003, 58 power reactors had accounted for almost 78% of the electricity production 
in France. The policy, decided upon soon after the 1973 oil shock, had three basic objectives: the longterm 
security of energy supplies; competitive prices; and sustainable development in the energy sector. 
Those objectives had been reviewed in 2003 during a large-scale national energy debate organized by 
the Government. The review had resulted in a consensus that FranceÂs high level of energy 
independence should be maintained and in agreement on the other principles which should guide 
FranceÂs energy policy: competitiveness; respect for the environment; the right to energy; and 
international coordination. Also, it had led recently to the adoption of an energy law whose priorities 
were: energy conservation; the development of renewable energy sources; nuclear power; and research 
into new energy technologies. That law provided for a broad energy palette in which nuclear powerÂs 
place was acknowledged. Accordingly, the French authorities had authorized the construction of a 
demonstration European Pressurized Reactor Â a reactor which would be cheap to build and would 
produce 15Â30% less radioactive waste. In the light of the experience gained with the demonstration 
model, a decision would be taken during the period 2015-2020 on whether a series of such reactors 
should be built. 
152. In the present global situation, which favoured nuclear power, international cooperation Â 
particularly within the Agency framework Â was essential. The development, through international 
cooperation, of innovative nuclear technologies was an area to which great importance was attached 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 19 

by France, which was participating in the Generation-IV International Forum and in INPRO. France 
also attached great importance to the long-term preservation of nuclear knowledge and skills, and the 
French Atomic Energy Commission had been pleased to host Â earlier that month Â the 
Agency-organized International Conference on Nuclear Knowledge Management: Strategies, 
Information Management and Human Resource Development. Looking still further ahead, France was 
a strong supporter of the ITER project, for which the European Union was proposing a site at 
Cadarache, where there was an ideal scientific and technical environment. 

153. Fifty years after the Atoms for Peace initiative, nuclear power offered a way of generating 
electricity that made for sustainable development and was protective of humankind and the planet 
generally. In that context, the Agency had an important role to play. It could count on FranceÂs 
continuing support. 
154. Mr CHO Chang-beom (Republic of Korea), having welcomed the General ConferenceÂs 
approval of Chad, Mauritania and Togo for Agency membership, expressed appreciation of the 
AgencyÂs efforts to prevent malicious acts directed against nuclear installations and the use of nuclear 
and other radioactive materials for malicious purposes. 
155. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative was important for protecting the international 
community, and his country was grateful to the Governments of the United States and Russia for 
launching it. 
156. As part of its response to the threat of nuclear terrorism, the Republic of Korea had stepped up 
its efforts to ensure the physical protection of nuclear facilities and radioactive sources. As a first step, 
the legal system had been streamlined, in accordance with the guidance contained in Agency 
document INFCIRC/225/Rev.4. Off-site emergency management centres would be established for all 
of his countryÂs domestic nuclear power plants. His country, which was making every effort to fully 
implement the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, was developing a 
radiation safety information system and a system for the real-time tracking of radiation sources using a 
satellite-based global positioning system. 
157. With the increasing demand for primary energy and the growing concern about the greenhouse 
effect, nuclear power had become recognized again as a clean and CO2-free energy source. As had 
been stated at the International Conference on Fifty Years of Nuclear Power Â the Next Fifty Years, 
held in Russia, the future of nuclear power hinged upon the development of nuclear hydrogen 
technology, of innovative power reactors, of proliferation-resistant fuel cycles and of safe management 
technologies for spent fuel and radioactive waste. His country believed that the Agency would play an 
important role in their development. 
158. The Republic of Korea had 19 nuclear power plants in operation. Unit 5 of the Ulchin nuclear 
power plant had started commercial operation in June 2004. Construction work was soon to start, at 
Shin-Kori, on a 1400-MW advanced pressurized water reactor that would go into commercial 
operation around 2011. 
159. In the Republic of Korea, work was continuing on the development of a system-integrated 
modular advanced (SMART) reactor for desalination and power generation and his country would like 
to see the Agency encouraging exchanges of information on multipurpose small reactors among 
Member States through its technical cooperation programmes. 
160. The Republic of Korea, which was participating very actively in INPRO, had carried out a case 
study to assess the proliferation-resistance of the direct use of spent PWR fuel in CANDU reactors. 
161. Recognizing the importance of Agency technical cooperation activities, the Republic of Korea 
had increased its contribution by 18 per cent, to $1 million, in an effort to help overcome the financial 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 20 

difficulties that the Agency faced in providing technical assistance. Also, it had made $500 000 
available as support for the Regional Cooperation Agreement Regional Office (RCARO) each year 
since its establishment, in 2002. It hoped that, through the RCARO, Member States covered by the 
RCA would increase their cooperation. It is also hoped that, with the support of the Agency, 
cooperative relationships would be established with AFRA, ARASIA and ARCAL. 

162. The Republic of Korea welcomed the launching of the Asian Network for Higher Education in 
Nuclear Technology (ANENT) and looked forward to its implementation through a regional technical 
cooperation project. It was very actively participating in the Asian Nuclear Safety Network (ANSN). 
163. In 1999, the General Conference had approved an amendment to Article VI of the Statute 
providing for an increase in the number of members of the Board of Governors from 35 to 43. The 
amendment had been the result of almost 20 years of laborious negotiations, and his country regretted 
the fact that, five years later, only 35 of the AgencyÂs 137 Member States had ratified it. His country 
would like to see all Member States that had not yet done so ratifying the amendment as soon as 
possible. 
164. The Republic of Korea, which had long been committed to strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime and the AgencyÂs safeguards system, would like to see all Member States 
accepting strengthened safeguards supported by an additional protocol. Demonstrating its 
commitment, it had Â on 19 February 2004 Â ratified the additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. It was the only country active in the field of nuclear power generation to 
have a firm policy of voluntarily renouncing enrichment and reprocessing facilities, despite a high 
demand for nuclear fuel. 
165. In 2003, his Government had contributed to the cause of nuclear non-proliferation as Chairman 
of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, one of the pillars of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. During its 
chairmanship, it had helped to make the Group a more effective Â although more broadly-based Â 
international export control mechanism by enlarging its qualified membership and conducting an 
extensive outreach dialogue. 
166. For decades, the Republic of Korea had set an example as a nation making good use of the 
possibilities offered by nuclear energy while fully honouring its obligation to use nuclear energy solely 
for peaceful purposes. In that context, it was very unfortunate that incidents involving nuclear-related 
experiments carried out by some Korean scientists in the past had recently been brought to the 
attention of the international community in a disproportionate manner. The experiments in question 
had been conducted without the knowledge of the Government and performed on a laboratory scale, 
exclusively for research purposes and involving only about a milligram of nuclear material. As soon as 
those incidents had come to the attention of the Government, it had notified the Agency on its own 
initiative, submitting all the relevant information acquired by it. In line with its steadfast commitment 
to transparency, the Republic of Korea had extended full, proactive cooperation to the Agency, and it 
would continue to do so, facilitating thorough verification by the AgencyÂs inspectors, in whose 
professionalism and competence it had full confidence. 
167. On 18 September 2004, the Standing Committee of the Korean National Security Council had 
made a statement in response to various misinterpretations and unwarranted suspicions relating to the 
incidents he had referred to. The statement underlined, among other things, the following: 
Â 
the Government of the Republic of Korea did not intend to develop or possess nuclear 
weapons and had not planned or pursued any nuclear programmes intended for military 
purposes, and there would be no change in its policy in the future; 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 21 

Â 
the Government of the Republic of Korea would uphold its principle of nuclear 
transparency and strengthen its cooperation with the international community to that end, 
faithfully implementing its safeguards agreement with the Agency, the additional protocol 
thereto and other international non-proliferation agreements to which it was party, in the 
expectation that the AgencyÂs verification activities concerning the nuclear-related 
experiments in the Republic of Korea would be professional and impartial, and 
cooperating fully in order to gain the complete confidence and understanding of the 
international community; 
Â 
the Government of the Republic of Korea would faithfully abide by the NPT and the 1992 
Joint North-South Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, taking all 
domestic measures necessary in order to strengthen its control over nuclear materials, and 
would participate in international efforts to that end, in the hope that the international 
community would extend its full support so that all pending issues concerning the 
Republic of Korea might be dealt with in an impartial manner based on the facts; and 
Â 
with the confidence of the international community, the Government of the Republic of 
Korea would expand the countryÂs peaceful utilization of nuclear energy, on which the 
country was very dependent. 
168. The Republic of Korea, as a founding member of the Agency, had been very active in all major 
fields of Agency work Â safeguards, technical cooperation, and safety and security. As one of the 
leading States in the area of nuclear power generation, the Republic of Korea would spare no effort in 
helping the Agency to achieve all of its goals, which were of paramount importance for the lives of all 
human beings. In so doing, it would continue to cooperate closely with the Secretariat and with other 
Member States, since only through coordinated efforts could progress be made towards a world free of 
the nuclear threat. 
169. Mr. PALACIOS (ABACC) said that during the past year ABACC had, in the context of 
strengthening the MERCOSUR, ensured that the nuclear activities of both Argentina and Brazil had 
remained exclusively peaceful, providing a basis for still closer economic, political, technological and 
cultural ties between the two countries. ABACC was proud to be contributing to peace and prosperity 
in South America. 
170. In applying the common system for nuclear material accounting and control to the 76 nuclear 
facilities in Argentina and Brazil, ABACC had in 2003 conducted 110 inspections Â an effort 
involving over 400 inspector-days. 
171. The success of ABACC in applying that system had been possible only thanks to the support 
which both countries had given to the ABACC Secretariat by providing funds and inspectors and by 
making the best consultants and specialized laboratories available. 
172. During the current year, despite various difficulties, it had been possible to build on past 
achievements, increasing the cooperation between the Agency and ABACC in various areas. For 
example, the two organizations had completed a series of activities which would enable them to apply 
full safeguards at the Atucha nuclear power plant. Their task had been facilitated by the cooperation 
received from ArgentinaÂs National Atomic Energy Commission and the operator of the plant. 
173. ABACC hoped for still further cooperation with the Agency after the finalization, in the near 
future, of guidelines for joint inspections at all relevant facilities in Argentina and Brazil Â guidelines 
which were also a prerequisite for the adoption by ABACC and the Agency of procedures of the ÂNew 
Partnership ApproachÂ type. In that connection, it was important to strengthen communications 
between both organizations. 

GC(48)/OR.3 
21 September 2004, Page 22 

174. The imminent start-up of a commercial uranium enrichment plant in the region covered by it 
presented ABACC with a new safeguards challenge. The ABACC Secretariat had developed a 
safeguards approach, based on perimeter control, for the plantÂs first two cascades which would ensure 
that safeguards were applied efficiently and effectively and that the operator was able to maintain 
commercial and technological confidentiality during the first phase. ABACCÂs approach had been 
negotiated with the Brazilian authorities and was ready for implementation. 
175. It was, however, important that the Agency, ABACC and BrazilÂs Nuclear Energy Commission 
arrive at a suitable overall approach for that plant, within the framework of the Quadripartite 
Agreement. Following a technical meeting which had been held the previous week, he was confident 
that the resumption of an open and constructive dialogue would soon result in an approach which 
satisfied all parties. 
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (continued) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Mr. DE ESTEBAN (European Commission) said that the Commission continued to attach great 
importance to security of power supplies. The Euratom Supply Agency continued to monitor the 
security of supply of nuclear fuel and raw materials, and the uranium market. The great disparity 
between global consumption and production on the natural uranium market remained a cause for 
concern; secondary sources were currently being used to address the problem. Thus, a clear security of 
supply strategy was need, as the Euratom Supply Agency had been advocating for years. 
2. Security of supply of nuclear power was directly linked to the safety of nuclear facilities. On 30 
January 2003, the Commission had adopted two proposals for directives, one on safety of nuclear 
installations and one on safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. Although those 
proposals were supported by the majority of member countries, unfortunately they had not attracted 
the qualified majority needed in the Council for their adoption. The Commission felt it was essential to 
preserve the legally binding nature of those proposals. Community competence in the nuclear safety 
area had been confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Therefore the 
Commission had adopted revised versions of the directive proposals on 8 September 2004 
incorporating amendments by the European Parliament and elements from discussions in the Council. 
With regard to the proposal on the safety of nuclear installations, the Commission remained 
committed to the community-wide application of the rules and principles of the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and to the establishment of a common nuclear safety evaluation system in each 
member country. With regard to the proposal on radioactive waste management, the Commission was 
committed to making it obligatory for every member country to establish a programme with deadlines 
for the final disposal of waste, and to strengthening research and development in that area. The 
Commission hoped that the Council would discuss the amended proposals quickly so that they could 
be adopted as soon as possible. 
3. In the field of transport of radioactive material, the Commission aimed to ensure the safety and 
security of transport of material and to improve it where necessary, with assistance and support from 
members. It supported and was following closely the development of the INES scale for transport in 
the hope that it would provide a simple tool for evaluating incidents. It would be studying carefully the 
conclusions of the report on refusals to transport radioactive material for medical or industrial use with 
a view to proposing solutions. 
4. Nuclear safety was a high priority for the European Union and had been a key issue in the 
accession negotiations with the new members. Following discussions with the Commission, Bulgaria, 
Lithuania and Slovakia had committed themselves to the early shutdown of some nuclear reactors 
which it was thought could not be upgraded at reasonable cost. The Community had provided 
considerable financial assistance to help those countries prepare for the dismantling of the units 
concerned. Since 1990, mainly through the Phare nuclear safety programme, the Community had 
made a significant contribution to international efforts to improve nuclear safety in Central and 
Eastern Europe. The Phare nuclear safety programme in 2003 had been the last for the new members 
of the European Union, but Bulgaria and Romania would continue to receive support for some time. 
Under the TACIS programme, a billion euros had been invested in nuclear safety in CIS countries 
since 1991 focusing on the promotion of a safety culture, management of spent fuel and nuclear waste 
and the dismantling of nuclear facilities. The European Union had also contributed to international 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 2 

initiatives such as the closure of Chernobyl and the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership. It 
had been the main contributor to the Chernobyl ÂShelterÂ project and had helped improve the safety of 
several power plants in Russia and Ukraine. The Commission had worked closely with the Ukrainian 
authorities on the upgrading of the Khmelnitski-2 and Rovno-4 reactors. That work would be 
co-financed by Euratom and the EBRD. Close collaboration with the IAEA and international donors 
had been important for those efforts and greatly appreciated. 

5. Since 11 September 2001, concern had increased that nuclear power plants could be targeted by 
terrorists and the European Union therefore attached great importance to security. Community 
activities in the near future would focus on harmonizing measures to ensure the security of production 
facilities and storage of spent fuel, establishing binding legal instruments, monitoring the effective 
implementation of those tools and harmonization measures at European level, ongoing dialogue with 
national bodies responsible for security and with operators, and cooperation with international 
organizations. 
6. The Commission shared the international communityÂs concerns about the safety and security of 
radioactive sources and was convinced that greater vigilance was needed in that area. It had therefore 
originated a directive on the control of high-activity sealed radioactive sources and orphan sources 
which had been adopted by the Council in December 2003. The Commission was ready to work with 
the Agency to help prevent the damage that incorrect use of radioactive sources could cause to human 
health, the environment and even the economies of European Union members. 
7. The Commission had adopted two proposals for Council decisions in August 2004 with a view 
to the Community adhering to the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention. 
Those proposals, which were currently under review by the Council, took account of the CommunityÂs 
competences in the areas of early notification and assistance, and of the mechanism established 
in 2001 to promote greater cooperation in emergency interventions relating to civil protection. The 
European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange System had expanded as a result of 
the enlargement of the Union. It was currently in force in the 25 member countries as well as in 
Switzerland, Bulgaria and Romania. 
8. The Commission and the Agency cooperated most closely in the area of nuclear safeguards. The 
European Union had finalized the relevant procedures and had announced to the AgencyÂs Director 
General on 30 April 2004 that its member countries and the Commission were ready to apply 
additional protocols. The Commission supported the universal implementation of that excellent tool. 
The next challenge would be the accession of the new members to the European Union safeguards 
agreement contained in INFCIRC/193 and the protocol thereto, which should begin early in 2005. As 
part of its ongoing efforts to promote efficiency as well as effectiveness, the Commission continued to 
modify its inspection effort in the light of the actual risks in order to avoid wastage of resources. 
9. European legislation continued to aim for a high level of radiation protection for the public and 
the workforce through the appropriate application of the Basic Safety Standards. 
10. Euratom supported joint research by institutes in Europe in the fields of radioactive waste 
management (geological disposal, separation and transmutation), radiation protection (for example 
low-dose effects, emergency assistance management and medical exposure), safety of reactors and 
innovative reactors. Euratom had joined the Generation IV International Forum. Education and 
training were also important. Approximately 20 large-scale projects had been launched or were under 
negotiation under the Sixth Framework Programme for 2002Â2006. The programmeÂs total budget 
allocated Â200 million to that sector alone. All R&D activities on nuclear fusion in member 
countries and in Switzerland had been integrated in a single European programme whose total budget 
was Â750 million.

11. The Commission had always supported international cooperation in the nuclear field. The 
European Union had concluded bilateral agreements with a number of Agency Member States and was 
negotiating with many others. 
12. The Community had acceded to the Convention on Nuclear Safety in 2000. The instruments of 
accession had included a declaration of competence which had been deposited with the AgencyÂs 
Director General. A Court of Justice ruling in December 2002 had recognized the additional 
Community competence in the area covered by the Convention. A new, amended declaration which 
also announced the enlargement of the Union had been deposited with the Director General in 
May 2004. The Commission was committed to making an active contribution to the third meeting of 
the Contracting Parties in March 2005. 
13. Negotiations were under way on the implementation of the ITER project among the six 
countries involved and the European Union hoped the programme would be implemented on an 
international collaborative basis under conditions that would bring the greatest benefits for all. The 
assistance provided by the Agency in that regard was greatly appreciated. The Council of the 
European Union had adopted a joint action on support for IAEA activities under its nuclear security 
programme and in the framework of the implementation of the EU strategy against proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction in May 2004. That involved a set of projects whose financial 
implementation would be managed by the Commission and which were aimed at strengthening 
physical protection of nuclear and other radioactive material during use, storage and transport and 
physical protection of nuclear installations, maintaining the security of radioactive material in nonnuclear 
applications, and maintaining the capability of States to detect and combat trafficking. That 
initiative would cost a total of over Â3.3 million and it focussed mainly on south-eastern Europe and 
Central Asia. 
14. Mr. SEBETELA (Botswana) recalled that his country had become a member of the Agency in 
January 2002. It had pursued Agency membership because it was interested in using nuclear science 
and technology to promote sustainable economic growth and development, in particular by increasing 
agricultural production, improving health care, providing access to safe drinking water, and promoting 
industrial development and environmental protection. The Agency also played a vital role in 
promoting safety and security in the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The Government of Botswana had 
embarked on an aggressive programme to meet Agency obligations. Thus, the capacity of the Ministry 
of Communications, Science and Technology had been strengthened, plans were being made to 
establish a regulatory framework, including an independent regulatory body, and practical steps were 
being taken to sign the NPT and an additional protocol. Furthermore, an unknown number of radiation 
sources with unknown specifications existed in Botswana and they had to be registered and strictly 
controlled in accordance with Agency guidelines. Similarly, the problem of nuclear waste disposal 
needed to be addressed. 
15. The agricultural sector remained an important source of food in Botswana and provided income, 
employment and investment opportunities for a significant part of the population in rural areas. There 
were many obstacles to its development, such as drought, insect pests and plant and animal diseases. 
The introduction of nuclear-based pest control technologies was providing an environmentally friendly 
solution. 
16. His Government attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme 
and, in particular, to use of the SIT for area-wide tsetse control. With the AgencyÂs assistance more 
sensitive tsetse monitoring techniques had been developed. Botswana also continued to benefit from 
expert missions, the provision of equipment and institutional support and capacity building through 
fellowships, short-term training, scientific visits and staff secondments.

17. Nuclear medicine was also being developed in Botswana. The Gaborone Oncology Centre was 
equipped to provide treatment using external beam radiotherapy. However, it lacked facilities for 
brachytherapy, resulting in patients being referred to South Africa for costly specialist treatment. 
Diagnostic equipment was also not available. Over 90% of patients passing through the Oncology 
Centre each year would benefit from nuclear medicine applications. Agency assistance with the 
establishment of such facilities could greatly improve the health of the population. 
18. His country was currently looking into other areas where nuclear technology could help 
Botswana achieve its development goals. It was discussing possible projects with the Agency in the 
areas of water resources management, HIV/AIDS management and nutrition. 
19. In conclusion, he stressed the importance of human resource capacity building in developing 
countries to enable those countries to exploit nuclear technology for socio-economic development and 
to comply fully with Agency obligations. 
20. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) said that global changes during the preceding decade had raised hopes of 
the emergence of a new world order based on greater justice, security and prosperity, but those hopes 
had not been realized. 
21. The NPT had been concluded on the basis of what might be termed a package deal: the five 
recognized nuclear-weapon States had committed themselves to moving towards nuclear disarmament 
and other States to refraining from acquiring a military nuclear capacity in return for an unfettered 
right of access to advanced nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. However, that deal had come 
apart and the credibility of the non-proliferation regime had been critically undermined. Those who 
clamoured for the channelling of all available humanitarian, technical and financial resources into 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons resisted any move to dismantle their own nuclear 
arsenals. Indeed some of them were bent on developing new weapons and conferring legitimacy on 
them. Moreover, some non-nuclear-weapon States had seen fit to join alliances through which they 
enjoyed the protection of a nuclear umbrella, while States that remained outside such alliances had 
become more vulnerable. 
22. States that wished to acquire nuclear technology for development were facing more and more 
restrictions. Although the ostensible aim of the systems that restricted exports of such technology was 
to prevent nuclear proliferation, the fact that they were run by a small number of States, and that their 
rules were influenced by political considerations, prevented their acceptance by many other States 
which viewed them as an attempt to perpetuate the developed countriesÂ monopoly over nuclear 
technology and as a political tool that served the interests of those countries. Moreover, three known 
nuclear States in two of the worldÂs most politically fraught regions had remained outside the 
non-proliferation regime, yet the international community remained either indifferent to or incapable 
of taking any remedial action. As a result of the double standards that were being applied by the great 
powers, some non-nuclear-weapon States were seeking to obtain nuclear weapons by hook or by 
crook. 
23. The non-proliferation regime could only be saved through multilateral action and renewed 
respect for its basic principles. Measures to prevent proliferation had to be accompanied by 
disarmament, transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and universality of the 
non-proliferation regime. Perhaps the NPT Review Conference to be held in 2005 would provide an 
opportunity to remedy the existing shortcomings. 
24. The Agency had an important role to play in ensuring StatesÂ compliance with their safeguards 
obligations, supporting the transfer of technology for peaceful purposes and sustainable development, 
and striking an appropriate balance between safeguards and technical cooperation activities. If 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 5 

the 2005 NPT Review Conference succeeded in renewing the earlier package deal, it was to be hoped 
that the Agency would implement it with its usual objectivity and professionalism. 

25. While welcoming the positive developments in respect of the Libyan Arab JamahiriyaÂs nuclear 
programme, and the Director GeneralÂs report to the effect that the Islamic Republic of IranÂs 
cooperation with the Secretariat had assisted it in understanding the nature of that countryÂs nuclear 
programme, he expressed regret over the continuing security imbalance in the Middle East region due 
to the fact that Israel, the only State with a nuclear military capability, refused to accept the AgencyÂs 
comprehensive safeguards system on the grounds that it needed such a capability to guarantee its 
security and the security of its citizens. That misguided belief had turned the Middle East into the most 
politically tense region in the world. 
26. For more than four decades, Egypt had been working hard to contain the worsening security 
situation in the region and to lay the basis for an equitable regional security regime through the 
establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and the scaling-down of stocks of 
conventional weapons. Each year it submitted a resolution to the General Conference calling for the 
application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the region which was 
adopted by consensus. However, the attitude of one State, which claimed it was unable to discuss the 
matter until a comprehensive peace was achieved in the region, prevented implementation of the 
resolutions of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference on the Middle East and General 
Assembly resolutions on the subject. The example of Europe during the Cold War showed that arms 
reduction and disarmament talks could achieve results even before a political settlement was reached. 
It was therefore necessary to start discussing the foundations of a security regime right away so that it 
could be put it into practice as soon as a comprehensive peace was achieved. 
27. Unfortunately, the international community continued to apply double standards, focusing on 
some issues in the region and ignoring others. Egypt had consistently urged world powers to put the 
same pressure on Israel as they did on other parties suspected of possessing or trying to acquire 
weapons of mass destruction, with a view to persuading it to engage in serious discussions aimed at 
the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. In that context, he 
expressed support for the Director GeneralÂs proposal to hold a forum on the subject in early 2005. 
Egypt would take part in that forum and had urged Israel to take its own participation seriously rather 
than viewing the event as an academic exercise. It also called on other States to play their part in 
ensuring the success of the forum. 
28. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities were no less important than its role in the area of 
verification, although media coverage focused on the latter. The steady increase in the AgencyÂs 
membership was due to the admission of developing countries that were keen to exploit the potential 
of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in areas such as health, agriculture, livestock production and 
water desalination, and to develop their scientific and technical expertise. All Member States should 
help ensure the continued success of the AgencyÂs role in supporting sustainable development in 
keeping with its Statute, and in transferring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes in accordance 
with Article IV of the NPT. 
29. Despite the voluntary nature of contributions to the TCF, Egypt considered that Member States 
had a political obligation to pay them in full and on time. The 2000 NPT Review Conference had 
stressed the importance of ensuring that adequate funds were available for technical cooperation 
activities. 
30. Egypt, which had been pursuing a peaceful nuclear programme for more than 44 years, greatly 
appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance in ensuring the safe and optimal functioning of the countryÂs 
second multi-purpose research reactor as well as its cyclotron and electron accelerator, in training 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 6 

human resources in the areas of nuclear desalination technology and radioactive waste management, 
and in assisting the National Centre for Nuclear Safety and Radiation Control. 

31. Egypt supported the AgencyÂs Technical Cooperation Strategy, especially the policy of focusing 
on projects with a tangible output, early consultations with Member States on project details and the 
development of Country Programme Frameworks. His country looked forward to further cooperation, 
especially on the topics of increasing crop yields, developing the desert environment, improving 
production of medicinal plants, livestock and poultry, pest control, and the production of agricultural 
hydrogel by irradiation of polymer materials. It was also eager to develop cooperation with Arab and 
African States through the Arab Atomic Energy Agency and AFRA with a view to promoting 
self-reliance and planning productive projects. It was involved in research on the use of nuclear 
technology for mine detection, especially on the countryÂs north-west coast. 
32. Lastly, he expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs work in the area of knowledge management, 
particularly through the development of INIS. 
33. Mr. NIEWODNICZANSKI (Poland) said that developments in recent years had underlined the 
importance of nuclear non-proliferation. For nuclear disarmament and international security efforts to 
bear fruit, a universal non-proliferation regime was needed supported by a credible and effective 
safeguards system that required States to account for and control nuclear material properly and 
promptly through the implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional 
protocols. The NPT and the Agency played a vital role in verifying non-proliferation commitments 
and providing the international community with assurances regarding the exclusively peaceful use of 
nuclear material and facilities. 
34. The Agency played a crucial role in planning and coordinating efforts to protect against nuclear 
terrorism and Poland firmly supported its nuclear security activities. His country had actively 
participated in the drafting of an amendment to the CPPNM and supported the proposal to convene a 
diplomatic conference to consider that amendment in the near future. The Convention was a valuable 
tool in the prevention of nuclear terrorism. He welcomed the creation of the Nuclear Security Fund to 
fund activities in that area. His country intended to make at least an in-kind contribution in the near 
future. 
35. Poland attached great importance to the role of multilateral legal instruments in ensuring the 
safety and security of nuclear material and facilities worldwide. It therefore welcomed the results of 
the review meeting of the Contracting parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management held in November 2003, and 
looked forward to the similar meeting for the Convention on Nuclear Safety planned for spring 2005 
for which Poland had already drawn up and submitted its national report. He noted with satisfaction 
the improved quality of the recently revised nuclear safety standards and expressed support for the two 
codes of conduct on the safety and security of radioactive sources and on the safety of research 
reactors, as well as for other non-binding instruments to strengthen nuclear, radiation and radioactive 
waste safety. His country also appreciated the progress made in the field of safe transport of 
radioactive material and welcomed the strengthening of international response to nuclear and 
radiological emergencies. The Agency also played an essential role in education and training 
initiatives in the safety and security area. 
36. Given the vital importance of knowledge preservation and the availability of qualified 
manpower for the safe and secure development of nuclear technologies, Poland fully supported the 
Agency's approach to the maintenance and development of nuclear knowledge. The development of 
nuclear techniques in many areas would be impossible without the coordinated research programmes, 
scientific conferences and technical studies organized by the Agency, and without INIS. Poland was 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 7 

reconsidering the nuclear power option and therefore wished to reactivate its nuclear research and 
education activities. Initiatives like the regional networks and the nuclear knowledge packages 
proposed during the recent international conference on nuclear knowledge management held in 
Saclay, France, could be very valuable in that context. The ICTP also had a vital role to play. 

37. Technical cooperation remained an important Agency activity, particularly TCDC. The 
European region provided a good example of successful technical cooperation and Poland was eager 
to continue to participate in Agency technical cooperation programmes both at national and regional 
level. He thanked the staff of the Department of Technical Cooperation for their hard work in assisting 
Member States in the region. 
38. The financing of technical cooperation activities should be assured, sufficient and predictable, 
and all Member States should demonstrate their commitment to the programme by paying their TCF 
target shares on time and in full. As in previous years, Poland was prepared to pledge and pay its 
target share. 
39. Finally, at the 2003 regular session of the General Conference, he had signed on behalf of the 
Polish Government a trilateral agreement with the Agency and the Russian Federation relating to the 
supply of nuclear fuel for Poland's only research reactor, following the approval of that agreement by 
the Board of Governors in March 2003. Unfortunately, that agreement had so far not been signed by 
the other two parties and therefore the decision of the Board had not yet entered into force. 
40. Mr. AL-JASEM (Kuwait) said that the role of nuclear power in meeting the growing global 
demand for energy over the coming decades would be enhanced if progress were made in addressing 
issues such as nuclear security and safety and radioactive waste management. There had been an 
accelerating trend towards the use of nuclear energy and technology for peaceful purposes, especially 
in developing countries. It was important to respect the right of those countries, as enshrined in 
Article IV of the NPT, to choose that option. 
41. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme played an important role in building the 
national capacity of developing countries and promoting the transfer of nuclear technology for use in 
peaceful applications. It was therefore essential to ensure a steady, reliable and predictable flow of 
contributions to the TCF to finance existing and future projects and programmes, including footnote-a/ 
projects. Appropriate steps should be taken to prevent shortfalls in the Fund owing to the failure of 
States to pay their voluntary contributions, and partnerships with international financial institutions 
should be given the importance they deserved. 
42. As one of the main purposes of the technical cooperation programme was to enhance the 
scientific, technological and supervisory capacity of developing countries, it was important to 
strengthen their radiation protection infrastructures in accordance with the Basic Safety Standards. 
Regional training courses in radiation protection were essential to maintain a pool of qualified national 
manpower. Kuwait planned to host, for the third time, a regional training course on radiation 
protection and safety, focusing on interventional radiodiagnosis, in October 2004 for participants from 
nine different countries. He thanked the Agency for its assistance in organizing the courses. 
43. Referring to the recommendation by OIOS that the organizational structure of the Department 
of Technical Cooperation should be made more integrated in order to enhance performance and use of 
available resources, he stressed the need to preserve the DepartmentÂs ability to function effectively 
with existing human resources, especially in the light of the recommendation to merge the existing 
five regional units into four. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 8 

44. In view of the importance of strengthening the nuclear verification system, Kuwait urged all 
States that had not yet concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency or an 
additional protocol to do so as soon as possible. 
45. Given the strategic importance of the Middle East region, security and stability were not only 
the fervent aspiration of the countries in that region but also the responsibility of the international 
community. He called on the Agency to redouble its efforts to promote the application of 
comprehensive safeguards to all nuclear facilities in the Middle East with a view to the eventual 
establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone. Although those goals were unrelated to the achievement 
of a peace settlement, the application of comprehensive safeguards would certainly help move the 
peace process in the Middle East forward and build the necessary trust. He expressed the hope that the 
forum which the Director General intended to organize would achieve its aim of creating a nuclearweapon-
free zone in the Middle East and urged the international community to put pressure on Israel 
to accede to the NPT and place its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards as a major and necessary 
step towards ridding the Middle East of all weapons of mass destruction. 
46. In that context, he welcomed the Libyan Arab JamahiriyaÂs cooperation with the AgencyÂs 
investigations as a step towards establishing a nuclear-weapon free zone in the region. He also 
commended the willingness shown by the Islamic Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Agency and 
expressed the hope that it would do more to settle outstanding issues. Lastly, he welcomed the 
continuing six-party talks aimed at reaching a final agreement with the DPRK on compliance with its 
safeguards agreement and on allowing Agency inspectors to return to the country. 
47. In conclusion, he urged the international community to intensify action against the deadly 
scourge of terrorism, especially nuclear terrorism, by compelling all countries without exception to 
place their nuclear material and facilities under Agency safeguards. 
48. Mr. POPOVIC (Serbia and Montenegro) said that, since the adoption of the Constitutional 
Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics had embraced a common 
approach to international relations and, despite differences in their needs and capacities and the 
complexity of the State structure, had achieved successful cooperation with the Agency. 
49. His country strongly supported the AgencyÂs strengthened safeguards system and its verification 
role which were essential to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Promoting the Model 
Additional Protocol would undoubtedly help overcome the recent challenges to the NPT. His country 
had decided to sign an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and called on others to do the 
same. 
50. In the interests of improving the prevention of illicit trafficking and strengthening the physical 
protection of nuclear and radioactive material, Serbia and Montenegro was preparing to accede to the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management and urged others to do the same. 
51. Combating nuclear terrorism required coordinated action. His country fully supported the 
AgencyÂs nuclear security programmes and, recognizing the potential danger of terrorist attacks, had 
arranged for the removal of the fresh nuclear fuel from the site of the Vinca Institute of Nuclear 
Sciences near Belgrade to its country of origin, the Russian Federation, for enrichment reduction as 
part of the Trilateral Initiative of the Agency, the Russian Federation and the United States. The 
assistance and support of those countries would also be needed for the removal of the spent nuclear 
fuel from the RA reactor as part of the comprehensive decommissioning programme at the Institute. 
52. As one of the AgencyÂs main pillars, technical cooperation should continue to improve. In that 
connection, he expressed appreciation for the dedicated efforts of the Department of Technical 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 9 

Cooperation, particularly the Europe Section. His country depended on the assistance it received from 
the Agency to reach its national and international goals, ranging from decommissioning activities to 
the establishment and enhancement and mechanisms in such fields as radiation protection and nuclear 
safety and security. 

53. Serbia and Montenegro had reached agreement on their proposed activities for the AgencyÂs 
2005Â2006 technical cooperation cycle, had successfully concluded a CPF in December 2003 and had 
submitted proposals for national and regional projects. The proposed projects reflected the needs of 
both republics and were in accordance with the priorities indicated in the CPF. Apart from the 
aforementioned decommissioning programme, those priorities included harmonization of safety 
standards, human health and the environment. In the Balkan region, particular importance was being 
given to establishing an effective safeguards system, physical protection of nuclear material and 
prevention of illicit trafficking of nuclear and radioactive material. 
54. Serbia and Montenegro regularly fulfilled its financial obligations, had paid its contributions to 
the Agency for 2004 in full and would make every effort to ensure that its contributions for 2005 were 
paid on time. 
55. Ms. BRIDGE (New Zealand) said that, in seeking ways to improve global safety and security, it 
was imperative that the international community present a united front and coordinate effective 
responses to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament challenges. The Agency had a vital role to 
play in that area. The risk of weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists or States 
that were not fully compliant with international treaties was an issue that required priority attention. A 
key initiative in that context was the Nuclear Security Fund, to which her country had contributed each 
year since its establishment. New Zealand had also joined the G8 Global Partnership Against the 
Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, assisting in securing the destruction of 
weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union, and had registered its support for the 
Proliferation Security Initiative. 
56. The year 2005 was a crucial one for the NPT. New Zealand was disappointed at the lack of 
progress in relation to the undertakings agreed upon at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The NPT 
was not just about States forgoing the development of nuclear weapons; it was also about disarmament 
and ridding the world of existing nuclear arsenals. Calls by States possessing such weapons for other 
States not to develop them would carry more moral authority if they were accompanied by greater 
progress towards disarmament. The 2005 NPT Review Conference offered Member States an 
opportunity to reinforce the TreatyÂs vital place in the international security regime. 
57. The DPRKÂs announced withdrawal from the NPT was of deep concern to her country, which 
would continue to urge the DPRK to meet its NPT responsibilities and to resume cooperation with the 
Agency as soon as possible. She welcomed the multilateral talks to address the problem and looked 
forward to an expansion of the common ground between the six participating countries in future 
meetings, leading eventually to a comprehensive and durable solution. She also noted with 
appreciation ChinaÂs constructive facilitating role in the process. 
58. New Zealand encouraged the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to maintain its transparent and proactive 
cooperation with Agency inspectors. 
59. The nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran continued to be of concern to New 
Zealand, since the Agency was still unable to verify that that programme was intended exclusively for 
peaceful purposes. She urged that country to recommit itself to full suspension of its enrichmentrelated 
and reprocessing activities and to abide by the resolution adopted by the Board of Governors in 
the preceding week. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 10 

60. New Zealand was fully committed to the principles and objectives of the Code of Conduct on 
the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. It was also encouraged by the progress made on the 
safety and security of transport of radioactive material since the international conference on that 
subject held in July 2003. The Secretariat should pursue implementation of all areas of the action plan 
on the latter topic, including those relating to liability and communication, and Member States should 
cooperate fully with the Secretariat to that end. In that connection, she welcomed the TranSAS 
mission to France in March 2004 and JapanÂs request for a TranSAS mission. New Zealand looked 
forward to the continuation of the work of INLEX on the overall liability regime, including its 
examination of any serious gaps in the regime. New Zealand and other countries in the region 
remained concerned about the possibility of an incident causing serious environmental damage and, 
even without a release of radiation, significant economic loss. An effective global liability regime had 
to make provision for adequate compensation in such a situation. Coastal States should also be 
provided with advance information about shipments of radioactive material, since such information 
could contribute to the safety of shipments and the effectiveness and timeliness of any response to an 
incident. 
61. One of the 13 practical steps to disarmament agreed upon at the 2000 NPT Review Conference 
had been the early entry into force of the CTBT. New Zealand, which remained fully committed to 
that Treaty, was concerned that the prospects for its entry into force had not improved. As a further 
demonstration of its support for that objective, it would be signing the Joint Ministerial Declaration in 
support of the Treaty during the current week in New York. 
62. New Zealand supported the NPT principle that others should have access to nuclear technology 
for peaceful uses, especially civilian applications. However, it did not believe that nuclear power was 
compatible with the concept of sustainable development, given the long-term financial and ecological 
costs of nuclear waste. Although New Zealand was aware of its commitment under the AgencyÂs 
Statute to support all pillars of the AgencyÂs mandate, there was currently no mechanism to ensure that 
contributions to the technical cooperation programme would not go towards projects that promoted the 
use of nuclear power as an energy option. Nevertheless, her Government had announced earlier that 
year that, for the first time, it would contribute to a footnote-a/ project related to research into use of 
the SIT to combat malaria. In that way, New Zealanders could be assured that their money was not 
being used to promote nuclear power. 
63. Mr. DAINIUS (Lithuania) said that nuclear energy was becoming increasingly attractive for 
developing countries and evolving market economies because of their pressing need to satisfy rapidly 
growing demand and ensure security of energy supply. The Agency was to be commended for 
assisting Member States with the elaboration of energy studies. Major factors such as environmental 
impact and waste disposal, safety performance, physical threats and nuclear security, risks to the 
public and public acceptance thereof needed to be taken into account when deciding on future energy 
strategies. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had benefited from Agency assistance in elaborating the 
Baltic region energy study. 
64. The Ignalina nuclear power remained the main producer of electricity in Lithuania, accounting 
for 80% of all electricity generated in the country. The national energy strategy had determined the 
terms and conditions for the plantÂs early closure in accordance with the international commitments 
undertaken by Lithuania. The early closure and decommissioning of the plant was a huge challenge in 
both economic and safety terms and Lithuania therefore highly appreciated the assistance being 
provided by the Agency and donor countries, particularly France and the United States. LithuaniaÂs 
updated national energy strategy provided for continued nuclear energy generation at nuclear power 
plants that complied with modern safety requirements. Investment in the construction of a new unit 
using the existing infrastructure of the Ignalina plant would therefore be fully supported. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 11 

65. His Government was taking the necessary measures to ensure that a high level of safety was 
maintained at Unit 1 of the Ignalina plant during its operation and decommissioning. In June 2004, the 
preparation and review of the safety analysis report for Unit 2 had been completed. An in-depth safety 
assessment of Unit 2 had been performed in close cooperation with international experts and the 
Lithuanian nuclear power safety inspectorate had granted the Unit a long-term operating license. 
Safety improvements at Unit 2 were set to continue with the installation of the diverse shutdown 
system. 
66. In its safeguards statement for 2003, the Agency had concluded that there was no indication of 
diversion of nuclear material or of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Lithuania. LithuaniaÂs 
additional protocol had come into force in July 2000 and, with further efforts from the Agency, the 
national authority and the operator of the Ignalina nuclear power plant, it looked forward to the early 
implementation of integrated safeguards in the country. He encouraged countries that had not yet done 
so to bring additional protocols into force at an early date. 
67. His countryÂs approach to non-proliferation challenges was guided by the European Union 
strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction adopted in December 2003. Lithuania 
strongly advocated the universalization of non-proliferation standards and the halting and reversal of 
any proliferation programmes. It welcomed the adoption of United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1540 and would implement its provisions in full. It also took note of the objectives set out 
in the Proliferation Security Initiative. Strengthening export controls, including through informal 
export control regimes, was of crucial importance. In 2004 his country had joined the Nuclear 
Suppliers Group and the Australia Group. It also looked forward to joining the Missile Technology 
Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement. 
68. In cooperation with the Agency and other Member States, Lithuania was undertaking all 
necessary measures to improve its national physical protection regime. It highly appreciated the 
assistance provided by the Government of the United States of America with comprehensive security 
enhancement at five oncology clinics and with the installation of a security and monitoring system at 
the radioactive waste repository. It also welcomed the Global Threat Reduction Initiative announced 
by the United States Secretary of Energy and looked forward to further developments in that area. The 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania had expressed his GovernmentÂs full support for the AgencyÂs 
efforts to enhance the safety and security of radioactive sources in a letter dated January 2004 and 
amendments had been made to national legislation. The country was implementing the provisions of 
the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and, in that connection, it was 
important that the Agency continue to provide training and equipment to State border control and, 
customs authorities, and other State institutions responsible for the detection and control of illicit 
trafficking in radioactive material and for the recovery of orphan sources. 
69. Lithuania also fully endorsed the plan of activities to protect against nuclear terrorism recently 
approved by the Board of Governors and fully supported the convening of a conference to consider 
amendments to the CPPNM. 
70. With assistance from the Agency and the European Commission, Lithuania had allocated 
significant resources to enhancing and strengthening the regulatory infrastructure for control of 
radiation sources and exposure to ionizing radiation. The Lithuanian Radiation Protection Centre had 
established a national training centre. Through regional projects, Lithuanian experts had shared their 
experience in improving radiation protection at nuclear power plants and, through effective 
implementation of the optimization principle, occupational exposure at the Ignalina nuclear power 
plant had been reduced significantly. The country participated actively in the Information System on 
Occupational Exposure. In that connection, the implementation of quality systems in hospitals was 
vitally important to control medical exposure. Further Agency assistance would be needed to establish 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 12 

or improve substantially the system for control of patient exposure in diagnostic radiology, 
radiotherapy and nuclear medicine through the development of appropriate quality assurance and 
quality control programmes. Lithuania appreciated the AgencyÂs active cooperation in organizing 
fellowships, scientific visits, workshops, seminars and training courses in Lithuania and welcomed the 
AgencyÂs support for the Central and Eastern European ALARA network. 

71. Lithuania had ratified the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and, in accordance with the requirements of Article 12 
thereof, was assessing its past practices and re-evaluating the safety of its existing radioactive waste 
management facilities. The Lithuanian radioactive waste management agency had successfully 
completed the site selection process for a near-surface repository for low- and intermediate-level 
radioactive waste, with assistance from the Agency and Sweden. The establishment of such a 
repository would remove the need for interim waste storage, reduce the costs of decommissioning the 
Ignalina plant and increase safety. A national programme was also being implemented to assess the 
possibility of constructing a deep repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and long-lived 
radioactive waste. 
72. For over a decade the Agency had been assisting Lithuania with the establishment, enhancement 
and maintenance of its national infrastructure and capabilities in such areas as nuclear safety, radiation 
protection, radiotherapy and waste management. In 2003Â2004, particular attention had been given to 
regional and national technical cooperation projects on nuclear safety and nuclear power, nuclear 
security, decommissioning, radiotherapy and improvement of the regulatory infrastructure. 
73. The Agency was to be commended for the assistance it provided to Member States with the 
preservation of nuclear knowledge, nuclear education and training in all areas of nuclear technology 
for peaceful purposes. His country looked forward to further elaboration of the AgencyÂs strategy for 
the development of effective nuclear knowledge management based on the outcomes of the 
international conference on nuclear knowledge management held in September 2004 in Saclay, 
France. 
74. In the near future, an increasing number of countries would be faced with the problems of 
decommissioning large-scale facilities and, in that connection, Lithuania fully supported the 
International Action Plan on the Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities. 
75. His country had a strong interest in continued cooperation with the Agency through national and 
regional programmes, particularly in such areas as nuclear safety and security, radiation protection, 
radiotherapy and waste management. 
76. In conclusion, he announced that the Lithuanian Government would pledge and pay its 
recommended target share of the TCF. 
Mr. Moyo (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, took the Chair. 

77. Mr. TOMÂIC (Croatia) offered condolences to the families of the victims of the recent terrorist 
attacks in the Russian Federation and to the Russian Government. Such acts highlighted the 
importance of making the fight against terrorism a priority. 
78. The Republic of Croatia fully supported international activities and initiatives aimed at 
strengthening security of nuclear and radioactive material and was one of the countries that had 
requested the Director General to convene a diplomatic conference to consider the proposed 
amendment to the CPPNM. 
79. Recent Board discussions relating to the implementation of safeguards in the DPRK, Iran and 
the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had confirmed the importance of the AgencyÂs safeguards activities. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 13 

Recognizing as it did the key role of comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, 
his country had been one of the first where an additional protocol had entered into force and had been 
implemented. It welcomed the forthcoming conclusion of additional protocols by the PeopleÂs 
Democratic Republic of Algeria, Mauritius and the Republic of Serbia and Montenegro and called 
upon Member States which had not yet done so to do likewise. 

80. Croatia had also been one of the first ten countries to complete the internal legal procedures for 
the acceptance of the amendment of Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute and invited other Member 
States to follow suit. 
81. His country valued and followed the guidance contained in the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources. It had established a State office for radiation protection as an 
independent regulatory body and planned to establish a similar office for nuclear safety. 
82. Croatia valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and was grateful for the assistance 
the Agency had provided through a broad range of successful projects. Croatia continued to increase 
its level of cost sharing having contributed US $260 000 in 2004, thus reaffirming its commitment to 
the implementation of approved technical cooperation projects. He expressed special appreciation to 
the staff of the Europe Section in the Department of Technical Cooperation for their valuable 
assistance, support and efficiency in implementing projects in Croatia. An example of efficient 
regional cooperation was the assistance the Agency had provided to Croatia and Slovenia with the 
decommissioning of the KrÂko nuclear power plant. 
83. Croatian experts were attending seminars and training courses abroad, and a growing number of 
foreign experts had been offered Agency fellowships to participate in training courses and 
scientific visits at Croatian institutions, including the University of Zagreb. In 2004, Croatia had 
accepted 12 experts and 7 of those visits had already taken place. He invited the Agency to strengthen 
such activities in the future. 
84. The ability of the Agency to meet the requests and needs of Member States depended on 
financial contributions and Croatia had once again met all of its financial obligations in full and on 
time. The shortfall in payments, especially to the TCF, was worrying and endangered technical 
cooperation activities. Although it was important to take into account the ability of recipient States to 
meet their financial obligations, other criteria were also relevant when considering the allocation of 
funds for technical cooperation, such as the rate of attainment, or payments of NPCs or arrears in 
APCs. His country was of the opinion that there should be a correlation between payments (of TCF 
contributions and NPCs) and approved technical cooperation projects or funds allocated to a recipient 
State. 
85. Mr. KERIMOV (Azerbaijan) said that his country was committed to the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and universal disarmament. It had therefore acceded to the main international treaties and 
agreements on nuclear safety and non-proliferation. 
86. Azerbaijan had joined and was an active participant in the international coalition against 
terrorism. It had experienced terrorism at first hand in Nagorno-Karabakh where many thousands had 
died at the hands of the Separatists. As a result of Armenian aggression, 20% of AzerbaijanÂs territory, 
including Nagorno-Karabakh and seven other regions, were not under control of the Government of 
Azerbaijan. The existence of such areas, which were also not subject to international verification 
mechanisms, created favourable conditions for trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material and the 
unsanctioned use of such material, including for terrorist ends. All actions undertaken by Azerbaijan in 
cooperation with the Agency to prevent illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material by 
strengthening customs and border controls might be in vain unless the occupied areas were liberated 
and control over them re-established. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 14 

87. While his country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure nuclear safety, it urged it to 
continue strengthening measures to prevent all possible threats to global peace and stability. Member 
States bore a large part of the responsibility in that area and it was important to strengthen their 
national radiation safety infrastructures, to improve control mechanisms, to establish reliable physical 
protection systems and to inventory nuclear and radioactive material. The AgencyÂs role in providing 
assistance in that regard could hardly be overestimated. Coordination with Member States and 
harmonization of Agency national priorities promoted involvement and helped ensure that available 
resources were used effectively to meet the objectives set. 
88. The Agency continued to provide assistance to Azerbaijan through its technical cooperation 
programme with the upgrading of its infrastructure for radiation protection and the safety of radiation 
sources. With the active participation of Agency experts, an accounting and control system for 
radioactive material had been set up, measures had been implemented for the physical protection of 
radiation sources, regulatory and legal documents on the handling of radioactive material had been 
prepared and approved, licensing had been put in place for activities, general State standards and 
regulations for radiation safety had been prepared and measures to improve the qualifications of the 
staff of the regulatory bodies were under way. 
89. Under national projects, a national INIS centre had been established and was in operation, 
equipment was being supplied to customs services for the effective control of trafficking in nuclear 
and radioactive material, and work was under way to provide equipment and improve radiotherapy 
methods at the National Oncology Centre. Substantial financial resources had been provided by the 
Agency for those projects, but the training opportunities and seminars it provided for young specialists 
were even more valuable. The Government of Azerbaijan showed how it valued the assistance 
provided through national and regional technical cooperation projects by cooperating closely with the 
Agency and meeting its financial obligations in full and on time. 
90. AzerbaijanÂs cooperation priorities for the near future included radiation monitoring, including 
of water resources in rivers and the Caspian Sea basin, further work to equip and upgrade the existing 
long-term storage facility for radioactive waste and material and to construct new ones, and the 
introduction of modern radiation technologies in various sectors such as agriculture, medicine and 
environmental protection. 
91. In conclusion, while scientific and technical progress could be a deadly weapon in the hands of 
terrorists, science could also be used to combat the threat and the Agency had an important role to play 
in promoting peace. 
92. Ms. FREIRE DE NAVE (Guatemala) said that her countryÂs Government remained committed 
to lasting peace founded on socio-economic development for the benefit of all. Thus, the new 
administration hoped to build a safer, more transparent Guatemala with modern, effective public 
institutions, where the most vulnerable members of society were protected, with equal opportunities 
for all, a good investment climate, new businesses, sustained development and prosperity. That would 
require accelerated and sustained economic growth and access to energy supplies. Thus, new projects 
were being established to develop cleaner energy, utilizing GuatemalaÂs great potential for renewable 
energy sources. That initiative would also favour the continued promotion of the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. 
93. The Agency had proved a loyal ally in GuatemalaÂs development efforts. As a signatory to the 
Early Notification Convention and the Tlatelolco Treaty, the country was committed to fostering 
global peace, security and nuclear disarmament. Radiation safety was a priority interest and the 
national body responsible for regulating ionizing radiation, backed by appropriate legislation and the 
authority to penalize offenders, monitored the safety of radiation sources entering or leaving the 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 15 

country, the security of radioactive material and good practice in handling radioactive material. The 
AgencyÂs Model Projects in the radiation protection field had strengthened GuatemalaÂs regulatory 
authority through the support they had provided for the legislative framework governing radiation 
protection, ionizing radiation and the transport of radioactive material. The secondary standards 
dosimetry laboratory had also been strengthened and served as a reference laboratory for the Central 
American region, currently providing calibration services to El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa 
Rica and the Dominican Republic for radiotherapy. 

94. During the current year, Guatemala had hosted various activities supported by the Agency, 
including a regional training workshop on implementation of the international code of practice for 
medical dosimetry in radiotherapy where Agency experts and medical physicists from countries such 
as Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, 
Uruguay and Venezuela had shared their experiences. The most recent audit mission to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the regulatory infrastructure for radiation safety and control of occupational exposure 
had produced recommendations to strengthen the countryÂs monitoring systems which had been fully 
implemented. She encouraged the Agency to continue conducting such audits. 
95. With regard to technical cooperation, Guatemala had held a seminar-workshop on strategic 
planning to strengthen the countryÂs nuclear sector. National and regional Agency projects had 
enabled Guatemala to enhance its institutional capacity and the expertise of its human resources, to use 
nuclear technology to solve problems in the areas of health, agriculture, industry and the environment, 
and to exploit its geothermal and oil resources, contributing to improving the populationÂs quality of 
life. The Agency had assisted the health sector by providing equipment and training for medical 
physicists and had helped with the introduction of quality assurance programmes in radiotherapy at the 
National Cancer Institute. Under a regional project on geothermal energy and its environmental 
management, staff from the National Institute of Electricity had received training. GuatemalaÂs 
geothermal fields had been evaluated and it hoped to achieve an overall output of 430 MW from its 
known geothermal areas. With help from the United States and Mexico, and the support of the Agency 
and the FAO, the medfly had been successfully controlled and fellowship holders from all over the 
world had been trained in the SIT. That programme had been classified as a centre of excellence by 
the Agency and 1850 million sterile pupae were produced per week. The PetÃ©n department in the north 
of the country had been declared a medfly-free zone, which had also had a favourable impact on the 
national economy. In the medium term, Guatemala intended to focus on activities aimed at eliminating 
poverty and promoting rural development. Finally, at the fifth session of the ARCAL Technical 
Coordination Board held in her country, Guatemala had been elected President. After 20 productive 
years of ARCAL, the Government of Guatemala was very supportive of that type of regional 
cooperation. 
96. In conclusion, she urged all Member States to continue to pay their financial contributions to the 
technical cooperation programme and announced that Guatemala was making every effort to meet its 
obligations. 
97. Mr. STEINMANN (Switzerland) said that the failure of the third session of the Preparatory 
Committee for the forthcoming NPT Review Conference to agree on a work programme for the 
conference was further evidence of the current difficult climate in the area of nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation. The current emphasis on non-proliferation should not be allowed to obscure the 
equal importance of disarmament for national and collective security. 
98. Switzerland welcomed such positive developments as LibyaÂs decision to abandon the pursuit 
of nuclear weapons and the AgencyÂs conclusions regarding the absence of a nuclear weapons 
programme in Iraq. The latter example had strengthened his countryÂs determination to support the 
Agency as the only credible multilateral monitoring authority in the nuclear field.

99. On the other hand, the lack of a solution to the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula continued 
to cause concern. In that connection, he expressed the hope that the collaboration between the 
Republic of Korea and the Agency would allow the latter to clarify the situation in that country as 
soon as possible. The Agency also still lacked information on several aspects of IranÂs nuclear 
programme and, in that regard, his country supported the resolution adopted in the preceding week by 
the Board of Governors. The worrying discovery of illicit trafficking in nuclear technology also could 
not be ignored in view of the growing threat of terrorism. 
100. The comments of Member States should be reflected in the AgencyÂs draft programme and 
budget for 2006-2007 which would be submitted to the Board of Governors in November 2004. His 
country would be reviewing the draft budget in the light of the budgetary basis adopted at the 
preceding yearÂs General Conference by consensus. The costs of a possible second phase of 
strengthening the security of Agency buildings should be integrated in the Regular Budget. 
101. His Government had recently decided to ratify the additional protocol to its safeguards 
agreement and its entry into force would coincide with that of a new law on nuclear energy planned 
for 2005. That decision had been taken on the understanding that the introduction of integrated 
safeguards would avoid the useless and counterproductive situation where comprehensive safeguards 
measures were implemented in addition to additional protocol measures, and that the new measures 
introduced would not be applied mechanically or systematically. 
102. The integrated safeguards system should help improve monitoring efficiency and reduce costs. 
The recent large increase in the safeguards budget had prompted reflection and SAGSI had been 
consulted. Switzerland looked forward to hearing the Director GeneralÂs views on that matter at the 
November meetings of the Board. 
103. His country supported the Director GeneralÂs efforts to ensure that the manufacture of nuclear 
material for civil and military purposes and the storage of radioactive waste and spent fuel from 
nuclear reactors did not increase proliferation risks. It also welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision 
to establish a group of international experts to reflect on certain multilateral aspects of the nuclear fuel 
cycle. Regional cooperation in that field would only strengthen mutual confidence among States. 
However, the expert groupÂs recommendations should not run contrary to the letter and spirit of 
Article IV of the NPT. 
104. The work carried out in recent years to improve the CPPNM had been fruitful and his country 
was satisfied with the revision proposed by the States party to the Convention. He encouraged all 
States to support the holding of a diplomatic conference to amend the Convention. Any outstanding 
issues could be discussed during the preparations for the conference. 
105. He welcomed the launch of the AgencyÂs Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy. The 
Agency was right to draw attention to the foreseeable catastrophic increase in the number of cancer 
victims in the developing world. 
106. Over the preceding year, SwitzerlandÂs five reactors had operated under good safety and 
security conditions and had met 40% of the countryÂs electricity needs. Under the new law on nuclear 
energy, new power plants could be built, no a priori limit was imposed on the service life of existing 
plants and a moratorium of 10 years was imposed on new contracts for the reprocessing of spent 
nuclear fuel. The law also gave the public the right to vote on the construction of new nuclear facilities 
in a referendum. The AgencyÂs recommendations, particularly those concerning safety, had played a 
very important role in the elaboration of the new legislation. 
107. His countryÂs authorities were evaluating the documentation arguing in favour of the possibility 
of safe storage of long-lived intermediate- and high-level waste. A decision on that subject was not 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 17 

expected before 2006 and the local population affected would be consulted extensively in the 
meantime. However, international collaboration on a multinational project on storage of high-level 
waste had not been abandoned. Following the rejection two years previously of a project for 
underground storage of low- and intermediate-level waste, the site selection process had been 
restarted. 

108. Mr. PORTUGAL (Peru) said that, since the preceding session of the General Conference, his 
country had made significant progress in using nuclear science and technology to address a number of 
national problems. It had conducted successful projects on training of human resources, archaeology, 
environmental conservation and mining and had participated in various research contracts and in 
technical events organized by the Agency to disseminate nuclear knowledge and introduce effective 
standards for the safe use of nuclear energy. 
109. With Agency assistance, the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute (IPEN) had drawn up a mediumterm 
strategic plan for the nuclear sector identifying new areas for research into and the development 
and application of nuclear science and technology, such as materials science, molecular biology, 
biomining and hydrology, which should enhance the countryÂs socio-economic development. The 
projects submitted for the 2005Â2006 technical cooperation cycle stemmed from that plan. Also under 
the plan, IPEN was conducting a campaign to disseminate knowledge and was offering services and 
products in order to promote interest in academic training and scientific research, facilitate exchange 
of experience among Peruvian and foreign scientists mainly through annual scientific meetings, and 
promote better links with production sectors in the interests of using nuclear science and technology 
more effectively to meet various human needs. 
110. Besides obtaining financing for a footnote-a/ project on nuclear medicine from the preceding 
biennium, Peru wanted to implement four national projects and two regional projects. 
111. The most important of the national projects would use genetic, molecular and radioisotope 
techniques to restore and preserve alpaca biodiversity and to improve the highly productive varieties. 
It would benefit an association of farmers with small and medium-sized herds in Puno, one of the 
poorest regions of southern Peru. Besides increasing the farmersÂ income, the project would benefit 
the clothing and textile industries, and the assistance of UNIDO had been enlisted to market the 
products, a clear example of a synergy with a non-traditional donor. Under the second project, 
biomolecular and radioactive techniques would be used to recover varieties of white cotton and other 
natural colours. The availability of different types of cotton would enhance the countryÂs export 
capacity on the organic fibre market, which was highly lucrative, and would particularly benefit the 
semi-arid coastal areas. The third project, involving mining companies, would use the prompt gamma 
method and neutron activation analysis to estimate the copper content in wide diameter bores in 
Peruvian opencast mines. Peru was one of the main producers of copper. The fourth project would 
focus on the environmental rehabilitation of abandoned mines. 
112. Of the two regional projects, the first related to the peace agreement between Peru and Ecuador 
and involved characterizing the river Zarumilla aquifer to ensure it was managed in a sustainable way 
by both countries. The second project related to diagnosis of malaria and analysis of antimalarial drug 
resistance in four Andean countries. The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria would 
add 26 million dollars to the one million required from the Agency for that project. 
113. Peru also attached great importance to the strengthening of south-south and interregional 
cooperation which brought added value and additional resources to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme, in particular through contributions of new resources, goods and services and through cost 
sharing. Peru hoped to be both a recipient and a donor for six cooperation projects under ARCAL. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 18 

114. Given the AgencyÂs mission to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, he urged it to 
ensure that reliable, predictable and adequate resources were available for the technical cooperation 
programme so that it could be fully implemented, including footnote-a/ projects, thus maintaining a 
balance among the AgencyÂs main activities. 
115. With regard to radiation safety, Peru had participated actively in the preparation of the action 
plans for the safe transport of radioactive material and for the strengthening of the international 
preparedness and response system for nuclear or radiological emergencies which sought to enhance 
the application of Agency standards and guidelines and to address gaps in such areas as the liability 
regime. 
116. Turning to the security of nuclear facilities and material, he noted that Peru had received a 
second IPPAS mission in 2003. IPEN had involved the national police force, the national civil defence 
system and the Ministry of Defence in implementing the IPPAS recommendations. A comprehensive 
physical protection action plan was also being coordinated with the IAEA and a national workshop 
had been held to evaluate possible threats. It was also planned to review the national physical 
protection system for the RP-0 and RP-10 research reactors, to evaluate compliance with the 
recommendations from the previous IPPAS mission, to continue exchanging experience and to 
evaluate the possibility of establishing an international cooperation programme on physical protection. 
117. The Agency had not found any discrepancies in the safeguards reports submitted by Peru 
in 2003 nor any evidence of undeclared activities or diversion of nuclear material. His country was 
concerned that, while material subject to safeguards had remained in peaceful activities in States with 
safeguards agreements, a number of States were not part of the comprehensive safeguards regime and 
did not have additional protocols. The Agency had also recently identified further shortcomings in the 
safeguards system. Appropriate mechanisms needed to be sought to strengthen the safeguards regime 
in a spirit of dialogue and cooperation. 
118. Mr. KINGÂORIAH (Kenya) said that his Government was strongly committed to combating all 
forms of terrorism, having experienced the devastating effects thereof itself, supported bilateral and 
multilateral efforts to combat terrorism and had published its own anti-terrorism bill for debate by 
parliament. 
119. Kenya had acceded to the CPPNM in February 2002. It had also ratified the CTBT and had 
been working with the CTBTO Preparatory Commission to establish seismic and infrasound stations 
in Kenya as part of the global verification regime. 
120. Effective and comprehensive safeguards were crucial components of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime and provided an essential foundation for peaceful nuclear cooperation. Kenya 
was making arrangements to conclude a safeguards agreement and a small quantities protocol with the 
Agency. 
121. To detect any material that might be intended for use in malevolent acts, two scanners had been 
installed at the port of Mombasa. The Radiation Protection Inspectorate had stepped up its efforts to 
curb illicit trafficking and had prioritized both the creation of a database of radioactive material in the 
country and the security of such material. Assistance in those areas from the international community 
and the Agency would be deeply appreciated, including the extension of scanning activities to other 
ports of entry. 
122. The Institute of Nuclear Science at the University of Nairobi had been established in 1983 and 
was conducting research in various areas. Laboratory facilities established at the Institute with Agency 
assistance had been used by several students in the MSc and PhD programmes there. A nuclear 
instrumentation laboratory had also been established. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 19 

123. His Government had recently more than doubled the number of inspectors attached to KenyaÂs 
regulatory authority, the Radiation Protection Board, and it was spending $750 000 to upgrade the 
physical facilities of the Radiation Protection Inspectorate. Through collaborative efforts with the 
Agency, a national reference laboratory for radiological exposure had also been established, making 
intercomparison studies of personal monitoring services within and outside Kenya possible. 
124. In May 2004, in collaboration with the Agency, Kenya had hosted a two-week training course 
on radiation protection in diagnostic and interventional radiology which had given thirty participants 
from the African region first-hand experience of using quality assurance and control kits at medical 
radiological facilities. 
125. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Kenya cut across many sectors of 
socio-economic development and his country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to reallocate funds 
from regional to national programmes. KenyaÂs CPF for 2004Â2009 had been finalized and was 
awaiting signature. 
126. Kenya was participating in a project on crop improvement and management through the 
application of nuclear and biotechnology techniques. The results achieved were encouraging and were 
proving useful in the molecular characterization of crops, which should improve genetic resource 
indexing and storage of crops, and help address food security and poverty alleviation issues. 
127. The Agency had assisted the Central Veterinary Laboratories and the National Veterinary 
Research Centre in Nairobi with the introduction of the ELISA technique, improving their capability 
to diagnose and monitor animal diseases. 
128. His Government was contributing $120 000 per annum for the implementation of a Model 
Project to eradicate tsetse flies from the Lambwe Valley. The project incorporated conventional tsetse 
control techniques and the SIT in an area-wide approach and had already achieved a significant 
suppression of the tsetse population and a significant reduction of disease incidence in livestock. The 
Agency continued to provide equipment to upgrade insectaries for tsetse mass rearing, as well as 
expert missions and training. It had also procured a gamma irradiator. The project was being 
implemented within the framework of PATTEC. 
129. The use of nuclear techniques had played a significant role in providing relevant data for the 
management of major diseases in Kenya. The Agency had provided substantial assistance to the 
Ministry of Health through the National Council for Science and Technology, facilitating further 
integration of isotope techniques in national and other donor-supported programmes pertaining to 
monitoring of drug resistance in such diseases as malaria and tuberculosis. His country was grateful to 
the Agency for its continued assistance in combating those diseases and HIV/AIDS. Agency assistance 
was also needed to help establish other radiotherapy centres in Kisumu and Mombasa and to provide 
the Kenyatta National HospitalÂs Medical Training Centre with the facilities and infrastructure to train 
radiotherapy technicians and technologists. 
130. Isotope hydrology techniques played an important role in the overall development and 
management of KenyaÂs water resources. Under project RAF/8/037 on sustainable development and 
equitable utilization of the common Nile basin water resources, a one-week training course on data 
evaluation had been held in collaboration with the Agency in Kisumu in June 2004. 
131. The Government of Kenya, would be hosting a national seminar on public awareness of the 
peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology later in 2004 in close collaboration with the Agency. 
The participants, who would include policy makers, planners, researchers and representatives of public 
institutions, international research institutions, the private sector, NGOs and community-based 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 20 

organizations, would also be discussing and adopting a draft constitution for the proposed Society for 
Promotion of Peaceful Applications of Nuclear Science in Kenya. 

132. In conclusion, he thanked the Director General and the Secretariat for their efforts and 
commended the Department of Technical Cooperation in particular on the high implementation levels 
in Kenya. 
Mr. Bahran (Yemen), Vice-President, took the chair. 

133. Mr. HORVÃTH (Hungary) said that, recently, the AgencyÂs safeguards system had been placed 
under unprecedented strain. Several cases of concern had been brought to the AgencyÂs attention and 
needed to be addressed in a manner which upheld the integrity and authority of the safeguards system, 
including, if warranted, referral to the Security Council and General Assembly. He commended the 
professionalism and objectivity with which the Agency had carried out its verification activities in 
countries whose safeguards implementation was under continued scrutiny. Experience clearly 
demonstrated the value of the additional protocol, which should become a standard for all countries 
party to the NPT if the Agency was to fulfil its verification responsibilities in a credible manner. 
134. Hungary was one of 19 States with both a comprehensive safeguards agreement and an 
additional protocol in force in which the Agency had found no indication of diversion of nuclear 
material or of undeclared nuclear material or undeclared nuclear material and activities. In the case of 
Hungary, that conclusion had been reached more than a year ago and his Government stood ready to 
take the next step and move towards the early introduction of integrated safeguards. 
135. One of the major events in 2003 had been the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to 
the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. While preparing for and participating in the meeting, the Contracting Parties, including 
Hungary, had demonstrated a strong commitment to fulfilling the obligations they had accepted in 
adhering to the Convention. The review meeting had helped further improve the safe management of 
spent fuel and radioactive waste and his country hoped that a wider range of Member States would be 
represented at the next review meeting. He commended the excellent support provided by the 
Secretariat before and during the review meeting, and its efforts in promoting the Convention. 
136. As everyone was aware, an unfortunate event had occurred on 10 April 2003 at the Paks nuclear 
power plant. A description of the event, a summary of the lessons learned and an outline of the 
planned improvement measures had been included in HungaryÂs third national report prepared 
pursuant to the Convention on Nuclear Safety. That report was already available on the Internet. 
Investigations had been promptly initiated by the plant and the regulatory body, and the Agency had 
been invited to send an expert mission. The investigations and the expert mission had identified the 
main causes of the incident and the resulting recommendations had served as a starting point for major 
improvements. It was essential to prevent recurrence of such a challenge to nuclear safety. However, 
the event had not involved the technological systems responsible for normal plant operation and had in 
no way affected the nuclear safety of the plant. A thorough inspection and refuelling had been carried 
out at Unit 2, it had been started up again very recently and was expected to be operating at full power 
by the end of the year. During the same period, the country had also had to cope with the licensing 
issues related to the recovery of the damaged fuel assemblies. In view of the unusual circumstances, it 
had requested assistance from more experienced regulators in Russia and the United States. It was 
grateful for the support received, and to the Agency for providing the requisite framework. The actual 
removal of the damaged fuel was expected to take place in 2005. 
137. Hungary attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, in 
particular regional cooperation. Its accession to the European Union should not change the current 
status of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in the region. At the same time, it was 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 21 

determined to increase gradually its contribution to the TCF in several ways and had already begun to 
do so. Hungary had continued to provide strong financial and technical support to regulatory activities 
and had hosted Agency fellowship and training programmes. It would be pledging its full target share 
of the TCF for 2005 and urged all other Member States to pay their share in full and on time. 

138. The Hungarian Parliament had ratified the proposed amendments to Article VI of the AgencyÂs 
Statute, regarding the enlargement of the Board of Governors, and to Article XIV, on the move to a 
biennial budget. His country strongly encouraged all Member States to ratify the proposed 
amendments without delay in order to attain the two-thirds majority needed for the amendments to 
come into force. 
139. Ms. MELIN (Sweden) expressed sympathy for the victims of the terrorist attacks in Beslan and 
Madrid. 
140. The existence of weapons of mass destruction remained one of the greatest threats to 
international peace and security and all States should act jointly and effectively to prevent their 
proliferation. Nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament were mutually reinforcing and both had to be 
pursued energetically. In the run-up to the 2005 NPT Review Conference, States should recall that 
threats to international security could only continue to be addressed if the NPT was treated as a legally 
binding agreement whose delicately balanced commitments were complied with by all. 
141. The Agency played a vital role within the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The world would be 
a safer place once the NPT was universally applied and fully implemented, which would require the 
entry into force of additional protocols in all States. Additional protocols gave the Agency enhanced 
authority to provide assurances that States were complying with their non-proliferation commitments 
and, together with comprehensive safeguards agreements, constituted the verification standard for 
NPT safeguards. The 2005 NPT Review Conference therefore needed to make the additional protocol 
mandatory under Article III of the Treaty. SwedenÂs own additional protocol had entered into force in 
April 2004 and implementation measures were well under way. She called on all States that had not 
yet done so to conclude and bring into force additional protocols with the Agency. 
142. Increased international attention was again being directed to proliferation-sensitive aspects of 
the nuclear fuel cycle. Sweden looked forward to seeing the report by the independent expert group 
recently set up by the Agency to examine that issue. Any measures adopted needed to be broad-based, 
aimed at strengthening multilateral control, and non-discriminatory in assuring supplies of nuclear fuel 
and material for peaceful purposes. Negotiations should also begin on an internationally verifiable 
fissile material cut-off treaty to halt the production of plutonium and high-enriched uranium for 
nuclear weapons. 
143. She commended the Agency on its activities to date to protect against nuclear terrorism. A 
combination of national and Agency efforts would yield the most effective results in such areas as 
physical protection and the fight against illicit trafficking in nuclear material. 
144. Sweden remained deeply concerned over the DPRKÂs position with respect to the NPT and the 
Agency and strongly supported the pursuit of intensive and constructive efforts to find a solution 
within the framework of the six-party talks. Any solution would have to include the dismantlement of 
all the DPRKÂs nuclear weapons programmes. 
145. Her country had supported the most recent resolution adopted by the Board on the 
implementation of IranÂs comprehensive safeguards agreement, as it did the AgencyÂs untiring efforts 
to reach a conclusion regarding the character of the Iranian nuclear programme. Iran should cooperate 
fully with the Agency to resolve the outstanding issues and should resume the full suspension of its 
enrichment activities. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 22 

146. The CPPNM provided a unified approach to the protection of nuclear material and it was time 
to complete the amendment process. Her country was grateful to Austria for having initiated a 
consolidated effort to implement the proposed amendments to the Convention and supported the 
holding of a diplomatic conference for that purpose. 
147. Sweden supported the action plan for strengthening the international preparedness and response 
system for nuclear and radiological emergencies recently adopted by the Board. The action plan had 
its foundations in the Early Notification Convention and the Assistance Convention, which constituted 
an important legal framework for international cooperation and coordination in the event of 
radiological emergencies. The competent authorities identified under the Conventions had recognized 
the need for united efforts to strengthen and harmonize current international response arrangements. 
Sweden would play an active part in the future implementation of further compatible and coordinated 
international arrangements. 
148. In a letter addressed to the Director General in March 2004, the Swedish Government had 
expressed its political support for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and had announced that it was working towards implementing the guidance contained therein. 
The Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources recently approved by the Board was 
an important step towards further improving safety and security and should be endorsed by the 
General Conference. 
149. Her country strongly supported the AgencyÂs work in the field of research reactor safety and 
looked forward to the swift resolution of the outstanding issues relating to the draft safety 
requirements for such reactors with a view to their being approved by the Board in November 2004. 
The Swedish national report to the third review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention 
on Nuclear Safety would cover aspects related to research reactors. 
150. Sweden also strongly supported the AgencyÂs initiative to prepare an action plan based on the 
findings of the International Conference on the Protection of the Environment from the Effects of 
Ionizing Radiation held by the Agency in Stockholm in 2003. It encouraged the Agency to continue its 
valuable work in that area. 
151. SwedenÂs advanced programme for nuclear waste aimed at total transparency in all areas. In that 
connection, it highly valued such international reference material for post-closure safety as was 
foreseen in the draft safety standards for geological disposal of radioactive waste. It also supported the 
AgencyÂs ongoing preparatory work on the conservation and the intergenerational transfer of 
repository information. The Swedish repository for spent fuel had reached an advanced stage. A 
license application for the spent fuel encapsulation plant was expected in 2006 and one for a national 
repository for encapsulated spent fuel in 2008. It was essential for the Agency to complete its 
development of a safeguards approach for such back-end facilities in a timely manner so that Sweden 
and other Member States with advanced repository programmes could incorporate that approach into 
their facility designs. In doing so, the Secretariat should take full account of the development 
possibilities offered by the provisions of the additional protocol. 
152. Finally, in recognition of the importance that it attached to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme, Sweden had pledged its full share to the TCF for 2005. 
153. Mr. YAMKATE (Thailand) said that his country attached great importance to peace and 
security, especially in south-east Asia, and was of the view that States, in joining the United Nations 
system, reaffirmed their commitment to global peace and security. 
154. Since the preceding session of the General Conference, Thailand had made major progress in 
the fields of nuclear non-proliferation, safety-related issues and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 23 

cooperating closely with the Agency which was to be commended on the constructive role it had 
played. Thailand had also contributed to the strengthening of TCDC. It had hosted several workshops, 
meetings and training courses in Bangkok and would be holding a train-the-trainers meeting from 22 
to 26 November 2004 on radiation protection in medicine under the regional Model Project on the 
development of technical capabilities for sustainable radiation and waste safety infrastructure. 

155. His country was prepared to cooperate with the Agency and Member States in the 
implementation of nuclear safety activities, particularly those related to capacity building and 
preparedness in south-east Asia. He called on the Agency to continue working closely with Member 
States to develop national safety regulatory infrastructures and to strengthen international cooperation 
in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste safety. Thailand appreciated the support and assistance the 
Agency provided in that field but felt it could be more innovative in coordinating its various technical 
cooperation mechanisms to enhance delivery, including mechanisms under the RCA. 
156. Thailand continued to support Agency fellowships and scientific visits for on-the-job training in 
agricultural and medical applications. It also attached great importance to the promotion of a global 
safety culture and encouraged the Agency to include projects on safeguards and safety regimes in its 
technical cooperation programmes. The Agency should also identify specific programmes on radiation 
protection infrastructure, quality assurance in medical applications, food safety, the application of 
isotopic and nuclear techniques to nutrition research and water resource development, public 
information and knowledge management as part of its core activities. His country had greatly 
benefited from projects on plant mutation breeding and food irradiation. It was giving priority to 
programmes for the development and promotion of integrated resource management and building of 
human resources capacity in livestock production. The SIT and related technology had been used to 
combat fruit flies. Moreover, for many years it had been supporting the project to establish a new 
nuclear research centre at Ongkharak in Thailand. Unfortunately, that project had been delayed 
because of public concerns over the safe operation of the reactor, but the Government had decided to 
revive the project with a view to completing it by 2007. 
157. Deeply concerned about nuclear terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear material, Thailand 
was committed to working closely with the Agency and the international community to confront those 
threats. The success of international cooperation to address the threat of proliferation of weapons of 
mass destruction could be seen in the unanimous adoption of United Nations Security Council 
Resolution 1540 on 28 April 2004. 
158. His country was preparing to endorse the AgencyÂs Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources, was reviewing its domestic law and regulations with a view to bringing them 
into line with the Code and was strengthening its physical protection measures to meet international 
standards. It was also preparing to accede to the CPPNM in 2005. 
159. As a State party to the NPT and an IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreement, Thailand fully 
supported the strengthened safeguards system. The Government of Thailand was committed to the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and was currently preparing to conclude an additional protocol. 
160. Thailand strongly supported the AgencyÂs efforts to implement NPT safeguards in Iran and the 
DPRK. It encouraged Iran to cooperate with the AgencyÂs inspectors and to provide full clarification 
and transparency regarding its uranium enrichment programme. It also urged the DPRK to consider 
resuming safeguards activities with the Agency and to allow inspectors into its nuclear facilities as 
soon as possible, and looked forward to progress in the new round of six-party talks. 
161. In conclusion, he announced that Thailand would be pledging $156 550 to the TCF for 2005. 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 24 

162. Mr. ALI (Bangladesh) said that the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme was the main 
vehicle for transferring nuclear science and technology to developing countries where their peaceful 
application helped to promote development. His country was fully committed to the use of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes. 
163. Bangladesh had a broad range of peaceful atomic energy programmes which addressed 
problems faced by sectors of its national economy. In line with the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration and BangladeshÂs development goals, the countryÂs priorities included poverty reduction 
and improving access to clean drinking water and sanitation. The Bangladesh Atomic Energy 
Commission had contributed, for example, to efforts to tackle the problem of widespread arsenic 
contamination of groundwater by conducting element analyses of water samples and biological 
matrices. Bangladesh was also collaborating with other agencies in studies of underground aquifers 
employing isotope hydrology techniques. 
164. In the agriculture sector, a country-wide investigation of pesticide residues in some items of the 
food chain was under way. Other important activities included pest control using the SIT, improving 
the shelf life of various agricultural products and the sterilization of medical products using gamma 
rays. In the health sector, 14 nuclear medicine centres were currently providing diagnostic and other 
services to about 150 000 patients annually. A small unit which processed human tissues for use in 
healing burns, treating ulcers and surgery had been developed and there were plans to develop a 
full-scale tissue bank. 
165. Activities in nuclear safety and radiation control focused on regulatory control, including 
licensing and enforcement, strengthening of the regulatory infrastructure, development of human 
resources including both practitioners and regulators, and preparation of regulatory guides on various 
practices. Efforts were also under way to strengthen the regulatory framework by ensuring the 
independence of the regulatory authority. Bangladesh intended to meet the five Agency milestones and 
was encouraged by the observations made by the peer review mission regarding its achievements over 
the preceding few years. 
166. The AgencyÂs technical assistance programme had always been very important to Bangladesh 
and it was particularly grateful for the support it had received in human resources development and 
project-oriented technical assistance, which it hoped would continue and increase. Bangladesh 
intended to improve the capacity utilization of existing facilities by diversifying their activities and 
adding new ones. It planned to establish a nuclear training institute and add a number of experimental 
facilities. 
167. The RCA was a powerful mechanism for addressing the needs of its member countries. It 
provided an environment which promoted the sharing of resources, experience and expertise on a 
regional basis. It had expanded its activities and had been responsive to BangladeshÂs needs over the 
years. A number of RCA events had been hosted in Bangladesh. 
168. While it was a strong supporter of the non-proliferation regime, his country felt that a balance 
had to be maintained between the AgencyÂs promotional and regulatory activities and would like to 
see that reflected in future Agency budgets. 
169. His country had noted with concern the Director GeneralÂs statement about the status of 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It was convinced that universal adherence to those 
instruments and the NPT could help achieve the goal of non-proliferation and pave the way towards 
the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. As a party to both the NPT and the CTBT, and signatory 
to an Agency safeguards agreement and additional protocol, Bangladesh urged all States which had 
not yet done so to sign those instruments and bring them into force as soon as possible. The current 
challenges to the non-proliferation regime made it even more important for the Agency to continue its 

GC(48)/OR.4 
21 September 2004, Page 25 

efforts to achieve universal adherence to the safeguards system. The NPT Review Conference in 2005 
would provide another opportunity to renew commitments and take effective action to bring about 
nuclear disarmament. 

170. The situation in the Middle East continued to cause concern. All countries in that region which 
had not already done so should accede to the NPT and place all their nuclear facilities under 
comprehensive safeguards as soon as possible. The global nuclear non-proliferation regime would be 
strengthened by the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region. In that context, he 
welcomed the Director GeneralÂs efforts to organize a forum in the coming year on experience in other 
regions with such zones. 
171. In conclusion, the threat of nuclear terrorism posed a great danger to the international 
community. Bangladesh condemned all acts of terrorism and remained committed to fighting it in all 
its forms. It also supported the AgencyÂs efforts to combat nuclear terrorism in line with the objectives 
enshrined in its Statute. 
The meeting rose at 7.20 p.m.

7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (continued) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Mr. MOYO (Zimbabwe) said that the AgencyÂs important role in the field of international 
nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament should be strengthened. His country appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen its safeguards system and, in the light of its verification activities in 
Libya, the DPRK and the Republic of Korea, felt that it should be given the leeway to continue to 
demonstrate in an unhindered manner its usefulness as a balanced, experienced, effective and essential 
mechanism for promoting global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament and the peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy. The Agency should be allowed to execute its mandate, in accordance with its Statute 
and the NPT without hindrance, prejudice or unwarranted political limitations. It should also promote 
development and further the inalienable right of Member States to develop research into, and produce 
and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination, and should facilitate the fullest 
possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information between 
States. 
2. Zimbabwe was concerned about nuclear safety. Expansionism by any Member State was a 
threat to international peace, as was any form of terrorism. 
3. He commended the Agency on its application of the SIT to combat tsetse flies, which 
constituted one of the greatest constraints on socio-economic development in Africa. He also 
welcomed the AgencyÂs work with PATTEC, the FAO and the WHO to create tsetse-free zones. He 
further commended the Agency and its development partners on their funding of the laboratory 
research and development work at Seibersdorf on the possibility of extending use of the SIT to control 
malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. 
4. The AgencyÂs continued support for ZimbabweÂs projects in the areas of health, water, 
non-destructive testing and agriculture was appreciated. The draft CPF currently being elaborated 
should further enhance implementation of technical cooperation programmes in the country in the 
period 2005Â2010. 
5. His country was committed to establishing an appropriate legal framework for peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy, which should help it achieve milestones 1 and 2, facilitating full 
implementation of Agency projects. A radiation protection bill had become law on 3 September 2004. 
6. Zimbabwe appreciated the AgencyÂs specialist training courses, workshops and seminars. Many 
of its national experts received regular training from the Agency and, as a result, were in demand in 
both developing and developed countries. 
7. Under ZimbabweÂs land reform programme, Agency assistance in the isotope hydrology field 
was helping improve crop production. The equipment provided by the Agency for the assessment of 
groundwater aquifers in Matabeleland would help ensure year-round agricultural production. The 
Government had provided extensive financial resources for that project. Further resources from the 
Agency and other development partners would be welcome. Zimbabwe was also grateful to the 
Agency for its continued involvement in the development of bio-fertilizers. 
8. The Agency was providing assistance through a regional project with the control and 
eradication of major diseases affecting livestock within the Southern African Development 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 2 

Community. His country hoped that that project would succeed and that there would be a reliable and 
sustainable regional supply of critical diagnostic reagents and kits for combating animal diseases. 

9. His country appreciated the assistance provided with the development of isotope-aided 
molecular techniques for the early detection, treatment and control of cancer in the form of equipment, 
training and expert visits, and it fully supported the PACT initiative. The direct technical support for 
cancer therapy provided by the Agency to ZimbabweÂs central hospitals had enabled thousands of its 
citizens to access much-needed palliative and curative treatments. 
10. Malnutrition was a major problem in Africa, especially for those suffering from HIV and AIDS. 
His country welcomed the AgencyÂs project aimed at improving nutrition using isotope techniques to 
assess nutrition intervention programmes related to HIV/AIDS in Africa. It hoped that such 
intervention programmes would improve the health of the majority of people living with that disease. 
11. He commended the Agency for the various AFRA projects that Zimbabwe was benefiting from, 
including projects on the maintenance of medical and scientific instruments, strengthening of waste 
management infrastructure, development of improved crop varieties, improvement of radiotherapy, 
tumour markers and non-destructive testing. 
12. His Government and the Agency continued to work together to prioritize activities in such core 
areas as agriculture, food and nutrition, water resources, public health and the facilitation of 
international development assistance. 
13. The development of commercial energy sources was a challenge to all regions of the world and 
inadequate electricity generation had become a major impediment to the development of the African 
continent, particularly in southern Africa. Africa was still the continent that used nuclear technology 
least. 
14. In conclusion, Zimbabwe was committed to fulfilling its obligations to the Agency and had paid 
most of its outstanding contributions to the Regular Budget and the TCF. 
15. Mr. GRÃNBERG (Finland) said that, over the preceding year, the AgencyÂs verification system 
had faced an increasing number of new challenges of serious concern to the international community 
and the non-proliferation regime, including revelations of a nuclear black market network. The 
Agency was to be commended for the professional, impartial and objective manner in which it had 
managed those developments. There was an urgent need to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and it was essential that a positive and universally supported outcome be found at the 
forthcoming NPT Review Conference. Finland looked forward to the outcome of the work of the 
high-level group of experts convened to study multilateral nuclear approaches. 
16. Universal application of the Model Additional Protocol would help strengthen the nonproliferation 
regime. Adherence to the additional protocol should be made a condition of supply for 
nuclear transfers to non-nuclear-weapon States. His country had brought into force its additional 
protocol and had embarked on its practical implementation. The Finnish support programme carried 
out exercises in activities related to the additional protocol. A pilot workshop on additional protocol 
activities had been organized in Finland in April and the first full-scope workshop was scheduled to 
take place at the end of October. 
17. The potential link between terrorism and nuclear power had been given increasing attention in 
the AgencyÂs work over the preceding three years. Finland fully supported the AgencyÂs nuclear 
security action plan. It had provided in-kind support for the AgencyÂs activities and he was pleased to 
announce a new voluntary contribution of Â10 000 to the Nuclear Security Fund. Over the preceding 
ten years, FinlandÂs support for bilateral and multilateral activities, primarily in Russia, Ukraine and 
the Baltic States, had ranged from Â2Â3.5 million per year. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 3 

18. The threat of nuclear terrorism made the need to upgrade the CPPNM increasingly acute and his 
country had been one of those that had requested the convening of a diplomatic conference to 
negotiate amendments to the Convention. It had also expressed its full support for the Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
19. With regard to the AgencyÂs programme for 2006Â2007 and the Medium Term Strategy 
for 2006Â2011, discussions between Member States and the Secretariat should focus on the content of 
the programme first, and only then on the required and available resources. The elements of the 
programme should fall clearly within the AgencyÂs statutory functions and there should be sufficient 
flexibility with respect to the allocation of resources to new priority activities, even between major 
programmes. In that connection, he welcomed the package agreement of July 2003 assuring adequate 
funding for the AgencyÂs core activities. 
20. Finland attached great importance to the technical cooperation programme and had always paid 
its share of the target in full and on time. Technical cooperation projects should fall within the 
AgencyÂs terms of reference and should be consistent with national development goals laid down in 
CPFs. Furthermore, coordination with relevant international organizations, such as the WHO and 
FAO, should be enhanced to ensure that the AgencyÂs nuclear input was technically justified, relevant 
and produced sustainable results. Funding of technical cooperation activities should be a shared 
responsibility of donor and recipient countries. 
21. The project to construct a fifth nuclear power reactor in Finland had been approved by the 
Finnish Parliament after a thorough preparatory process. The contract between the operator and vendor 
had been signed in December 2003 and implementation of the project was proceeding as planned. The 
Government was expected to approve the construction licence in early 2005, and the 1600 MW reactor 
was scheduled to produce electricity in 2009. The safety objectives of the plant were higher than in the 
current generation of nuclear power plants, and the regulatory work had benefited much from the 
AgencyÂs safety activities. He encouraged the Agency to continue its work in setting modern standards 
for nuclear safety. Safety, security and safeguards were becoming increasingly interconnected and had 
to be taken together if nuclear power was to be used without problems. 
22. The continuing use of nuclear power required a robust and reliable solution for the final disposal 
of high-level and long-lived nuclear waste. While a clear majority of experts agreed that geological 
disposal was a safe concept, the process leading to the establishment of a final disposal facility needed 
to be undertaken cautiously and in a measured manner. The Finnish parliament had agreed on a final 
disposal site for spent fuel in 2001 and the facility, which was intended strictly for national use, should 
be in operation by 2020. 
23. His country hoped that FinlandÂs experience in constructing its final disposal facility would help 
the Agency when it was developing guides for spent fuel and high-level waste management. He 
thanked the Secretariat for its cooperation with the Finnish authorities in developing a nuclear 
safeguards concept for geological disposal and expressed the hope that that cooperation would become 
even more intense once the building phase had commenced. 
24. Mr. KAKODKAR (India) said that IndiaÂs atomic energy programme had come of age during 
the fifty years since the Department of Atomic Energy had been founded. The research and 
development activities led by its scientists had led to commercially viable industrial operations in the 
fields of heavy-water power reactor technology, the fuel cycle, heavy water, and electronics and 
instrumentation. The country was poised to translate its R&D attainments into commercial industrial 
activities related to fast power reactors and thorium reactors, as work continued to expand rapidly the 
national nuclear power capacity based on thermal reactors. That was in line with IndiaÂs long-standing 
three-stage nuclear power programme designed to meet its emerging large-scale energy needs. The 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 4 

golden jubilee year had been used to take stock of the DepartmentÂs achievements, and to prepare 
a road map and identify a collective vision for the future, which exercise had involved 
nearly 1500 young scientists and their mentors. A study had been conducted on the growth of 
electrical energy in India over the coming 50 years and the role nuclear power could be expected to 
play. Since all estimates for an appropriate energy mix for sustainable development over the coming 
decades included a significant proportion of nuclear power, India was determined to build on its 
accumulated national capabilities. The recent rise in oil prices had reconfirmed that nuclear power was 
cost-effective. However, the prevailing low interest rates also favoured investments in nuclear power. 

25. IndiaÂs future programme would aim to: shift to a large-scale construction programme for fast 
reactors and their associated fuel cycles as soon as possible; develop fuel cycles with a short doubling 
time; demonstrate technologies for large-scale thorium utilization; develop technologies to support 
faster growth of thorium systems; develop technologies for the co-generation of electricity, hydrogen 
and water; and work on fusion technologies. It also envisaged a strong emphasis on linkage between 
domestic education, research and technology and special emphasis on nuclear energy and radiation. 
26. The construction of the first 500 MW(e) nuclear power plant in India based on a fast breeder 
reactor had been launched at Kalpakkam. The unique mixed plutonium-uranium carbide fuel in the 
fast breeder test reactor had reached a burnup of around 125 000 MWÂ·d/t. That reactorÂs fuel cycle had 
been closed with the successful reprocessing of the spent fuel. The first 1000-second steady-state 
tokamak with superconducting toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields, which could be used for a 
number of physics investigations of relevance to ITER, was currently preparing for magnet cooldown 
and first-phase commissioning tests. 
27. The expansion of nuclear power to meet the energy needs of IndiaÂs growing economy, using its 
modest uranium and abundant thorium resources, was only possible through a closed nuclear fuel 
cycle involving fuel reprocessing and refabrication supporting fast and thorium reactors. Sufficient 
industrial-scale experience had been gained in plutonium recycling in both thermal and fast reactors to 
ensure that the objectives were met. 
28. There was an ever increasing need for safer and cleaner energy sources, and nuclear energy had 
great potential in that regard. However, the future of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy was being 
jeopardized by the irresponsible actions of a few States. All those with a stake in its future needed to 
devise policies and technological solutions based on the principle that international commitments had 
to be respected. India would collaborate with like-minded countries to achieve that. 
29. An active supporter of the AgencyÂs nuclear security programmes, India had organized an 
international training course on the physical protection of nuclear installations with the Agency in the 
preceding year, which would be repeated in the current year. It had also been an active partner in 
Agency programmes on the safety and security of radioactive sources. In the long run, the strain on 
resources caused by the funding of security programmes could be alleviated by deploying technologies 
and implementing policies that reduced inequality and promoted sustainable development. The 
AgencyÂs INPRO programme with its focus on safety, economics, waste management, sustainability 
and proliferation resistance was of crucial importance in that regard. Innovative technologies would 
have an increasingly important role to play in meeting the energy needs of developing countries and 
high priority should therefore be assigned to activities in that field. He welcomed the fact that INPRO 
was being partly funded from the Regular Budget in 2004. However, that important programme 
merited greater financial support from that source. The international conference organized by the 
Agency in Obninsk to celebrate 50 years of electricity production through nuclear power had also 
highlighted the importance of meeting current challenges through technological innovation. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 5 

30. He praised the AgencyÂs work on nuclear knowledge management. India had been conducting a 
sustained and comprehensive programme on knowledge management in the nuclear field for over four 
decades. Recent Agency initiatives such as the international conference on nuclear knowledge 
management held at Saclay were timely and should be further strengthened. IndiaÂs experts were 
working in close cooperation with the Agency in that area. 
31. IndiaÂs strength was its human resources and it had perhaps the largest pool of young talent. In 
the field of nuclear science and technology, that pool was fully competent and self-sustaining, and 
capable of supporting a growing programme by creating additional capacities and developing new 
technologies. However, his country recognized the value of international collaboration and had been 
active in WANO, in programmes at CERN and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the United 
States, as well as in Agency technical cooperation programmes. 
32. It hoped that conditions would soon become favourable for India to ratify the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety. However, currently there was a contradiction between that ConventionÂs objective of 
achieving and maintaining a high level of nuclear safety worldwide through the enhancement of 
measures and international cooperation including, where appropriate, safety-related technical 
cooperation, and restrictive practices in trade even for safety equipment. India had adopted a 
consistent, responsible approach to developing its self-reliant atomic energy programme and would 
continue to do so, and its export control framework stood the test of time. 
33. As an active supporter of Agency development programmes, India had always paid its TCF 
contributions in full and on time and would do so again in the current year. 
34. In addressing the problems faced by humanity, it was important to be proactive rather than 
reactive and to strike at the root causes rather than the symptoms. Technology was the key to success 
and strategies had to be found that facilitated its free transfer without compromising safety and 
security. 
35. Mr. FRANK (Israel) said that, in view of the challenges and dangerous revelations of recent 
years, the Agency should strengthen its capabilities for safeguarding nuclear material and facilities. 
Israel was appreciative of the AgencyÂs initiatives to address the threats of proliferation and terrorism 
and had shown its support for the Nuclear Security Fund by making a further voluntary contribution. It 
was also in the process of implementing the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources, had ratified the CPPNM in 2002 and had actively participated in the expert 
group that had prepared a draft amendment to that Convention. He welcomed the launching of the 
Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Furthermore, a new Israeli export control order had entered into 
force in July 2004 which fully incorporated the NSG trigger list and the list of nuclear-related dual-use 
equipment, materials, software and related technology. The Israeli legislation went beyond the NSG 
lists and included a Âcatch-allÂ clause. His country also supported the United StatesÂ proposal that 
Member States should not participate in decisions by the Board relating to their own cases should they 
come under investigation for non-technical non-proliferation and safeguards violations. 
36. While important, all the aforementioned initiatives were still insufficient in view of the most 
acute challenges to the non-proliferation regime, namely the attempts by some signatories to the NPT 
to develop nuclear weapons, the growing availability of nuclear technologies and material, mainly 
through illicit supply networks, the increasing interest of non-State actors in weapons of mass 
destruction and radiological weapons, and the policy of certain regimes that both sought weapons 
capabilities and supported terrorism. Thus it was not surprising that the Director General had indicated 
that a framework more suited to the threats and realities of the 21st century needed to be defined. 
37. All four fundamental stages of the safeguards process Â detection, reporting, judgement and 
enforcement Â had shortcomings. While detection of non-compliance had improved vastly under the 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 6 

additional protocol, it still required much bolstering. Detection of undeclared activities would always 
be critically dependent on intelligence provided by States, particularly where there were illicit 
trafficking networks. Much also depended on the adoption by the Agency of a Âno trustÂ and problemoriented 
culture to focus on inconsistencies under adverse conditions. The reporting of findings 
relevant to non-compliance had shown certain shortcomings, especially where non-technical 
judgement was involved. Agency reports should also appropriately reflect the fact that safeguards only 
covered part of the obligations under the NPT. The formidable political difficulties of the last two 
stages, judgement and enforcement, had been amply demonstrated at recent Board meetings. Those 
problems assumed even greater significance in view of Member StatesÂ right to withdraw from the 
NPT at relatively short notice while retaining fuel cycle capacities acquired under the Treaty. New and 
enhanced tools were required to address the new challenges. 

38. The problem of global warming and the enhanced safety and reliability of nuclear power made 
that energy source the most attractive source for the future. However, to realize that vision, a new 
synergy would need to be developed between safe, reliable nuclear power generation, overcoming 
proliferation concerns and environmentally sound waste disposal requirements. The expected massive 
expansion and global dissemination of a nuclear infrastructure to meet growing energy demands made 
that challenge especially pressing. The issue of new norms to diminish the proliferation risks 
associated with nuclear fuel cycle facilities should be discussed with an open mind. The suggested 
options included new norms designed to create better tools for facing proliferation crises when they 
occurred, and approaches to avoid the emergence of such problems by limiting the spread of fuel cycle 
facilities. Israel supported the United States initiative in that regard and commended the G8 decision 
on a moratorium on the dissemination of fuel cycle facilities until a new norm was formulated. In 
parallel, access to power reactors could be facilitated while fuel supply by recognized existing vendors 
was guaranteed. That arrangement could free countries from the economic burden of building and 
managing national nuclear fuel cycle facilities, and from the environmental burden of spent fuel 
storage. It would also ensure that those sensitive facilities were managed more safely and securely, 
thereby ensuring that the proliferation risk did not increase in proportion to the number of power 
reactors. He also commended the Director GeneralÂs decision to convene an expert group to explore 
multilateral approaches to limit the global spread of fuel cycle facilities while providing assurances of 
competitively priced fuel supplies, and called on all Member States to develop new tools to enable the 
Agency and other institutions to confront the new proliferation challenges while meeting growing 
energy demands, instead of spending time and resources on less relevant issues. 
39. In that connection, he noted that the Conference had before it two draft resolutions concerning 
the Middle East which stood out as extraneous to the AgencyÂs Statute and mission. Israel supported 
the principle of making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic 
missiles, once the political and security conditions necessary for its negotiation had ripened. That was 
not yet the case, as some States in the region did not even recognize IsraelÂs right to exist and were 
even calling for its elimination while supporting terrorist groupsÂ operations and ideologies. Israel also 
could not ignore the alarming attitude of some of those States to their international commitments in the 
nuclear domain, as reflected in recent Agency findings. It had made no secret of its fundamental 
reservations regarding the language and relevance of the preceding yearÂs resolution on the application 
of safeguards in the Middle East and had formally distanced itself from the modalities of that 
resolution. However, it had shown itself willing to join the consensus on the resolution, while 
recognizing that there was no substitute for reconciliation leading to direct negotiations and freely 
reached agreements among States in the region. During the Director GeneralÂs recent visit to Israel, 
discussions had been held on a forum on nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
40. Equally, with regard to the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat, there had been 
many alarming proliferation developments in the Middle East and other regions in recent years but 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 7 

none of them had involved his country, though many directly challenged its security. Therefore, the 
draft resolution on that issue was unfounded and an instance of cynical use of the Conference for 
political purposes, like the reservations expressed by some States regarding his countryÂs credentials. 
That cast serious doubt on the sincerity of its sponsors and their willingness to make any real progress 
towards cooperative security in the Middle East. He therefore called on all Member States to reject 
such a proposal outright. If any action were taken on that agenda item, his country would not be in a 
position to support the resolution on the application of safeguards in the Middle East. 

41. Finally, he commended the Agency for its contribution to cancer radiotherapy through its 
technical cooperation programme and expressed support for the launching of the PACT initiative 
which aimed to address the alarming cancer rates in developing countries. Israel was ready to share its 
knowledge and experience in cancer therapy, providing interested parties with practical training in 
radiotherapy, radiation techniques, quality assurance and dosimetry at leading Israeli medical centres. 
42. Mr. CAMPOS (Brazil) said that his countryÂs intensive work with the Agency since its founding 
was based on its firm support for the AgencyÂs mandate and had been fruitful for the development of 
nuclear energy in Brazil, resulting in the establishment of partnerships in the field of technical 
cooperation, the adoption of a national regulatory system and of safety standards recognized 
internationally for their excellence. 
43. Brazil was an example of how the quest for scientific and technological development of nuclear 
energy for peaceful purposes was entirely compatible with non-proliferation objectives and full 
compliance with commitments undertaken in that area. 
44. His country had been developing its complete nuclear fuel cycle capacity since 1987. The 
peaceful purpose of those efforts was demonstrated by the fact that all of BrazilÂs nuclear facilities had 
been subject to Agency comprehensive safeguards since 1994 when the Quadripartite Agreement had 
entered into force. Thus, four years before its adherence to the NPT, Brazil had already subjected all 
its facilities to international supervision and control. Moreover, its nuclear facilities were also subject 
to the safeguards established under the bilateral agreement that created ABACC. 
45. Scientific research, applied technology and innovation were indispensable for socio-economic 
development, income generation and job creation in his country, and as a means to meet the 
populationÂs social, educational, commercial and environmental needs. In todayÂs Âknowledge 
economyÂ, scientific and technological development constituted the basis for economic growth and 
development that was socially sustainable, politically democratic and economically viable in terms of 
the preservation of natural resources. His Government was at a stage where it needed to take decisive 
action to generate knowledge and technologies in areas of vital importance to the countryÂs 
development. That would have to be done in accordance with the industrial, scientific, technological 
and foreign trade policies of the Brazilian Government, and in full compliance with its international 
obligations in all areas, including in the nuclear field. 
46. BrazilÂs economic recovery would require a considerable expansion of its national 
infrastructure, which had deteriorated over preceding decades as a consequence of insufficient new 
investment. The electricity generation sector was in a particularly critical situation, since economic 
expansion was accompanied by an increased demand for electricity. His country relied heavily on 
hydroelectric power which was a finite resource and had almost reached its maximum potential. 
Therefore, diversification was essential and the Government was promoting several programmes to 
promote economically and environmentally viable alternative energy sources such as biodiesel. 
Nuclear energy played an important role and its share in the countryÂs energy mix could be increased. 

GC(48)/OR.5

47. Brazil was a peaceful country whose objective was socially inclusive development. It also had 
the necessary technical and human resources and an adequate control, licensing and research 
infrastructure for peaceful nuclear applications. 
48. The NPT was the centrepiece of the international non-proliferation and disarmament regime and 
dealt with three issues which could not be separated: disarmament, non-proliferation and the right to 
develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. His country had demonstrated its commitment to 
fulfilling the TreatyÂs objectives when it nominated Ambassador de Queiroz Duarte to chair the 2005 
NPT Review Conference. The unanimous support he had received was an unequivocal recognition of 
the professional and personal qualities of one of BrazilÂs most experienced diplomats, whose career 
had centred around issues dealt with in the Agency. It was also a sign of confidence in Brazil, whose 
tireless efforts to advance the cause of nuclear disarmament dated back to the launch of the Tlatelolco 
Treaty. His country had proscribed any use of nuclear energy other than for exclusively peaceful 
purposes and, in the Legislative Decree approving the text of the NPT, its National Congress had 
included an interpretative clause underlining its attachment to nuclear disarmament. 
49. The success of the 2005 NPT Review Conference depended upon all States party to the Treaty. 
As far as disarmament and non-proliferation objectives were concerned, a balanced result was needed 
which preserved the political gains that had been made in 1995 and 2000. At regional level, his 
country was proud of the contribution Latin America and the Caribbean had made to disarmament and 
non-proliferation through the establishment of the worldÂs first nuclear-weapon-free zone. 
50. The nuclear-weapon States could make an exemplary contribution to the successful conclusion 
of the forthcoming NPT Review Conference by acceding to the request of the member States of 
OPANAL that they withdraw their reservations to Protocol II of the Tlatelolco Treaty, and by 
extending unconditional negative security assurances to Latin American and Caribbean countries and 
to all member States of nuclear-weapon-free zones. As a member of the New Agenda Coalition, Brazil 
participated actively in efforts to bring home to the nuclear-weapon States the importance of fulfilling 
the disarmament commitments undertaken at the 2000 NPT Review Conference. The regional and 
political diversity of the members of the New Agenda Coalition confirmed the widespread nature of 
the concerns regarding the threat to international peace and security from the continued existence of 
nuclear weapons. 
51. Brazil supported the AgencyÂs activities and recognized its prominent work in the areas of 
nuclear verification, technical cooperation and nuclear safety. Those activities contributed to nuclear 
disarmament, non-proliferation and the use of nuclear energy for sustainable development. His 
Government supported international efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, including possible 
malicious acts involving nuclear material. His country had adequate legislation and efficient control 
systems in that area. It also fully shared concerns about the risk of nuclear weapons falling into the 
hands of non-State actors. Such a threat only reinforced the need to work towards the objective of 
nuclear disarmament. On the other hand, the discussion of measures relating to the possible use of 
nuclear weapons by terrorists did not justify the indefinite retention of such weapons, nor should the 
need to adopt measures to prevent terrorism have a detrimental effect on the rights of States to develop 
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In particular, no initiative in the enrichment and reprocessing 
field should undermine that right. 
52. His country assigned great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and 
was fully involved in it, both as a donor and as a recipient. Brazilian nuclear energy institutions had 
received 41 foreign students and trainees funded by the Agency in 2003. Brazil ranked among the top 
ten countries in terms of the number of Agency-funded researchers it received. In the same year, 
91 Brazilian experts had worked as specialists for the Agency and 5 training courses had been held in 
the country with Agency support. The technical cooperation programme should continue to give 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 9 

priority to radioisotope and radiation applications, particularly in the areas of medicine, health, 
industry, agriculture and water resource management. Member StatesÂ interests and needs should 
continue to be the key factor in the approval of technical cooperation projects and activities and the 
elaboration of the AgencyÂs regular programme. ARCAL had also made a strong contribution to 
nuclear scientific and technical exchange among countries in the region. 

53. He commended the progress achieved in the cooperation between ABACC and the Agency on 
the application of safeguards under the Quadripartite Agreement following the implementation of 
common data auditing at relevant nuclear facilities and the elaboration of manuals for joint safeguards 
activities and shared use of equipment. Brazil attached the utmost importance to cooperation between 
ABACC and the Agency and urged both to continue working together in order to avoid any 
unnecessary duplication of effort, improve cost efficiency and minimize potential disruptions to the 
operation of nuclear facilities in Brazil and Argentina. 
54. Mr. BUTT (Pakistan) said that his country strongly believed in the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy to promote socio-economic development and was firmly committed to its application in a wide 
variety of fields. Its experience in that area dated back to the 1960s and it looked forward to further 
progress and continued Agency cooperation. 
55. Work had commenced on the second 300 MW nuclear power plant unit at the Chashma site, 
CHASNUPP 2. Pakistan was grateful to China for having supplied that power plant in a significant 
example of South-South cooperation. The plant would be under Agency safeguards and an application 
had already been made in that connection. When operational, it would join the two other safeguarded 
plants: CHASNUPP 1, which was operating satisfactorily, and KANUPP, the Karachi nuclear power 
plant, which had undergone extensive refurbishing and upgrading during a 14-month relicensing 
outage. Notable activities had included the replacement of the plant control systems and most of the 
related instrumentation. All those activities had been indigenous except for coolant tube inspection, for 
which assistance had been received from Canada. Following licensing by the Pakistan Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority, the plant was back in operation at about 50% of its rated power. During the 
coming year, his country planned to upgrade some more safety systems, after which the plant should 
operate well at higher power levels for the next 15 years. The planned safety upgrades included the 
installation of additional redundancy in the emergency coolant injection system and another external 
and independent coolant injection system in case of a loss of coolant accident. With those changes, the 
plant would meet almost all the modern safety requirements for a CANDU plant. 
56. Owing to increasing concerns about global warming and oil price increases, there was renewed 
interest in nuclear power worldwide particularly, in the region stretching from Pakistan to Japan where 
more nuclear power plants were under construction than anywhere else. Although significant coal 
reserves had been found in his country, recent studies based on the accelerated national economic 
growth of the preceding four years predicted that more nuclear power plants might be needed than 
previously planned. Unpredictable rainfall owing to global weather pattern changes also made 
hydroelectricity less dependable. 
57. With its long experience of generating nuclear electricity, Pakistan fully recognized its 
responsibility to the rest of the world and the need to maintain the safety and security of its plants. 
Therefore, it had ratified the Convention on Nuclear Safety. However, while the developed countries 
did offer theoretical help to his country with the improvement of plant safety, they refused to supply 
the equipment and materials needed to attain that safety level, so it had to rely on indigenous 
development which was not always cost-effective. He therefore urged Western countries not to restrict 
the supply of such parts and technology. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 10 

58. Nuclear power plant operators were aware of the high standards set by the AgencyÂs nuclear 
safety standards, requirements and guides, but the latter were often implemented differently from 
country to country. Pakistan looked forward to the Agency helping countries which did not have an 
extensive indigenous nuclear power plant capability to develop a practical approach to improve that 
situation. 
59. He noted with interest the increasing activities in the areas of nuclear desalination, small and 
medium-sized reactors and proliferation-free innovative power plants as envisaged under INPRO. His 
country was keen to play an increasingly active role in those programmes, within the limits of its 
resources. However, those programmes were long-term and, to meet the urgent power needs of 
countries like his own, the international community should consider setting up Ânuclear power parksÂ 
as joint ventures at specially designated sites and subject to appropriate safeguards. 
60. Pakistan had applied nuclear energy peacefully in such areas as health, agriculture, water 
resource management, industry, environment and various R&D activities. That year it had completed 
its thirteenth nuclear medicine centre. More than one third of a million patients were treated in such 
centres annually. Work was currently under way to set up five more to cover all areas of Pakistan, and 
to ensure that they were accessible to nearly all of the population within a few hoursÂ travel by road. 
There were also plans to establish the countryÂs first PET diagnostic facility. In agriculture, PakistanÂs 
centres continued to develop new crop varieties and had set up five demonstration farms to help 
farmers use land affected by salinity. The country now needed eco-friendly biocontrol technology for 
insect pests to reduce excessive dependence on chemical pesticides. It looked forward to receiving 
Agency assistance with the setting up of the first SIT facility. It was also requesting help with uranium 
prospecting, as it viewed uranium as the oil of the future and hoped to meet its uranium needs 
indigenously. 
61. As it attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, Pakistan had 
been concerned by the financial uncertainties of the preceding year. It remained strongly committed to 
the package proposal approved by the Board in 2003 and urged all Member States to pay their 
financial contributions in full and on time. 
62. Pakistan currently had 30 operational CRPs through which it maintained active cooperation 
with the Agency. Unfortunately, it had only been awarded 26 out of the 55 CRPs it had requested the 
preceding year. Those programmes promoted exchange of information among scientists and engineers 
from developing and developed Member States and should be encouraged. 
63. Finally, in order to combat terrorism, his country had significantly augmented the already strong 
physical protection measures at its nuclear installations. It remained deeply committed to nonproliferation. 
A few days previously, it had passed legislation to control the export of goods, 
technologies, material and the equipment related to nuclear and biological weapons and their delivery 
systems. It also planned to educate and train its scientists and engineers and other officials to enforce 
those controls and had taken strict action against an illicit network dealing in nuclear material and 
technology. 
Ms. Hall (Canada), Vice-President, took the chair. 

64. Mr. CARRERA DORAL (Cuba) said that his country had always complied fully with its 
obligations, as could be seen from its commitment to non-proliferation. His Government held the 
position that no State should have the right to develop, manufacture, possess, use or improve nuclear 
weapons and that the NPT was therefore inadequate and discriminatory. Nevertheless, as a gesture of 
political goodwill and its commitment to multilateralism, Cuba had ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty, 
acceded to the NPT and signed a safeguards agreement and additional protocol, both of which 
instruments had been in force since June 2004. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 11 

65. The declaration adopted at the eighteenth session of the OPANAL General Conference held in 
Havana in November 2003 reaffirmed that the consolidation of the nuclear-weapon-free zone 
embodied in the treaty of Tlatelolco was an important contribution of the region to international peace, 
security and international stability, and was a clear demonstration of the firm commitment of Latin 
America and the Caribbean to the cause of comprehensive and verifiable nuclear disarmament and 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals and principles of the Charter of the 
United Nations. The declaration also appealed to all States possessing nuclear weapons to provide full 
guarantees to States that were members of nuclear-weapon-free zones that they would not use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons. In that context, Cuba was concerned that the power with the most 
nuclear weapons, and the only one to have used them for military purposes, was assigning extensive 
funding to the improvement and development of such weapons and subscribed to the theory of 
preventive nuclear strikes, in flagrant violation of the NPT. 
66. A recent package of initiatives purported to reduce the risks of proliferation and nuclear 
terrorism. Cuba shared concerns about the possibility of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons and fully 
supported all legitimate international efforts to prevent that. However, the only way to attack the 
problem at its roots was the total, unconditional elimination of nuclear weapons, an approach which 
those initiatives unfortunately did not adopt. Rather, they demonstrated a worrying tendency to restrict 
the peaceful use of nuclear energy in the majority of countries while in others vertical proliferation 
increased, leading to double standards, discrimination and further arms build-up. The implementation 
of any initiative or proposal within the framework of the Agency should be the result of analysis and 
transparent discussion involving all Member States, and should be strictly in line with the Statute. 
67. Turning to the implementation of safeguards agreements in certain States, he endorsed the 
Non-Aligned MovementÂs praise for the AgencyÂs progress in solving the outstanding issues raised in 
recent reports by the Director General to the Board of Governors. Every State had an inalienable 
sovereign right to the unrestricted use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as long as there was 
no evidence that it had breached its NPT obligations. Only the Agency had the mandate to verify or 
draw conclusions on any StateÂs nuclear programme, on the basis of objective information. Nobody 
had the right to prejudge a countryÂs nuclear programme or to politicize the issue. There should be a 
clear distinction between StatesÂ legal obligations and political commitments made as a demonstration 
of goodwill. Cuba hoped that technical issues relating to nuclear verification would not become a 
political issue leading to another international crisis. Furthermore, it strongly supported political and 
diplomatic efforts to reach settlements that were acceptable to all parties, that remained within the 
framework of the Agency and that respected the sovereignty of all States and the principles of the 
Charter of the United Nations. 
68. His country supported all measures taken by the Agency to strengthen international cooperation 
in nuclear and radiation safety. It therefore welcomed the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources to which it attached great importance, as evidenced by the fact that it had been 
one of the first States to notify the Director General of its intention to follow the Code. However, none 
of the aforementioned measures should be used to justify unilateral actions involving pressure or 
political blackmail in connection with trade in radioactive material, or deliberate, unjustified 
obstruction of the development of applications of nuclear techniques in any country. 
69. The use of nuclear technology had had a tangible impact on CubaÂs priority development 
programmes. Cuba attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and felt 
they should be adequately funded. It also believed in the importance of maintaining the balance 
between technical cooperation and safety and verification activities. It had systematically honoured its 
financial commitments to the Agency in spite of its economic difficulties and had continued to 
increase the efficiency of its programme management and its support for other countries, mainly 
through the provision of experts. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 12 

70. The Cuban Government had continued to support ARCAL, which it considered an important 
tool for the promotion of cooperation and exchanges among developing countries and for channelling 
technical cooperation resources in the region. Cuba had recently assumed the presidency of ARCAL. 
It was grateful for the AgencyÂs support for that programme and felt sure that it would increase in the 
future. There was a need for a broader, more effective technical cooperation programme which met the 
growing needs of developing countries, with more real commitment from all parties and adequate, 
secure and predictable financial resources. While the TCF had not increased as much as his country 
had hoped, the target of US $77.5 million set for 2005Â2006 was a step in the right direction and Cuba 
hoped to see an increase to over $78.5 million in future financial years. 
71. Finally, the he expressed the hope that seventh NPT Review Conference would provide an 
opportunity to develop a collective security system based on cooperation. 
72. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) drew attention to the global repercussions of the 
worsening security situation in the Middle East. It was no secret that the peace process in the Middle 
East had run aground because of IsraelÂs refusal to comply with General Assembly and Security 
Council resolutions, and because of the application of double standards by some powers which 
supported Israel despite its occupation of part of the territory of neighbouring Arab countries 
since 4 June 1967. 
73. The responsibility for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East lay to 
a large extent with the great powers which had a duty to address the issue of IsraelÂs sole possession of 
such weapons. International moves to eliminate Israeli nuclear weapons should begin with the 
adoption of corresponding resolutions by the General Conference and other international fora. 
Unfortunately, as indicated in his report on the matter, the Director General had been unable to fulfil 
the mandate assigned to him by the preceding General Conference to facilitate the application of 
comprehensive Agency safeguards to all nuclear activities in the Middle East region. Israel, the only 
party that threatened the regionÂs security through its possession of nuclear weapons, refused to 
discuss the idea of a nuclear-weapon-free zone until a peace agreement had been signed. However, its 
policy of indifference to a just and comprehensive peace in the region was a major obstacle to any 
progress towards that goal. The establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone depended primarily on 
Israeli compliance with Security Council resolution 487(1981), which called on it to accede to the 
NPT and place all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. It should be noted that all Arab 
countries were already parties to the NPT. 
74. The Syrian Arab Republic had submitted a draft resolution to the Security Council in April 2003 
on behalf of the Arab group aimed at making the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction, in particular nuclear weapons, and had announced to the international community that it 
would work together with other Arab States and all peace-loving nations with a view to realizing that 
goal. However, the international situation at the time had not been conducive to the success of the 
initiative. Therefore, his country had submitted the draft resolution again in December 2003 and it was 
still before the Security Council awaiting more propitious international circumstances. 
75. The Syrian Arab Republic had always been in the forefront of the fight against terrorism. 
In 1986 it had been the first to call for a United Nations conference to discuss the subject and define 
the meaning of the term. A distinction had to be made between terrorism and the struggle of peoples 
against foreign occupation. His country had made the same proposal in 1991 but to no avail, because 
some States, for political reasons, applied double standards in dealing with the issues of terrorism and 
the right of peoples to defend their land and freedom. 
76. The Israeli Government pursued a policy of terrorism vis-Ã -vis the people of occupied Palestine 
and the Golan Heights through the destruction of homes, making women and children homeless, and 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 13 

through arbitrary detention and assassinations, flouting international opinion and United Nations 
resolutions. Furthermore, nuclear reactors in Israel, which were not subject to international inspection, 
could cause a major environmental disaster. He called on the General Conference, when it discussed 
the agenda item on Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat, to bear in mind the fact that all Arab States 
wanted peace, security and stability and were working tirelessly to achieve that goal in the United 
Nations, at Arab and Islamic summit meetings and within the relevant geographic groups. He also 
called on the international community to show understanding for the regionÂs legitimate concern about 
IsraelÂs nuclear weapons capability. 

77. With regard to the Director GeneralÂs proposal to convene a forum to discuss the establishment 
of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, the Syrian Arab Republic agreed in principle to 
participate if Israel acceded to the NPT and placed all its nuclear facilities under Agency safeguards. 
78. One of the AgencyÂs most important tasks was the transfer of nuclear knowledge to Member 
States, especially developing countries. In that connection, he expressed appreciation for its work on 
the development of databases, the publication of technical documents and the training of human 
resources in the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The Agency should encourage developed 
Member States to provide more training opportunities for nationals of developing countries. 
79. The Syrian Atomic Energy Commission played a role in disseminating nuclear knowledge, 
especially in Arabic. It had recently undertaken to translate the AgencyÂs INIS multilingual dictionary 
of nuclear terms into Arabic free of charge, drawing on the services of a team of outstanding Syrian 
academics. The Commission also translated the IAEA Bulletin into Arabic. For the fifth year running, 
it had hosted an Arabic-language course leading to a diploma in radiation protection and the safety of 
radiation sources in cooperation with the Agency. Over a hundred students had already completed the 
course. It also arranged specialized training courses each year for fellowship holders and scientific 
visitors from Arab States. Moreover, it provided experts in various fields free of charge under the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. 
80. The control of radioactive sources was a national responsibility to be addressed on the basis of 
internationally agreed safety standards and guidelines, and the strengthening of regulatory 
infrastructures in Agency Member States and non-member States should enhance national and 
regional capacities in that regard. The Syrian Arab Republic had assisted with the development of a 
computer program for radiation sources and with the training of inspectors from a number of national 
regulatory bodies in using that program. It complied with the Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources adopted by the Agency the preceding year and had worked with the 
group of experts that had drafted the Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. 
81. Thanking the Agency for the technical assistance it provided under national and regional 
projects, he noted that two joint projects were being implemented under the ARASIA agreement: one 
on comparative assessment of electricity generation options and the other on strengthening regional 
training and certification capability in non-destructive testing. He urged the Agency to continue 
supporting ARASIA. 
82. Unfortunately, despite the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure the timely implementation of all technical 
cooperation projects, difficulties in respect of some training programmes and fellowships and the 
purchase of medical equipment had led to delays in the implementation of some national projects. 
83. He cautioned against allowing current international tensions to influence the ongoing need to 
facilitate the transfer of nuclear technology to developing countries for use in such areas as health 
care, industry and scientific research. The countries that provided such assistance should honour the 
commitments they had made on many various occasions.

84. A shortfall in the TCF during the preceding year owing to the failure of many countries to pay 
their contributions on time had led to a major decline in the rate of attainment in 2003. The developing 
countries had agreed to the deshielding package and had accepted a departure from the principle of 
zero real growth in the budget in return for more effective arrangements to fund the TCF, yet no 
agreement had been reached to date on a mechanism that would make the FundÂs resources more 
reliable and predictable. He expressed the hoped that the Secretariat would give more attention to the 
matter and put forward workable proposals as soon as possible. 
85. Mr. DIATTA (Senegal) said that scientific and technical cooperation between his country and 
the Agency had been conducted partially through the programmes of the ICTP in Trieste, and through 
bilateral cooperation with Agency Member States and special programmes such as AFRA. It had 
brought success in a number of areas, including agriculture, biology, chemistry, geology, hydrology, 
medicine and physics. 
86. His country had received help in the radiation protection area in the form of investment, 
equipment, and assistance with legislation, the establishment of regulatory infrastructure, the 
elaboration of a national programme for the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and 
the signature of the major agreements relating to the use of nuclear energy. Thanks to its new 
institutional and regulatory framework, it had been able to adopt a law on radiation protection 
elaborated in cooperation with the Agency, to set up a national scientific research centre and to extend 
its research activities nationwide. Currently, a science park was being established which should further 
promote research, and thought was being given to an African science agency which would facilitate 
inter-African cooperation. 
87. His country was grateful to the Agency for the opportunity to have a data centre installed which 
would permit geological and seismographic monitoring covering several African countries. The 
establishment of the national scientific research centre would strengthen groups performing research in 
atomic physics, nuclear and molecular biology and physics. 
88. He welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to decentralize training programmes and coordinate R&D 
programmes in Africa. There should be enhanced coordination between national programmes and 
AFRA programmes. 
89. Climatic anomalies, such as desertification and drought cycles, were a matter of global concern 
and all nations should work together to solve the catastrophic consequences of human behaviour. 
90. Senegal would spare no effort to strengthen its current technical cooperation programmes with 
the Agency. It welcomed the development of cooperation between the Agency and the African 
continent based on local initiatives, research and development, and existing or planned infrastructure. 
91. Furthermore, it supported unreservedly the AFRA programme and would spare no effort to 
integrate that programme in NEPAD. 
92. Mr. SYCHOV (Belarus), extending his condolences to the Russian Federation for the recent 
unprecedented series of terrorist acts, said that the latest incident had emphasized the need for the 
world community to consolidate its efforts to combat international terrorism, including the possible 
malicious use of nuclear material and radioactive sources. In that connection, the Agency had an 
increased responsibility for maintaining international stability and security. Agency Member States 
and the Secretariat had worked together successfully in many fields: improving and strengthening 
physical protection of facilities containing nuclear material and radiation sources, developing and 
introducing guidelines for the management of nuclear material, and ensuring the safe storage of 
material that could be used to produce a radiological dispersal device. Belarus attached special 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 15 

importance to strengthening the physical protection of nuclear material. Central to that were the efforts 
to amend the CPPNM. 

93. His country was concerned that the unresolved crisis in the DPRK was undermining the NPT. 
Though the six-party talks had not yet resulted in any substantial achievement, it was to be hoped that 
the constructive interaction of all participants would lead to a compromise solution that would help 
relieve tension in the Asia and Pacific region. 
94. He commended the efforts of both the Secretariat and Iran to resolve outstanding safeguards 
questions in that country. Belarus was confident that Iran would work with the Agency in a spirit of 
cooperation and transparency. 
95. The future of the safeguards system as a whole depended on how effectively the Agency dealt 
with the current crises. It should remain objective, basing its arguments on established facts, and 
should play a more active role in the search for a solution, holding consultations with the governments 
of the countries concerned. 
96. Belarus participated actively in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and appreciated 
the results that had been achieved in recent years. Proactive transmission of nuclear technologies to 
Member States and assistance with acute medical, social and economic problems had helped expand 
the contribution that nuclear science made to sustainable development in Belarus. The CPF signed in 
March 2003 provided a solid foundation for crucial further development of technical cooperation 
between Belarus and the Agency in the medium term. 
97. Technical cooperation between the Agency and Belarus was largely related to overcoming the 
consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident. The last in a series of rapeseed projects 
had been successfully completed in 2001 and a plant had been set up which was producing 
ecologically clean products in the contaminated areas. Belarus was successfully implementing a 
Model Project on the rehabilitation of the Chernobyl-affected territories in which the key factors were 
sustainable economic development and the establishment of industries that allowed clean goods to be 
produced from local feedstock. 
98. His country attached special importance to the implementation of a regional project on longterm 
countermeasure strategies and monitoring of human exposure in rural areas affected by the 
Chernobyl accident. The project aimed at solving the practical tasks of dose exposure monitoring and 
developing a long-term strategy to overcome the consequences of the catastrophe. 
99. The progress made by the Chernobyl Forum was pleasing. Strict adherence to its schedule and 
sustainable funding of its activities should allow it to complete its work by 2005. Belarus highly 
appreciated the active role played by the Director General, the Deputy Director General for Technical 
Cooperation and the staff of the Department of Technical Cooperation in addressing the long-term 
consequences of the Chernobyl accident. Funding of national and regional programmes related to the 
accident should be preserved at the existing level. 
100. Staff training was a crucial to strengthening the effectiveness of the regulatory infrastructure for 
the safety and security of radioactive and nuclear material. The AgencyÂs efforts to implement a 
strategic approach to education and training in the field of radiation and waste safety were welcome. 
Belarus had made a substantial contribution to those activities over many years by hosting Agency 
training and consultative events, a recent example being the third postgraduate training course on 
radiation safety and the safety of radiation sources held at the International Sakharov Ecological 
University. It was interested in continuing its cooperation with the Agency on the basis of long-term 
plans and agreements. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 16 

101. Equally, it was also interested in further improvement of technical cooperation in the field of 
nuclear safety. His countryÂs considerable experience in that sphere might be of interest to other 
countries, in particular its work on illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. With Agency 
assistance, two pilot checkpoints had been equipped to monitor material crossing the border. On the 
basis of that project, it was planned to establish a national automated system to account for and control 
transfers of nuclear and radioactive material. 
102. Another priority issue was the safe management of nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, which 
would only be possible with the participation of all States party to the Joint Convention. He therefore 
encouraged those States that had not yet done so to ratify that Convention. Radioactive waste 
management was often connected in Belarus with other important tasks, such as the identification and 
rehabilitation of orphan sources. Some twenty sites had been identified where orphan sources might be 
located. The examination of two of those sites had confirmed that they posed a radiation risk. 
Resources were being sought to pursue that work and to develop a model project to remove the 
sources. 
103. In conclusion, Belarus regularly paid its contributions to the TCF in full and called upon 
Member States to take the necessary measures to provide the TCF with sufficient financial resources 
for the full-scale implementation of the technical cooperation programme. 
104. Mr. BACCINI (Italy) said that his Government supported all the activities performed by the 
Agency in fulfilment of its statutory obligations and looked favourably on its efforts to promote 
sustainable energy development, develop innovative and proliferation-resistant technology and 
preserve knowledge. It also supported the AgencyÂs activities to combat nuclear terrorism and 
welcomed the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
105. It was essential to uphold and strengthen the global non-proliferation regime. The Agency had a 
crucial role to play in the field of verification and in all activities related to the implementation of the 
NPT. Reviewing and strengthening the Treaty, which constituted the cornerstone of the regime for 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, should be seen as fundamental to peace and 
stability. 
106. Italy therefore supported the strong verification regime provided by additional protocols, which 
enabled the Agency both to provide credible assurances of the non-diversion of nuclear material and to 
detect clandestine material and activities. Italy had ratified its additional protocol and urged all 
countries that had not yet done so to follow suit. His country also fully supported the re-examination 
of nuclear fuel cycle issues, as suggested by the Director General, and looked forward to the findings 
of the recently established expert group. Italy was committed to preventing any possible diversion of 
material through strict controls on sensitive exports, including transfer controls on nuclear and 
nuclear-related material, provided that such controls did not hinder international cooperation related to 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also supported the AgencyÂs efforts to improve further the illicit 
trafficking database in the interests of combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive material. 
In view of the widespread concern about the risks from illicit trafficking, his country looked forward 
to the early implementation of the guidance on the import and export of high-risk radiation sources. 
107. His country would continue its efforts to maintain the authority and integrity of the NPT. It 
therefore endorsed the view that the CTBT should enter into force and that negotiations on an 
internationally verifiable fissile material cut-off treaty should begin as soon as possible. 
108. Nuclear safety had to be given the highest priority at every stage of a countryÂs nuclear 
programme. In that connection, the Convention on Nuclear Safety was an essential tool for spreading a 
common safety culture to ensure that an internationally accepted standard was maintained at all 
nuclear power plants. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 17 

109. Italy was also committed to completing the ratification of the Joint Convention, which was 
essential for achieving and maintaining a high level of safety worldwide. 
110. It appreciated the increased international attention which was being given to the 
decommissioning of nuclear facilities and stood ready to contribute to the proposed Agency action 
plans on decommissioning and on strengthening the international preparedness and response system 
for nuclear and radiological emergencies. Particular attention should be paid to so-called 
non-technological factors in the implementation of decommissioning projects, such as the involvement 
of local communities, site re-developers and unions. 
111. His country fully supported the AgencyÂs initiative in convening the recent International 
Conference on Nuclear Knowledge Management held in France. The continuity of nuclear knowledge 
was a matter of growing concern for all, including Italy, where fewer young people were studying 
nuclear science and engineering at university. 
112. It also supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation initiatives and, recognizing their increasing 
importance as an instrument of progress and stability, hoped that the general public would learn to see 
the Agency as an institution which not only carried out verification work but also helped less 
developed countries to achieve better living standards. The Agency should aim to develop a technical 
cooperation programme with fewer but better quality projects. The effective coordination between the 
AgencyÂs own technical cooperation activities and those of other organizations was welcome, 
particularly the coordination with the World Bank and the WHO. 
113. ItalyÂs academic and health institutions had long-standing experience of cooperation with the 
Agency, especially in the field of nuclear medicine, thanks to the organization of training courses, 
scientific visits and fellowships. His country would like to see those scientific programmes 
strengthened and possibly also included within a national framework to be agreed upon with the 
Agency. In that connection, the Agency had an important role to play in providing assistance and 
cooperation to help combat the increased incidence of cancer in developing countries. 
114. Through UNESCO, Italy contributed more than 80 % of the budget of the ICTP which carried 
out activities and programmes aimed at promoting international cooperation among scientists around 
the world. The AgencyÂs support for the ICTP was deeply appreciated and had encouraged Italy to 
continue to strengthen the centre and enhance its role of bridging the scientific and technological gap 
between North and South. 
115. To ensure cost-effectiveness, precise priorities should be identified when starting new Agency 
activities. The results-based approach provided indications of possible deviations in programme 
implementation and opportunities to take advantage of the lessons learned from past experiences. The 
use of performance indicators to improve assessments was welcome. Special attention should be paid 
to the formulation of activities in cross-cutting areas such as knowledge management and 
environmental quality assurance. Furthermore, the Secretariat should base its staff recruitment policy 
on scientific and technical competence in order to maintain a high level of expertise in the Agency. 
116. As the sixth largest contributor to the AgencyÂs Regular Budget, Italy had always honoured its 
commitment to pay its contributions and had regularly paid its voluntary contribution to the TCF, thus 
contributing to the high rate of attainment achieved in the current year. The Secretariat should reflect 
that commitment in its recruitment of Italian nationals. 
117. Mr. HASSANE YARI (Niger) said that his country was fully committed to the AgencyÂs 
objectives and would spare no effort to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology and strengthen 
the non-proliferation regime. It would also work with the international community towards ensuring 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 18 

global peace, security and prosperity. In that context, the President of the Republic had recently 
promulgated laws to ratify NigerÂs safeguards agreement and authorize its accession to the CPPNM. 

118. Niger fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the safety and security of radioactive 
sources. It was working towards implementing the guidelines contained in the Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and urged other countries to do the same. 
119. His country appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to promote sustainable development through 
peaceful applications of nuclear technology in the fields of radiation protection, human and animal 
health, the environment, nutrition and agriculture. 
120. It was particularly grateful for the implementation of technical cooperation programmes in the 
fields of radiological safety and radioactive waste safety, human health, animal health and production, 
nuclear sciences and other nuclear applications, which had promoted human resources development in 
Niger and the use of nuclear medicine. The country now had a radioimmunoassay laboratory and a 
gamma camera for the diagnosis of cancerous tumours. 
121. Under NigerÂs new CPF for 2003Â2007, cooperation activities would be implemented in 
harmony with the national anti-poverty strategy, whose main focus was on education, health, water 
and sanitation, population policy and capacity building. The project requests the country had 
submitted to the Agency at the end of 2003 related to the establishment of a radiotherapy centre, study 
of nitrate pollution and groundwater recharge, training in radiation metrology and radiation protection, 
monitoring of occupational and public exposure and control of medical exposure, radioactive waste 
management, training of a team to maintain laboratory equipment, establishment of a molecular 
biology laboratory and a laboratory for monitoring products of animal origin at the Niamey Central 
Laboratory for Livestock, and promotion of the production and consumption of roots and tubers rich in 
micronutrients. It hoped that many of them would be approved for the 2005Â2006 biennium. 
122. The proposed radiotherapy project was particularly important to treat the growing number of 
cancer patients. Currently, patients had to be referred to hospitals abroad, causing the country further 
financial difficulties. A radiotherapy centre in Niger could provide curative and palliative treatment to 
two thirds of those patients. His Government had undertaken to build the premises for the radiotherapy 
centre, recruit the staff, allocate an operating budget that would ensure the regular replacement of the 
cobalt source and provide the necessary consumables and radiopharmaceuticals. He appealed to all 
donor countries and organizations to provide the substantial assistance required for the construction of 
the centre, which would cost around $1.6 million, and for the development of in vitro and in vivo 
nuclear medicine services at Niamey. 
123. Like many African countries, Niger suffered from a cruel lack of renewable water resources. 
However, thanks to the AgencyÂs ongoing projects and its constant willingness to assist developing 
countries, it hoped that solutions would be found to those problems. It was grateful for the 
considerable assistance the Agency provided for sustainable development, particularly under regional 
and subregional programmes for water management and desertification, and the training it provided in 
nuclear-related subjects. 
124. Mr. HOFFMANN (Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty 
Organization) said that the CTBT was becoming increasingly universal in its status, having been 
signed by 172 States and ratified by 116. The ratifiers included 32 of the 44 States whose ratification 
was required for the Treaty to enter into force. President Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo was also expected to present his instrument of ratification to the United Nations 
Secretary-General in the coming few days. 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 19 

125. The Treaty provided for the establishment of a unique global verification regime consisting of 
an international monitoring system, a consultation and clarification process, on-site inspections and 
confidence-building measures. Data from monitoring system stations around the world were processed 
and analysed by the International Data Centre in Vienna. All data and International Data Centre 
products were made available to Member States which had the final responsibility for analysing the 
data. 
126. The Preparatory Commission and its Provisional Technical Secretariat had made significant 
progress in preparing the effective implementation of the CTBT. Site surveys had been completed 
for 322 of the 337 international monitoring system facilities. Altogether, 190 facilities had been 
installed or upgraded. 
127. The International Data Centre supported the verification of the Treaty and provided for the civil 
and scientific interests of Member States by providing products and services needed for effective 
global monitoring through the establishment and testing of facilities that received, collected, 
processed, analysed, reported on and archived data received from monitoring system stations. To date, 
about 105 stations had been included in the CentreÂs operations. 
128. The international monitoring system data and the products of the International Data Centre were 
useful not only for international security but also for civil and scientific purposes, such as rapid 
notification of the location and size of potentially damaging earthquakes, scientific studies of the earth 
including its oceans and atmosphere, early detection of exploding volcanoes and warnings to the 
aviation industry of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. About 80 secure signatory accounts had been 
established, with over 600 users authorized to access data and products and to receive technical 
support from the Centre. 
129. The global communications infrastructure transferred monitoring system data to the Centre and 
disseminated the data and products to signatory States. The Provisional Technical Secretariat operated 
the global communications infrastructure as a worldwide closed and secure satellite communications 
network. Once it was fully operational, the network was expected to carry some 11 gigabytes of data 
daily. 
130. As the development of the international monitoring system became more advanced, the 
Provisional Technical Secretariat became increasingly more engaged in the operation and maintenance 
of the system. Significant resources had been dedicated to the planning, execution and analysis of the 
first progressive system-wide performance test. Work had been carried out to develop several tools for 
monitoring and reporting on the operation and maintenance network and to support the physical 
infrastructure. 
131. The Provisional Technical Secretariat had organized joint training courses for international 
monitoring system operators and National Data Centre staff in 2004. A technical training programme 
in radionuclide technology had been hosted by the Austrian Research Centers Seibersdorf. Joint 
regional training courses for monitoring system station operators and National Data Centre technical 
staff had been held in Obninsk and Caracas. Detailed preparations were continuing for the Provisional 
Technical Secretariat to hold an operation and maintenance workshop in Baden in October, and 
regional training courses for National Data Centre technical staff in Dakar in October and in Jakarta in 
December. 
132. The Provisional Technical Secretariat had conducted the preparatory phase of its first 
system-wide performance test in May and June 2004. In total, 130 monitoring system stations 
and 4 radionuclide laboratories (about 40 % of the network) had taken part. Continuous evaluation was 
an important element of preparing and planning for that test. Implementation of the preparatory phase 
of the first test involved monitoring the coordination and participation of key players in the exercise 

GC(48)/OR.5 
22 September 2004, Page 20 

and the functioning of various system components and reporting tools. The feedback received and the 
results of the baseline assessment and implementation scenarios would provide the basis for the main 
phase in 2005. 

133. Work had continued on the draft on-site inspection operational manual, the development of a 
provisional list of inspection equipment and equipment specifications for testing and training 
purposes, the development and implementation of the equipment testing programme, and the 
definition of activities such as field experiments, equipment demonstrations, workshops, tabletop 
exercises and experimental advanced courses. 
134. The measurement of the radioactive noble gases xenon and argon-37 was important for on-site 
inspections conducted under the Treaty. However, the measurement equipment required was unique 
and would need to be specially designed and developed. The Provisional Technical Secretariat had 
two separate ongoing projects on those gases with a view to obtaining the relevant measurement 
equipment for testing and training purposes. 
135. Currently, the Provisional Technical Secretariat had about 270 staff members from 70 countries, 
some 175 of them in the Professional category. It was committed to a policy of equal employment 
opportunities and the representation of women in Professional positions was about 27% of the staff. It 
continued to cooperate with other VIC-based international organizations on the provision and 
management of joint services. 
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (continued) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Mr. VEJONIS (Latvia) said that the difficulties in terms of knowledge management for 
countries like his which were experiencing rapid change in many fields were compounded by the fact 
that young people were tending to seek careers in non-technical areas. In Latvia, the most important 
nuclear applications were in health care and the natural sciences, but unfortunately the number of 
graduates in the nuclear field was falling and Latvia had no option but to cooperate with other 
countries, with the help of the Agency. Preserving and enhancing nuclear knowledge was very 
important for ensuring the availability of qualified experts, which was vital to the safe and secure 
utilization of nuclear technologies. Latvia was therefore promoting networking arrangements between 
establishments and institutions and its experts had participated, and would continue to participate, in 
international knowledge-building activities. 
2. Safety was tightly linked with security of radiation sources and global implementation of an 
effective system, with an enhanced regulatory framework and supervisory capabilities, should be 
treated as a top priority. There should be a joint effort by Member States of the Agency to promote the 
benefits of membership for that would enhance the safety and security of radiation sources, given that 
in some regions there were many countries that were not involved in joint activities and did not 
receive support from the Agency. 
3. Latvia regarded a universal non-proliferation regime, supported by a strong system of 
safeguards, as essential for collective security. Unfortunately, however, there were still some 40 States 
Party to the NPT with no safeguards agreement and only 60 additional protocols were in force. Only a 
few dozen countries participated in regimes for the control of the import, export and transit of dual-use 
nuclear items. The CTBT had still not entered into force, and Latvia called upon States that had not yet 
signed and ratified it to do so at their earliest convenience. 
4. Latvia had always paid its full contribution to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, 
from which it had gained a number of benefits. It had now reached a level where it was confidently 
able to provide assistance to others. The replacement of APCs by NPCs was entirely acceptable and 
the new approach should help the Agency to maintain its funding. Latvia hoped that the level of 
voluntary contributions to the TCF would increase and that consequently the Agency would be able to 
offer its Member States extra assistance. Latvia appealed to all Member States to pay their 
contributions in full and on time. 
5. Latvia was involved in national and regional technical cooperation projects related to health 
care and nuclear applications for diagnostics and treatment. It was undertaking feasibility studies for 
the use of positron emission tomography. Also, it had submitted to the Agency a project for a 
cyclotron facility to be installed at a research reactor site that was in the early stage of 
decommissioning, which would greatly contribute to developments in nuclear science and its 
applications. Latvia was analysing ways of better utilizing national funds and funds from the Agency 
in the cost-sharing project. 
6. Latvia was implementing its first radioactive waste management strategy. One of a number of 
challenging tasks was the disposal of long-lived radiation sources. With help from the Agency, 
Latvian experts had undertaken about 15% of the countryÂs decommissioning plan. The environmental 
impact assessment study had been completed and a study had begun for expansion of the radioactive 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 2 

waste disposal site to manage all the waste from decommissioning. Unfortunately, there was still no 
real progress to report on how the spent HEU fuel from its decommissioned research reactors would 
be dealt with. Pending a resolution of that issue, Latvia was implementing a temporary solution 
involving the establishment of short-term dry storage in transportable casks. 

7. Mr. ZHANTIKIN (Kazakhstan) said the events of the past year had demonstrated the 
complexity of building confidence in the world. A cornerstone of that process was the NPT and it was 
essential to ensure the effective implementation of that Treaty and all measures aimed at strengthening 
the nuclear non-proliferation regime. He therefore called upon all States Party to the NPT to fulfil their 
obligations scrupulously. 
8. Kazakhstan had voluntarily renounced a substantial nuclear arsenal and ever since independence 
had worked to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. In February 2004, his Government 
had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement with the Agency. Kazakhstan had also 
joined many initiatives designed to reduce the nuclear threat, including the G8 Global Partnership 
Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the United States Proliferation 
Security Initiative and the United States Global Threat Reduction Initiative. The Ministry of Energy 
had undertaken a five-year programme to convert its WWR-K Alma Ata research reactor to 
low-enriched nuclear fuel and its BN-350 fast-breeder reactor was being safely decommissioned. 
Efforts were under way to strengthen control of sources of ionizing radiation and to ensure secure 
management of powerful sources, and his country was grateful for the AgencyÂs support in that regard. 
9. The Agency was obliged, under its Statute, to assist Member States in realizing their right to 
develop nuclear technologies for peaceful purposes. However, a way must be found to resolve recent 
problematical issues which would not only safeguard StatesÂ legitimate rights but also reassure the 
international community about their peaceful intentions. It would not be an easy task, but the 
AgencyÂs experience and the firm and principled position taken by its Director General would stand it 
in good stead. 
10. Kazakhstan, a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, abided fully by universally accepted 
international export controls. It was concerned that some other countries which possessed elements of 
the nuclear fuel cycle were not doing likewise, thereby opening the way to illegal trafficking in 
nuclear materials and the illegal transfer of nuclear technologies. Further restrictions on the transfer of 
nuclear technology should not be introduced, however, without careful consideration since they might 
create unjustified obstacles to the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
11. Mr. SOTIROPOULOS (Greece) said that the AgencyÂs activities in the area of nuclear safety 
were of paramount importance. Greece had always played an active role in all aspects of nuclear 
safety, having joined the Incident Reporting System for Research Reactors and having ratified the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety. Greece supported the drawing up and strengthening of safety standards 
to cover the whole spectrum of fuel cycle facilities. It attached great importance to the AgencyÂs 
efforts to establish and maintain a global safety regime through the adoption of action plans, a first 
step towards the conclusion of codes of conduct. 
12. His Government appreciated the adoption by the Board in June 2004 of the International Action 
Plan on the Decommissioning of Nuclear Facilities. It encouraged the Director General to step up 
efforts in that regard in close cooperation with other international organizations with a view to 
achieving implementation of Agency safety standards by all States at the earliest possible time. That 
was especially important as hundreds of nuclear plants and other facilities had been decommissioned 
or would be in the foreseeable future. 
13. His Government supported the SecretariatÂs work on occupational radiation protection, the 
safety and security of radioactive sources, the safe transport of radioactive material, the safety, non

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 3 

proliferation and minimization of nuclear wastes, the safety of research reactors and, more generally, 
the establishment of a global safety regime. It urged the Secretariat and all international organizations 
to strengthen their cooperation in those areas. 

14. Greece attached great importance to nuclear security and had already provided financial and inkind 
voluntary contributions to the AgencyÂs Nuclear Security Fund. It had concluded a joint action 
plan with the Agency to ensure a high level of nuclear security at the 2004 Olympic Games. The 
action plan had been designed to protect facilities and materials, detect illicit trafficking and malicious 
use of radioactive materials and provide for effective and efficient emergency response forces. His 
Government expressed gratitude to the Director General, and to the countries and other organizations 
which had helped make the action plan a success. Greece supported Agency activities aimed at 
preventing nuclear terrorism and also the United States new Global Threat Reduction Initiative. In that 
regard, his country had just taken part in the Global Threat Initiative International PartnersÂ 
Conference aimed at securing or removing high-risk nuclear and other radioactive materials 
worldwide that posed a threat to the international community. The work of the United States of 
America, the Russian Federation and the Agency was an important component of that Initiative. 
15. In recent years, the nuclear non-proliferation regime had come under pressure for a number of 
reasons, including the lack of substantive progress on disarmament, the threat of nuclear terrorism and 
regional instability. Urgent steps must be taken to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
16. The case of the DPRK remained unresolved although it had been referred to the Security 
Council for reasons of non-compliance more than 12 years previously. In Iraq, the Agency had long 
been preoccupied with the relevant Security Council resolutions and had now resumed its inspection 
activities to perform a physical inventory verification. Greece recognized the efforts of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran to cooperate with the Agency and its signing of an additional protocol. It expected 
full cooperation from the Iranian authorities in all areas, including the suspension of enrichment and 
other related activities. Greece was pleased at the decision by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to eliminate 
all materials, equipment and programmes leading to the production of internationally proscribed 
weapons, including nuclear weapons. Iran and Libya had provided the Agency with an unprecedented 
opportunity for investigating illegal supply routes for the transfer of nuclear materials, equipment and 
technology and Greece appreciated the ongoing efforts to that end. One of the main ways of attaining 
the goal of a lasting peace in the Middle East would be to focus on making it a region free of weapons 
of mass destruction. His country urged the Director General to continue his work on that issue. It 
welcomed the idea of holding a technical forum in Vienna; the participation of all countries of the 
Middle East region would be key to its success. 
17. Greece reiterated its strong commitment to the AgencyÂs verification role within a universal 
non-proliferation regime. Reliable verification was of paramount importance in curbing the spread of 
nuclear weapons. The universal application of safeguards and the additional protocol remained one of 
the basic components of international nuclear security because it would reduce the chances of success 
of nuclear terrorism and restore faith in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. In that context, Greece 
supported the objectives of the Proliferation Security Initiative and welcomed Security Council 
resolution 1540 (2004). 
18. A universally applied system of export controls, the conclusion of an additional protocol as a 
condition for supply, measures to combat illicit trafficking in nuclear material and the CPPNM were 
essential to preventing nuclear terrorism. The time had come to finalize amendment of the CPPNM 
and convene a diplomatic conference on the subject. 
19. Nuclear energy, and sensitive technology in particular, should be developed for peaceful 
purposes only and not for reasons of national prestige or for military expansion carried out on the 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 4 

pretext of regional instability. Mutual understanding, dialogue and diplomacy were the only solutions. 
Greece endorsed the Director GeneralÂs decision to establish a group of experts to study ways of 
achieving multilateral control over sensitive nuclear technologies so as to prevent their spread. 

20. Greece had paid its voluntary share of the TCF target for 2002 and 2003 in full and would do so 
again for 2004 and 2005. It also assisted the Agency by providing training laboratories, making 
experts available, and hosting and supporting events under the technical cooperation programme. His 
country would support every initiative to incorporate technical cooperation programmes into the 
AgencyÂs assistance-related scientific programmes with a view to achieving better management and 
efficiency. 
21. Mr. SRIWIDJAJA (Indonesia) expressed appreciation for the valuable support received through 
the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities. Noting with satisfaction that 87 CPFs Â used as 
planning tools to design projects within the context of national priorities Â were now in place, he said 
that his country had just submitted a revised CPF. Indonesia welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to expand 
and intensify the application of nuclear science and technology with a view to promoting quality of 
life, particularly in the developing countries. 
22. Nuclear technology could have a significant impact in Indonesia, especially in the areas of food 
irradiation, river basin management, groundwater management and to control communicable diseases. 
Indonesia had abundant geothermal resources and was planning to utilize nuclear techniques in 
exploring and exploiting them. In December 2003, Indonesia had commissioned a domestically 
produced low-energy electron beam machine for accelerator technology research and applications, and 
had recently signed an agreement with a domestic power supply company for the installation of a 
modular demonstration electron beam machine for flue gas treatment in a coal-fired power plant. 
Indonesia had also developed high yielding rice and soybean varieties, and would be continuing to 
disseminate nuclear techniques to improve animal reproduction, animal health and feed supplement 
technology. In the field of human health, Indonesia was continuing to develop and produce 
radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals for domestic use and for export. It was also drawing up a 
programme to design and manufacture nuclear medical instruments for radiodiagnostics and 
radiotherapy. In IndonesiaÂs national energy policy for 2004Â2020, nuclear energy was regarded as a 
component of the long-term energy mix. Indonesia was grateful to the Agency and to the Republic of 
Korea for their close cooperation in the three-party project for a joint feasibility study of a nuclear 
desalination plant. In anticipation of the introduction of a nuclear power plant, IndonesiaÂs national 
regulatory body had embarked on a comprehensive programme to develop the necessary infrastructure 
and was counting on not only assistance from the Agency but also bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation with developed countries. 
23. The Agency had dispatched a number of expert missions to help Indonesia in nuclear security 
matters, in the light of increasing terrorist threats that might involve nuclear and radiation facilities, as 
well as illicit trafficking and/or the use of nuclear materials, radioactive sources and radioactive waste. 
Coastal States had concerns regarding nuclear transport safety and security, particularly the increasing 
danger of accidents caused by nature, human error or criminal acts. Indonesia commended the Agency 
for establishing the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security to facilitate an effective and integrated 
approach towards nuclear security. The Agency had also provided assistance in the form of expert 
missions for the regulatory control of nuclear safety and radiation protection, particularly at 
IndonesiaÂs hospitals and industrial plants, as well as help in improving the safety of IndonesiaÂs 
research reactors. 
24. Indonesia was proud to be among the first three countries to have reached the stage of integrated 
safeguards and encouraged those non-nuclear-weapon States which had not yet done so to conclude an 
additional protocol with the Agency. At the same time, Indonesia urged the nuclear-weapon States to 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 5 

take their NPT obligations seriously, in particular their commitments to nuclear disarmament and the 
total abolition of nuclear weapons. With regard to strengthening the third pillar of the NPT, namely the 
peaceful uses of nuclear energy, Indonesia invited all Member States, in particular the donor countries, 
and the Secretariat seriously to consider a special incentive for developing Member States which had 
signed an additional protocol, for example by providing them with more technical cooperation 
programmes. 

25. Mr. SAHINBAS (Turkey) said that world energy demand was set to grow, particularly in the 
developing countries. As TurkeyÂs conventional resources could not meet its needs in a secure and 
sustainable way, it planned to include nuclear energy in its future energy mix. Turkey recognized the 
crucial role the Agency played in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. However, a significant increase 
in nuclear power could be achieved only if progress was made in developing innovative and 
evolutionary technology to address concerns about waste, proliferation, safety and security. In 2004, 
the Turkish Parliament had ratified bilateral agreements with the United States of America and France 
on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
26. The preservation of nuclear knowledge was also crucial to ensuring safety and security, 
encouraging innovation and assuring the future availability of the benefits of nuclear technologies. 
Turkey supported the AgencyÂs efforts to seek creative methods and approaches in education and 
training to ensure that the knowledge, skills and abilities of the current generation of nuclear 
professionals were transferred effectively to their successors. 
27. Turkey recognized the importance of ongoing national and international efforts to promote 
innovation in nuclear reactors and fuel cycles to meet future needs in terms of economics, safety, 
environmental impact, proliferation resistance and public acceptance. It appreciated the progress 
achieved in the AgencyÂs INPRO project over the previous few years. The Agency should remain 
committed and continue its activities in that important field, using the synergies between INPRO and 
the Generation IV International Forum, and encouraging cooperation between Member States. 
28. Turkey had always supported the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime 
and considered that universal adoption and implementation of comprehensive safeguards agreements 
and additional protocols were essential for an effective and credible verification system. Turkey, 
which had already ratified an additional protocol, called on Member States that had not yet done so to 
follow suit without delay. 
29. Concerned that the Agency remained unable to draw any conclusions regarding the DPRKÂs 
nuclear activities and by its announced withdrawal from the NPT, Turkey supported the Director 
GeneralÂs efforts to negotiate with the DPRK requirements and modalities for compliance with its 
NPT safeguards agreement. Turkey welcomed the AgencyÂs steady progress in understanding the 
nuclear programme in the Islamic Republic of Iran and in resolving questions concerning its uranium 
conversion and enrichment activities. Iran had continued to act as though its additional protocol was in 
place and had given the Agency access to all requested locations, but there was still a need for 
complete and unconditional cooperation in order to resolve all outstanding issues promptly. Turkey 
expected that Iran would move rapidly towards bringing its additional protocol into force and regarded 
that step as an important sign of IranÂs commitment to non-proliferation. The Director GeneralÂs 
efforts concerning the implementation of full-scope safeguards for all nuclear activities in the Middle 
East were welcome, including the idea of convening a forum on experience of possible relevance to 
the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in that region. 
30. He reiterated TurkeyÂs firm commitment to contribute to international efforts to combat all 
forms of terrorism, including malicious acts involving nuclear and radioactive materials. The recent 
Global Threat Reduction Initiative PartnersÂ Conference in Vienna had been one such effort and his 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 6 

country supported its findings. National and regional training courses and a regional awareness 
seminar on nuclear security had been conducted in Turkey during the previous year and the Turkish 
authorities were cooperating closely with the Agency to improve their national nuclear security 
measures. In that connection, Turkey had expressed its readiness to bring into effect the guidance 
contained in the AgencyÂs Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. It 
continued to support the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts to promote nuclear safety and to strengthen safety 
standards. In particular, it welcomed the progress made in the field of the safe transport of nuclear and 
radioactive materials as envisaged in resolution GC(47)/RES/7 and also the publication of the 
TranSAS report for Turkey. 

31. He commended the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, which were an essential part of 
the sustainable development process. The current shortfall in resources for the TCF was worrying. 
Although contributions to that fund were voluntary, they should be considered a political commitment 
for all Member States with payment of the target shares in full and on time demonstrating the priority 
they attached to supporting all the AgencyÂs activities in an equitable and balanced manner. 
32. Mr. SHANGULA (Namibia) said that his Government, having taken note of the BoardÂs 
recommendations concerning the establishment of a national regulatory structure, was pleased to 
report that the drafting of its national legislation had reached an advanced stage. His delegation was 
hopeful that the Agency would support NamibiaÂs recently submitted project proposals on the 
strengthening of national infrastructures for radiation protection and he reiterated NamibiaÂs 
commitment to expediting the process of establishing a regulatory framework in compliance with the 
BSS. 
33. Namibia had established a National Committee on Nuclear Safety and was confident that, in 
partnership with the Agency and other stakeholders, it would be better able to respond to incidents 
involving nuclear security. Referring to the regional training workshop on the security of radioactive 
sources recently held in Namibia, his delegation urged the Agency to continue to support such 
collaborative efforts so as to improve nuclear security in both Namibia and Africa as a whole. Namibia 
fully subscribed to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. 
34. With regard to technical cooperation programmes, his Government highly valued the AgencyÂs 
support in expanding the diagnostic capacity of its Central Veterinary Laboratory to Northern 
Namibia. Also, it greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance with technology transfer enabling his 
country better to exploit its groundwater resources for the provision of clean and safe water to its 
citizens. 
35. The technical cooperation programmes would not be successful unless human resource skills 
and capabilities were improved and strengthened. Namibia was therefore grateful to the Agency for its 
role in the transfer of the scientific and technical knowledge. Human resources development required 
concerted efforts if Namibia was to achieve the objectives of its national development programmes. 
He called for proactive partnership by the Agency to assist national institutions in meeting their human 
resource needs. In particular, his delegation hoped that the Agency would cooperate with the 
University of Namibia on a national project to develop nuclear science teaching capability so as to 
supply national institutions with scientific knowledge and technical skills. 
36. Project proposals currently under consideration by the Agency included the expansion of 
nuclear medicine services to Northern Namibia where accessibility and affordability were a problem 
for a large part of the population. His Government had committed itself to the project in order to reach 
out to the needy and help provide health care for all, but the AgencyÂs partnership was crucial to its 
success. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 7 

37. Another proposed project was to increase crop productivity and resource use efficiency in 
Northern Namibia. Namibians whose livelihoods depended largely on agriculture continued to be hard 
hit by periodic droughts, which occurred one year in ten and undermined not only the subsistence of a 
large proportion of the population but also agricultural productivity in general. The droughts had an 
adverse impact on food security country-wide. Nuclear technology available through the Agency had 
an important role to play in addressing that problem by improving crop productivity, particularly in 
Northern Namibia. He hoped that the anticipated Agency technical cooperation would contribute 
towards the overall national objective of enhancing the food security of smallholders in the northern 
communal areas. 
38. Of similar importance to food security were the effects of harmful algal blooms, or red tides, on 
the countryÂs marine and fishery resources. The regional project on algal blooms which the Agency 
had recently initiated had finally begun to bear fruit, and he was confident that the AgencyÂs technical 
assistance to counterparts in Namibia, Angola and South Africa would enhance effective monitoring 
and management of harmful algal blooms. 
39. Finally, he commended the Agency for its efforts in collaborating with other United Nations 
agencies in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic through the use of isotope techniques to assess 
nutrition intervention programmes to mitigate the diseaseÂs impact and called upon it to increase its 
budgetary resources for that important undertaking. 
40. Monsignor BOCCARDI (Holy See), said that continued threats to peace and stability due to the 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as well as humanitarian and environmental emergencies, 
called for firm and far-reaching responses. The response of the international community must combine 
security, solidarity and the defence of human life. There had been warnings from various quarters that 
nuclear proliferation was on the increase and that there were countries interested in the illicit 
acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. There was also a risk that terrorists would gain access to 
such materials and technology. It was necessary to agree on measures to ensure that nuclear Âbusiness 
as usualÂ could not continue. The international community had to work harder to diminish the risks of 
nuclear proliferation, exerting better control over the export of nuclear material and universalizing the 
export control system. There was a need to give more authority to inspectors, as the recent discovery 
of an illicit market for nuclear material and equipment had made clear. 
41. His delegation shared concerns about the growing signs of rising insecurity in the Middle East 
as evidenced by the war in Iraq and its security implications for the region as well as the unresolved 
conflict in the Holy Land. Respect for the legitimate aspirations of both sides, a return to the 
negotiating table and the concrete engagement of the international community could lead to a solution 
that was acceptable to all, but for that it was desirable that all the countries of the region and the 
international community initiate a serious dialogue to create a Middle East region free of weapons of 
mass destruction. That, together with limitations on conventional armaments and appropriate security 
and confidence-building measures, could contribute to establishing peace in the region. 
42. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme could contribute to a peaceful solution of the 
serious problems facing mankind. The Agency, together with WHO, had recently drawn attention to 
the dramatic rise in the number of patients suffering from cancer, especially in the developing 
countries. Almost 13% of all deaths worldwide were caused by cancer Â more than those due to 
tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS put together. Cancer rates were expected to increase substantially over 
the next decade. The Holy See expressed its appreciation for the work of the Agency and its partners 
in planning and furthering cancer control programmes. 
43. The considerable efforts made by the Agency to enhance nuclear and radiation safety, to 
indicate ways of using radioactive sources safely and to help retrieve abandoned sources had made a 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 8 

significant contribution to minimizing dangers and preventing harm to the public. The Agency was 
actively engaged in fostering a safety culture in the application of nuclear techniques and ionizing 
radiation, and work still needed to be done in upgrading radiation protection infrastructures in many 
regions. The task of enhancing the security of nuclear material remained daunting and required 
efficient and intense cooperation between international organizations and individual States. 

44. Finally, he urged the Agency not to rest on its laurels but to strive constantly in pursuit of its 
goals. 
45. Mr. STRITAR (Slovenia) said the AgencyÂs verification activities, aimed at providing credible 
assurances that States were complying with their obligations under their safeguards agreements, were 
of the utmost importance. Slovenia had signed both a safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, 
and urged all Member States to follow suit. Now that it had acceded to the European Union, it was 
preparing to move over to the Euratom safeguards regime. 
46. The security of nuclear materials was another essential area of work for the Agency. Its training 
courses and evaluation missions on SSACs and its review and updating of Member StatesÂ design 
basis threat methodology were of paramount importance for the effective physical protection of 
nuclear materials and installations. Slovenia supported the proposal to convene a diplomatic 
conference to consider amendments to the CPPNM. Recent terrorist action and threats and other 
illegal activities made it essential to reinforce international cooperation. For its part, in 2002, Slovenia 
had made a voluntary contribution to the AgencyÂs activities to protect against nuclear terrorism. 
47. Slovenia fully endorsed the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the safety and security of radioactive 
sources, as set down in resolution GC(47)/RES/7.B and was working towards following the guidance 
contained in the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. He welcomed 
the AgencyÂs activities in education, training and the preparation of safety standards. Nuclear and 
radiation emergency preparedness was also of great importance. Slovenia had participated in the work 
of the National Competent AuthoritiesÂ Coordinating Group and in the CONVEX nuclear emergency 
response exercises in 2003 and 2004. The Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive 
Material would contribute significantly to nuclear safety and the International Action Plan for 
Strengthening the International Preparedness and Response System for Nuclear and Radiological 
Emergencies would facilitate the sustainable development of international nuclear and radiological 
emergency preparedness and the preparation of tools and documents for notification, communication 
and assistance. 
48. Slovenia attached great importance to operational safety in its nuclear facilities. The report of 
the third OSART mission to the KrÂko nuclear power plant in early 2003 had commended the priority 
accorded to nuclear safety at all levels, the staffÂs in-depth technical knowledge and experience in 
nuclear plant operation, and the effective use of computer technology. The Team had reported that the 
plant had a strong safety culture, driven from the top. The challenges which had been identified were 
ageing of the plant, the preservation of knowledge and increasing economic pressure in a competitive 
energy market. 
49. Slovenia had already submitted its third national report under the Convention on Nuclear 
Safety, which he hoped would demonstrate the progress the country had made following the 
recommendations of the second Review Meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention in 2002. 
The third Review Meeting, due in April 2005, would provide a further opportunity to share ideas and 
learn new ways of fulfilling the obligations under the Convention. He hoped that the initiative, which 
his country had raised at the first Review Meeting of the Joint Convention in November 2003, for a 
regional repository for high level radioactive waste would be kept under discussion. He invited 
comments on the proposal from other Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 9 

50. He commended the work of the Europe Section in the Department of Technical Cooperation and 
also the commitment of the countries of the region through their contributions to the TCF. Slovenia 
had pledged its full target share to the TCF for 2005, and had already paid its Regular Budget and 
TCF contributions for 2004. His delegation expressed doubts about the proposed NPCs, which it 
would like to discuss further with the Secretariat. 
51. Mr. NGANDAJINA (Angola) said that in the two years or so since the end of the war in his 
country the Government had been making enormous efforts to consolidate the democratic system, 
work for the eradication of poverty and achieve sustainable development. Angola was grateful to the 
Agency for the support it had received in the promotion of nuclear science and technologies, 
particularly in the areas of agriculture, health and the environment. In the radiological protection area 
it had received significant impetus in terms of equipment and the training of personnel, creating the 
conditions necessary to begin monitoring occupational exposure and to conduct inspections of 
facilities using ionizing radiation sources. 
52. Angola was in the initial stages of acquiring nuclear technology, but the Government was 
making efforts to accelerate the process of acceding to conventions. The Angolan parliament had 
already approved the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Regional Supplementary Agreement 
concerning the provision of technical assistance by the IAEA (RSA), AFRA and the Early Notification 
Convention, and the relevant instruments would be deposited shortly. The Government of Angola 
acknowledged the role of nuclear technologies in sustainable development, and therefore gave special 
importance to the activities of the Agency. However, it had to be admitted that some institutional 
factors had led to a certain delay in the approval of legal instruments. 
53. The manufacture of nuclear weapons and terrorism were a threat for mankind and, for that 
reason, Angola had on many occasions urged those who undertook such programmes and engaged in 
such activities to cease doing so. Angola reiterated its call to all Member States of the United Nations 
to respect the Charter of the United Nations and to ensure that courageous measures were taken in the 
framework of the Security Council for the preservation of world peace. 
54. Ms. KELLY (Argentina) said that the work of the Agency had become increasingly complex 
during the previous year particularly as regards the delicate balance between its promotional and 
verification roles. Many issues dealt with by the Agency would receive due attention at the NPT 
Review Conference in 2005, including the need to maintain the foundations of the Treaty. It was in the 
interests of all States Party to comply with the TreatyÂs provisions and with the commitments made at 
previous Review Conferences. Argentina firmly supported the NPT and other relevant instruments for 
international non-proliferation. 
55. She highlighted the importance of ensuring the high technical quality and credibility of the 
AgencyÂs verification system, which was the only mechanism for providing the international 
community with assurances regarding the peaceful nature of national nuclear programmes. Argentina 
made an additional contribution to safeguards through ABACC and hoped that still closer links could 
be established between ABACC and the Agency. While acknowledging the great differences in the 
various regions, ABACC was willing to share its experience and achievements with others provided 
an appropriate forum for that purpose, as proposed by the Director General, was established. 
Argentina, concerned by the increasing expenditure on safeguards, urged the Agency to ensure more 
efficient implementation. Also, account should be taken of the difficulties encountered by developing 
countries like Argentina in paying their assessed contributions and their burden should be reduced. 
56. In the safety area, Argentina had continued to develop its role as a regional centre for training in 
radiation protection and nuclear safety through the postgraduate course which it had run for over two 
decades. The International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, held in 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 10 

Vienna in July 2003, and the approval in 2004 of the related Action Plan had marked good progress in 
the transport field. Strict compliance with the AgencyÂs safety standards and reliable information on 
shipments for coastal states were critical. She drew attention to the contribution that INLEX, in which 
Argentina participated, could also make in that area. Another topic of special interest for Argentina 
was the implementation of the Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, which 
would help to coordinate national and international measures and which it would be following closely. 

57. Argentine experts had participated in the recent Global Threat Reduction Initiative International 
PartnersÂ Conference, an international cooperative effort to improve physical protection. There 
reference had been made to ArgentinaÂs experience in reducing the enrichment level of uranium used 
in specific activities and its cooperation with third countries in similar areas under programmes 
coordinated by the Agency. Also, Argentina had contributed to the application of effective export 
controls to sensitive technologies by chairing the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and 
the Wassenaar Arrangement. 
58. Argentina was participating in two international projects on the development of new generation 
reactors and fuel cycles, which provided better operational safety, substantially reduced radioactive 
waste generation and prevented proliferation risks. The Agency had an important role as catalyst for 
such initiatives Â one example of which was INPRO Â and should consider incorporating those 
activities under its Regular Budget. The Director General had recently formed an expert group on the 
nuclear fuel cycle and her delegation was confident that it would draw useful conclusions which took 
into account both non-proliferation aspects and the right of States to use nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. 
59. In terms of developments in the Argentine nuclear sector since the previous General 
Conference, the Government made a political decision to finish construction of the Atucha-2 nuclear 
power plant, which had been delayed for a decade for financial reasons. It would make a significant 
contribution to energy supply in the face of the countryÂs increased demand. Additionally, the National 
Atomic Energy Commission had been designated a fabricator of high-density fuel based on uranium 
silicide for research reactors. The excellent results obtained during post-irradiation tests had confirmed 
that international quality standards would be met. Thus Argentina would now be able to supply third 
countries. Argentina remained ready to develop bilateral cooperation and had cooperation agreements 
with 31 countries on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. 
60. Finally, Argentina was satisfied with its technical cooperation links with the Agency, including 
ARCAL. In particular, Argentina remained interested in acting as a supplier of equipment for the 
implementation of projects. Argentina sponsored courses, workshops and scientific meetings, trained 
many fellows and foreign scientific visitors, and made experts and lecturers available to the Agency, 
contributions which it hoped the Secretariat would quantify and record as contributions in kind to the 
TCF. 
61. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that it was in the common interest to maximize the 
benefits and minimize the risks stemming from the use of nuclear energy. The Agency had a crucial 
role to play in that regard, and the Czech Republic pledged its continued support for its efforts. 
62. The fulfilment of obligations under the NPT was one of her countryÂs highest priorities. The 
Czech Republic had consistently met all its international commitments under its safeguards agreement 
and the additional protocol, as confirmed by the Agency safeguards inspection activities and 
verification of the initial declaration submitted in accordance with the additional protocol. 
Recognizing the importance of Member StatesÂ support programmes, the Czech Republic had 
broadened the scope of its activities to further enhance the safeguards system. That included 
intensified cooperation with the Network of Analytical Laboratories for safeguards, safeguards 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 11 

implementation at geological repositories, and training of Agency safeguards inspectors at Czech 
nuclear installations and uranium mining and milling facilities. 

63. With regard to the growing risk of misuse of nuclear materials and other radioactive sources, the 
Czech Republic fully supported the findings of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. In that 
connection, her Government had already started negotiations, under the Trilateral Initiative, on the 
repatriation of HEU from Czech research reactors to the country of origin. 
64. The strengthening of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and an active approach to nuclear security 
were the best ways of eliminating the global threat posed by nuclear terrorism. The security of nuclear 
materials was based on effective safeguards, verification and physical protection of nuclear materials 
and comprehensive and strengthened exports control. Comprehensive and universal implementation of 
those activities was the best prevention against the diversion of nuclear materials and nuclear 
technologies for non-peaceful uses, illicit trafficking in nuclear materials and nuclear terrorism. To 
support those efforts, the Czech Republic had contributed about $75 000 to the AgencyÂs Nuclear 
Security Fund in 2004. 
65. Her delegation assured the Board that all the nuclear facilities in the Czech Republic were 
operating safely. The ongoing process of further enhancing nuclear safety and establishing the highest 
safety standards constituted the main pillar of national policy in that field. A well-developed safety 
culture together with a properly managed nuclear knowledge framework were the two basic 
prerequisites for enhancing nuclear safety. For countries the size of the Czech Republic, nuclear 
knowledge preservation could be better ensured in a wider cooperation framework. Hence its decision 
to make that objective one of the main themes of its collaboration with the Agency in the near future. 
The first proposed project would focus primarily on training the younger generation to ensure the 
sustainability of nuclear institutions and knowledge. 
66. The Czech Republic recognized the importance of TCDC and had always paid its voluntary 
contribution to the TCF in full and on time. A number of Czech organizations and experts had taken 
an active part in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and other of its activities. Her 
Government had also provided extrabudgetary resources to support various Agency activities in 2004. 
The Czech Republic would contribute about $250 000 in 2004 to projects in the countries of the 
former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia. The planned projects ranged from nuclear power 
plant safety to radiation protection in medical applications. In the year that had elapsed, her country 
had held Agency training courses and workshops, as a result of which nearly 50 experts from around 
the world had received training in nuclear medicine, radiation protection and radioactive waste 
management. 
67. Mr. DAUD MOHAMAD (Malaysia), speaking on behalf of NAM, drew attention to certain 
points of relevance to the Agency and its work contained in the final document of the XIV Ministerial 
Conference of NAM, held in Durban, South Africa, in August 2004, and to the Durban Declaration on 
Multilateralism issued by that Conference. In the Durban Declaration, the NAM Ministers had 
expressed strong concern at the growing resort to unilateralism and unilaterally imposed methods, and 
had reaffirmed the MovementÂs commitment to advancing multilateralism. Concerning nuclear 
non-proliferation and disarmament, they had welcomed the adoption of General Assembly resolution 
58/44 on the promotion of multilateralism in the area of disarmament and non-proliferation, and had 
again emphasized the importance of efforts aiming at non-proliferation being parallel to simultaneous 
efforts aiming at nuclear disarmament. The Ministers had further reaffirmed the inalienable right of 
developing countries to engage in research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes without discrimination, and had continued to note with concern that undue restrictions on 
exports to developing countries of material, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes persisted. 
In that regard, the Ministerial Conference had expressed strong rejection of attempts by any Member 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 12 

State to use the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme as a tool for political purposes in violation 
of the AgencyÂs Statute. 

68. The Ministers of the NAM States Party to the NPT, emphasizing that the aforementioned 
inalienable right constituted one of the TreatyÂs fundamental objectives, had confirmed that each 
countryÂs choices and decisions in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should be respected. 
National policies or international cooperation agreements and arrangements regarding the peaceful 
uses of nuclear energy and the fuel cycle should not be jeopardized. The Ministerial Conference had 
further expressed concern at the use by some countries inside international organizations of coercive 
methods, including financial influence, in the pursuit of unilateralist interests. The Ministers had also 
expressed their concern at the impact such unilateral acts could have on the independence of 
international organizations and of the multilateral system as a whole. 
69. The NAM Chapter in Vienna had worked in good faith to enhance the text of the resolution on 
implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran, contained in 
document GOV/2004/79, adopted at the meeting of the Board of Governors the previous week with a 
view to achieving consensus. NAM had recalled the findings of the Director General that there had 
been no evidence of diversion of the Iranian nuclear programme for military purposes, had noted that 
the report by the Board had welcomed the additional information provided recently by the Islamic 
Republic of Iran in response to the AgencyÂs requests, and had noted with satisfaction that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran had granted six complementary accesses since the meeting of the Board in June 2004. 
NAM had noted that, as reported to the Board, the Agency had continued to make steady progress in 
understanding the Iranian nuclear programme, and so NAM expected that that progressive 
development would assist the Agency in drawing definitive conclusions and confirming the 
correctness and completeness of IranÂs declarations related to all aspects of its nuclear programme. 
70. With respect to two of those aspects Â laser enrichment activities and the Islamic Republic of 
IranÂs declared uranium conversion experiments Â NAM had noted that investigations had reached a 
point where further follow-up would be carried out as a routine safeguards implementation matter. 
NAM had noted with satisfaction that progress had been made towards identifying the origin of the 
uranium contamination found at various locations in the Islamic Republic of Iran including the source 
of HEU contamination found. Also, NAM had been gratified to note that from the AgencyÂs analysis it 
had appeared plausible that the HEU contamination found might not have resulted from enrichment of 
uranium by the Islamic Republic of Iran. NAM had continued to support the AgencyÂs efforts to 
resolve the remaining issue of LEU contamination, and had welcomed the cooperation of other States 
in that regard. On the issue of the extent of the Islamic Republic of IranÂs efforts to import, 
manufacture and use P-1 and P-2 centrifuges, NAM had noted that the Agency had gained a better 
understanding of the Islamic Republic of IranÂs efforts relevant to both designs. 
71. NAM had appreciated that the Agency had been able to verify the Islamic Republic of IranÂs 
suspension of enrichment related activities at specific facilities and sites and to confirm that it had not 
observed to date any activity at those locations inconsistent with the Islamic Republic of IranÂs 
voluntary decision to suspend those activities. NAM had reiterated the basic and inalienable right of 
all Member States to develop atomic energy for peaceful purposes and had recognized that IranÂs 
voluntary decision was a confidence-building and temporary measure, intended only to facilitate a 
prompt closure of the agenda item. NAM looked forward to the Director GeneralÂs next report to the 
Board and believed that the issues should be resolved on technical grounds. To that end, NAM 
attached paramount importance to reaching Board decisions through consensus to bring the issue to a 
prompt closure, remove it from future Board agendas and achieve normalcy. 
72. It should be made very clear that even though NAM had serious concerns regarding many 
paragraphs of the Board resolution the previous week, contained in document GOV/2004/79, it had 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 13 

still compromised and sought consensus. With regard to operative paragraph 9 of the resolution, NAM 
had sought to separate the issues so that matters relating to confidence-building measures were not 
transformed into legal safeguards obligations. That was also in line with what the Director General had 
said in his introductory statement, namely that the two, although interrelated, were distinct sets of 
issues. NAM therefore interpreted the paragraphs related to the issues in that context. With regard to 
voluntary actions towards confidence-building measures, NAM was of the view that they should have 
a definite time frame and be stopped when appropriate requirements were met. For the record, if that 
Board resolution had been put to a vote as a whole, NAM would have abstained. 

73. As regards implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
NAM shared the Director GeneralÂs assessment and fully supported him in continuing to report 
developments as part of the periodic reporting of the AgencyÂs verification activities, unless 
circumstances warranted otherwise. NAM believed that the agenda item should have been brought to a 
closure at the previous meeting of the Board, removed from the agenda of the next, and be dealt with 
in future in a normal manner pursuant to the Libyan Arab JamahiriyaÂs relevant safeguards 
agreements. 
74. Turning to the Director GeneralÂs statement to the General Conference, the Malaysian 
delegation had been pleased to note the record number of 111 Member States participating in national, 
regional and interregional projects under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, but 
expressed concern at the shortfall in the current level of payments received for the 2004 Regular 
Budget estimates. Malaysia had consistently fulfilled its financial obligations to the Agency, including 
to the TCF and APCs, in full and on time, and urged all Member States to do the same. 
75. Malaysia was continuously improving its national delivery system for the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation programme, and in July 2004 the Malaysian Institute for Nuclear Technology Research 
(MINT) had received an international quality accreditation for its management of the programme. 
Malaysia would be pleased to share its acquired expertise with other developing Member States. 
Malaysia had been sharing the cost for the implementation of some of its technical cooperation 
projects with the Agency, thereby contributing to a wider dissemination of their benefits within the 
country. In addition to the nine fields of activities under the AgencyÂs technical cooperation 
programme, Malaysia was interested in the potential use of nuclear technology in other national 
research and development priority areas, particularly in biotechnology and tropical medicine, 
advanced materials such as nanomaterials, and other new areas of industrial development, as well as 
the role of information and communications technology in promoting and facilitating the peaceful uses 
of nuclear technology. Although Malaysia had no plans to embark on a nuclear power programme and 
its participation in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme had been mainly in the area of 
non-power applications of nuclear technology, it had participated in various of the AgencyÂs 
cooperative activities contributing to the safe and peaceful uses of nuclear power within the region. 
76. In the area of nuclear safety and security, Malaysia had in June 2004 received an Agency 
sponsored INSServ mission, and was currently studying its recommendations. Malaysia had decided to 
accede to the CPPNM once the prerequisite amendment to the relevant national laws to criminalize the 
offences under the Convention had been approved by parliament. 
77. Finally, in the area of nuclear weapons non-proliferation safeguards, Malaysia welcomed the 
AgencyÂs investigation into the illicit multinational supply network for nuclear items, and in that 
regard had been extending its full and prompt cooperation to the Agency. 
78. Mr. ALOWAIS (United Arab Emirates) said that nuclear energy was a topic that attracted 
intensive media coverage around the world. Warnings of the dangers inherent in the use of nuclear 
energy should be heeded and more stringent controls introduced in order to prevent flaws that might 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 14 

prove detrimental to the environment and public health. New legislation should be enacted or existing 
legislation updated under Agency supervision. 

79. The achievements of scientific research on nuclear radiation had been one of the glories of 
modern civilization over the past century. Those achievements had coincided with an increasingly 
urgent need to address the shortage of resources available for sustainable development. Nuclear energy 
was now being used in medicine to relieve suffering and in agriculture to ensure food security. He 
therefore urged all Member States of the Agency to increase the resources available for sustainable 
development and to accede to international treaties and bilateral agreements under the AgencyÂs 
auspices aimed at supporting the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
80. Since joining the Agency in 1976 his country had endeavoured to pursue an exemplary nuclear 
energy policy. With the AgencyÂs support it had enacted the law on the regulation and control of the 
use of radioactive sources and radiological protection as well as legislation establishing a Radiation 
Control and Protection Department in the Ministry of Electricity and Water to act as the countryÂs 
regulatory authority. A Radiation Protection Commission with representatives from various ministries 
and other State bodies as well as local authorities had also been set up. The regulatory authority, with 
the AgencyÂs assistance, had published basic regulations to ensure protection against ionizing 
radiation, rules governing radioactive waste management and the safe transport of radioactive waste, 
as well as a plan for dealing with nuclear emergencies. National expertise was being enhanced through 
participation in training courses, workshops, scientific visits, seminars and conferences. 
81. The United Arab Emirates had stepped up its collaboration with the Agency through regional 
and international groups, exchanges of experience, regional projects and training courses under the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. He hoped that the Agency would continue to support 
ARASIA as well as the model regional projects in West Asia with a view to promoting the transfer 
and exchange of knowledge aimed at strengthening control over radioactive sources. 
82. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme played a key role in training national experts, 
thereby encouraging future generations to become involved in meeting basic sustainable development 
needs through the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. He trusted that the Agency would support 
his countryÂs proposed national projects so that it could guarantee radiation protection for all 
employees in the nuclear sector and ensure the safety of radioactive sources. 
83. The United Arab Emirates believed that nuclear energy had the potential to meet growing 
energy needs during the twenty-first century, especially in developing countries. Nuclear power 
reactors could be used for electricity generation and water desalination at a cost that was acceptable in 
comparison to other options. He therefore urged governments and international bodies to provide 
strong support for the peaceful applications of nuclear energy and to counter its use for harmful 
purposes. 
84. Mr. KAMANDA WA KAMANDA (Democratic Republic of the Congo) stressed his countryÂs 
unswerving commitment to universal respect for the non-proliferation regime. The very possession of 
nuclear weapons by a State or group of States placed a burden on other States and increased their 
sense of insecurity, and thus was inconsistent with the principles and objectives of the United Nations 
Charter. Accordingly, the Democratic Republic of the Congo would make every effort to strengthen 
nuclear security and the non-proliferation regime, thereby contributing to the legitimate struggle of 
peoples against nuclear terror and the production, possession and use of nuclear weapons. 
85. On 16 October 2002, his Government had approved act No. 017/2002 on protection against the 
dangers of ionizing radiation and on the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities. On 
9 April 2003, it had signed an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and had acceded to the 
Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 15 

July 2004, the National Assembly had passed legislation ratifying the CTBT and the instrument of 
ratification would be deposited shortly with the United Nations Secretary-General. During the current 
session, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had deposited the instrument of accession to the 
CPPNM and his Government planned, in the coming weeks, to submit to the National Assembly bills 
on the ratification of the Pelindaba Treaty and another on the Chemical Weapons Convention. All 
those actions showed that his country was fulfilling its international obligations and working to 
improve international security and stability, thereby creating a climate favourable to applications of 
nuclear energy for peace, health care, economic development and prosperity. To the same end, his 
Government encouraged the initiative of the countries of the Middle East to make their territories a 
nuclear-weapon-free zone and called on the international community to encourage that effort. 

86. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme gave considerable support to the activities of 
AFRA. He expressed concern about the planned reduction in the portion of that budget allocated to 
regional projects in Africa for the 2005Â2006 cycle compared with 2003Â2004 (from 53.4 to 34%). In 
that context, the budgetary allocation specifically for AFRA had decreased from 20.6 to 14.7%. That 
might seriously compromise not only the balance between national programmes and the AFRA 
programme but also the sustainability of projects launched under AFRA. He hoped that a better 
compromise could be found before the Board formally approved the budget for the 2005Â2006 
biennium. 
87. His country was in the process of finalizing its CPF so as to maximize the impact of Agency 
technical cooperation projects. The key sectors concerned were agriculture, health, food, water, 
electricity, transport infrastructures and mining. The national priorities Â dictated by the national 
poverty reduction strategy Â were agriculture and food security, water resources, health and nutrition, 
the mining and metallurgy industry, the environment, education and human resources development. 
The AgencyÂs assistance would also help strengthen the national infrastructure for radiation 
protection, nuclear safety and security, and national capacities for the repair and maintenance of 
medical and scientific instrumentation. 
88. As the peace process progressed and the political and economic situation stabilized after the 
long war, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reaffirmed its commitment to cooperate with the 
Agency to achieve the important objectives for which it had been created. 
89. Mr. MTESA (Zambia) said that INIS activities had been very beneficial to his country because 
they had simplified the acquisition and dissemination of information. Contributions having been a 
matter of concern in the past, his delegation commended INIS on the input increase of more than 20% 
into the database. 
90. The measures taken by the Agency to strengthen technical cooperation activities were critical to 
the development process of Member States. In that connection, the TC-Pride project management 
system had facilitated ZambiaÂs access to information. Also, he commended the Agency for its 
initiatives to strengthen technical cooperation in nuclear radiation and waste safety management in 
many countries. Those areas were crucial in ensuring that the application of nuclear technologies did 
not have disastrous results. Improved radiation safety infrastructures and appropriate legal reform 
were needed for maximum safety at all levels. He reiterated ZambiaÂs support of the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation activities within the framework of AFRA and commended the AFRA field 
management committee for enhancing technical cooperation among the Member States of the region. 
91. Zambia was determined to combat illegal trafficking of nuclear materials and radioactive 
sources. However, to facilitate the effective implementation of those activities it needed assistance to 
train personnel and acquire equipment. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 16 

92. His delegation acknowledged the AgencyÂs efforts to preserve nuclear knowledge management 
and was pleased that it had recently organized an international conference on the subject in Saclay, 
France. Zambia urged all Member States to support the initiative to establish the World Nuclear 
University. It considered that universities, particularly in developing countries, should be encouraged 
to embark on programmes in nuclear sciences in order to train the human resources needed in the 
sector. 
93. His Government thanked the Secretariat for its participation in the development and finalization 
of ZambiaÂs CPF for 2005Â2009. The document provided a roadmap for cooperation with the Agency 
in the areas of health care, agriculture and water resources management. 
94. Since the 47th General Conference, there had been several important developments in Zambia. 
Construction had begun on a cancer treatment centre, due to be completed in early 2005. Training of 
personnel for the centre was under way. The induced mutation breeding programme had been 
strengthened through both the training of technicians and the provision of more equipment for 
improved facilities. His Government thanked the Agency and OPEC for supporting those programmes. 
In addition, Zambia continued to benefit from the AgencyÂs support of projects in such fields as the 
production of radiation sterilization tissue grafts, the detection of drug resistant tuberculosis and 
malaria, and the diagnosis and control of diarrhoeal diseases. The lessons learned from those projects 
would be used in various initiatives. 
95. In conclusion, he said that Zambia pledged its full share of assessed voluntary contribution to 
the TCF for 2005. 
96. Mr. MUTALEMWA (United Republic of Tanzania) noted that despite limited financial 
resources the Agency had made considerable achievements in the past year, particularly in the areas of 
technical cooperation, nuclear safety, safeguards and security. He thanked the Agency for the technical 
cooperation programmes and projects being implemented for the benefit of his country and appealed 
for that cooperation to be continued and, as far as possible, strengthened. The successes achieved and 
the contribution towards poverty reduction had greatly increased peopleÂs awareness of the benefits of 
nuclear technologies. His country badly and urgently needed such support and assistance for the 
acquisition, adoption, adaptation and use of appropriate nuclear technologies to act as a catalyst for 
economic development and to contribute to reducing poverty. Tanzania was a participant in AFRA 
and derived immense benefits from projects under that agreement in the areas of agriculture, health, 
non-destructive testing, nuclear instrumentation and waste management. 
97. In 2003, Tanzania had promulgated an atomic energy act, establishing a firm foundation and 
framework for the peaceful and safe utilization of nuclear technology for social and economic 
development and poverty reduction. The emphasis and spirit of the legislation, which had been drawn 
up with the support and cooperation of the Agency, focused on efficient and effective frameworks and 
infrastructure for radiation protection, safety and security, as well as the acquisition of nuclear 
techniques for the peaceful utilization of atomic energy for poverty reduction. The legislation had also 
been motivated by the urgent need to have better control over the use of nuclear technology in an 
economy that was rapidly becoming a free and privately run market economy. TanzaniaÂs CPF was 
being reviewed so as to improve technical cooperation with the Agency and to take into account the 
goals of the new legislation. The intention was to finalize the new CPF before the beginning of the 
2005Â2006 project cycle, and Tanzania invited the Agency to assist in that endeavour. 
98. His country appreciated the growing attention being given to cancer therapy in developing 
countries, where deficits in equipment and expertise often prevented patients from receiving 
appropriate radiotherapy. Tanzania therefore welcomed the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy 
(PACT) and, since one of the major obstacles to efficient treatment was poor early diagnosis, would 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 17 

welcome parallel programmes for early cancer diagnosis during implementation of the PACT. 
Tanzania was also very grateful for Agency assistance in the area of tsetse eradication, enabling it to 
collect baseline information in two sites as the starting point for eradication initiatives. 

99. It was unfortunate that the TCF was experiencing disbursement problems because contributions 
had not been timely, predictable or assured. Tanzania had cleared all its arrears to both the Regular 
Budget and the TCF and would do all it could to meet its obligations for 2005 in full and on time 
despite extreme economic hardship. 
100. Recognizing the need for new and stronger measures to guard against nuclear weapons 
proliferation and the threat of global nuclear terrorism, Tanzania welcomed the new Global Threat 
Reduction Initiative of the United States of America. His delegation wished to express its appreciation 
to the United States Government and the Agency for the assistance given to Tanzania in addressing the 
threat of nuclear terrorism, particularly the bilateral assistance from the United States in making 
security upgrades in facilities with significant radiation sources. 
101. On the other hand, Tanzania was deeply worried that the new challenges of nuclear terrorism 
and nuclear proliferation were threatening to divert the attention and resources of the international 
community away from support for poverty reduction efforts by developing countries in general, and 
least developed countries in particular. Tanzania appealed to all nations, particularly Member States of 
the Agency, to face the challenges of terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation and combat them in 
ways that were as cost-effective as possible so that significant resources could still be spared to 
continue fighting poverty, which, in his delegationÂs opinion, was one of the root causes of terrorism. 
102. Strengthening of the AgencyÂs safeguards system and the additional protocol were vital for 
reinforcing the NPT, and Tanzania would be signing an additional protocol during the current session 
of the General Conference. Tanzania commended the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for its decision 
voluntarily to abandon its nuclear weapons programme and to comply with its safeguards agreement 
with the Agency. 
103. Mr. ZEWERI (Afghanistan), noting that his country had been part of the pioneer group of 
Member States that had joined the Agency in 1957, reviewed events in AfghanistanÂs recent past. He 
stressed that his Government, notwithstanding the problems currently facing it, was committed to its 
international obligations and responsibilities. It was in that spirit that it had signed a payment plan in 
August 2004 for settling its arrears with the Agency and had paid the first instalment that same month. 
He expressed the hope that those developments and AfghanistanÂs determination to pay its 
contributions on time in the future would pave the way to restoring the countryÂs voting rights in 
Agency bodies, including the General Conference. His GovernmentÂs request in that regard had been 
circulated in document GC(48)/INF/12. 
104. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and its 
practical applications would substantially contribute to AfghanistanÂs reconstruction and improve the 
lives of the Afghan people. The transfer of nuclear technology would help achieve higher agricultural 
productivity and better health care services and ensure the supply of drinking water to both the urban 
and rural population, thereby promoting sustainable socio-economic development in the post-conflict 
period. In that connection, he noted that an Afghan delegation had been invited to come to Agency 
headquarters at the end of October to discuss with the relevant departments the scope and modalities 
of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation and formulate a comprehensive technical assistance 
programme. Afghanistan was very interested in the AgencyÂs training calendar and its capacitybuilding 
programme. Applications for training in a number of areas had been submitted to the Agency 
for consideration. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 18 

105. The Agency had an important role to play in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. His Government 
was confident that technical cooperation would promote peace and prosperity in the country and help 
ensure security in the region. 
106. Ms. BIJOU (Haiti) said that the transition government in place for the past six months was 
working tirelessly to build democracy, promote respect for human rights and create a society at peace. 
But peace was not possible without sustainable development, which her country was having enormous 
difficulties in achieving. New technologies held out the prospect of helping Haiti attain its 
development goals. More attention must be given to the least developed countries to help them bridge 
the nuclear knowledge gap and make the most of the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. 
107. For nearly three years, her country had been cooperating actively with the Agency in the areas 
of radiation protection, energy planning and groundwater management. A solid foundation was being 
laid to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. For 2005-2006, her Government planned to 
employ nuclear techniques in agriculture through projects to improve soil fertility and crop yield. 
Particular attention would be given to human resources training and management in radiation therapy, 
nuclear medicine, isotope hydrology, energy planning and environmental protection, as well as to 
developing a policy of nuclear knowledge management. 
108. Her Government, which attached great importance to the AgencyÂs efforts to encourage the use 
of nuclear techniques in Haiti, felt that the international community should be made more aware of 
nuclear technologyÂs enormous potential through a public information campaign to promote nuclear 
energy and help overcome prejudices against its use. 
109. She stressed the vital nature of the AgencyÂs cooperation programme in Haiti which, if was 
carried through, would enable the country to cope with many obstacles to sustainable development. 
Haiti was facing extremely serious energy, environmental and healthcare problems, and it appealed to 
the international community for support in overcoming them. To benefit from the programme, the 
Ministry of Public Health and Population, of which she was the head, was cooperating with the 
Agency on introducing the necessary legal and physical infrastructures for radiation protection and 
nuclear security. Haiti would soon publish a decree establishing its national radiological security 
authority and work on the dosimetry laboratory was nearing completion. Thus, everything would be in 
place so that Haiti could make the most of the cooperation offered by the Agency. 
110. In the past five years cancer, especially among women, had reached alarming proportions, 
affecting both the better-off segments of society and those that could not afford treatment abroad. In 
January 2005, an Agency radiotherapy project for cancer treatment would commence in Haiti. The 
project was a matter of high priority for womenÂs health and she urged other countries to provide 
financial assistance to ensure its success. In that context, she noted that Haiti was obliged to contribute 
more than $5 million for the construction of a centre for cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
111. Technical cooperation among countries was of growing importance and was an excellent 
addition to North-South cooperation. One of the most successful technical cooperation experiences 
was in connection with ARCAL. Haiti, which had joined that agreement two years previously, 
recognized its enormous value and hoped that the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean would 
continue to use it to intensify TCDC. 
112. Her Government condemned all attempts to use nuclear technology for non-peaceful or terrorist 
purposes. It stressed the importance of the AgencyÂs initiatives to combat nuclear and radiological 
terrorism. To contribute in that regard, Haiti had already ratified its safeguards agreement and an 
additional protocol, as well as ARCAL. All three texts would be published shortly in the official 
gazette so that they could enter into force. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 19 

113. Haiti had been making every effort to fulfil its financial obligations to the Agency, and above all 
to pay its contributions to the TCF. To reduce its arrears more rapidly, it was in favour of setting up a 
five-year payment plan. Although Haiti did not have considerable resources at its disposal, it was 
aware of the importance of paying its contributions regularly so that the Agency could function 
normally. Similarly, the voluntary contributions to ARCAL would enable her country to benefit 
enormously from its excellent work. 
114. In closing, she drew the Director GeneralÂs attention to waste management at the National 
Oncological Institute. Despite the AgencyÂs financial support for the packaging, removal and transport 
of two radioactive cobalt sources, the containers were still there; that was a matter of great concern to 
persons in the immediate vicinity. Haiti hoped that all the necessary steps would be taken without 
delay to deal with that problem. 
115. Mr. NGUYEN TRUONG GIANG (Vietnam) said that, in the current challenging international 
environment, the existence of nuclear weapons constituted a major threat to peace, security, stability 
and development. While reaffirming the right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, Vietnam 
supported non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and the total elimination of nuclear weapons and 
weapons of mass destruction. 
116. Through its cooperation with the Agency and other partners, Vietnam had made progress in a 
number of areas involving the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. The AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation projects had been making significant contributions to enhancing R&D activities and the 
application of nuclear techniques in a number of areas in Vietnam. His Government urged the Agency 
to continue to strengthen the technical cooperation programme to help ensure that developing Member 
States could make safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy for their socio-economic development. 
117. Since being renovated and restarted 20 years earlier, the Dalat Research Reactor had been used 
for isotope production, activation analysis and research and training. To date, it had produced 2200 Ci 
and analysed about 45 000 samples, and it regularly supplied more than 20 radioisotopes and 
radiopharmaceuticals to 25 hospitals in the country. 
118. In agriculture, the countryÂs R&D capabilities in the application of in vitro induced mutations 
and molecular marker techniques for food crop breeding, in the production of plant promoters with the 
help of radiation technology, and in the use of tracer techniques in soil erosion studies had been 
enhanced. Eight new rice and four soybean mutant varieties had been released and certified as regional 
and national varieties. Also, nuclear applications had contributed to programmes on national food 
security, rice export and poverty alleviation. 
119. Nuclear techniques, including non-destructive testing, nucleonic control systems and tracer 
techniques, had also been widely applied in the coal, oil and gas industries, transport and construction. 
120. In the field of health care, the Agency had assisted Vietnam in starting a quality control 
programme for radiation facilities in hospitals, in drawing up national regulations on radiation 
protection and the supervision of X-ray and cobalt-60 radiotherapy equipment and in training staff. 
Two tissue banks had been set up in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with improved quality standards; 
their products had been used to treat thousands of patients in more than 40 hospitals. Following 
successful technical cooperation projects with the Agency, his Government was considering two 
projects on the establishment of positron emission tomography cyclotron centres in Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City. 
121. Vietnam had also been promoting irradiation technology. Assisted by an Agency technical 
cooperation project, an industrial cobalt-60 irradiation facility had been operating effectively at the Ho 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 20 

Chi Minh City Centre for Research and Development of Radiation Technology. It sterilized 1 000 m3 
of medical products and processed 5 000 tons of food items annually. 

122. A sedimentology laboratory and two isotope hydrology laboratories set up with Agency support 
had been conducting studies to identify pollution sources so as to prevent further degradation of 
groundwater resources and to improve the quality of drinking water in urban and industrial areas. 
123. In the field of radiation protection and nuclear regulation, hundreds of specialists and more than 
2000 radiation workers had been trained in radiation safety, regulation, licensing and inspection. A 
nationwide personnel dosimetry service had been in operation for workers exposed to radiation. An 
inventory of major spent radioactive sources had been completed and radioactive waste conditioning 
and storage facilities had been improved. 
124. His Government supported the efforts of the international community to enhance cooperation in 
nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste management. Vietnam had provided the resources 
needed to strengthen its national regulatory structure, including the elaboration of atomic energy 
legislation. His Government thanked the Secretariat and Member States for their assistance in that 
area. 
125. Finally, turning to nuclear power, he said his delegation was encouraged by the progress made 
in developing innovative nuclear technology through the INPRO project and the Generation IV 
International Forum. The Agency should continue to focus its attention on nuclear power activities and 
assist Member States which planned to develop them. 
126. Mr. VARGAS (Secretary General of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 
Latin America and the Caribbean) said that OPANAL had originated from the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty 
establishing the worldÂs first inhabited nuclear-weapon-free zone. All 33 Latin American and 
Caribbean countries were Contracting Parties to the Treaty and had made a commitment to use their 
nuclear material and facilities for exclusively peaceful purposes and to prohibit and prevent in their 
respective territories the testing, use, manufacture, production or acquisition by any means whatsoever 
of any nuclear weapons, directly or indirectly, and also the receipt, storage, installation, deployment 
and any form of possession of any nuclear weapon. 
127. The Tlatelolco Treaty had two additional protocols. The first aimed to ensure the status of 
denuclearization in territories in the Latin American zone covered by the Treaty which, de jure or de 
facto, were under the control of foreign powers, namely France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom 
and the United States of America. The aim of the second was for the nuclear powers Â China, France, 
the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States of America Â not to use or 
threaten to use nuclear weapons against the Contracting Parties of the Treaty, which provided an 
important assurance of nuclear security that was fundamental for disarmament and the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. Still more progress could 
be made however if, as proposed by OPANAL, the nuclear powers were to retract or modify some 
parts of the interpretative declarations drawn up some decades previously which affected the status of 
denuclearization of the zone established in the Treaty. 
128. The Tlatelolco Treaty had prevented a dangerous arms race in Latin America and the Caribbean 
and had contributed to global non-proliferation, setting an example to other parts of the world. Taken 
together with the Rarotonga, Bangkok and Pelindaba Treaties, it meant that more than half of the 
worldÂs States were now within nuclear-weapon-free zones. It seemed likely that a fifth zone would 
soon be established in Central Asia that there would be further progress in the negotiations on setting 
up a zone in the Middle East and South Asia. OPANAL was willing to contribute its experience to the 
forum the Director General proposed to hold on that subject. 

GC(48)/OR.6 
22 September 2004, Page 21 

129. There was a need for the nuclear-weapon-free zones to establish a common policy vis-Ã -vis the 
nuclear powers, the General Assembly, the various disarmament forums and the Agency. It would thus 
be appropriate to convene an international conference of the States party to nuclear-weapon-free 
zones, in which the Agency would be an important participant. 
130. The aims of the Tlatelolco Treaty would be in vain if they were not backed up by an effective 
control, safeguards and verification system. While acknowledging the inalienable right of all States to 
research, produce and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, he said it was important to underline 
the AgencyÂs crucial role in verifying compliance with the global nuclear safeguards regime as 
envisaged in the Tlatelolco Treaty and the NPT. He emphasized efforts to strengthen that regime, and 
in particular the importance of the additional protocol as a suitable instrument for ensuring that the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system functioned more efficiently and effectively. Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, 
Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and 
Uruguay had all signed additional protocols with the Agency and over half of those had been ratified. 
OPANAL sought closer links with the Agency, with which it had had a cooperation agreement 
since 1972, and would provide support so that the control and safeguards system could function as 
well as possible, safeguarding both nuclear security and regional interests. 
131. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme played an important role in such areas as 
human health, food and environmental conservation, particularly in developing countries and he urged 
Member States to give their financial support to those activities. 
132. Finally, OPANAL actively supported the AgencyÂs initiatives to prevent nuclear weapons from 
falling into the wrong hands. The best way of ensuring that was complete nuclear disarmament. 
The meeting rose at 7.05 p.m.

7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (continued) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Ms. STOKES (Australia) said that, through their adherence to the NPT, the great majority of the 
AgencyÂs Member States had committed themselves to cooperating with each other on peaceful 
nuclear applications. Member States that violated their safeguards obligations had to recognize that 
their actions adversely affected the scope for peaceful nuclear cooperation. The spread of 
proliferation-sensitive nuclear technologies also had serious implications for the non-proliferation 
regime and her country welcomed the Director GeneralÂs initiative to establish a group to examine 
ways of controlling sensitive nuclear technologies. 
2. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was facing challenges and all Member States had to help 
ensure the effectiveness and integrity of safeguards. Resolute action should be taken in cases of noncompliance 
and the Agency should send an unambiguous message demonstrating that any efforts to 
acquire nuclear weapons capability would not be tolerated. Like others, her country was of the view 
that a comprehensive safeguards agreement with an additional protocol was now the safeguards 
standard required of non-nuclear weapon States under Article III of the NPT, and any nuclear supply 
activities should be made conditional on having an additional protocol in force by the end of 2005 at 
the latest. She urged those States that had not yet done so to sign and ratify an additional protocol as 
soon as possible. 
3. Recent events served as a sharp reminder of the continuing threat of covert nuclear proliferation 
and she commended the Agency on its work to unravel clandestine proliferation networks. Australia 
welcomed the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 which, inter alia, required 
all States to establish controls on relevant items and technology to prevent the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. All Member States should comply with the provisions of that resolution 
and the Security Council should be more active in upholding nuclear non-proliferation and responding 
to breaches in safeguards obligations. 
4. The potential acquisition of nuclear material and know-how by terrorists remained a serious 
concern. Her country welcomed the high rate of project implementation under the Nuclear Security 
Fund but remained concerned about the voluntary, and thus unreliable nature of the funding for those 
important activities. 
5. Effective multilateral diplomacy was central to the promotion of international peace and 
security and the Agency had a key role to play in that area. She commended Libya for its historic 
decision, taken after decades of isolation, to renounce weapons of mass destruction. That countryÂs 
cooperation had enabled the Agency to verify the accuracy of its declarations, and information about 
LibyaÂs past nuclear activities had played a key role in uncovering clandestine procurement networks. 
She called upon other States to cooperate fully in Agency investigations. The Australian Foreign 
Minister had visited the DPRK in August to urge that countryÂs leadership to disclose fully and 
dismantle its nuclear programmes. The continued pursuit of nuclear weapons would drive the DPRK 
deeper into international isolation and it should take the opportunity to change its course in a way that 
would add to, rather than diminish, its security. Iran was at a key point in its cooperation with the 
Agency. Successive reports had highlighted repeated serious failures by Iran to comply with its 
safeguards obligations. Although Iran had taken steps towards greater transparency and cooperation, 
more remained to be done. Iran had to be completely transparent and committed to its international 
obligations. It should cooperate fully with the Agency to resolve outstanding questions, ratify its 
additional protocol without delay and suspend all enrichment and reprocessing-related activities as a 
confidence-building measure. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 2 

6. Australia valued the AgencyÂs efforts to develop and promote effective international 
instruments to enhance nuclear safety and security. In particular, it welcomed the recent progress on 
outstanding issues regarding the CPPNM, supported the proposed amendments and had requested the 
Director General to convene a diplomatic conference with a view to their consideration. 
7. Her country attached great importance to concerted and cooperative action to ensure effective 
control over the movement and use of radioactive sources. The recently approved Guidance on the 
Import and Export of Radioactive Sources supplementary to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and 
Security of Radioactive Sources should significantly reduce the possibility of loss of control over 
sources and provide a framework for continued beneficial applications in health care, research, 
industry and environmental protection. Harmonized implementation of the Guidance was vital. 
Australia was committed to implementing the Guidance from 31 December 2005 and hoped that other 
Member States would be in a position to do likewise. 
8. Australia hoped that the explanatory texts on the international nuclear liability regime would 
assist discussions on the transport of radioactive material. Having acknowledged the AgencyÂs work in 
developing the guidance on the application of the concepts of exclusion, exemption and clearance for 
radionuclides in commodities, she stressed the need to resolve issues relating to the denial of shipment 
of radioisotopes for medical purposes. 
9. Her country welcomed the adoption by the Board of the Code of Conduct on the Safety of 
Research Reactors which provided invaluable guidance for the regulation and operation of many such 
reactors in the world. Australia would be applying the guidance in the Code and urged other countries 
to do the same. 
10. Australia supported the expansion of the safe use of nuclear science and technology applications 
to help solve the socio-economic problems of Member States. The technical cooperation programme 
continued to play a key role in that regard, as well as helping maintain nuclear knowledge worldwide. 
Her country had contributed to technical cooperation activities through the provision of expertise, 
resources and access to facilities. It had also continued to provide support to the RCA and actively 
supported the moves aimed at increasing ownership of the RCA programme by Member States. It 
would be providing 1.42 million Australian dollars over the forthcoming three years for RCA projects 
aimed at improving regional radiological safety, including the capacity to respond to radiological 
emergencies. 
11. In the context of its support for non-proliferation norms, Australia looked forward to the 
ministerial meeting to be convened at United Nations Headquarters in New York to launch a joint 
ministerial statement in support of the CTBT. The early entry into force of that Treaty would 
constitute a practical step towards achieving nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation objectives. 
12. In November, Australia would be hosting a ministerial-level Asia-Pacific conference on nuclear 
safeguards and security with a view to promoting regional cooperation and understanding and it 
welcomed the AgencyÂs support for that event. Her country was also providing active support for 
capacity building in the Asia and Pacific region through the Australian GovernmentÂs contribution to 
the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the 
work of the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office to promote best practice in safeguards 
and physical protection and adherence to the additional protocol, and the initiative of the Australian 
Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear 
Safety Agency to secure, protect and regulate radioactive sources in the region. 
13. Mr. SANZ OLIVA (Spain) said that the recent series of challenges to the international nonproliferation 
regime had brought the AgencyÂs safeguards system to the forefront of international 
attention. The most effective tool the Agency had at its disposal to deal with that threat to international 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 3 

security was the swift and universal implementation of additional protocols and universal acceptance 
of the NPT. Happily, the budgetary agreements reached in 2003 had dispelled the financial uncertainty 
surrounding the application of additional protocols. He welcomed the progress made with the signing 
and ratification of additional protocols and, notably, the entry into force of the additional protocols of 
European Union countries on 30 April. Likewise, he welcomed the recent adoption, in countries on the 
southern shore of the western Mediterranean, of political decisions that paved the way for 
implementation of the additional protocol throughout the region in the near future and he expressed 
the hope that similar developments would take place in the eastern Mediterranean. However, at the 
global level Spain remained deeply concerned that seventeen States with significant nuclear activities 
had not yet signed an additional protocol. 

14. Safeguards activities had been enhanced by the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the security of 
nuclear facilities and material and high-risk radioactive sources. His country welcomed the progress 
that had been made since the 47th regular session of the General Conference in implementing the 
action plan to combat nuclear terrorism, as outlined in document GC(48)/6 and the supplementary 
information to that document placed on the GovAtom website. Spain had actively supported those 
efforts, inter alia by contributing US $80 000 to the Nuclear Security Fund. Pursuant to General 
Conference resolution GC(47)/RES/7, Spain had notified the Director General of its commitment to 
put into practice the guidance contained in the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources. It was also in favour of holding a diplomatic conference to amend the CPPNM. 
15. The Secretariat had made laudable progress in developing, disseminating and implementing 
safety standards. The action plan for the development and application of Agency safety standards, 
which had been approved by the Board of Governors in March 2004, should prove most useful in 
establishing a universal regime for nuclear and radiation safety and security of nuclear and radioactive 
material and facilities. The Agency should also step up and consolidate its efforts in the safety culture 
area. 
16. The Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors and the AgencyÂs INSARR service 
should considerably enhance the safety of, and reduce the risks associated with that type of facility. 
17. The Agency was to be congratulated on the excellent outcome of the International Conference 
on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material held in 2003, one of the fruits of which had been 
the Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material approved by the Board in 
March 2004, and it was to be commended on the good work of TranSAS. 
18. The first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of 
Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management held in 2003 had been a 
landmark event. The Secretariat was to be congratulated on its efforts, should take note of the lessons 
learned during that meeting and should strive to incorporate that experience into future activities under 
the Convention. 
19. Spain fully supported the AgencyÂs efforts to integrate environmental protection into radiation 
protection activities while endeavouring to strike a balance between the level of protection and the 
resources needed to provide it. Its efforts to promote consensus on that issue through international 
conferences like the International Conference on the Protection of the Environment from the Effects of 
Ionizing Radiation, held in Stockholm in 2003, were also praiseworthy. 
20. His country also firmly supported the AgencyÂs activities related to radiation safety, radiation 
safety infrastructure, education, training and knowledge management. In 2003 it had contributed 
$112 000 for an extrabudgetary project to promote radiation safety in Latin America, which it intended 
to continue supporting. That project was an initiative of the Ibero-American Forum of Nuclear 
Regulators and involved experts from Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Chile and Spain who were 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 4 

working with the Secretariat to develop a prototype system for a Latin American network to facilitate 
management of knowledge relating to radiation safety in the region. 

21. In spite of the financial and other difficulties the technical cooperation programme had faced in 
2003, programme delivery and the rate of attainment had increased, the latter falling only slightly 
short of its target of 90%. Spain had contributed to that achievement by increasing its voluntary 
contribution to the TCF, making it one of the eight largest contributors. Moreover, over the preceding 
year, Spanish companies and institutions had received 46 fellows and scientific visitors, had hosted 
seven training events attended by 79 foreign experts, and had provided 41 experts for missions, as well 
as offering cost-free waste management experts under an agreement between the Agency and 
ENRESA, the body responsible for radioactive waste management in Spain. He noted with satisfaction 
the agreements reached on the financing of technical cooperation and the improvement in management 
of technical cooperation. The Secretariat should strive to optimize use of resources even further and 
resource allocation should be weighted more in favour of training than acquisition of equipment. 
22. Spain was providing ongoing support to INPRO, inter alia by providing cost-free experts. It 
attached great importance to that project, since the future of nuclear energy depended on the 
development of innovative, more competitive and safer technologies that would minimize the risk of 
proliferation and environmental impact. The Spanish Research Centre for Energy, Environment and 
Technology hoped to strengthen its already extensive collaboration with the Agency and planned to 
fund more type II fellowships. 
23. In 2003, nuclear power had played a key role in electricity generation in Spain whose nine 
nuclear power plant units had produced 61 875 GW, or 23.6% of its total electricity output. In the 
coming years, Spain would have to face the major challenge posed by its rapidly rising electricity 
demand (6.3% in the preceding year and 31% over the preceding 6 years), the need to meet its 
environmental commitments and energy supply problems at the international level. Although the 
Spanish Government was very interested in promoting the use of renewable energy sources, and 
energy saving and efficiency, the country lacked its own conventional energy sources and nuclear 
power contributed significantly to the diversification of supply sources, reduction of dependence on 
energy imports and control of greenhouse gas emissions. The control and monitoring activities 
conducted by the Nuclear Safety Council showed that safety levels, availability and operating 
parameters at SpainÂs nuclear plants were good. 
24. SpainÂs radioactive waste management body, ENRESA, had applied for authorization to expand 
the El Cabril low- and intermediate-level waste storage facility so that very low level waste could also 
be stored there. Such waste was generated by decommissioning activities and by accidental melting of 
radiation sources in recycled scrap. An international symposium on low-level radioactive waste, 
organized by the Agency in collaboration with the Nuclear Safety Council and ENRESA inter alia, 
was to be held in Cordoba in December 2004. 
25. The owner of the JosÃ© Cabrera nuclear power plant had applied for authorization to set up a 
temporary storage facility for irradiated fuel in preparation for the scheduled shutdown of the plant in 
April 2006. In 2003, ENRESA had opened a technology centre at the site where the VandellÃ³s 1 
nuclear power plant was being dismantled to conduct dismantling and waste management activities. 
That centre should allow projects to be implemented promoted by international bodies and institutions 
such as the European Union, the OECD/NEA and the IAEA, with the involvement of national and 
international companies, universities and research institutions. A European regional seminar on the 
dismantling of nuclear power plants was being held there in the coming week. 
26. Mr. CHONG (Singapore) said that recent challenges to the NPT and significantly increased 
risks of nuclear terrorism had made the AgencyÂs role as a nuclear safety and non-proliferation 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 5 

watchdog more important than ever. The bargain that lay at the heart of the NPT was that countries 
would be given access to the benefits of civilian nuclear technology in return for refraining from 
seeking military applications, and that those already possessing nuclear weapons would work towards 
disarmament. However, the nuclear powers were not engaging in sustained disarmament efforts. At 
the same time, according to the Director General, over 40 countries now had the capability, if not yet 
the inclination, to move directly from a civilian nuclear programme to a military one. There was also 
the additional concern of radiological or nuclear terrorism by disaffected non-State actors. 

27. The unfortunate case of the DPRK gave clear cause for concern. Once a non-compliant party 
had left the NPT, international law appeared to offer the international community no further means of 
recourse. Singapore looked forward to the fourth round of six-party talks and hoped that the Agency 
would soon be in a position to verify all the details of the DPRKÂs nuclear programme and provide the 
international community with the necessary assurances regarding non-diversion of nuclear material. 
28. He expressed the hope that the Islamic Republic of Iran would fully implement, before the 
BoardÂs meetings in November, the resolution adopted by the Board of Governors contained in 
document GOV/2004/79. He also urged Iran to demonstrate that it was committed to fulfilling its 
international obligations, and to taking the necessary steps to reassure the international community of 
its peaceful intentions, through full and timely cooperation with the Agency. 
29. Furthermore, he noted that the Republic of Korea was working closely with the Agency to 
clarify the questions about its uranium enrichment experiments and was making a full disclosure of its 
activities. His country looked forward to the AgencyÂs report on the matter. 
30. Nuclear security was an area of key concern for Singapore. Research reactors and other 
facilities containing nuclear and other radioactive material were highly vulnerable to sabotage, theft or 
attack if not adequately protected. Efforts to secure and physically protect nuclear material should be 
further enhanced. The threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism remained real and much work 
needed to be done in that area, both in developing international guidelines and recommendations and 
in encouraging their implementation by Member States. In that context, he welcomed the Director 
GeneralÂs initiative to expand the scope and accelerate the pace of the AgencyÂs work in nuclear 
security-related activities. 
31. His country strongly urged countries which intended to make use of civilian nuclear technology 
to adhere strictly to the nuclear safety standards developed by the Agency. Singapore would continue 
to work closely with the Agency to enhance, harmonize and develop nuclear safety standards and 
norms and to foster a safety culture among Member States. He expressed concern at the low rates of 
attainment for the TCF. Singapore had paid its full share of the TCF every year since 1998. Many 
countries considered technical cooperation in the nuclear field important and it was incumbent upon 
them to contribute their full shares to the Fund in order to ensure that the Agency had a stable financial 
base from which to help Member States enjoy the benefits of peaceful nuclear applications. 
32. The NPT was the principal safeguard in nuclear matters for small States, which were still the 
majority of the members of the United Nations. Recent events had shown that the effectiveness of the 
international non-proliferation regime could not be taken for granted. Compromising the credibility 
and integrity of the global non-proliferation regime was in nobodyÂs interests. The Member States of 
the Agency had a responsibility to ensure that the Secretariat was given all the assistance and 
resources it needed to discharge its mandate under the NPT. Singapore would continue to support the 
work of the Agency in strengthening the NPT and the associated safeguards systems. He urged all 
countries to comply fully and transparently with their obligations. 
33. Mr. KODAH (Jordan) expressed support for the priorities that Agency had set for the use of 
nuclear technology in areas that had a direct impact on peopleÂs lives such as water supply and 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 6 

management, health care, agricultural improvements and industrial oversight and control. Water 
supply was a major problem in many parts of the world, including his own region. Jordan therefore 
attached particular importance to activities related to water management and the use of multi-purpose 
medium-sized nuclear reactors for seawater desalination. 

34. In the area of health care, Jordan was implementing a number of projects with Agency 
assistance, for instance on the use of RIA technology for the detection and management of cancer and 
on the integration nuclear medicine in the national health care system. It was also involved in regional 
projects related to radiation protection in medicine. 
35. Jordan took a keen interest in the safety and security of radioactive sources and nuclear material 
and in measures to manage radioactive waste. It had issued regulations on radiation protection and the 
management and processing of radioactive waste and instructions for the transport of radioactive 
material based on Agency standards and specifications. It had also established facilities for 
radiological monitoring of trucks entering the country in order to detect any illicitly imported material. 
He stressed the importance of international coordination to improve the safety and security of 
radioactive sources, inter alia through national and regional projects supported by the Agency and 
other relevant organizations. 
36. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards system was the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime, which was supported by most countries in the world. He urged States that had not 
yet done so to sign a safeguards agreement with the Agency. Jordan itself had signed the NPT and an 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. 
37. His country attached great importance to the application of Agency safeguards to all nuclear 
activities in the Middle East. He thanked the Director General for the contacts he had established with 
and the visits he had made to countries in the region and expressed regret that he had been unable to 
achieve the desired progress. It was essential that Israel accede to the NPT, sign and implement a 
comprehensive safeguards agreement and an additional protocol, and refrain from any action that was 
incompatible with that goal. His country had repeatedly expressed its desire to make the Middle East a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction, since such a zone would strengthen the non-proliferation 
regime and promote peace, security and development in the region and the world as a whole. 
38. Ms. HALL (Canada) said that, after a year and a half of extensive and detailed work, the 
Agency had clearly documented eighteen years of undeclared activities by Iran. That fact, and IranÂs 
continuing lack of full cooperation and transparency, was cause for deep concern and, in her countryÂs 
view, constituted a clear case of non-compliance by Iran with its NPT safeguards obligations. It was 
worrying that the Agency was still unable to draw definitive conclusions about the scope and nature of 
IranÂs nuclear programme. Though that country had signed an additional protocol and had declared its 
willingness to act as if it were in force, the protocol had not yet been ratified and Canada was 
concerned that Iran could reverse its decision to abide by the protocol, as it had its decision to suspend 
its enrichment and reprocessing activities. It was essential for the credibility and relevance of the 
Agency and international nuclear non-proliferation norms that IranÂs actions were recognized for what 
they were and that the action called for in the AgencyÂs Statute was taken. 
39. It was extremely alarming that Libya had had an undetected nuclear weapons programme and 
had even acquired the design for a weapon. Canada welcomed LibyaÂs decision to abandon its nuclear 
and other weapons programmes, which constituted an important step towards the establishment of an 
Africa and Middle East free of nuclear weapons and at peace. 
40. The DPRK offered a prime example of what could happen if the international community was 
unable to respond to activities found to be in non-compliance with a StateÂs safeguards obligations. 
Canada remained extremely concerned about the DPRKÂs nuclear programme and the serious threat it 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 7 

posed to global and regional peace and security. It fully supported the ongoing six-party talks but 
noted that the situation had not evolved significantly since the preceding General Conference. 

41. Her country remained concerned that India, Israel and Pakistan continued to refuse to accede to 
the NPT as non-nuclear-weapon States and it urged those countries to do so unconditionally and 
without delay and to place their fuel cycles under Agency safeguards. The presence of nuclear 
weapons in regions in conflict did not contribute to regional peace and security. A substantive 
dialogue on security issues was essential to achieve progress. 
42. Equally, her country had been shocked to learn of the extent of the A.Q. Khan proliferation 
network. States should work together to put an end to the nuclear black market. Canada would 
continue to work within relevant multilateral fora to develop appropriate export control measures and 
capabilities to prevent such proliferation in the future. 
43. She welcomed the Director GeneralÂs decision to convene a forum through which experience in 
other regions with nuclear-weapon-free zones could be shared with countries in the Middle East and 
she urged all States in that region and elsewhere that had not already done so to sign, ratify and 
implement comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols, which was the new 
safeguards standard. 
44. The recent information regarding small-scale experiments on the conversion and enrichment of 
uranium and the separation of plutonium in the Republic of Korea was cause for concern. The fact that 
those activities might have been conducted without the knowledge of the Government of the Republic 
of Korea and the Agency highlighted the limitations of the AgencyÂs investigative powers under 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and further reinforced the importance of universal adherence to 
the additional protocol. While Canada welcomed the Republic of KoreaÂs full cooperation with the 
Agency, it was incumbent on the Agency to apply the Statute and safeguards agreements equally to 
all. 
45. Her country welcomed the efforts of the G-8 to promote universal application of comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols. It was also in favour of the G-8 action plan on 
non-proliferation adopted at the Sea Island Summit which envisaged the establishment of a special 
safeguards committee within of the Board of Governors and advocated that countries under 
investigation for non-technical violations be excluded from the decision-making process in the Board 
and that special committee. 
46. Canada looked forward to seeing the findings of the group of experts convened by the Director 
General to develop new and innovative approaches to controlling sensitive parts of the nuclear fuel 
cycle and was prepared to assist the Agency in that work. 
47. With regard to safety and security, she welcomed the progress made in implementing the 
AgencyÂs nuclear security action plan. The Agency should coordinate its efforts relating to nuclear 
terrorism with other international initiatives such as the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
48. Her Government supported the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and urged others to do likewise. It also welcomed the BoardÂs recent approval of the 
Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources which Canada was committed to 
implementing by the end of 2005. It was important to ensure that the Code and Guidance were applied 
in a coherent manner so as not to delay unduly legitimate transfers of radioactive sources. Her country 
also welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to address the increasing number of problems caused by refusals 
to transport sources. 

GC(48)/OR.7

49. An amended CPPNM would significantly strengthen the international physical protection 
regime. Canada fully endorsed the convening of a diplomatic conference to amend the Convention and 
urged all Member States to support that initiative. 
50. The Canadian Nuclear Waste Management Organization, which had been established in 2002 to 
investigate and recommend a long-term approach for the management of spent fuel, had recently 
completed its consultations with the public. The aim was to develop waste management methods that 
were socially acceptable, reliable, environmentally friendly, economical, safe and secure. She hoped 
that other Member States could benefit from CanadaÂs experience in that area. 
51. Canada had submitted its national report for the third review meeting of the Contracting Parties 
to the Convention on Nuclear Safety setting out CanadaÂs progress and achievements in the area of 
nuclear safety over the preceding three years. It hoped that the review meeting would prove useful and 
that all signatory States would have made progress in achieving the objectives of the Convention. 
52. Her country fully appreciated the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear technology and had a 
broad-based nuclear industry ranging from uranium mining and refining to CANDU nuclear power 
plant design and operation, waste management, research and development and associated 
infrastructure. It was also a major supplier of medical and industrial radioisotopes and fully supported 
the use of radioisotopes for medical purposes. The Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy was a 
timely new initiative to address the impending cancer crisis in developing countries, and she 
welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to coordinate that programme with other relevant international 
organizations. The use of radioactive sources offered a sound and effective treatment for certain 
cancers and the programme should allow the Agency to help developing countries put the necessary 
treatment facilities in place. 
53. Her Government remained a strong supporter of the technical cooperation programme and 
welcomed the AgencyÂs ongoing efforts to improve the programmeÂs effectiveness and efficiency 
through evaluations, audits and process reviews. Those efforts should be expanded from the project to 
the programming level. Although her country recognized the importance of adequate funding for 
technical cooperation activities, it felt that contributions to the TCF should remain voluntary and that 
technical cooperation needs should be assessed independently and not linked to changes in the Regular 
Budget. 
54. Mr. DONOGHUE (Ireland) said that his country supported the multilateral regime of 
disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and was committed to upholding and 
strengthening them. It viewed the NPT as the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and 
an essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. Disarmament and non-proliferation 
were mutually reinforcing and both should be vigorously pursued. Ireland attached particular 
importance to the conclusions contained in the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference 
which set out 13 practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the 
Treaty, including an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total 
elimination of their nuclear arsenals. 
55. Weapons of mass destruction were different from other weapons not only because of their 
capacity to cause death and destruction on a large scale, but also because of the danger that such 
weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists destabilizing the international situation. Ireland, 
together with its partners in the European Union, had adopted a strategy against the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction. Support for multilateral institutions charged with verifying and 
upholding compliance with the relevant treaties was a key element of that strategy. His country would 
spare no effort in working to achieve the shared objectives of a rules-based international order and 
strong international institutions. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 9 

56. The preceding year had seen continuing challenges to the global non-proliferation regime. He 
urged the DPRK to return to full compliance with its international non-proliferation obligations under 
the NPT, including its safeguards agreement with the Agency. Any clandestine nuclear weapons 
programme should be dismantled in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner. 
57. He welcomed the news that the AgencyÂs understanding of the nature and extent of the Iranian 
nuclear programme was improving and expressed appreciation for the cooperation that Iran had shown 
both in facilitating Agency inspections and in continuing to act as though its additional protocol was in 
force. However, the fact that the Agency was still unable to draw definitive conclusions about the 
correctness and completeness of IranÂs declarations regarding all aspects of its nuclear programme was 
cause for concern. The European Union had supported the resolution contained in document 
GOV/2004/79 adopted in the preceding week by the Board of Governors. He urged Iran and all third 
countries concerned to cooperate fully and proactively with the Agency to enable a complete, 
comprehensive and definitive picture of all aspects of IranÂs nuclear programme to be presented at the 
BoardÂs meetings in November 2004. 
58. The Agency also had verification responsibilities to fulfil with respect to Iraq and its safeguards 
agreement. Ireland looked forward to those responsibilities being discharged as soon as circumstances 
permitted. 
59. His country had been concerned at the revelations that the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had also 
been in breach of its obligations under its safeguards agreement. However, since that countryÂs 
decision in December 2003 to eliminate all material, equipment and programmes which might be used 
for the production of weapons of mass destruction, LibyaÂs cooperation with the Agency had been 
exemplary. He welcomed, in particular, its signature and decision to implement an additional protocol 
and its ratification of the CTBT. 
60. The aforegoing examples demonstrated that the AgencyÂs safeguards system was an essential 
part of the non-proliferation regime. It played a crucial role in providing the necessary assurances to 
the international community that nuclear material and facilities were being used exclusively for 
peaceful purposes. The AgencyÂs compliance mechanisms had to have the funding and capacity to 
detect any breaches of the NPT and the safeguards agreements which underpinned it. 
61. IrelandÂs long established relationship with the Agency had been of great benefit to it, 
particularly to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. That Institute had contributed to various 
technical working groups, training courses and conferences. Ireland continued to provide appropriate 
training and technical assistance opportunities for other Member States under the auspices of the 
Agency. It was through such cooperation that the benefits of the Agency could be maximized. He 
commended the Agency on its research and technical work and the opportunity it afforded national 
experts to inform themselves of the latest knowledge and thinking among their peers at international 
level. That up-to-date knowledge facilitated a broader strategic perspective on nuclear safety issues 
which were an abiding concern of the people of Ireland. 
62. His country had a clear policy in relation to nuclear energy. It felt that the perceived benefits of 
pursuing the nuclear option were outweighed by the potential risks to human health and the 
environment. Those risks included the safety and security of nuclear installations, transport of nuclear 
material, unresolved problems regarding radioactive waste management, unnecessary reprocessing of 
spent nuclear fuel, marine and terrestrial environmental contamination, the ever-present danger of a 
major accident or incident, and the threat of increased proliferation. For those reasons, Ireland did not 
consider nuclear energy to be a suitable sustainable energy alternative. That view was not shared by all 
Member States and some States had actively embraced the nuclear energy option. The problems 
associated with nuclear energy and global warming constituted environmental challenges to which the 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 10 

international community had to respond. The notion that nuclear energy provided a no-risk, clean and 
safe solution to global warming was one which Ireland treated with some scepticism. In some respects, 
portraying nuclear energy as a solution to global warming amounted to recommending a solution that 
was as grave as the problem itself. 

63. The increasing attention paid by the Agency and Member States to decommissioning was 
welcome. He expressed appreciation for the International Action Plan on the Decommissioning of 
Nuclear Facilities which had been approved by the Board of Governors in June 2004. The 
management of radioactive waste had long been a concern for Ireland. The belated and reluctant 
attention directed by the nuclear industry to the problems of decommissioning and radioactive waste 
could not conceal the fact that, for many decades, insufficient provision had been made by that 
industry in those areas. The extent of the accumulated waste and the cost of dealing with it were only 
now becoming clear. Member States had to address the safety, security and environmental aspects of 
that problem. Decommissioning should not be at the expense of the environment and/or human health. 
The Agency should guide Member States involved in decommissioning in order to ensure that the 
highest safety standards were met and that all wastes were carefully and securely managed in order to 
prevent adverse environmental impact. 
64. While decisions concerning nuclear energy provision and associated activities were a matter for 
individual States, a decision to use nuclear energy inevitably affected a StateÂs neighbours. Nuclear 
and non-nuclear States should work together to ensure that all safety standards were adhered to and 
subjected to continuous review and improvement. As a non-nuclear coastal State sharing a common 
marine environment through which radioactive material was transported, Ireland had a particular 
interest in and concern about the safety of such shipments. While there was considerable divergence of 
views between Member States regarding the level of risk posed by such shipments, the reality was that 
a risk did exist. For Ireland, ensuring that the interests of its citizens were fully protected against such 
risks was a legitimate concern. To protect the interests of non-nuclear coastal States such as his own, a 
highly-developed system of cooperation and coordination between nuclear shipping States and coastal 
States would be required. The system should be based on a reciprocal recognition of the legitimate 
interests, concerns and aspirations of all parties which would complement existing safety standards. 
65. Ireland supported and welcomed the adoption of the Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material by the Board in March 2004, a plan which was challenging but achievable. The 
plan addressed many issues on which there was common agreement among Member States, but there 
were, perhaps inevitably, a number of issues on which there was a considerable divergence of views. 
The success of the Action Plan would depend on the effectiveness with which Member States, assisted 
by the Agency, addressed those sensitive issues. 
66. He expressed support for the AgencyÂs efforts to create an international emergency 
preparedness and response system, in particular the Action Plan for Strengthening the International 
Preparedness and Response System for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies adopted by the Board 
in June 2004. The plan built on the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the 
Convention of Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency and provided 
an opportunity to strengthen national nuclear and radiological emergency preparedness in association 
with fellow Member States. 
67. He commended the Director General on his foresight in establishing the International Expert 
Group on Nuclear Liability (INLEX) in 2003. The provision of explanatory texts on the nuclear 
liability instruments adopted under the AgencyÂs auspices was an important step to facilitate 
understanding of the complex issues raised by nuclear liability mechanisms. Adequate liability 
mechanisms had to be in place to prevent harm to human health and the environment, as well as 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 11 

economic losses caused by nuclear accidents or incidents. Ireland would continue to work with the 
Agency and other Member States through that group to consider issues related to nuclear liability. 

68. Much of the work facilitated by the TCF involved improving safety and human health in 
recipient countries. Ireland had paid its contribution to the TCF in full, along with its full Regular 
Budget contribution. It had also pledged financial support for the Nuclear Security Fund. 
69. Mr. NIEUWENHUYS (Belgium) expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs efforts to promote 
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and safeguard peace and security in the world and stressed the 
importance of a multilateral approach in addressing political, economic and social challenges. 
70. The risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remained a concern and he welcomed 
the adoption of Security Council resolution 1540 on that topic which provided for better coordination 
of efforts at the global level. The Agency had a key role to play in that regard. His country fully 
supported the European Union Strategy against the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and 
had recently joined the G-8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass 
Destruction. It was a firm advocate of universal adherence to the NPT and hoped that tangible 
progress would be made in the areas of non-proliferation and disarmament at the 2005 NPT Review 
Conference. 
71. The AgencyÂs safeguards system was an essential tool to prevent nuclear proliferation. Belgium 
called upon States party to the NPT that had not yet concluded and implemented a safeguards 
agreement to do so, in compliance with their NPT obligations. Regrettably, additional protocols were 
still not in force in a number of States more than seven years after that instrumentÂs approval by the 
Board. 
72. Belgium was concerned that the Agency had still not been able to confirm the scope and exact 
nature of the nuclear programmes in the DPRK and the Islamic Republic of Iran and called upon those 
States to increase their cooperation with the Agency with a view to finding a diplomatic solution to the 
outstanding issues. It urged the DPRK to participate fully in the six-party talks and called upon Iran to 
step up its efforts to clarify certain aspects of its nuclear activities and undertake the confidencebuilding 
measures specified in the BoardÂs latest resolution on the matter. Libya had kept its word and 
followed a policy of transparency and active cooperation with the Agency and he encouraged it to 
continue along that path. 
73. Every State, in developing the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, had an obligation to protect its 
people and the environment from ionizing radiation and the risks of radioactive contamination. The 
Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on 
the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management and the AgencyÂs safety standards were helping to 
promote a global safety culture and to improve or maintain the safety of nuclear facilities. 
74. Work was continuing in Belgium to find a sustainable solution for the final disposal of 
intermediate- and high-level and long-lived radioactive waste. Geological disposal remained the 
preferred option and research had shown that it did not pose insurmountable problems. However, his 
country was also participating in work on the separation and transmutation of radioactive waste, 
techniques that might facilitate disposal. In that connection, its Nuclear Research Centre (CEN/SCK) 
was developing the Myrrha system, an accelerator-driven system allowing a number of experiments to 
be performed, including on transmutation. 
75. Although nuclear safety and security had points in common, they were different and involved, 
at times, incompatible requirements. That made it difficult for States to elaborate or maintain a clear 
and coherent regulatory framework. The Agency should initiate consideration of that topic. It was 
incumbent upon each State to put in place its own physical protection system for nuclear material and

facilities and the Belgian authorities were currently revising regulations in that area. His country 
supported the convening of a conference to consider the proposed amendments to the CPPNM. It 
hoped that the review process would be completed shortly and that the final report of the expert group 
would be useful. 

76. Belgium had joined the consensus in the Board on the approval of the Guidance on the Import 
and Export of Radioactive Sources supplementary to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security 
of Radioactive Sources and hoped that an appropriate import and export control system would be put 
in place with a view to harmonizing practices. 
77. Although nuclear power was growing more slowly than in the past in the West, it continued to 
contribute significantly to energy supply. In Belgium, nuclear power plants had produced 56% of the 
total amount of electricity generated in 2003. 
78. At a time when some countries were deciding to abandon the nuclear energy option in the 
medium term, the maintenance and promotion of nuclear knowledge was more important than ever for 
both plant safety and security and the development of non-power applications. Belgium welcomed the 
AgencyÂs activities in that regard and was taking steps to safeguard nuclear knowledge, including 
through the provision of scholarships for some university courses in the nuclear area, the 
establishment of the Belgian Nuclear Higher Education Network, and participation in the European 
Nuclear Education Network. However, an insufficient number of students were choosing to study 
nuclear science and information campaigns aimed at young people had been launched. 
79. In conclusion, the international community had to rise to the challenges in the areas of safety, 
security and non-proliferation; its failure to do so would have grave consequences for international 
security. The Agency would have a pivotal role to play in that regard and could be sure of BelgiumÂs 
full support. 
Ms. Hall (Canada) took the chair. 

80. Mr. BENDJABALLAH (Algeria) said that the many challenges facing the international 
community included the risk of nuclear proliferation, constraints affecting the technical cooperation 
programme, and international terrorism. In that context, the AgencyÂs mission of ensuring the safe and 
peaceful use of nuclear energy and promoting nuclear technology made a valuable contribution to 
sustainable development and international peace and security. 
81. Despite its shortcomings, the NPT was an essential element in the global security system. All 
States party to that Treaty had voluntarily undertaken to pursue the double objective of disarmament 
and non-proliferation. Non-proliferation was thus a transitional stage intended to lead to the complete 
elimination of nuclear weapons. The right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was enshrined 
in Article IV of the NPT and should be respected as it only served to strengthen the non-proliferation 
regime. All States should accede to all international non-proliferation and disarmament instruments. 
82. The constant tension in the Middle East in recent years, and the deadlock in the peace process, 
exacerbated the threat posed by the fact that nuclear safeguards were not being applied in all countries 
in the region. Israel was the only country in the Middle East which had not acceded to the NPT and 
continued to develop military nuclear capacity. His country deplored the lack of progress on that issue 
which had long been on the AgencyÂs agenda. The proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
the Middle East had not even got off the ground because of IsraelÂs refusal to accede to the NPT and 
subject its nuclear installations to Agency safeguards. 
83. Algeria had ratified all international instruments related to weapons of mass destruction. In 
July 2003 it had deposited its instruments of ratification for the CTBT and it had just notified the 
Agency of its intention to conclude an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 13 

84. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative International PartnersÂ Conference which had taken 
place in Vienna just prior to the General Conference should help meet nuclear safety and security 
challenges. The use of radioactive sources by terrorists could no longer be ruled out. The AgencyÂs 
action plan to combat nuclear terrorism was an appropriate response to that threat. The Agency should 
pursue its activities aimed at improving the security of nuclear installations and material and at 
strengthening Member StatesÂ capacity in that area, in accordance with its mandate under its Statute. 
Those activities should, however, continue to be financed from voluntary contributions so as not to 
reduce the resources allocated to technical cooperation. 
85. Constant and sustained effort was required in the field of nuclear, radiological and waste safety 
in order to counter the reluctance and lack of understanding of potential users and the public where 
nuclear technology was concerned. Algeria had begun to revise its legislation and regulations in order 
to strengthen its radiation infrastructure, as recommended by the Agency. Measures had been taken to 
improve the physical protection of nuclear material, coordination and implementation. Algeria 
subscribed to the provisions of the AgencyÂs Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of 
Radioactive Sources. 
86. Technical cooperation, one of the three pillars of the AgencyÂs work, helped to strengthen 
national capacities in line with the needs and priorities of developing countries. Algeria believed that 
the goals and mechanisms of technical cooperation should be constantly adapted to suit the 
requirements of recipient States and the challenges which they faced. The technical cooperation 
programme provided the international community with an opportunity to demonstrate solidarity. 
Algeria paid both its Regular Budget contributions and its contributions to the TCF consistently and 
on time, and he called on all Member States to ensure that assured, predictable, and sufficient 
resources were available for the financing of technical cooperation activities. Furthermore, the Agency 
should strive to maintain the necessary balance between its main statutory activities. 
87. Algeria had signed its CPF in August 2004, which should facilitate the elaboration of future 
cooperation programmes. It was also involved in and contributed to AFRA. Many regional scientific 
events had taken place in Algeria and the country had helped with an audit of African nuclear 
medicine services. It had welcomed many students from other African countries and was now offering 
a masterÂs degree in medical physics in collaboration with the Agency. 
88. Algeria, like many other African countries, had suffered greatly from the ravages of the desert 
locust. He urged the Agency to consider initiating research under its pest control programme to 
develop appropriate control techniques. 
89. Finally, he called upon all States to ratify the amendment to Article VI of the Statute in order to 
achieve more equitable representation of developing countries in the Board of Governors. 
90. Mr. ADZEI BEKOE (Ghana) expressed condolences to the Governments and peoples of the 
Russian Federation, Spain, Australia and Indonesia following the terrorist attacks launched in those 
countries. 
91. Events over the preceding year had been very challenging for the Agency and it was gratifying 
to see from the Annual Report for 2003 that the organization had been able to respond promptly, 
appropriately and with great dexterity to all those challenges. In handling those complex and highly 
sensitive situations, the Agency had been guided by the principle that it was only through international 
cooperation, vigilance and mutual accommodation that progress could be made when dealing with 
issues relating to international peace and security, nuclear non-proliferation and environmental 
protection. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 14 

92. The safe and peaceful use of nuclear technology offered unique tools in the quest for sustainable 
development. The AgencyÂs role in transferring nuclear technologies for peaceful applications in its 
Member States could not be overemphasized, hence the importance of stepping up Agency efforts to 
help eradicate poverty, fight disease and protect the environment. However, success depended on 
sustained and cooperative action among all committed Agency partners. 
93. Ghana was highly appreciative of the support it had received from the Agency through its 
technical cooperation programmes. Through both national and regional projects it had continued to 
strengthen its human resources and institutional capabilities for the application of nuclear technologies 
to solve problems in the areas of health care, agriculture, industry and the environment. 
94. The Ghana Atomic Energy Commission had continued to make more efficient use of the 
AgencyÂs programmes for nuclear science and technology research and applications. One notable 
achievement was the application of neutron activation analysis. GhanaÂs research reactor had been 
used to characterize major aquifers in the countryÂs eastern region and for geochemical studies of 
granite bodies in the south. Researchers had carried out work involving radioisotope scanning of 
distillation columns for the nationÂs oil refinery and had used non-destructive testing techniques to 
inspect welds in the chemical and mining industries. 
95. Nuclear and biotechnological techniques were being used together with conventional farming 
practices to support national agricultural projects aimed at increasing food production through the use 
of tissue culture, and at enhancing biodiversity through the introduction of viable economic varieties 
produced by mutation breeding. 
96. For a decade, Ghana had been utilizing radiation processing for food preservation and 
sterilization of medical products. Over the years, manpower had been trained to operate the cobalt-60 
gamma irradiator. The source had become very weak and his country was seeking venture capital or a 
partnership with the private sector to replace it. It was hoped that the financial resources needed for the 
full commercialization of the technology would be found. 
97. The Radiation Protection Institute of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission continued to carry 
out safety assessments for licensing of the possession and use of radiation sources and radioactive 
material. There had also been regular compliance inspections to ensure protection of staff, patients and 
the public. 
98. His country would continue to make every effort to ensure that radioactive sources were safe 
and secure. Measures were being taken to enhance the physical protection of all facilities housing 
ionizing radiation sources and nuclear material. The Radiation Protection Board and the National 
Disaster Management Organization had just agreed on a national emergency response plan. The roles 
and responsibilities of the stakeholder institutions had been identified and preparations made for 
emergency drills and exercises to be conducted in the near future. Ghana shared the international 
communityÂs concern about nuclear safety and security and recognized the importance of the actions 
taken to address that issue. It also strongly supported the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. 
99. As in many countries in Africa and other tropical areas, malaria was a major cause for concern. 
His country was therefore particularly excited about the AgencyÂs efforts and research activities aimed 
at combating malaria through the application of the SIT. 
100. His Government was grateful to the Agency for establishing of a second radiotherapy centre in 
the country. The Agency had provided all equipment, training and expert services. The two 
radiotherapy facilities were being used to treat cancer patients from both Ghana and neighbouring 
countries in the West African subregion. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 15 

101. Nuclear security was a precondition for nuclear cooperation and trade, but many countries with 
insignificant nuclear activities lacked the experience needed to devise and implement a national 
nuclear security system. Verification challenges were constantly evolving, and the fact that potential 
proliferators constantly sought access to new technologies meant that the Agency had constantly to 
update its knowledge and detection capabilities. He appealed to the Agency and Member States with 
sufficient experience to assist developing countries to close the security gap. Furthermore, multilateral 
solutions should be found for the management and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive 
waste. Due account should be taken of the potential economic benefits, as well as the security and 
non-proliferation advantages, that could result from international cooperation on the construction and 
operation of international storage facilities and waste repositories. 
102. Countries should cooperate fully to enhance the effectiveness of the NPT and the sustainability 
of the non-proliferation regime. Ghana attached great importance to the reduction of military 
expenditure and urged all States to devote the resources freed through such efforts to economic and 
social development. 
103. The Agency had been one of GhanaÂs reliable development partners ever since the country had 
joined the Organization in 1960. GhanaÂs second CPF had been signed earlier in the month and it 
provided a framework for technical cooperation with the Agency in the medium term and outlined a 
mutually agreed strategy for matching nuclear technology to national priorities for sustainable 
development. The focus of cooperation with the Agency would be on human health, water resources 
development, crop production, livestock development and the development of human resources for the 
application of nuclear technology and biotechnology. 
Mr. RÃ³naky (Hungary) took the chair. 

8. Election of members to the Board of Governors 
(GC(48)/4 and 27) 

104. The PRESIDENT recalled that in 1989 the General Conference that had approved a procedure 
whereby, when there was agreement regarding the candidate or candidates from a particular area, no 
secret ballot would be held; balloting would only take place for those areas where no candidate had 
been agreed upon. That procedure considerably facilitated the rational use of the General ConferenceÂs 
time. Accordingly, he proposed that Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Conference, 
which provided that elections to the Board should be by secret ballot, be suspended in respect of those 
areas for which there was agreement. 
105. He was happy to report that agreement had been reached in all area groups on their candidates 
for the vacancies to be filled. 
106. Drawing attention to document GC(48)/4, containing a list of the Agency Member States that 
the Board of Governors had designated to serve on the Board from the end of the ConferenceÂs current 
session until the end of the forty-ninth (2005) regular session, he recalled that, under Rule 83 of the 
Rules of Procedure, he had to inform the General Conference of the elective places on the Board that 
had to be filled. To that end, document GC(48)/27 had been prepared; it indicated that the Conference 
had to elect eleven members of the Board from the seven categories listed. 
107. He took it that the General Conference wished to elect Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela to the 
three vacant seats for Latin America. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 16 

108. Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela were duly elected. 
109. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Portugal and Sweden to 
the two vacant seats for Western Europe. 
110. Portugal and Sweden were duly elected. 
111. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Slovakia to the vacant 
seat for Eastern Europe. 
112. Slovakia was duly elected. 
113. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Algeria and Ghana to the 
two vacant seats for Africa. 
114. Algeria and Ghana were duly elected. 
115. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Yemen to the vacant seat 
for the Middle East and South Asia. 
116. Yemen was duly elected. 
117. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Singapore to the vacant 
seat for South East Asia and the Pacific. 
118. Singapore was duly elected. 
119. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference wished to elect Sri Lanka to the floating 
seat for Africa/MESA/SEAP, which it was the turn of a member from MESA to fill. 
120. Sri Lanka was duly elected. 
Â Requests for the restoration of voting rights 
(GC(48)/INF/9, 10, 11 and 12) 

121. The PRESIDENT noted that the General Committee had had before it requests from 
Afghanistan, Armenia, Iraq and Kazakhstan for the restoration of their voting rights. It had 
recommended that Afghanistan, Armenia and Kazakhstan be permitted to vote during the current 
session of the Conference, and until the end of their respective payment periods, on the understanding 
that they continued to meet the requirements of their payment plans and that the Secretariat would 
report annually on the status of those payment plans. The General Committee had further 
recommended that Iraq be permitted to vote during the current session of the Conference because it 
was of the view that it had failed to pay the amount necessary to avoid the application of Article 
XIX.A of the Statute owing to conditions beyond its control. 
122. He took it that the Conference accepted the recommendations of the General Committee. 
123. It was so decided.

22. 
Examination of delegatesÂ credentials 
(GC(48)/28) 

124. The PRESIDENT said that the General Committee had met earlier in the day to examine the 
credentials of all delegates, as provided for in Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure. The report of the 
Committee was contained in document GC(48)/28. After discussion, the Committee had 
recommended the adoption by the Conference of the draft resolution contained in paragraph 7 of its 
report, with the reservations and positions expressed in the report. 
125. Mr. SHAALAN (Egypt) said that EgyptÂs acceptance of the credentials submitted by the 
delegation of the State of Israel should on no account be understood as covering any of the territories 
occupied by Israel since 1967, in particular Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. As far as Egypt was 
concerned, Israel as a State meant the State with the borders of 4 June 1967 and as defined in the 
peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan. 
126. Mr. LAASEL (Morocco) said that MoroccoÂs acceptance of the credentials of the delegation of 
Israel issued in occupied Jerusalem in no way prejudged the international status of the city, as laid 
down in relevant United Nations resolutions. 
127. Mr. FASSIH (Algeria) associated himself with the statements made by the representatives of 
Egypt and Morocco. 
128. Mr. AL-RAFIE (Jordan) said that, given the importance that his country attached to securing 
peace for the peoples of the Middle East, and its belief in the need for international action to achieve 
that aim, his delegation had approved the report of the General Committee and had not signed the 
statement by Arab delegations expressing their reservations regarding the credentials of the Israeli 
delegation for the current and previous sessions. Jordan adhered to its consistent position regarding the 
illegality of the Israeli annexation of occupied Jerusalem, which violated Security Council resolutions. 
It also affirmed its commitment to General Assembly resolution 35/169 of 1980 which determined that 
all legislative and administrative actions taken after the occupation of Jerusalem were null and void 
and called upon all States, specialized agencies and international organizations not to conduct any 
business that was not in conformity with the provisions of that resolution. 
129. The PRESIDENT took it that the General Conference was prepared to adopt the draft resolution 
contained in paragraph 7 of document GC(48)/28. 
130. 
It was so decided. 
7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (resumed) 
(GC(48)/3) 
131. Mr. MENDIS (Sri Lanka) said that Agency technical cooperation provided developing Member 
States with the competitive edge to meet the challenges of globalization, sustainable development and 
attainment of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 18 

132. The technical cooperation programme had enabled Sri Lanka to acquire the capacity to use 
nuclear technology for important projects and programmes in the fields of health, agriculture and 
industry, addressing such issues as the safety of agricultural produce, judicious application of 
agrochemicals and the improvement of radiotherapy facilities in cancer hospitals. 
133. The Agency had made every effort to enhance self-reliance and sustainability of national 
institutions. Sri LankaÂs Atomic Energy Authority had generated 55% of its operational expenses 
in 2003 through its own activities. He expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs efforts to improve 
radiation protection and waste management infrastructure facilities in Sri Lanka. 
134. In 1976, Sri Lanka had become a party to the RCA and had actively participated in its 
programmes. As a result, national programmes on the use of nuclear technology had been established, 
primarily in the health care, agricultural and industrial sectors. Many programmes initiated through the 
RCA had been developed as national programmes through Agency technical cooperation. His country 
strongly supported the AgencyÂs approach to fostering regional cooperation. Regional cooperative 
agreements were effective mechanisms through which transboundary issues relating to safety and 
security could be addressed. 
135. One of the AgencyÂs most important tasks was to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons by 
implementing effectively and efficiently the verification regime established through NPT 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The end of the Cold War had 
accentuated the risk of proliferation of nuclear material to non-State actors. In recent years, prevention 
of such proliferation had been a task of overriding importance for the Board of Governors. His country 
was confident that the Board would take the necessary steps if there was an imminent danger and that 
it would not remain passive until the mushroom cloud appeared on the horizon. However, any such 
steps had to be based on strong and reliable evidence of violations. In case of doubt, it might be 
necessary to continue the diplomatic process. The Board had to tread carefully before taking such 
decisions. 
136. Sri Lanka endorsed the AgencyÂs concern regarding the lack of progress towards complete and 
universal elimination of nuclear weapons. Efforts to achieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons 
were as important as non-proliferation. His country remained concerned at the lack of progress in 
fulfilling the commitments contained in the final document of the 2000 NPT Review Conference, and 
at the failure of the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work. 
137. The safety and security of nuclear and radioactive material was of paramount importance to the 
international community. In the hands of non-State actors, such material could cause havoc and 
destruction. The danger of terrorists using weapons of mass destruction was not science fiction. His 
country welcomed the Global Threat Reduction Initiative which required States to undertake voluntary 
measures to transfer high-enriched uranium from research reactors and to ensure the safety and 
security of nuclear and radioactive material. The implementation of that initiative called for legal and 
technical expertise from both developed and developing countries to ensure that those measures were 
incorporated into national legal systems. 
138. There was an urgent need to redouble efforts to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime 
and prevent weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of non-State actors. Multilateral 
treaties on and multilateral approaches to the elimination and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons 
were fundamental to ensuring peace and security for future generations. 
139. Mr. ARÃVALO YÃPES (Colombia) said that his country had always supported nuclear nonproliferation 
and disarmament, was firmly committed to the NPT and the Tlatelolco Treaty, and 
fulfilled its obligations under its safeguards agreement. It supported multilateral initiatives to end the 
nuclear threat posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their possible use by terrorists, 

GC(48)/OR.7 
23 September 2004, Page 19 

and by the very existence of nuclear weapons. The NPT established a collective security system based 
on multilateralism and the recognition of the right of all States to develop nuclear energy for peaceful 
purposes. For that system to be effective, the cooperation and commitment of all States were required. 
He called for renewed efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and expressed support for the 
AgencyÂs safeguards and verification activities. 

140. Colombia accorded great importance to the Agency, of which it had been a member since 1960. 
The three pillars of the AgencyÂs activities struck a balance which was fundamental to the 
achievement of the organizationÂs statutory objectives. It was important to maintain that balance, 
particularly at a time when developing countries faced huge challenges which exceeded their 
technological and financial resources. Nuclear applications in such sensitive areas as food security, 
agriculture, health, water resource management, environmental protection, radiation safety culture and 
the sustainability of industrial processes could improve the quality of life in many communities. The 
AgencyÂs work in those areas and its efforts to preserve nuclear knowledge were laudable and should 
continue, since the Agency had an important role to play in promoting sustainable development. 
International cooperation was a vehicle for the transfer of nuclear knowledge and technology for 
peaceful purposes for the benefit of all humanity. 
141. Colombia had benefited from the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme. Both national and 
regional projects had been implemented, focusing in particular on human health, mining, radiological 
protection, agriculture and nuclear medicine. His country had welcomed the AgencyÂs policies 
promoting systematic analysis of the planning of activities and projects and it was fully committed to 
the AgencyÂs modern management vision. 
142. As a pioneer in its region in the use of nuclear techniques to treat liver cancer, Colombia 
attached particular importance to radiotherapy and nuclear medicine projects. Its oncological 
institutions had received Agency support and the National Institute of Oncology had undertaken a 
cost-sharing exercise with the Agency in December 2003. Hence, it supported the AgencyÂs 
Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy. It was also strongly in favour of adapting nuclear 
technologies for humanitarian demining. At regional level, the ARCAL programme had been 
promoting and strengthening South-South cooperation for 20 years. He expressed appreciation to the 
Secretariat and donors for their support for that programme. 
143. Colombia attached great importance to the transport of radioactive waste. It supported the 
conclusions of the 2003 International Conference on the Safety of Transport of Radioactive Material, 
General Conference resolution GC(47)/RES/7, the Action Plan for the Safety of Transport of 
Radioactive Material approved by the Board in March 2004, and the work of the International Expert 
Group on Nuclear Liability. He stressed the importance of international cooperation and information 
exchange between shipping States and coastal States and the fundamental role of the Agency in that 
regard. The elaboration of a binding legal instrument on that issue would also be desirable. 
144. The safety and security of radioactive sources was a priority and his country shared the concerns 
regarding inadequate control of such sources. There was a need to strengthen mechanisms, national 
regulations and international cooperation structures aimed at reducing the potential risks associated 
with radioactive sources, illicit trafficking in radioactive material and their potential use by terrorists. 
Colombia valued the AgencyÂs work in the nuclear safety and security field, supported all efforts to 
promote collective security based on international cooperation and multilateralism, welcomed the 
Global Threat Reduction Initiative and felt that the Agency had a fundamental role to play in that 
initiative and any other initiative in that field. It was also concerned at the existence of a black market 
network for radioactive material, equipment and components and the new challenges that posed. The 
threat of proliferation and terrorism required joint efforts at all levels. A collective security system 
should not only be based on respect for the rights and legal equality of all States, it should also take 

GC(48)/OR.7

account of the needs of developing countries which, in a globalized world, had to fight for equal 
access to markets while the resources allocated to international cooperation were constantly being 
reduced. 

Â Report of the Scientific Forum 
145. The PRESIDENT invited the Rapporteur, Mr. Bigot, to present the report of the Scientific 
Forum. 
146. Mr. Bigot presented the report which is reproduced in the Annex. 
147. The PRESIDENT thanked Mr. Bigot for his most interesting report and the Secretariat for its 
excellent preparation of the Scientific Forum. 
The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.

Report to the 48th regular session of the IAEA General Conference 
from the 7th Scientific Forum 

As a Chairman, it is my privilege and duty to report to you and the Plenary the main points from 
the presentations and debates of the 7th Scientific Forum organized during the 48th regular session of 
the IAEA General Conference. This meeting took place on 21-22 September 2004 in Vienna, in an 
excellent and constructive spirit under the general title of ÂNuclear Fuel Cycle Issues and ChallengesÂ. 
It gathered about 180 participants. The three sessions focused on: Advanced Fuel Cycles and Reactor 
Concepts; Waste and Spent Fuel Management Issues; and Research Reactor Fuel Cycle and Related 
Issues. All together, 12 detailed presentations were made by leading experts, followed by panellistsÂ 
comments and discussion with participants. 

Before presenting a short report on the points related to the three sessions, let me share with you 
some general comments: 

After years of large R & D efforts in several countries, we presently have a wealth of important 
scientific results offering answers to a range of issues related to reactors, fuels and nuclear material 
cycles. New important results are expected to come in the next five/ten years in the considered fields. 

We are now moving towards large-scale demonstrations of technologies which could give us an 
incentive to consider new R & D programs for fully satisfying economical, safety, reliability and nonproliferation 
expectations. 

Due to the present world-wide energy and security context, the next years and decades will see 
the need for important decisions regarding the building of new power plants, the life extension of the 
present ones, the decommissioning of reactors as well as the commencement of long term waste 
disposal projects. All these topics require firm scientific basis, which have to be shared by the public 
opinion as well as by the political decision makers. There is a great need to communicate on the 
scientific and technological achievements if we want to gain the agreement of the public. 

Our discussions in the Forum revealed that there is no unique way to deal with these issues; 
diversity has to be fully accepted as far as we agree on the fundamental principles of safety, and 
environmental and health requirements. We have to set some R & D programs accordingly and work 
towards international cooperation and discussions to further facilitate the decision process. 

Let me now turn to the discussions that took place in the Forum. 

In an introductory stimulating presentation, the interest for sub-critical reactors with accelerator 
driven systems, from the safety point of view, was emphasized. The thorium cycle for minimizing the 
minor actinide problems associated with the uranium cycle was also advocated. The presentation also 
highlighted the need to work on highly innovative ideas to generate electricity without any 
radioactivity by using inertial nuclear fusion involving protons, and boron or lithium. 

In Session 1, the importance of optimising in a coherent and global way the nuclear fuel cycle 
with respect to economics, proliferation resistance, safety and environmental aspects was emphasized. 
In this connection, the advanced aqueous processing of spent fuel and the emerging dry pyrochemical 
processes involving molten salt and electro refining were highlighted. The importance of the efficient 
use of uranium in fast breeder reactors was also stressed. 

A survey of evolutionary and innovative reactors and fuel cycles was presented. A 
comprehensive review of advanced water-cooled, gas cooled, and liquid metal cooled reactors, was

provided highlighting their design and operational features. The importance of international initiatives 
such as INPRO and GIF was emphasized in this context to optimise the large R & D efforts required. 

There was emphasis on multi-recycling of plutonium and minor actinides in fast reactors, to 
produce additional energy from fissioning all the actinides. It was mentioned that there is a need for 
progressive changes in the fuel cycles from plutonium recycling in LWRs to multiple plutonium 
recycling in fast reactors in a phased manner over the next hundred years, for optimal utilization of 
uranium resources and burning of all the actinides. 

The R&D needs for innovative reactor and fuel cycle technologies were discussed highlighting 
the Indian experience of its three-stage nuclear power programme combining pressurized heavy water 
reactors, fast reactors and thorium-232/uranium 233 breeders. 

The Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), which is designed to pave the way for an expanded 
role of nuclear energy in the USA was presented. AFCI is considering the technical and economic 
viability of four fuel cycle options, including the open cycle option, recycling in thermal reactors, 
recycling in thermal and fast reactors, and multiple recycling in fast reactors. 

The panel discussion centered on the real need for accelerator driven systems (ADS) and FBR 
for waste minimization, and utilization of research reactors for development of advanced fuels and 
materials for innovative reactors. The panel explained the technical reasons for ADS introduction and 
confirmed its potential, but not yet demonstrated, role for transmutation and energy production. 

Regarding the question on the introduction of innovative nuclear energy systems in developing 
countries, the panel pointed out that developing countries have the highest energy demand in the 
foreseeable future. Nuclear energy could cater to this demand. In particular, innovative reactor systems 
in the small and medium size category with inherent safety features and enhanced proliferation 
resistance are seen as a future potential source of energy in these countries. 

At the end of the session there was a broadly shared view among the participants that nuclear 
energy as an emission free energy source is indispensable for sustainable development. The 
continuous research and development in support of innovative reactors and fuel cycles is crucial. The 
panel also confirmed the need for research reactors as an important tool for development of innovative 
reactor systems. In this respect, the closure of the fuel cycle with fast reactors was highlighted. 

Session 2 on waste and spent fuel management noted that the growth of nuclear power, while 
providing many benefits, has also resulted in an increasing global challenge over safe waste and spent 
fuel management. Over the past fifty years, the world has come to better understand the strong 
interplay between all elements of the nuclear fuel cycle, global economics and security. The nuclear 
fuel cycle is no longer managed as a simple sequence of technological, economic and political 
challenges. Rather it must be managed as a system of strongly related issues. Waste and spent fuel 
management cannot be relegated to the back-end of the fuel cycle as only a storage or disposal issue. 
There exists a wealth of success and experience with waste and spent fuel management that can be 
forged together to mitigate these global challenges in the future. 

The participants of this session reviewed the R & D results and the experience to date, in some 
specific countries like Russian Federation, USA and France for instance, including approaches from 
direct disposal to the closed cycle. Regarding the latter, reprocessing of irradiated power reactor fuel 
was noted to be a mature industrial technology. Experience to date has demonstrated that reprocessing 
can be compatible with security and non-proliferation requirements. There has also been a continuing 
reduction in the volume of waste arising from reprocessing. This trend will continue with the 
implementation of improved technology and operating practices. R&D programmes to study the 


GC(48)/OR.7 
Annex 
23 September 2004, Page 3 

partitioning and transmutation of environmentally significant radionuclides are being pursued to 
further assess potential paths to enhancing the effectiveness of waste minimization programmes. 

The session also noted that safe and robust interim storage technologies are available to provide 
system flexibility while addressing longer term waste and spent fuel management options and issues. 
Regarding direct disposal, session 2 participants described significant progress to date. The majority of 
technological issues were noted to have been satisfactorily addressed, but ethical and social issues, 
remain to be addressed appropriately in some countries. 

The discussions centered on the issues regarding reprocessing to preclude the need for 
repositories and the question of relative economics associated with the fuel cycles. The consensus 
among the participants was that geological disposal remains an ultimate requirement for the open as 
well as the closed cycle. In the discussion regarding national and multinational repositories, it was 
noted that it would be desirable to have operating national repositories and to further public 
acceptance and facilitate progress on multinational geological repositories. 

Session 3 dealt with several aspects of the research reactor fuel cycle from the development and 
qualification of high density low enriched uranium (LEU) fuels as replacements for highly enriched 
uranium (HEU) fuels, through utilization, interim spent fuel management, reactor refurbishment and 
ultimate decommissioning. 

The extensive development work to increase the uranium loading in LEU fuels and the 
substantial success achieved so far were reported. Also, work is in progress for development of LEU 
targets for fission Mo99 production. It is not expected that qualified U-Mo fuels will become available 
before the year 2010. In this context, the extension of the United States foreign research reactor spent 
fuel return program would be welcome. 

While research reactors will continue to play a crucial role in nuclear science and technology it 
is important to ensure operational ability in terms of technical and financial resources, meeting the 
current standards of nuclear and conventional safety, and other aspects related to physical security, 
public acceptance and environmental responsibility. The technical aspects that need to be addressed 
include the capability for safe spent fuel management and storage, reactor refurbishment when 
required and the eventual decontamination and decommissioning of the facility. 

For extended interim storage of aluminium-clad spent fuel, a semi-dry storage technique 
developed and implemented at the Budapest research reactor institute was discussed. Irradiated fuel 
was encapsulated in sealed tubes filled with dry nitrogen and turned to the water storage pool. This is 
expected to prevent further corrosion of the irradiated fuel and hence can be used for storing spent fuel 
over extended periods. 

Various aspects of decommissioning of research reactors were presented wherein it was 
highlighted that early development of a decommissioning strategy is highly beneficial. It was also 
underlined that a cooling-off period after the final shutdown of the reactor can be highly beneficial, 
not only because of the decay in radioactivity, but in the progressive availability of newly developed 
technologies for decommissioning. Problems of dealing with stakeholders, funding issues and waste 
management associated with the decommissioning of a low power research reactor were also 
presented and discussed. 

It was stated that new research reactors would be required to investigate and develop the 
advanced fuel and core materials for many of the proposed innovative power reactor concepts. It was 
stressed that this reactor may have to be powered with HEU or plutonium fuels to investigate the 
conditions that will prevail in fast reactors.

Let me now conclude. The scientific and industrial communities greatly appreciate the IAEA 
initiative to organize this Scientific Forum on Nuclear Fuel Cycle Issues and Challenges. It allowed 
very fruitful discussions and provided opportunities for enhancing further cooperation involving the 
national programs. The meeting showed that large progresses have been made, but difficult issues still 
remain open. Therefore, it is important for all interested countries to carry on with ambitious R & D 
programs in due time in order to prepare for the future.

7. 
General debate and Annual Report for 2003 (resumed) 
(GC(48)/3) 
1. Mr. MÃRQUEZ MARÃN (Venezuela) said that his country attached great importance to the 
activities of the Agency, which was the appropriate channel for promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy and implementing any programme to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons with a view 
to ensuring peace and stability in the world. The signature and ratification by Venezuela of the NPT, 
the Tlatelolco Treaty and the CTBT showed its commitment to nuclear disarmament and the rule of 
international law. 
2. The Nuclear Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Energy and Mines in Venezuela was being 
strengthened to enhance its capacity to respond both to the increased use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes in Venezuela and to the growing need to regulate and control those uses to ensure 
optimum and safe use of nuclear applications. Technological development and innovation were 
important factors not only for sustainable social and economic development but also in the fight 
against poverty and social exclusion. The Agency had an important role to play in promoting the 
transfer of nuclear technology through bilateral and regional projects based on common needs and 
interests, making use of existing integration mechanisms such as the Association of Caribbean States 
and the Andean Community. Venezuela stood ready to work with the Agency and ARCAL to promote 
such socially and economically beneficial cooperation in the region. 
3. Venezuela attached great importance to technical cooperation and highly appreciated the 
projects it was implementing with the Agency. However, it hoped to make much greater progress in 
the application of nuclear science and technology through the implementation of a comprehensive plan 
designed to improve medical care, environmental protection, industry and agriculture. The plan would 
prioritize technical training and the building of the infrastructure required for the proper exercise of 
the StateÂs regulatory functions. His country hoped that the Agency would continue to support the 
strengthening of its nuclear regulatory and planning capacity. Only a coherent nuclear development 
strategy incorporated in the national development plan would bring optimum results in the transfer and 
dissemination of nuclear technology. Venezuela was grateful to the Agency for the steady progress 
achieved in the development of new projects for the 2005Â2006 biennium. It particularly appreciated 
the positive results obtained in the application of nuclear technology for the protection of dams and 
inventorying of water resources. It attached particular importance to the inclusion in the national 
technical cooperation programme of the project to monitor the stability of the terrace where the city of 
Valera was located, and seismic microzoning in that area, as part of the programme on disaster 
prevention and civil protection. It hoped that the number of new projects and training of human 
resources would increase. 
4. His Government was eager to design and implement a comprehensive plan aimed at establishing 
a national nuclear safety system which would ensure both security and safety and prevent illicit 
trafficking in radioactive material. To ascertain the current status in Venezuela in that regard, Agency 
experts had carried out a complete evaluation which was in the process of being validated by the 
national authorities. Once that phase was complete, an appropriate plan would be elaborated which 
should help improve nuclear safety considerably and which Venezuela hoped the Agency and donor 
countries would support. 
5. Particular areas of interest were radioactive waste management, strengthening regulatory 
capacity, upgrading and updating national radiological equipment, developing the radiological 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 2 

emergency system and improving the records of radioactive material. His country supported the Code 
of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the guidelines for its application 
and had been one of the first countries to adhere to it. 

6. The Agency played a fundamental role in the verification of disarmament and non-proliferation 
agreements and Venezuela supported its efforts to prevent any diversion of nuclear technology from 
peaceful uses. His country would support any initiative that contributed to nuclear disarmament and 
the use of nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes and absolutely rejected terrorism in any form 
and on whatever grounds. 
7. His country shared the international communityÂs desire for a secure world and felt that 
international cooperation aimed at establishing a reliable safety and security system for nuclear 
facilities should be conducted within the framework of the Agency. It was therefore essential to 
strengthen the Agency with a view to further increasing and improving its technical cooperation, 
safeguards and nuclear safety programmes. 
8. The global threat from nuclear arsenals and the proliferation of nuclear weapons had to be 
countered. The Agency, as the guardian of the NPT, had a fundamental role to play in that regard. The 
early entry into force of the CTBT was equally important and he urged countries that had yet to do so 
to sign or ratify that Treaty, especially those whose adherence was required for the TreatyÂs entry into 
force and those with large nuclear weapons arsenals. His country rejected unilateral, selective and 
discriminatory approaches to dealing with the nuclear threat and favoured strengthening international 
law, multilateralism and international cooperation with a view to achieving total global disarmament. 
The right of all countries to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear energy should also be respected 
without extra conditions which went beyond those imposed by international law. 
9. Mr. IBRAHIM (Iraq) said he wished to present an optimistic picture of Iraq and its science 
policies, which were designed to benefit his countryÂs society and people and to compensate for the 
time that had been wasted in misguided scientific pursuits under the preceding regime. The policies of 
that regime had hampered progress and isolated Iraq from the international community. 
10. Iraq had now put the past behind it and was seeking to forge solid relations with the rest of the 
world aimed at scientific cooperation and promoting mutual understanding. As the cradle of 
civilization, it hoped to recover its scientific and cultural status by working for international peace and 
security and a world free of weapons of mass destruction. 
11. The international community had welcomed the formation of the new Iraqi Government, which 
had committed itself to full compliance with all IraqÂs international treaties, in particular the NPT and 
its safeguards agreement with the Agency. Iraq supported the efforts to rid the Middle East of weapons 
of mass destruction. All States, and in particular nuclear-weapon States, should help to further that 
goal by urging parties in the region that had not yet done so to accede to the NPT and other 
instruments pertaining to weapons of mass destruction, thereby contributing to the establishment of a 
zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the region and promoting the universality of the 
instruments concerned. 
12. His country intended to participate as an observer in the meetings of bodies related to 
instruments to which it had not yet acceded and would voluntarily comply with the provisions of those 
instruments until such time as it was in a position to accede to them. 
13. Two existing institutions had been reformed: the Iraqi Institute for the Control of Radioactive 
Sources and the Iraqi Agency for the Prevention of the Proliferation of Weapons, a body that 
supervised and retrained scientists and engineers who had formerly worked on weapons of mass 
destruction. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 3 

14. Priority was being given to investment of Iraqi scientific expertise in the process of 
reconstruction, in particular in the peaceful use of nuclear energy in medicine, agriculture, industry 
and the environment. The country hoped for Agency assistance in those endeavours and, at the same 
time, believed that the experience of Iraqi scientists could be turned to account in promoting the aims 
for which the Agency was established. 
15. During a visit by the Iraqi Minister of Science and Technology to the Agency in July 2004, 
agreement had been reached on arrangements for the payment of IraqÂs debts to the Agency. On the 
same occasion it had been agreed that Iraq would again participate in elections to the Board of 
Governors and that the Agency would assist Iraq in developing a special remedial programme. The 
programme would focus on decontamination of destroyed sites to protect both people and the 
environment, selection of waste repository sites, promotion of safe transport of contaminated 
materials, provision of equipment and materials for controlling the transport of radioactive sources, 
and support for joint research projects in health, agriculture, water resources, engineering and the 
environment. 
16. Mr. SHEIN (Myanmar) said that the Annual Report highlighted the AgencyÂs growing role in 
building a global nuclear safety culture and helping countries achieve national development goals by 
promoting nuclear science and technology. 
17. The Agency had continued its efforts to implement a strengthened safeguards system in 2003. 
The number of States yet to bring into force comprehensive safeguards agreements in accordance with 
their obligations under the NPT had decreased from 48 at the end of 2002 to 45 and the end of 2003. 
That positive trend was welcome. 
18. A number of world events had posed significant challenges for the Agency over the preceding 
year. In the nuclear non-proliferation area, the Agency had been at the centre of world attention and 
had demonstrated its ability to perform effective and credible inspections. It was also to be 
commended on its successful efforts to ensure that the benefits of nuclear technology were shared 
globally for economic and social development. 
19. He expressed appreciation for the AgencyÂs promotion of international cooperation on nuclear 
safety and safeguards. All Agency safeguards and verification measures should be applied in a 
non-discriminatory manner and in conformity with the relevant provisions of the NPT. 
20. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities played an important role in promoting sustainable 
development in many countries and had contributed to MyanmarÂs national development in such areas 
as food, agriculture, health and human resources development. Thanks to Agency assistance in the 
form of equipment, experts and training, Myanmar had gained access to nuclear medicine, 
radiotherapy and nuclear diagnostic methods and nuclear techniques for medical research. The 
increased use of radioisotopes in industry reflected the industrial progress that Myanmar had achieved. 
21. Myanmar had embarked upon a programme for the promotion and development of nuclear 
applications for which it would need an adequate radiation protection and waste safety infrastructure. 
The elaboration of regulations for the safe use of radiation and atomic energy was nearing completion. 
The assistance provided by the Agency under the interregional Model Project on radiation protection 
and radiation and waste safety infrastructure was appreciated. 
22. All developing countries deserved Agency assistance and priority should be given to technical 
assistance programmes in less developed Member States. Myanmar had two active projects in the 
science and technology sector, two projects in the health sector and two projects in the agriculture, 
livestock and fisheries sector. It had proposed several projects in those areas for the 2005Â2006 cycle 
and sincerely hoped that the Agency would continue to provide assistance. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 4 

23. The AgencyÂs activities in 2003 clearly demonstrated that the scope of its work had continued to 
expand and that its agenda remained very full. It had responded appropriately to all the challenges that 
had arisen, guided by the principle that progress could only be achieved in combating poverty, 
maintaining and enhancing peace and security and protecting the environment through international 
cooperation and mutual accommodation. He expressed the hope that the AgencyÂs activities would 
continue to contribute to global peace, health and prosperity. 
24. Mr. YLLI (Albania) said that his country was committed to meeting all of its obligations under 
international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and attached special importance to 
implementing all resolutions adopted by the Agency, particularly those that ensured an effective and 
efficient international safeguards system. In that connection, his Government had decided to sign an 
additional protocol and would be making every effort to ensure that it was signed and ready for 
ratification by the end of the year. 
25. Albania highly valued the effective technical cooperation provided under the AgencyÂs 
technical cooperation programme, particularly in the fields of human health, radiation protection and 
safety, radioactive waste management and environmental management. It hoped that the Agency 
would continue to provide such assistance, which had a positive impact on peopleÂs lives. For that 
reason, it always paid its contributions to the Agency in full and he urged all Member States to do the 
same. 
26. AlbaniaÂs current technical cooperation programme comprised six active national projects and 
nineteen regional projects covering a broad range of nuclear applications. The infrastructure 
established during the current cycle included a radiological emergency centre, a secondary standards 
dosimetry laboratory and a new cobalt-60 machine at the Mother Teresa Hospital in Tirana. 
27. The Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources had become an 
important guide for Albanian institutions to improve the countryÂs radiation safety regulatory 
infrastructure. 
28. His country strongly supported the Global Threat Reduction Initiative and Albanian institutions 
had made enormous efforts under the radiological threat reduction programme and in combating illicit 
trafficking in nuclear material and radiation sources. 
29. His GovernmentÂs main priority in the next technical cooperation cycle would be to upgrade the 
countryÂs health sector, particularly radiotherapy and nuclear medicine services. A cancer management 
programme had been launched and the decision taken to focus on upgrading the Mother Teresa 
Hospital in Tirana. 
30. In conclusion, he expressed special appreciation to the Director General and to the staff of the 
Europe Section in the Department of Technical Cooperation for their valuable assistance in 
implementing various projects in Albania. 
31. Albania was strongly convinced that the Agency would continue to play an important role in 
promoting the safe use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. 
32. Mr. CABELLO (Paraguay) said that, in the current international climate, the Agency had an 
essential role to play in fostering peace and international security and in promoting the peaceful uses 
of nuclear energy for the social and economic wellbeing of mankind. 
33. As a country that requested technical assistance from the Agency, Paraguay was concerned that 
the balance that had always existed in the distribution of budgetary resources and in the AgencyÂs 
main activities might be lost. It trusted that a satisfactory solution would be found to maintain levels of 
international cooperation.

23 September 2004, Page 5 

34. Despite the difficulties his country faced, it was making every effort to bring its contributions 
up to date over a clearly defined time period. 
35. Paraguay had always supported every effort to put an end to nuclear proliferation and reduce 
existing arsenals. To that end, it had signed and ratified an additional protocol to its NPT safeguards 
agreement with the Agency. He called upon all States that had not yet done so to do likewise in the 
interests of international security. 
36. His country was applying the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and hoped that its provisions would be strictly applied by all States. The Code helped 
maintain security without hindering access to sources for essential applications. Full compliance 
should also strengthen the close link that should exist between exporters and importers, thus 
preventing illicit trafficking and use. 
37. He welcomed the expanding activities of the AgencyÂs Office of Nuclear Security and the 
growing contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund. Paraguay had contributed to the Fund in the 
preceding year and hoped to receive assistance to promote its national security. 
38. He commended the Governments of the United States of America and the Russian Federation 
on the launching of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative which should provide new resources to 
fight nuclear terrorism, the threat of which was more real than ever, particularly in the light of the 
discovery of an illicit supply market. 
39. Paraguay welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure the equitable representation of Member 
States in the AgencyÂs staff. 
40. His country was endeavouring to strengthen its institutional infrastructure through the 
establishment of a single regulatory authority. A group of technicians and legal advisers were revising 
current legislation and an executive decree had recently been signed for the establishment of a 
centralized authority. 
41. Effective controls were being put in place in the interests of nuclear and radiological safety to 
ensure the sustainable development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The objective was to 
establish a mechanism to identify and ensure the traceability of all radiation sources, monitor their safe 
and effective use, advise operators, ensure physical protection of disused sources and radioactive 
waste, and implement effective border controls. He trusted that the Agency and the Global Threat 
Reduction Initiative would cooperate effectively to provide the competent authority with the training 
and infrastructure it required. 
42. Finally, nuclear applications in the fields of health, agriculture and the environment were 
essential to the wellbeing of the population of Paraguay and were areas where his country hoped to 
increase its cooperation with the Agency. 
43. Mr MOREJÃN-ALMEIDA (Ecuador) said that security was one of the most pressing items on 
the international agenda and there was a clear recognition of the AgencyÂs responsibility to monitor 
nuclear material and radioactive sources, given the potential consequences of their accidental or 
malicious use, and to promote the transfer of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes for 
development. Ecuador therefore attached great importance to the Global Threat Reduction Initiative 
International PartnersÂ Conference held in Vienna on 18Â19 September 2004, and to the joint 
responsibility of the international community to control and manage in a responsible way nuclear and 
radioactive material. It had offered to host a Pan-American conference on nuclear and radiation safety 
in Quito in 2005. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 6 

44. The preceding twelve months had seen several Member States, including Spain, Russia and 
Indonesia, become the target of blind violence and terrorism. Such events should not be allowed to 
occur again. It was everyoneÂs responsibility to ensure that people lived together peacefully and 
multilateralism was the only way of achieving balance in international relations. 
45. His country was fully committed to security but also recognized that security and development 
were linked. The alleviation of poverty, sustainable development, fighting disease, promoting health, 
agriculture, energy, nutrition and environmental protection were all pressing matters on the 
international agenda and ones where the Agency made a significant contribution and had an important 
role to play. 
46. With regard to the AgencyÂs programme and budget, the budgetary exercise in 2003 had laid the 
necessary foundation to ensure that the Agency was able to provide what the international community 
expected of it, i.e. a credible verification system contributing to security, and a strengthened technical 
cooperation programme. Ecuador had made an unprecedented effort in the current year by contributing 
a significant sum equivalent to almost four times its annual share. It had also made an extra-budgetary 
contribution to support ARCAL fellowships and training activities. Such gestures demonstrated 
EcuadorÂs unequivocal support for and commitment to all Agency activities, like many other countries 
struggling to meet their financial obligations despite difficult economic situations. Such efforts should 
qualify a country to be a direct recipient of technical cooperation funds. Contributions by national 
counterparts should also be taken into account when developing technical cooperation programmes. 
47. Ecuador was in favour of an international regime for the safe transport of radioactive material 
which covered liability for damage to human health and the environment, and for economic losses 
incurred in the event of an accident or incident. Good communication between States prior to any 
maritime transport of radioactive material was also important. The Agency had an essential role to 
play in that area. 
48. He expressed appreciation to the Agency for the projects it was implementing in Ecuador which 
were contributing to sustainable social growth. His country hoped to expand cooperation in radiation 
safety, nuclear medicine, provision of equipment and training. To that end, it had strengthened its 
competent authority, the Ecuadorian Atomic Energy Commission, which was working hard to comply 
with legislation regulating the manufacture, use, transfer and transport of equipment generating 
ionizing radiation and radiation sources. It also identified areas for the scientific and peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and trained new professionals. 
49. As another example of its desire to participate more actively in the work of the Agency, 
Ecuador had stood for election to the Board of Governors for 2004Â2006 on behalf of GRULAC. 
50. Mr. UMAR (Nigeria) said that nuclear techniques and applications provided a way out of 
poverty, deprivation and suffering for people in developing countries. They were used to increase food 
production, fight disease, manage water resources and monitor the environment. The Agency should 
continue to expand the opportunities which nuclear technology offered for sustaining and improving 
human life. 
51. As a Party to the NPT, Nigeria expected all other State Parties to respect the AgencyÂs mandate 
to verify compliance with the Treaty. The objective of the NPT was, first and foremost, to rid the 
world of the nuclear threat. The approach adopted, namely limiting the number of nuclear-weapon 
States, appeared not to be working. Thus, the only solution was to eliminate nuclear weapons 
altogether. The NPT Review Conference in 2005 would give nuclear-weapon States the opportunity to 
review their nuclear policies with a view to genuinely pursuing nuclear disarmament, as they had 
undertaken to do under Article IV of the Treaty. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 7 

52. He welcomed Chad, Mauritania and Togo as new members of the Agency. African countries 
now made up around one quarter of the membership. The Agency should continue to help Africa 
eliminate the many insect pests which posed a major threat to its people and its economic 
development. The SIT was already being used to fight the tsetse fly. It could also be used to control 
malaria-transmitting mosquitoes and locusts. The tsetse fly eradication campaign enjoyed political 
support at the highest level: the African Union had set up a coordinating office for PATTEC in Addis 
Ababa and was preparing a budget for the eradication campaign. Malaria caused two million deaths 
every year, 90% of them in Africa, and there were 500 million clinical cases that put able-bodied 
adults out of work. R&D on mass rearing of mosquitoes, radiation sterilization and the development of 
genetic sexing strains would begin soon. African research institutions, such as the Sheda Science and 
Technology Complex in Nigeria, should be involved in that work. 
53. He commended the Agency for initiating PACT, which was a timely move in view of the 
impending cancer crisis in the developing world. The provision of radiotherapy services within the 
technical cooperation programme was a success story of which the Agency could be proud. All 
Member States should support PACT in cash and in kind. 
54. Nigeria was one of the initiators of NEPAD and had identified water and human health as its 
priority areas. It had invited the Agency to assist with the development of an isotope hydrology 
laboratory which would serve not only Nigeria but the rest of the West African subregion as well. The 
Federal Ministry of Water Resources had submitted a technical cooperation proposal for the next 
programme cycle. The Government had resolved to provide potable water for 70% of the population 
by 2007 and therefore planned to make a substantial contribution to the project. 
55. The fact that Nigeria, with over 100 000 radiation workers, had fewer than 30 trained radiation 
protection experts was a major challenge for radiation safety in the country. The Nigerian nuclear 
regulatory authority had submitted a technical cooperation proposal for a national postgraduate 
training centre in radiation protection. That authority had been established in May 2001 and had 
started receiving technical assistance immediately through the Model Project on upgrading radiation 
protection infrastructure. Twelve staff members had taken training courses over the preceding year. 
The Nigerian Government hoped that the Model Project would be maintained for a further biennium. 
A number of other events had taken place in Nigeria under that Model Project: a regional training 
course on radiation protection and management of radioactive waste in the oil and gas industry; a 
national seminar on the duties and responsibilities of managers and practitioners in medical 
applications of ionizing radiation; and a workshop on the duties and responsibilities of managers and 
executives involved in the use of radioactive sources in the petroleum industry. One major outcome of 
those events was a proposal to link Agency assistance with that provided under NEPAD. The Nigerian 
Minister of Health had also suggested collaboration with the Agency on the production of a national 
framework for sustainable development of medical applications of ionizing radiation in the country. 
Following an Agency peer review mission in 2003, the Government had issued the Nigerian Basic 
Ionizing Radiation Regulations which laid the basis for the enforcement of the Nuclear Safety and 
Radiation Protection Act 1995. 
56. The final stage of the installation of NigeriaÂs miniature neutron source reactor had begun in 
December 2003 with the delivery of the first batch of nuclear fuel from China. The reactor had 
achieved criticality in February 2004. 
57. In February 2003, two neutron sources had been reported lost by a Nigerian well-logging 
company. It transpired that they had been shipped to Germany in a container full of scrap metal: the 
port authority did not have the necessary equipment to detect radiation. The sources had been sent to 
the United States by the American owners of the shipping company. The Nigerian Government had 
taken a number of steps to prevent such an incident occurring again. It had undertaken an investigation 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 8 

and had banned the export of scrap metal. In addition, new regulations for the safety and security of 
radioactive sources and nuclear material were being developed based on the AgencyÂs Code of 
Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. An International Nuclear Security 
Advisory Service mission had visited Nigeria at the GovernmentÂs request in May 2004. 

58. Finally, he announced that Nigeria was pledging an amount to the TCF for 2005 equal to its 
assessed contribution. 
59. Mr. BALZAN (Malta) said that his country subscribed to the need for a strong system of 
international safeguards to promote collective security. Therefore, his Government had signed an 
additional protocol to its safeguards agreement and the ratification thereof was at an advanced stage. 
He encouraged all States that had not already done so to conclude safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols. 
60. The role of the Agency to promote nuclear safety was even more important at a time when the 
international community was intensifying its efforts to combat terrorism. In that context, misuse of 
nuclear material could pose a serious global threat. His Government was confident that, with the 
support, cooperation and goodwill of Member States, the Agency would continue to make a valid 
contribution to international peace and security. The Maltese Government had enacted legislation on 
radiation protection and nuclear safety and had established a nuclear regulatory authority in 
September 2003. 
61. The development of non-power applications related to human health, agriculture and the 
environment, and efforts to increase the efficiency of the technical cooperation programme were of 
particular interest to countries like Malta which did not use nuclear power. His country was grateful 
for the assistance it received from the Agency in such areas as medical uses of radiation, strengthening 
of national regulatory capabilities and national preparedness in the event of a radiological accident. 
Malta was participating in a number of national and regional projects which provided excellent 
opportunities for staff to take part in relevant training courses and international conferences. It 
welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to improve the effectiveness of the technical cooperation programme 
through greater dialogue with Member States and higher quality projects. Increased cooperation with 
other institutions would also make the programme more effective. In March 2004, his country had 
proposed an initiative aimed at assisting Member States to coordinate at regional level national 
activities relating to the assessment of radionuclides in the marine environment, application of tracer 
techniques to assess environmental pollution, preservation of cultural heritage and strengthening of 
national capabilities in radiation, waste and transport safety in the Mediterranean region. 
62. Ms. SHAIMERGENOVA (Kyrgyzstan) said that, since her country became independent, the 
GovernmentÂs policy on nuclear safety and nuclear energy had always been in line with the AgencyÂs 
fundamental principles. Thus it had signed an NPT safeguards agreement with the Agency which had 
entered into force in February 2004, and the Government was preparing to sign an additional protocol 
and accede to the CPPNM. 
63. On more than one occasion, her country had drawn attention to the grave environmental 
problems it had been facing in recent years which threatened at any moment to develop into a 
catastrophe of global proportions. During Soviet times, Kyrgyzstan had been one of the principal 
mining and processing areas for several heavy metals and uranium ore. Those activities had lasted 
several decades, ending in 1970, and had left behind numerous tailings dumps containing vast 
quantities of radioactive waste. There were some 40 such tailings dumps in Kyrgyzstan, the largest 
and most hazardous of which lay in the southern regions that formed part of the Fergana valley. 
Approximately 6500 hectares of land were radioactively contaminated and the volume of waste was as 
much as 145 million tonnes. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 9 

64. Owing to the absence of monitoring as a result of a lack of financial resources, and the impact 
of natural phenomena such as mud flows, landslides and underground tremors, the tailings dump 
dykes had suffered extensive damage and were in a hazardous condition. In the event of a major 
natural disaster such as an earthquake, the poorly maintained tailings dumps might burst, releasing 
deadly waste into rivers and waterways throughout the Fergana valley, which was the most densely 
populated valley in the world. Moreover, there was a real risk that radiation sources could fall into the 
hands of international terrorists. The problem extended beyond the borders of Kyrgyzstan and posed a 
real environmental threat to neighbouring countries as well. Kyrgyzstan was unable to meet that 
challenge alone. The only way her country could overcome the problem was through cooperation with 
the Agency and its Member States and, as a full member of the Agency, it counted on the AgencyÂs 
expertise, support and assistance. 
65. The Government of Kyrgyzstan was taking its own measures to eliminate the threat of nuclear 
waste. It had established the necessary regulatory framework for the rehabilitation of the tailings 
dumps and mining waste dumps, had collected together the design, technical and operational 
documentation, studied the disposal arrangements, drawn up maps showing the potential 
environmental risk, and carried out regular emergency restoration work. 
66. She thanked the World Bank, the European Union, the Tacis programme, the OSCE, and the 
Governments of the Russian Federation, the United States of America, the Czech Republic, Japan and 
other countries for the financial and technical assistance they had provided. To date, US $12 580 000 
had been spent on the rehabilitation of the tailings dumps, of which $1 910 000 had been provided by 
the Government of Kyrgyzstan. However, a total of $50Â70 million would be was needed to deal with 
the problem. She appealed to the Agency, Member States and other international organizations to lend 
further assistance. 
67. In the light of the heightened concern over global security, Kyrgyzstan was eager to play its part 
in strengthening the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Thus it was actively engaged in 
efforts to create a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia to strengthen peace and stability in the 
region, to establish an effective mechanism for cooperation on regional security, to reduce the risk of 
nuclear war and to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The Central Asian region faced 
complex political, economic, military, environmental and transport-related problems which, combined 
with other threats such as international terrorism and religious extremism, posed a real threat. The 
creation of a regional nuclear-weapon-free zone should also help strengthen bilateral relations between 
countries in the region. 
68. A consultative meeting of the Central Asian countries, the nuclear-weapon States and the 
United Nations had been held in Bishkek in July 1998 to consider that initiative. The key to success 
was the support of the international community. Her country greatly appreciated the efforts of the 
United Nations and the Agency in furthering the initiative which was currently at the implementation 
stage. 
69. Mr. AHMAD (Sudan) commended the AgencyÂs efforts to ensure full implementation of the 
NPT. To support those efforts, Sudan intended to enact legislation to prevent movements of material 
that might be used for non-peaceful purposes, and to sign an additional protocol. His country had also 
ratified the CTBT in June 2004. 
70. Sudan was deeply committed to the goal of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East through the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty that would be binding on all parties 
concerned. IsraelÂs nuclear capability was an ongoing source of concern to all countries in the region 
because Israel was the only entity in the Middle East that possessed nuclear weapons. His country had 
repeatedly warned of the danger of a nuclear disaster in the region. It was high time for the 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 10 

international community to compel Israel to sign and ratify the relevant Agency instruments. Sudan 
also hoped that the international community would continue to work for a just settlement of the 
Middle East question. 

71. He praised the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for reassuring the international 
community about its peaceful nuclear programme and expressed strong support for that countryÂs right 
to obtain assistance from the Agency in implementing that programme. It was a right enshrined in the 
NPT and the Islamic Republic of Iran was a peace-loving nation. 
72. Malaria was a major obstacle to SudanÂs development. He thanked the Agency for its assistance 
in that regard and pledged his countryÂs support for projects aimed at controlling the disease. His 
country also welcomed assistance under the technical cooperation programme to enhance food 
security. 
73. The tsetse fly was one of the main impediments to development in Africa and the AgencyÂs 
efforts to eradicate the pest using the SIT were greatly appreciated. He thanked the Agency for 
sponsoring the bilateral agreement on tsetse fly eradication between Sudan and Ethiopia. Now that a 
lasting peace was within reach in the south of the country, Sudan hoped that the Agency would extend 
its technical support for eradication of that pest to the whole of southern Sudan. 
74. Water scarcity was a major challenge, especially in arid regions of the world. It was therefore 
essential to promote rational management of water resources, especially of groundwater aquifers. The 
Nubian groundwater basin was a strategic water resource and Sudan hoped that the efforts of the 
Agency and the countries of the basin would result in its rational exploitation. 
75. The African countries that were party to AFRA had benefited greatly from human resource 
development projects, the utilization of existing expertise in the region and the establishment of 
centres of excellence in Africa. However, the downward trend in AFRAÂs budget for the coming two 
years would impede the implementation of proposed projects, which would in turn have an adverse 
impact on development projects using nuclear technology. He therefore called on the Agency to take 
further steps to secure the necessary funding for AFRA projects. 
76. SudanÂs development programme continued to be adversely affected by the brain drain. To 
address the problem, the Ministry of Science and Technology had established the Sudanese Academy 
of Sciences which was pursuing ambitious programmes in areas such as food security, health and 
water resources. As the use of nuclear technology in those areas had proved highly successful, Sudan 
hoped for Agency support for the AcademyÂs programmes. 
77. He also called for support for closer cooperation among States party to the Convention on 
Nuclear Safety and for continued harmonization of regulations and legislation in the area of radiation 
protection. 
78. Mr. WOLDE (Ethiopia) said that his country was pursuing an agricultural development-led 
industrialization policy which focused mainly on poverty reduction and sustainable economic 
development for the benefit of the Ethiopian people. His Government therefore attached great 
importance to its cooperation with the Agency on the peaceful uses of nuclear techniques in such areas 
as agriculture, water resources management and human health care. 
79. The biggest Agency technical cooperation project in Ethiopia was aimed at eradicating the 
tsetse fly from one of the countryÂs most fertile agricultural areas. The Southern Rift Valley tsetse 
eradication project was a ten-year programme initiated in 1997 and its long-term objectives were to 
establish and develop a sustainable agricultural production system in areas currently infested by the 
tsetse fly. Its potential contribution to the national strategy of poverty reduction and food selfsufficiency 
was immense. 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 11 

80. The project, which was expected to benefit some ten million people, was designed to address 
tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis in an area roughly 25 000 km2 in size, employing an area-wide 
integrated pest management approach with community participation. Its two principal components 
were the establishment of a centrally operated sterile insect production plant and the actual field 
operations. The AgencyÂs support for the project, which had made it such a success, was not limited to 
nuclear techniques but also included other non-nuclear inputs and had encouraged his Government to 
commit more resources to it. He appealed for continued and enhanced support from the Agency and 
Member States. 
81. One of the priority areas in which Ethiopia collaborated with the Agency was in human health 
care, including radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. His Government thanked the Agency for its 
ongoing technical support for the building of basic infrastructure and manpower capabilities, 
particularly in radiotherapy services. Encouraged by the AgencyÂs assistance, Ethiopia had made an 
extrabudgetary contribution of $150 000 to share the costs of purchasing a new cobalt-60 unit for the 
radiotherapy centre at Addis Ababa University under the technical cooperation project to upgrade the 
centre. 
82. The establishment of a national isotope hydrology laboratory at Addis Ababa University and the 
setting up of the national groundwater database had been the major achievements under the 2003Â 
2004 technical cooperation programme. Those outputs were vital to the planned Ethiopian 
groundwater resources assessment programme, which had been included in the countryÂs 15-year 
water sector development programme. Ethiopia was grateful to the Agency and its technical staff for 
their support in building those capacities. 
83. His country recognized the AgencyÂs outstanding role in safeguarding the world from the threat 
of nuclear proliferation and it endorsed the adoption and implementation of safeguards agreements and 
additional protocols by Member States. 
84. Regional cooperation agreements such as AFRA needed to be encouraged and supported on the 
basis of a thorough assessment of their contribution to promoting the peaceful application of nuclear 
techniques and enhancing collaboration among participating countries. 
85. Finally, Ethiopia was ready to pay its annual budgetary and TCF contributions in full and on 
time, as it had done for the last several years. 
86. Mr. ENKHTAIVAN (Mongolia) said that his country remained fully committed to the NPT and 
the CTBT which constituted the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime and the essential 
foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. As one of the first States to ratify the CTBT, 
Mongolia attached great importance to its early entry into force. It was committed to strengthening the 
international safeguards system and had ratified an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement in 
the preceding year. 
87. Much had been achieved in the application of nuclear science and technology and further 
developments should be aimed at improving the quality of human life. Mongolia sought new 
opportunities for the development of energy sources and was confident that the AgencyÂs professional 
expertise and technical assistance would make a major contribution to addressing the critical energy 
situation in the country. 
88. The AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities in Mongolia continued to help promote social and 
economic development, covering fields such as human resources development and nuclear technology 
support, integrated energy demand and supply, and livestock production and human health. He 
welcomed the fact that the Agency was increasing funding for activities in Mongolia over the 
forthcoming two years. Further expansion of the technical assistance programme into new areas such 

GC(48)/OR.8 
23 September 2004, Page 12 

as environmental impact assessment of uranium mining, transboundary animal diseases, isotope 
hydrology and soil and plant studies would be appreciated. 

89. His country attached particular importance to the Model Projects on upgrading radiation 
protection and waste safety infrastructure. As a result of the activities in that area, a legal framework 
for radiation protection and safety had been established in Mongolia and the independent nuclear 
regulatory authority had been strengthened. Mongolia continued to participate in the RCA, which 
helped promote nuclear technology transfer among countries in the region. 
90. In spite of the countryÂs current economic and financial difficulties, it had made payments of 
$200 000 to the TCF in the preceding two years. It was committed to paying in full its assessed 
contributions to the Regular Budget and to settling its arrears to the TCF. 
91. Lastly, he commended the AgencyÂs work on the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones. 
The AgencyÂs involvement in confirming MongoliaÂs nuclear-weapon-free status was another avenue 
for cooperation. 
The meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.

18. Implementation of the NPT safeguards agreement between

(GC(48)/17, GC(48)/L.2 and Add.1) 

17. The PRESIDENT noted that the item had been included in the agenda pursuant to General 
Conference resolution GC(47)/RES/12. The Director General had reported to the Board periodically 
on the issue during the intervening year and his report, contained in document GC(48)/17, summarized 
developments over that period. 
18. Ms. HALL (Canada), introducing the draft resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.2 and 
Add.1, said that it was based closely on the resolution that had been adopted without a vote at the 47th 
regular session of the General Conference, with updates to reflect developments in the interim. It was 
the product of intensive consultations with the countries most directly involved in the efforts to 
achieve a peaceful resolution of the issue and it enjoyed wide support from diverse regions. It 
underscored the abiding interest of the Agency and its governing bodies in the issue and urged the 
DPRK to reconsider its actions and announcements that ran contrary to non-proliferation obligations, 
to accept comprehensive Agency safeguards, and to dismantle any nuclear weapons programme in a 
prompt, transparent, verifiable and irreversible manner, maintaining the essential verification role of 
the Agency. Moreover, it encouraged the diplomatic efforts under way to find a peaceful solution and 
welcomed in particular the six-party talks which had taken place in Beijing at the initiative of the 
Government of China. It was important to maintain the momentum gained in those talks. All Member

States of the Agency were appreciative of the role that China had played in seeking a peaceful 
settlement to the issue. Her delegation believed that the draft resolution represented the consensus 
view of the General Conference and it hoped that it would be adopted without a vote, thus expressing 
the international communityÂs united resolve to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula. 

19. The PRESIDENT took it that the Conference wished to adopt the draft resolution contained in 
document GC(48)/L.2 and Add.1. 
20. It was so decided. 
21. Mr. TAKASU (Japan) noted that direct dialogue between the Agency and the DPRK remained 
suspended owing to non-cooperation on the part of the latter. The DPRK continued to be in noncompliance 
with its obligations under its safeguards agreement and the Agency had been unable to 
verify the non-diversion of nuclear material under safeguards. He endorsed the Director GeneralÂs 
statement that the situation in the DPRK continued to pose a serious challenge to the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. Early peaceful resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue was essential to preserve 
peace and stability in north-east Asia, including Japan, and to strengthen the international nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. He expressed regret that the DPRK continued to refuse to cooperate with the 
Agency. 
22. During the third round of the six-party talks in June 2004, each party had made specific 
proposals and the six parties had conducted substantive and practical discussions and had reaffirmed 
their commitment to achieving the common goal of a denuclearized Korean Peninsula through 
peaceful negotiations. They had also agreed on the need to take the first steps towards achieving that 
common goal as soon as possible. Differences still remained. For instance, the DPRK did not 
acknowledge the existence of its uranium enrichment programme. Further efforts and a fourth round 
of talks were needed to encourage the DPRK to adopt a more positive stance. 
23. Japan could not accept under any circumstances the development, acquisition, possession, 
testing or transfer of nuclear weapons by the DPRK and he called upon that country to ensure the 
complete dismantlement of all its nuclear programmes under credible international verification. The 
DPRK should observe all international agreements related to nuclear issues, including the NPT, and 
implement completely and immediately its comprehensive safeguards agreement with the Agency. It 
should commit itself to dismantling expeditiously all its nuclear programmes, including its clandestine 
uranium enrichment programme, and should provide complete information on all those programmes. 
The Agency would have a central role to play in the verification process. It was of paramount 
importance that the parties concerned agree promptly on a verification system that included complete 
and fully intrusive inspections and Japan continued to support the Agency in its efforts to persuade the 
DPRK to open all its nuclear-related facilities to Agency inspection and safeguards immediately. 
Furthermore, the complete dismantlement of its nuclear programmes would be beneficial for the 
DPRK itself. 
24. In conclusion, Japan remained ready to make every effort to resolve the issue by diplomatic 
means, primarily by contributing actively to the six-party talks process. 
25. Mr. Chang-beom CHO (Republic of Korea) said that it was cause for grave concern that the 
Agency remained unable to provide any level of assurance to the international community regarding 
the non-diversion of nuclear material in the DPRK. The DPRKÂs nuclear weapons and related 
programmes remained a threat to regional and global security and continued to pose a serious 
challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. The resolution contained in document GC(48)/L.2 
and Add.1 delivered a clear message. To achieve early resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue that 
country would have to make a fundamental strategic decision. It should return to the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime and accept comprehensive Agency safeguards without further delay, and it should 

GC(48)/OR.9 
24 September 2004, Page 4 

cooperate with the Agency in their full and effective implementation. Moreover, it should give up all 
its nuclear weapons and related programmes, including its uranium enrichment programme, in a 
thorough and transparent manner, under international verification, so that the issue did not arise again 
in the future. 

26. The international community was united in its support for a peaceful resolution of the issue 
through dialogue and diplomatic efforts. Steady progress had been made in the course of the three 
rounds of six-party talks. During the most recent round of talks, concrete proposals had been put 
forward and substantive discussions had been held. His Government, together with the other countries 
participating in the talks, was therefore eager that the fourth round of talks be held as soon as possible. 
The resolution of the issue would have a profound effect on relations between the DPRK and the 
international community as a whole and the DPRK should not miss the historic opportunity offered. 
27. Mr. ZHANG Huazhu (China) said that his delegation had had reservations about adopting such 
a resolution in the current circumstances and had made clear its concerns regarding the need to take 
into account the legitimate security concerns of the DPRK when seeking a peaceful resolution to the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It was of paramount importance that a common 
understanding be reached through the six-party talks. China had always advocated the 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and that the DPRK nuclear issue should be resolved through 
dialogue and consultations. Continuing the six-party talks process and maintaining dialogue with a 
view to finding a peaceful solution was in the interests of all parties concerned and was the correct 
way to proceed. All parties, including the international community and the Member States of the 
Agency, should remain cool-headed. China remained ready to work with the international community 
with a view to resolving the issue and achieving peace, stability and prosperity in the region. 
The meeting rose at 10.45 a.m.
