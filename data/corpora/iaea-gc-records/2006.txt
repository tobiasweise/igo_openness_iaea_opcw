Report 
on 
contributions 
pledged 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2007 
(GC(50)/23/Rev.3) 


1. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
document 
GC(50)/23/Rev.3 
contained 
details 
of 
pledges 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2007 
which 
Governments 
had 
made 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
by 
5.30 
p.m. 
on 
21 
September 
2006. 
By 
that 
time, 
Member 
States 
had 
pledged 
a 
total 
of 
US 
$6 
597 
114, 
or 
8.25% 
of 
the 
target 
for 
2007. 
That 
was 
24% 
lower 
than 
the 
percentage 
of 
pledges 
received 
by 
the 
same 
time 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Since 
the 
document 
had 
been 
sent 
for 
printing, 
further 
Member 
States 
had 
communicated 
pledges 
to 
the 
Director 
General: 
China 
had 
pledged 
$1 
584 
800, 
Cuba 
had 
pledged 
$32 
800 
and 
Uganda 
had 
pledged 
$4 
800. 
That 
brought 
the 
total 
amount 
pledged 
to 
$8 
219 
514, 
or 
10.27% 
of 
the 
target. 
2. 
He 
urged 
all 
delegations 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
make 
their 
2007 
pledges 
and 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions 
in 
full 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity, 
in 
order 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
might 
submit 
a 
proposed 
2007 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
the 
Technical 
Assistance 
and 
Cooperation 
Committee 
in 
November 
based 
on 
the 
level 
of 
pledges 
received 
and 
thereafter 
implement 
the 
approved 
programme 
without 
hindrance 
or 
uncertainty. 
20. 
Application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
(GC(50)/12, 
L.1 
and 
Add.1) 


3. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
item 
20 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
resolution 
GC(49)/RES/15 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Pursuant 
to 
operative 
paragraph 
9 
of 
that 
resolution, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
submitted 
the 
report 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/12. 
The 
matter 
had 
been 
considered 
by 
the 
Board 
the 
preceding 
week 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
that 
report. 
In 
addition, 
Egypt 
had 
submitted 
a 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.1 
and 
Add.1. 
4. 
Mr. 
RAMZY 
(Egypt), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
resolution 
was 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities 
under 
Article 
III 
of 
the 
NPT. 
The 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
attributed 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
accession 
of 
all 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
placement 
of 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
region 
under 
comprehensive 
safeguards. 
When 
the 
Treaty 
had 
been 
extended 
indefinitely 
in 
1995, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
adopted 
a 
resolution 
on 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
which 
it 
had 
expressed 
concern 
at 
the 
continued 
existence 
of 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
region, 
which 
undermined 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime 
as 
a 
whole. 
5. 
Egypt 
had 
sponsored 
a 
similar 
draft 
resolution 
on 
many 
previous 
occasions 
and 
no 
significant 
amendment 
had 
been 
made 
to 
it 
for 
the 
past 
14 
years. 
However, 
at 
the 
current 
session, 
following 
wide-
ranging 
consultations, 
Egypt 
had 
decided 
to 
introduce 
a 
draft 
resolution 
containing 
a 
minimum 
number 
of 
amendments 
that 
reflected 
current 
circumstances, 
without 
affecting 
the 
core 
content, 
on 

GC(50)/OR.10 
22 
September 
2006, 
Page 
2 


which 
there 
was 
a 
consensus 
in 
the 
international 
community. 
Egypt 
regarded 
the 
annual 
custom 
whereby 
the 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
adopted 
the 
resolution 
by 
consensus 
as 
a 
reaffirmation 
of 
the 
commitment 
of 
States, 
especially 
those 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
to 
the 
principle 
of 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
region. 
All 
States 
therefore 
had 
a 
duty 
to 
take 
concerted 
action 
to 
break 
the 
deadlock 
that 
was 
preventing 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
resolution 
and 
to 
secure 
respect 
by 
all 
States, 
without 
discrimination, 
for 
the 
non-proliferation 
principles 
it 
contained, 
thereby 
eliminating 
the 
risk 
of 
a 
nuclear 
arms 
race 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
preserving 
international 
peace 
and 
stability. 


6. 
At 
the 
NAM 
summit 
which 
had 
concluded 
its 
proceedings 
the 
preceding 
week 
in 
Havana, 
Cuba, 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
had 
reiterated 
their 
condemnation 
of 
Israeli 
military 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
their 
firm 
opposition 
to 
the 
challenge 
posed 
by 
Israel 
to 
the 
international 
community 
and 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
regime. 
They 
had 
expressed 
their 
determination 
to 
take 
serious 
steps 
to 
avert 
the 
Israeli 
nuclear 
threat 
in 
all 
relevant 
fora, 
in 
particular 
at 
the 
current 
session 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
General 
Conference. 
He 
commended 
NAMÂs 
initiative 
in 
reaffirming 
the 
basic 
principles 
involved 
and 
trusted 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
legitimate 
efforts 
to 
oppose 
the 
double 
standards 
that 
were 
threatening 
international 
stability 
and 
security, 
particularly 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
a 
new 
NPT 
review 
period. 
7. 
The 
way 
in 
which 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Member 
States 
addressed 
agenda 
items 
20 
and 
21 
was 
a 
real 
test 
of 
the 
sincerity 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
support 
for 
the 
NPT, 
which 
constituted 
the 
basic 
frame 
of 
reference 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
It 
also 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
assess 
the 
sincerity 
and 
neutrality 
of 
those 
who 
called 
for 
action 
to 
maintain 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
advocated 
full 
compliance 
with 
its 
provisions, 
especially 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Adoption 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
by 
consensus 
would 
reaffirm 
the 
consensus 
in 
the 
international 
community 
on 
the 
need 
to 
avert 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Any 
attempt 
to 
undermine 
that 
consensus 
would 
cast 
doubt 
on 
StatesÂ 
commitment 
to 
averting 
the 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
and 
to 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime. 
8. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
NAM 
on 
both 
agenda 
items 
20 
and 
21, 
said 
that 
during 
NAMÂs 
14th 
summit 
held 
in 
Havana, 
Cuba, 
on 
15Â16 
September 
2006, 
the 
Heads 
of 
State 
or 
Government 
had 
adopted 
a 
final 
document 
that 
included 
NAMÂs 
principled 
position 
on 
the 
issues 
under 
discussion. 
She 
quoted 
paragraph 
89 
of 
that 
document 
which 
read: 
ÂThe 
Heads 
of 
State 
or 
Government 
reiterated 
their 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
To 
this 
end, 
they 
reaffirmed 
the 
need 
for 
the 
speedy 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
paragraph 
14 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
687 
(1991) 
and 
the 
relevant 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
They 
called 
upon 
all 
parties 
concerned 
to 
take 
urgent 
and 
practical 
steps 
towards 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
proposal 
initiated 
by 
Iran 
in 
1974 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone 
and, 
pending 
its 
establishment, 
they 
demanded 
on 
Israel, 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
has 
not 
joined 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Non-Proliferation 
of 
Nuclear 
Weapons 
(NPT) 
nor 
declared 
its 
intention 
to 
do 
so, 
to 
renounce 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay, 
to 
place 
promptly 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
IAEA 
full-scope 
safeguards 
according 
to 
Security 
Council 
Resolution 
487 
(1981), 
and 
to 
conduct 
its 
nuclear 
related 
activities 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
They 
expressed 
great 
concern 
over 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
capability 
by 
Israel, 
which 
poses 
a 
serious 
and 
continuing 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
neighbouring 
and 
other 
States, 
and 
condemned 
Israel 
for 
continuing 
to 
develop 
and 
stockpile 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
They 
were 
of 
the 
view 
that 
stability 
cannot 
be 
achieved 
in 
a 
region 
where 
massive 
imbalances 
in 
military 
capabilities 
are 
maintained 
particularly 
through 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
allow 
one 
party 
to 
threaten 
its 
neighbours, 
and 
the 
region. 
They 
further 



GC(50)/OR.10

welcomed 
the 
initiative 
by 
H.E. 
Mr. 
Mohammed 
Hosni 
Mubarak, 
President 
of 
the 
Arab 
Republic 
of 
Egypt, 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
from 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
in 
this 
context, 
they 
took 
into 
consideration 
the 
draft 
resolution 
tabled 
by 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic, 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Arab 
Group, 
before 
the 
Security 
Council 
on 
29 
December 
2003 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
They 
stressed 
that 
necessary 
steps 
should 
be 
taken 
in 
different 
international 
fora 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
this 
zone. 
They 
also 
called 
for 
the 
total 
and 
complete 
prohibition 
of 
the 
transfer 
of 
all 
nuclear-related 
equipment, 
information, 
material 
and 
facilities, 
resources 
or 
devices 
and 
the 
extension 
of 
assistance 
in 
the 
nuclear 
related 
scientific 
or 
technological 
fields 
to 
Israel. 
In 
this 
regard, 
they 
expressed 
their 
serious 
concern 
over 
the 
continuing 
development 
whereby 
Israeli 
scientists 
are 
provided 
access 
to 
the 
nuclear 
facilities 
of 
one 
NWS. 
This 
development 
will 
have 
potentially 
serious 
negative 
implications 
on 
security 
in 
the 
region 
as 
well 
as 
the 
reliability 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime.Â 


9. 
Mr. 
KODAH 
(Jordan) 
said 
that 
the 
Jordanian 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
that 
region. 
It 
was 
essential 
for 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
and 
implement 
the 
NPT, 
to 
sign 
and 
implement 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
under 
international 
safeguards. 
10. 
Mr. 
BAHRAN 
(Yemen) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
a 
co-sponsor 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.1 
and 
Add.1, 
which 
it 
viewed 
as 
the 
minimum 
required 
action 
on 
the 
issue. 
Yemen 
hoped 
that 
one 
day 
the 
Middle 
East 
would 
become 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
in 
particular 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
had 
not 
adhered 
to 
the 
NPT. 
In 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
Agency, 
the 
NPT 
and 
peace 
and 
security, 
the 
principles 
of 
equality 
and 
justice 
under 
international 
law 
had 
to 
be 
upheld. 
11. 
Mr. 
MILAD 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
expressed 
deep 
concern 
at 
the 
presence 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
series 
of 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
since 
1974, 
and 
to 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
which 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
consider 
taking 
practical 
steps 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
called 
on 
them 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
to 
refrain 
from 
producing 
or 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons 
or 
nuclear 
explosive 
devices 
in 
whatever 
form 
and 
from 
allowing 
any 
other 
party 
to 
locate 
nuclear 
weapons 
on 
their 
territory, 
and 
to 
place 
their 
nuclear 
activities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
12. 
The 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
had 
taken 
the 
initiative 
on 
19 
December 
2003 
of 
abandoning 
all 
programmes, 
equipment 
and 
materials 
that 
might 
lead 
to 
the 
production 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
weapons. 
Libya 
was 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
also 
a 
party 
to 
most 
international 
and 
regional 
disarmament 
treaties, 
including 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty, 
and 
it 
had 
consistently 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Unfortunately, 
that 
region 
was 
still 
dangerously 
insecure 
on 
account 
of 
IsraelÂs 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
which 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
many 
countries 
extending 
from 
the 
Indian 
subcontinent 
to 
North 
Africa 
and 
the 
Mediterranean 
region. 
13. 
Security 
Council 
Presidential 
Statement 
S/PRST/2004/10 
of 
22 
April 
2004 
concerning 
LibyaÂs 
decision 
to 
abandon 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
programmes 
recognized 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
a 
step 
towards 
the 
realization 
of 
a 
Middle 
East 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
However, 
other 
States 
in 
the 
region 
had 
been 
able 
to 
develop 
their 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
possessed 
large 
arsenals 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
As 
Israel 
was 
the 
sole 
country 
in 
the 

GC(50)/OR.10 
22

2006,

Middle 
East 
that 
possessed 
such 
weapons, 
the 
security 
situation 
in 
the 
region 
was 
dangerously 
unbalanced. 


14. 
More 
than 
ever 
before, 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT, 
to 
reaffirm 
that 
TreatyÂs 
status 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
and 
to 
emphasize 
the 
linkage 
between 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
15. 
Ms. 
FEROUKHI 
(Algeria), 
speaking 
on 
items 
20 
and 
21 
of 
the 
agenda, 
said 
that 
her 
country 
deplored 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
verification 
system 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
However, 
that 
impasse, 
far 
from 
discouraging 
Algeria, 
strengthened 
its 
conviction 
that 
the 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
upon 
which 
AlgeriaÂs 
foreign 
policy 
was 
based 
was 
the 
best 
guarantee 
of 
peace 
and 
security. 
She 
commended 
those 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
that 
were 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
made 
the 
responsible 
decision 
not 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
weapons 
as 
a 
contribution 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
international 
resolutions 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
its 
universal 
character, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
In 
refusing 
to 
give 
up 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
adhere 
to 
the 
NPT, 
Israel 
had 
established 
itself 
as 
a 
de 
facto 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
which 
created 
a 
serious 
imbalance 
among 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region. 
Such 
an 
imbalance 
nurtured 
permanent 
suspicion 
and 
tensions, 
which 
aggravated 
an 
already 
precarious 
security 
situation. 
16. 
Algeria 
believed 
that 
the 
adherence 
of 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
the 
NPT, 
without 
exception, 
was 
a 
confidence-building 
measure 
that 
would 
foster 
a 
common 
perception 
of 
the 
threats 
to 
regional 
security 
capable 
of 
opening 
up 
the 
path 
to 
cooperation 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
That 
had 
been 
the 
objective 
of 
many 
international 
resolutions 
urging 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
submit 
all 
their 
nuclear 
activities 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system 
and 
to 
give 
serious 
consideration 
to 
the 
practical 
measures 
required 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
final 
document 
of 
the 
NAM 
summit 
in 
Havana 
supported 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
in 
particular 
the 
attempts 
by 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
eliminate 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities 
to 
regional 
peace 
and 
security. 
She 
noted 
the 
importance 
of 
implementing 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
and 
General 
Assembly, 
and 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
General 
Conference, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
those 
bodiesÂ 
collective 
credibility, 
and 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
Director 
General 
in 
fulfilling 
the 
mandate 
he 
had 
received 
of 
applying 
safeguards 
and 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-
weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
17. 
Mr. 
MÃRQUEZ 
MARÃN 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela), 
speaking 
on 
items 
20 
and 
21 
of 
the 
agenda, 
said 
his 
country 
gave 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
draft 
resolutions 
before 
the 
Conference. 
Both 
drafts 
reflected 
the 
long-standing 
aspiration 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
peace 
lovers 
that 
the 
Middle 
East 
be 
declared 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, 
which 
clearly 
arose 
from 
the 
serious 
concern 
that 
the 
conflicts 
in 
the 
region 
might 
lead 
to 
a 
confrontation 
involving 
nuclear 
weapons. 
That 
aspiration 
would 
begin 
to 
be 
feasible 
when 
concrete 
steps 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
achieve 
total 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
Israel 
had 
signed 
and 
adhered 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
submitted 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
to 
Agency 
safeguards. 
The 
need 
for 
such 
action 
was 
even 
more 
pressing 
in 
light 
of 
IsraelÂs 
recent 
armed 
intervention 
in 
Lebanon, 
where 
the 
toll 
of 
death 
and 
destruction 
had 
included 
thousands 
of 
civilian 
victims, 
among 
them 
children, 
and 
had 
left 
in 
ruins 
the 
countryÂs 
infrastructure, 
which 
the 
Lebanese 
people 
had 
gone 
to 
great 
effort 
to 
rebuild 
after 
the 
war 
with 
Israel 
in 
the 
preceding 
century. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
that 
had 
not 
acknowledged 
its 
status 
as 
a 
nuclear 
power, 
even 
though 
experts 
estimated 
that 
it 
had 
a 
considerable 
arsenal 
with 
enough 
capability 
to 
spark 
a 
global 
conflict. 
It 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
refused 
to 
allow 
the 
international 
community 
to 
monitor 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
to 
join 
the 
NPT. 
18. 
At 
least 
13 
resolutions 
had 
been 
adopted 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
General 
Conference 
since 
1987 
urging 
Israel 
to 
sign 
the 
NPT. 
Unfortunately 
they 
had 
not 

GC(50)/OR.10 
22 
September 
2006, 
Page 
5 


yet 
produced 
any 
results. 
Venezuela 
hoped 
that 
the 
draft 
resolutions 
contained 
in 
documents 
GC(50)/L.1 
and 
GC(50)/L.2 
would 
be 
approved 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
NPT. 
The 
General 
Conference 
had 
already 
approved 
the 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
at 
its 
ninth 
plenary 
meeting. 
Venezuela 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
on 
that 
resolution 
despite 
certain 
reservations. 
The 
logic 
that 
some 
countries 
had 
applied 
in 
approving 
that 
resolution 
was 
being 
turned 
upside 
down 
in 
the 
case 
currently 
under 
discussion. 
The 
double 
standards 
which 
were 
being 
applied 
revealed 
a 
lack 
of 
equality 
and 
balance 
in 
the 
handling 
of 
important 
multilateral 
affairs 
which 
undermined 
the 
moral 
authority 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
it 
celebrated 
50 
years 
of 
service 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
matter 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
discussed 
within 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Board 
should 
keep 
it 
on 
its 
agenda, 
giving 
it 
the 
same 
importance 
as 
had 
been 
given 
to 
other 
related 
topics. 


19. 
Mr. 
TANG 
Guoqiang 
(China) 
said 
that 
his 
Government 
had 
always 
supported 
the 
holding 
of 
consultations 
by 
the 
countries 
concerned 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
also 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
universality 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
The 
proposal 
before 
the 
Conference 
should 
contribute 
to 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
promote 
stability 
and 
security 
in 
the 
region. 
China 
hoped 
that 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
would 
make 
joint 
efforts 
to 
reach 
agreement. 
20. 
Mr. 
MICHAELI 
(Israel) 
requested 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
be 
put 
to 
a 
vote. 
21. 
Mr. 
RAMZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
he 
had 
hoped 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
as 
in 
previous 
years. 
However, 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
insistence 
by 
one 
country 
that 
the 
tradition 
of 
consensus 
be 
broken, 
he 
requested 
that 
the 
vote 
be 
taken 
by 
roll-call. 
22. 
Lebanon, 
having 
been 
drawn 
by 
lot 
by 
the 
President, 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
vote 
first. 
23. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
was 
as

25. 
Mr. 
ELOUMNI 
(Morocco), 
speaking 
on 
a 
point 
of 
order, 
requested 
clarification 
regarding 
the 
counting 
of 
the 
votes 
since 
the 
representative 
of 
Israel 
had 
not 
replied 
in 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
72 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
26. 
Mr. 
RAUTENBACH 
(Director, 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs) 
said 
that 
the 
word 
ÂagainstÂ 
used 
by 
the 
representative 
of 
Israel 
was 
clearly 
equivalent 
to 
ÂnoÂ. 
There 
was 
therefore 
no 
reason 
not 
to 
accept 
IsraelÂs 
vote. 
27. 
Mr. 
SHANNON 
(Australia), 
speaking 
in 
explanation 
of 
his 
vote, 
said 
that 
Australia 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
placing 
of 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
in 
the 
region 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
It 
also 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
effectively 
verifiable 
zone 
free 
of 
nuclear 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
28. 
Australia 
had 
abstained 
in 
the 
vote 
because 
the 
resolution 
did 
not 
form 
part 
of 
the 
consensus 
package 
adopted 
since 
1992. 
In 
his 
countryÂs 
view, 
the 
consensus 
package 
approach 
had 
provided 
a 
means 
of 
pursuing 
the 
application 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
while 
limiting 
the 
intrusion 
of 
other 
Middle 
East 
issues 
more 
appropriately 
considered 
in 
other 
United 
Nations 
fora. 
29. 
Mr. 
SCHULTE 
(United 
States 
of 
America) 
said, 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
commemorating 
the 
first 
fifty 
years 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
delegation 
had 
focused 
on 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
how 
it 
could 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
and 
prosperity 
of 
all 
nations, 
and 
it 
had 
consciously 
avoided 
introducing 
other 
issues 
that, 
while 
they 
were 
of 
great 
importance, 
could 
divert 
the 
focus 
from 
the 
desire 
of 
almost 
every 
delegation 
for 
a 
strong, 
positive 
outcome 
to 
the 
Conference. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
events 
of 
the 
evening 
would 
not 
detract 
attention 
from 
that 
special 
occasion 
and 
the 
important 
work 
accomplished. 
The 
United 
States 
would 
continue 
to 
give 
strong 
support 
to 
those 
seeking 
to 
help 
bring 
peace 
and 
long-term 
security 
to 
the 
Middle 
East. 
30. 
Mr. 
MICHAELI 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
wished 
to 
continue 
the 
long 
tradition 
of 
consensus 
on 
the 
agenda 
item 
in 
question. 
However, 
additional 
issues 
had 
been 
inserted 
in 
the 
text 
without 
coordination 
with 
Israel, 
some 
of 
which 
had 
worsened 
the 
existing 
imbalance 
in 
the 
resolution. 
Accordingly, 
his 
country 
had 
been 
left 
with 
no 
choice 
but 
to 
distance 
itself 
from 
it. 
Nevertheless, 
its 
vote 
should 
not 
confuse 
delegations 
with 
regard 
to 
IsraelÂs 
policy 
or 
the 
regional 
realities. 
31. 
Many 
alarming 
proliferation 
developments 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
the 
preceding 
decade, 
although 
some 
had 
become 
apparent 
to 
the 
international 
community 
only 
recently. 
None 
of 
those 
developments 
involved 
Israel, 
although 
many 
directly 
challenged 
its 
core 
security 
interests. 
In 
the 
preceding 
year, 
for 
example, 
an 
NPT 
State 
in 
the 
region 
that 
was 
heavily 
suspected 
of 
having 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes 
and 
had 
been 
found 
by 
the 
Board 
to 
be 
in 
non-compliance 
with 
its 
nuclear 
obligations 
had 
repeatedly 
threatened 
to 
eliminate 
Israel. 
Israel 
had 
neither 
threatened 
any 
of 
its 
neighbours 
nor 
had 
it 
acted 
in 
defiance 
of 
any 
of 
its 
international 
commitments. 
32. 
There 
was 
only 
one 
Middle 
East 
and 
there 
was 
no 
need 
for 
two 
agenda 
items 
on 
it. 
IsraelÂs 
policy 
of 
not 
joining 
a 
consensus 
on 
the 
resolution 
on 
application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
if 
any 
action 
were 
taken 
on 
the 
agenda 
item 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
was 
well 
known. 
Those 
who 
had 
pushed 
for 
a 
vote 
on 
the 
latter 
item 
knew 
the 
implications 
of 
their 
action. 
For 
the 
preceding 
14 
years, 
Israel 
had 
supported 
a 
consensus 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
the 
belief 
that 
a 
Middle 
East 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
ballistic 
missiles 
could 
eventually 
serve 
as 
an 
important 
complement 
to 
the 
overall 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
region, 
strengthened 
by 
arms 
control. 
It 
had 
done 
so 
despite 
its 
fundamental 
reservations 
about 
the 
language 
and 
relevance 
of 
the 
text, 
and 
had 
formally 
distanced 
itself 
from 
its 
modalities. 
However, 
steps 
taken 
by 
some 
States 
to 
destroy 
that 
basic 
consensus 
had 
prevented 
continuation 
of 
that 
tradition.

33. 
The 
fundamental 
goal 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
as 
in 
other 
regions, 
was 
to 
achieve 
regional 
peace, 
security 
and 
stability, 
not 
arms 
control 
per 
se. 
The 
basic 
premises 
underlying 
lasting 
regional 
security 
and 
arms 
control 
processes 
was 
that 
security 
margins 
should 
be 
enhanced 
and 
the 
threat 
perception 
of 
all 
participating 
States 
adequately 
addressed. 
No 
process 
compromising 
national 
security 
was 
viable. 
In 
addition, 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
States 
in 
such 
a 
process 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
meaningful 
progress, 
as 
non-participants 
continued 
to 
pose 
an 
undiminished 
threat. 
A 
practical 
step-by-step 
approach 
to 
the 
issue 
was 
required 
given 
the 
political 
realities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
process 
should 
begin 
with 
confidence-and 
security-building 
measures, 
carefully 
selected 
so 
as 
not 
to 
reduce 
the 
security 
margins 
of 
any 
State. 
Similar 
processes 
in 
other 
regions 
had 
begun 
with 
mutual 
recognition 
and 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations. 
Refusal 
to 
take 
small 
steps 
was 
hardly 
conducive 
to 
achieving 
the 
goal 
of 
freeing 
the 
region 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
ballistic 
missiles. 
34. 
In 
summary, 
IsraelÂs 
policy 
had 
not 
changed. 
However, 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
had 
lost 
value 
and 
relevance. 
Israel 
held 
to 
the 
vision 
of 
transforming 
the 
Middle 
East 
into 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
ballistic 
missiles, 
but 
it 
had 
no 
illusions. 
However, 
it 
would 
never 
give 
up 
hope 
for 
a 
better 
future 
of 
reconciliation, 
security 
and 
peace 
in 
the 
region.

The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
item 
21 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
a 
request 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
that 
were 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
An 
explanatory 
memorandum 
was 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/17. 
The 
Conference 
also 
had 
before 
it 
documents 
GC(50)/18 
and 
22. 
Document 
GC(50)/L.2 
and 
Add.1, 
2, 
3 
and 
4 
contained 
a 
draft 
resolution 
submitted 
by 
a 
group 
of 
countries. 
36. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada), 
speaking 
on 
a 
point 
of 
order, 
said 
that 
her 
delegation 
wished 
to 
move 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
in 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
59 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
thereby 
taking 
no 
action 
on 
the 
item. 
While 
Canada 
regretted 
having 
to 
invoke 
that 
rule, 
it 
was 
necessary 
in 
view 
of 
the 
situation. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.2 
had 
proven 
very 
divisive 
and 
had 
led 
to 
an 
unfortunate 
situation 
where 
a 
long-standing 
consensual 
approach 
had 
collapsed 
at 
the 
time 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary. 
She 
urged 
all 
delegations 
to 
return 
to 
a 
consensual 
approach 
in 
the 
future. 
37. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
delegate 
of 
Canada 
had 
moved 
within 
the 
terms 
of 
Rule 
59 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
that 
the 
Conference 
take 
no 
action 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.2 
and 
Add. 
1, 
2, 
3 
and 
4. 
If 
the 
motion 
were 
carried, 
no 
action 
would 
be 
taken 
by 
the 
Conference 
during 
the 
current 
session 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
draft 
resolution 
in 
question. 
38. 
Under 
Rule 
59, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
proposer 
of 
the 
motion 
who 
had 
already 
spoken, 
two 
delegates 
could 
speak 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
motion 
and 
two 
could 
speak 
against 
it, 
after 
which 
it 
should 
immediately 
be 
put 
to 
the 
vote. 
39. 
Ms. 
KAUPPI 
(Finland), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
motion 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
delegate 
of 
Canada 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
on 
the 
item. 
The 
European 
Union 
had 
supported 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
However, 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.2 
would 
not 
be 
helpful 
in 
achieving 
the 
stated 
objectives. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
issue 
had 
been 
politicized 
at 
the 
fiftieth 

GC(50)/OR.10

session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
that 
the 
parties 
concerned 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus, 
despite 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
President 
and 
other 
delegations. 


40. 
Mr. 
SHANNON 
(Australia) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
supported 
the 
motion 
because 
the 
long-
standing 
consensus 
package 
approach 
was 
the 
most 
effective 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
such 
complex 
and 
difficult 
issues. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
support 
the 
motion 
put 
forward 
by 
Canada. 
41. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
expressed 
astonishment 
at 
the 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate, 
particularly 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
situation 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
The 
blood 
of 
innocent 
women 
and 
children 
shed 
during 
the 
recent 
Israeli 
attack 
on 
Lebanon 
had 
not 
yet 
dried 
and 
many 
members 
of 
parliament 
elected 
by 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
remained 
in 
Israeli 
prisons. 
The 
requests 
made 
in 
the 
draft 
resolution 
were 
consistent 
with 
demands 
made 
in 
international 
instruments 
and 
the 
matter 
was 
of 
great 
significance 
for 
peace 
and 
security 
not 
just 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
but 
in 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
The 
application 
of 
double 
standards 
was 
plain 
to 
see. 
When 
the 
matter 
related 
to 
a 
country 
whose 
responsible 
authorities 
had 
said 
that 
they 
would 
not 
be 
using 
their 
peaceful 
nuclear 
installations 
for 
any 
military 
purpose 
there 
was 
an 
outcry, 
though 
another 
State 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
actually 
producing 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
understand 
the 
deep 
concern 
and 
anxiety 
that 
existed 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
he 
called 
upon 
the 
Conference 
to 
reject 
the 
motion. 
42. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
that 
her 
country 
opposed 
the 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
which 
sought 
to 
prevent 
Member 
States 
from 
expressing 
their 
opinions 
in 
an 
open 
and 
democratic 
manner 
on 
a 
sensitive 
matter. 
It 
was 
surprising 
that 
a 
group 
of 
States 
that 
were 
such 
strong 
proponents 
of 
democracy 
were 
attempting 
to 
prevent 
countries 
from 
exercising 
their 
right 
to 
vote. 
The 
recent 
events 
in 
the 
region 
justified 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
She 
endorsed 
the 
comments 
made 
earlier 
by 
Venezuela 
regarding 
political 
double 
standards, 
particularly 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Conference 
that 
morning 
of 
a 
draft 
resolution 
on 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Democratic 
PeoplesÂ 
Republic 
of 
Korea. 
On 
behalf 
of 
those 
who 
had 
lost 
their 
lives 
in 
the 
recent 
events 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
peace 
in 
the 
region, 
she 
called 
upon 
the 
Conference 
to 
reject 
the 
motion. 
43. 
At 
the 
request 
of 
Mr. 
Elamin 
(Sudan), 
a 
roll-call 
vote 
was 
taken. 
44. 
Spain, 
having 
been 
drawn 
by 
lot 
by 
the 
President, 
was 
called 
upon 
to 
vote 
first. 
45. 
The 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
was 
as 
follows: 
In

46. 
There 
were 
45 
votes 
in 
favour 
and 
29 
against, 
with 
19 
abstentions.4 
The 
motion 
was 
carried. 
47. 
Mr. 
CURIA 
(Argentina), 
noting 
that 
his 
country 
had 
a 
strong 
interest 
in 
the 
matter 
in 
question, 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Assembly 
was 
the 
appropriate 
forum 
to 
discuss 
such 
issues 
rather 
than 
a 
technical 
organization 
like 
the 
Agency. 
48. 
Mr. 
BERDENNIKOV 
(Russian 
Federation) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
would 
have 
supported 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
it 
been 
put 
to 
a 
vote, 
as 
it 
supported 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
non-proliferation. 
However, 
the 
appropriate 
and 
desirable 
way 
to 
address 
differences 
was 
through 
negotiation 
and 
consensus. 
Therefore, 
his 
delegation 
had 
understood 
the 
desire 
to 
avoid 
rushing 
to 
adopt 
a 
decision 
by 
a 
vote 
and 
had 
abstained 
on 
the 
motion. 
49. 
Mr. 
TANG 
Guoqiang 
(China) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
always 
supported 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
and 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
It 
also 
supported 
endeavours 
to 
enhance 
the 
universality 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Thus, 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.2 
was 
acceptable 
to 
China. 
50. 
Full 
and 
comprehensive 
discussions 
among 
the 
relevant 
parties 
were 
needed 
to 
achieve 
an 
appropriate 
solution, 
and 
to 
preserve 
the 
unity 
of 
Member 
States 
and 
step 
up 
efforts 
to 
preserve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
resolution. 
More 
time 
should 
have 
been 
allotted 
to 
consultations. 
51. 
China 
continued 
to 
promote 
such 
discussions 
and 
regretted 
that 
a 
hasty 
non-action 
approach 
had 
been 
chosen 
over 
patient 
dialogue. 
As 
China 
was 
not 
in 
favour 
of 
such 
an 
approach, 
and 
since 
his 
delegation 
it 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
seek 
instructions 
from 
its 
capital 
owing 
to 
the 
time 
difference, 
it 
had 
abstained 
in 
the 
vote. 
52. 
Mr. 
RAMZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
a 
series 
of 
resolutions 
adopted 
over 
the 
years 
by 
the 
Security 
Council, 
the 
General 
Assembly 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
General 
Conference 
had 
all 
advocated 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
had 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
abandon 
the 
nuclear 
option, 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT, 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
cooperate 
with 
its 
neighbours 
in 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
There 
was 
therefore 
no 
excuse 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
or 
deterrent 
policies, 
the 
accumulation 
of 
a 
nuclear 
arsenal 
or 
refusing 
international 
monitoring 
of 
nuclear 
activities. 
53. 
The 
goals 
of 
maintaining 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
supporting 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
were 
inextricably 
intertwined. 
Achievement 
of 
those 
goals 
called 
for 
the 
application 
of 
non-proliferation 
principles 
to 
all 
parties 
equally 
and 
without 
exception. 
Egypt 
therefore 
urged 
Israel 
to 
begin 
cooperating 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ending 
its 
questionable 
nuclear 
activities, 
acceding 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
ensure 
that 
TreatyÂs 
universal 
ratification 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
placing 
all 
its 
nuclear 
activities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
so 
that 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
could 
be 
established. 
54. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
shoulder 
its 
responsibilities 
in 
that 
regard. 
Its 
approach 
to 
the 
item 
under 
consideration 
and 
to 
the 
related 
draft 
resolution 
was 
based 
on 
double 
standards 
and 
would 
lead 
to 
an 
escalation 
of 
the 
current 
crisis 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
increasing 
the 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
and 
undermining 
the 
credibility 
of 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
its 
implementation. 
Instead, 
the 
international 
community 
should 
adopt 
the 
resolution, 
demonstrating 
that 
it 
sincerely 
wished 
to 
defend 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
without 
discrimination 
and 
hence 
work 
for 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT, 
especially 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
so 
that 
the 
risks

Subsequently, 
Ecuador 
indicated 
that 
it 
had 
intended 
to

could 
be 
averted 
and 
the 
way 
paved 
for 
a 
successful 
review 
of 
the 
NPT 
to 
make 
up 
for 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 


55. 
Unfortunately, 
Israel 
had 
not 
appreciated 
the 
concessions 
made 
by 
the 
Arab 
States 
in 
previous 
years 
when 
they 
had 
refrained 
from 
putting 
the 
draft 
resolution 
to 
the 
vote. 
It 
had 
remained 
silent 
and 
taken 
no 
practical 
steps, 
thereby 
defying 
the 
international 
community 
and 
flouting 
the 
key 
principles 
on 
which 
international 
security 
and 
stability 
were 
built. 
It 
was 
therefore 
necessary 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
take 
a 
firm 
stand 
again 
and 
to 
call 
on 
Israel 
to 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
peace 
in 
the 
region, 
a 
move 
that 
could 
not 
be 
reconciled 
with 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
or 
the 
policies 
that 
country 
was 
currently 
pursuing. 
56. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
was 
very 
conscious 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
agenda 
item 
under 
consideration, 
which 
had 
evolved 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
broad 
consensus 
over 
several 
years. 
His 
country 
would 
have 
supported 
any 
effort 
to 
review 
the 
consensus 
without 
sacrificing 
it 
and 
regretted 
that 
efforts 
in 
that 
direction 
had 
not 
succeeded. 
As 
India 
was 
unable 
to 
associate 
itself 
with 
any 
action, 
whether 
procedural 
or 
substantive, 
which 
involved 
sacrificing 
the 
consensual 
approach, 
it 
had 
disassociated 
itself 
from 
the 
motion 
brought 
before 
the 
General 
Conference 
by 
abstaining 
in 
the 
vote. 
57. 
Mr. 
ELOUMNI 
(Morocco) 
said 
that 
the 
issue 
under 
consideration 
was 
of 
crucial 
importance 
for 
all 
Member 
States 
and 
related 
to 
ensuring 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fundamental 
principles. 
For 
many 
years, 
the 
subject 
had 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
without 
the 
expected 
progress 
being 
achieved. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
exemplary 
consensual 
elements. 
It 
invited 
Israel 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
delegations 
which 
had 
submitted 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
shown 
great 
restraint. 
For 
a 
long 
time, 
they 
had 
given 
precedence 
to 
the 
need 
for 
dialogue 
and 
agreement 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
harmful 
confrontation. 
The 
issue 
of 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-
weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
should 
remain 
a 
priority 
for 
the 
international 
community 
and 
for 
the 
Agency. 
58. 
Mr. 
SKOKNIC 
(Chile) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
firmly 
supported 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
safeguards 
and 
the 
need 
for 
the 
ratification 
of 
the 
NPT 
by 
all 
States. 
It 
had 
voted 
in 
favour 
of 
two 
resolutions 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
safeguards 
system 
that 
very 
day, 
under 
agenda 
items 
18 
and 
20, 
and 
its 
commitment 
in 
that 
area 
was 
clear 
and 
decisive. 
Nevertheless, 
since 
the 
discussions 
on 
agenda 
item 
21 
had 
been 
clearly 
divisive 
and 
had 
not 
resulted 
in 
the 
usual 
consensus, 
Chile 
had 
abstained 
in 
the 
vote. 
He 
appealed 
to 
the 
parties 
involved 
to 
seek 
balance 
and 
consensus 
and 
recommended 
an 
analysis 
of 
the 
issue 
in 
the 
General 
Conference 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reaching 
a 
satisfactory 
and 
acceptable 
solution. 
59. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
said 
that 
the 
group 
of 
Arab 
States, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
peace-loving 
nations, 
had 
requested 
every 
year 
since 
1992 
that 
the 
item 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
be 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
60. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada), 
speaking 
on 
a 
point 
of 
order, 
said 
that, 
according 
to 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
those 
who 
had 
spoken 
in 
favour 
of 
or 
against 
the 
motion 
were 
not 
to 
be 
allowed 
to 
speak 
again. 
Therefore, 
as 
the 
delegate 
from 
Syria 
had 
already 
spoken 
against 
the 
motion, 
he 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
take 
the 
floor 
again. 
61. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Legal 
Adviser 
had 
instructed 
him 
that, 
since 
Syria 
and 
Cuba 
had 
previously 
spoken 
on 
the 
matter, 
they 
were 
not 
entitled 
to 
speak 
at 
the 
present 
juncture. 
62. 
Mr. 
ELAMIN 
(Sudan) 
said 
that 
the 
Group 
of 
Arab 
States, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
peace-loving 
nations, 
had 
requested 
every 
year 
since 
1992 
that 
the

and 
threat

placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
make 
the 
international 
community 
aware 
of 
the 
threat 
to 
regional 
and 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
possession 
of 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
capabilities 
in 
breach 
of 
international 
instruments. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
international 
community 
continuously 
turned 
a 
deaf 
ear 
to 
the 
message 
and 
failed 
to 
adopt 
a 
clear 
resolution 
calling 
on 
Israel 
to 
comply 
with 
international 
law, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
like 
the 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
and 
to 
open 
up 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
teams 
of 
inspectors. 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
current 
proceedings 
ran 
counter 
to 
the 
aspirations 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
region 
for 
the 
adoption 
of 
a 
firm 
stance 
that 
would 
lay 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
just 
and 
comprehensive 
peace. 


63. 
Israel 
had 
been 
building 
nuclear 
capabilities 
since 
1948 
and 
refused 
to 
implement 
dozens 
of 
resolutions 
adopted 
in 
a 
variety 
of 
international 
fora 
concerning 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
60/92 
of 
6 
January 
2006 
identified 
Israel 
as 
the 
only 
State 
in 
the 
region 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
become 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
its 
accession 
to 
the 
Treaty. 
64. 
The 
outcome 
of 
the 
current 
proceedings 
were 
a 
key 
factor 
in 
assessing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
international 
organizations. 
The 
Arab 
States 
sponsoring 
the 
draft 
resolution 
had 
wished 
to 
make 
it 
clear 
that 
they 
were 
no 
longer 
in 
a 
position 
to 
accept 
the 
postponement 
of 
discussion 
and 
action 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
from 
one 
session 
to 
the 
next. 
It 
was 
more 
than 
odd 
that 
Israel, 
in 
addressing 
the 
General 
Conference, 
had 
expressed 
concern 
about 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
while 
refusing 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
Such 
conduct 
demonstrated 
IsraelÂs 
contempt 
for 
the 
international 
regime 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
its 
conviction 
that 
it 
enjoyed 
full 
protection 
and 
would 
not 
be 
called 
to 
account. 
65. 
Peace-loving 
countries 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
their 
friends 
had 
aspired 
to 
address 
the 
question 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
from 
a 
regional 
perspective, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
security 
of 
the 
countries 
concerned, 
instead 
of 
adopting 
an 
approach 
that 
focused 
on 
individual 
States, 
since 
such 
an 
approach 
aroused 
suspicions 
of 
selectivity 
and 
double 
standards. 
66. 
Mr. 
SOLTANIEH 
(Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
as 
the 
main 
victim 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
had 
always 
called 
for 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
be 
freed 
from 
such 
weapons, 
in 
particular 
nuclear 
weapons. 
It 
was 
profoundly 
regrettable 
that 
that 
issue 
had 
become 
trapped 
in 
a 
vicious 
circle 
despite 
unanimous 
support 
and 
that, 
after 
years 
of 
continuous 
international 
calls 
for 
immediate 
adherence 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
placement 
of 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards, 
no 
progress 
had 
been 
made. 
67. 
He 
recalled 
that 
Iran 
had 
strongly 
condemned 
the 
armed 
attack 
by 
Israel 
on 
the 
Iraqi 
nuclear 
reactor, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
Iran 
had 
been 
attacked 
by 
Iraq 
under 
Saddam 
HusseinÂs 
regime 
with 
the 
full 
support 
of 
the 
West 
(in 
particular 
the 
United 
States), 
because 
his 
country 
considered 
the 
Israeli 
attack 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
the 
security 
of 
the 
region, 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
environment 
owing 
to 
the 
release 
of 
radioactive 
materials, 
and 
an 
act 
which 
placed 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
jeopardy. 
Fortunately, 
in 
spite 
of 
opposition 
from 
some 
States, 
a 
resolution 
had 
been 
adopted 
condemning 
the 
Israeli 
aggression 
and 
the 
issue 
of 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
had 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
Unfortunately, 
for 
ten 
years 
now 
no 
resolution 
on 
the 
issue 
had 
been 
tabled 
and 
instead 
a 
Presidential 
statement 
had 
been 
delivered 
in 
the 
hope 
that 
diplomatic 
efforts 
would 
work, 
though 
his 
delegation 
had 
been 
certain 
that 
the 
Israeli 
regime 
would 
not 
comply 
with 
the 
expectations 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
68. 
The 
Conference 
was 
now 
back 
where 
it 
started. 
Almost 
all 
Member 
States 
had 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
a 
strong 
message 
had 
to 
be 
sent 
without 
further 
delay 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
resolution 
stating 
that 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
as 
they 
were 
not 
subject 
to 
any 
international 
control 
and 
in 
particular 
Agency 
comprehensive 
safeguards, 
were 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
regional 
and 
global 
security.

Although 
the 
draft 
resolution 
tabled 
had 
fallen 
far 
short 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
expectations, 
it 
had 
decided 
to 
support 
it 
in 
the 
expectation 
it 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus 
or 
by 
a 
majority 
vote. 
It 
was 
deeply 
regrettable 
that 
a 
decision 
on 
such 
a 
vital 
issue 
at 
such 
an 
important 
historical 
juncture 
had 
been 
deferred. 


69. 
Mr. 
BAHRAN 
(Yemen) 
said 
that 
the 
proposal 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
had 
not 
been 
a 
just 
one. 
Year 
after 
year 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
taken 
up 
the 
issue 
in 
question, 
hearing 
the 
growing 
despair 
of 
the 
Arab 
peoples 
at 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
inability 
to 
put 
a 
stop 
to 
IsraelÂs 
activities. 
Children, 
women 
and 
the 
elderly 
were 
being 
killed 
wherever 
they 
sought 
refuge, 
even 
in 
United 
Nations 
buildings. 
However, 
the 
international 
community 
turned 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
IsraelÂs 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
applying 
double 
standards 
and 
ignoring 
the 
reality 
faced 
by 
Arab 
citizens, 
while 
hiding 
behind 
political 
rhetoric. 
What 
had 
happened 
during 
the 
meeting 
clearly 
demonstrated 
that 
no-one 
was 
taking 
the 
views 
of 
Arab 
States 
into 
consideration, 
that 
they 
were 
being 
cast 
aside, 
despite 
recent 
events 
which 
had 
provided 
ample 
proof 
of 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
Israel. 
Arab 
children 
would 
view 
the 
result 
of 
the 
vote 
with 
pain 
and 
frustration 
and 
look 
to 
the 
future 
with 
sorrow 
and 
disillusionment. 
70. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
said 
that 
he 
had 
been 
prevented 
from 
delivering 
his 
statement 
by 
the 
raising 
of 
a 
point 
of 
order 
under 
Rule 
56 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
on 
the 
grounds 
that, 
having 
spoken 
against 
the 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate, 
he 
was 
ineligible 
to 
speak 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote. 
However, 
prior 
to 
the 
vote 
he 
had 
been 
speaking 
under 
Rule 
59 
and 
he 
requested 
that 
that 
be 
taken 
into 
account. 
71. 
Mr. 
RAUTENBACH 
(Director, 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs) 
explained 
that 
no 
delegate 
could 
speak 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote 
on 
a 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
if 
they 
had 
previously 
spoken 
on 
that 
motion, 
nor 
could 
any 
delegate 
now 
speak 
on 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
debate 
as 
the 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
had 
been 
carried. 
72. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
asked 
which 
rule 
stated 
that 
he 
could 
not 
speak 
in 
explanation 
of 
vote. 
73. 
Mr. 
RAUTENBACH 
(Director, 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs) 
said 
that, 
if 
he 
had 
understood 
the 
question 
correctly, 
the 
relevant 
rule 
was 
Rule 
74. 
If, 
however, 
the 
delegate 
of 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
had 
been 
referring 
to 
his 
right 
under 
Rule 
56 
to 
appeal 
the 
decision, 
that 
right 
should 
have 
been 
invoked 
immediately. 
74. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic) 
pointed 
out 
that 
Rule 
74 
only 
prevented 
the 
proposer 
of 
a 
proposal 
or 
amendment 
from 
explaining 
his 
vote 
on 
his 
own 
proposal 
or 
amendment. 
He 
had 
not 
been 
the 
proposer 
of 
the 
motion 
to 
adjourn 
the 
debate 
but 
had 
spoken 
against 
the 
motion 
under 
Rule 
59. 
75. 
Mr. 
RAUTENBACH 
(Director, 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs) 
concluded 
that 
that 
was 
so 
and 
that 
speaking 
against 
the 
motion 
under 
Rule 
59 
did 
not 
constitute 
an 
amendment 
of 
a 
proposal 
either. 
76. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
with 
the 
indulgence 
of 
the 
Conference, 
he 
would 
give 
the 
floor 
to 
the 
delegate 
of 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic. 
77. 
Mr. 
OTHMAN 
(Syrian 
Arab 
Republic), 
thanking 
the 
Director 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Legal 
Affairs, 
said 
that 
his 
statement 
had 
already 
been 
heard 
by 
the 
Conference. 
78. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
thanked 
the 
delegate 
of 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic 
and 
all 
delegates 
for 
the 
dignity 
with 
which 
the 
item 
had 
been 
handled, 
even 
though 
regrettably 
no 
consensus 
had 
been 
reached.

Â 
Closing 
of 
the 
session 
79. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
49 
ministerial-level 
delegations 
had 
attended 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
there 
had 
been 
103 
speakers 
in 
the 
general 
debate, 
which 
was 
an 
indication 
of 
the 
importance 
which 
Member 
States 
attached 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
80. 
Mr. 
BAZOBERRY 
OTERO 
(Bolivia) 
commended 
the 
President 
on 
the 
proper 
and 
balanced 
manner 
in 
which 
he 
had 
chaired 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
world 
was 
entering 
a 
new 
era 
in 
which 
perceptions 
and 
realities 
were 
often 
confused. 
His 
distinguished 
and 
outstanding 
leadership 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
full 
and 
successful 
deliberations 
of 
the 
Conference. 
Many 
Member 
States 
had 
expressed 
gratitude 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
activities 
and 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
vision. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
should 
be 
conducted 
with 
due 
regard 
for 
relevant 
international 
instruments 
such 
as 
the 
NPT, 
which 
was 
the 
mainstay 
of 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
safer 
world 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
He 
recalled 
the 
words 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
the 
forty-seventh 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
the 
effect 
that: 
Âthe 
time 
had 
come 
to 
take 
stock 
of 
the 
successes 
and 
failures, 
and 
to 
resolve 
to 
take 
whatever 
actions 
were 
required, 
including 
a 
switch 
to 
new 
ways 
of 
thinking 
and 
unconventional 
approaches, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
remained 
a 
source 
of 
hope 
and 
prosperity 
for 
humanity 
and 
not 
a 
tool 
for 
self-destruction.Â5 
81. 
Ms. 
KAUPPI 
(Finland), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
thanked 
the 
President 
for 
bringing 
the 
fiftieth 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion. 
His 
able 
guidance 
and 
well-known 
diplomatic 
skills 
had 
greatly 
contributed 
to 
that 
outcome. 
She 
also 
thanked 
the 
Vice-
Presidents 
and 
the 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee, 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
and 
his 
Vice-Chairmen, 
and 
the 
chairmen 
of 
the 
two 
working 
groups. 
She 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
professionalism 
in 
preparing 
the 
session 
and 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
Austria 
and 
the 
Austrian 
authorities 
for 
hosting 
the 
Conference. 
82. 
Mr. 
CABELLO 
SARUBBI 
(Paraguay), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
GRULAC, 
congratulated 
the 
President 
on 
his 
efficient 
leadership 
of 
the 
Conference, 
highlighting 
in 
particular 
the 
personal 
efforts 
he 
had 
made 
during 
the 
intense 
negotiations, 
even 
though 
it 
had 
proved 
impossible 
to 
reach 
a 
consensus. 
He 
expressed 
gratitude 
to 
all 
delegations 
for 
their 
work, 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
and 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
and 
reaffirmed 
the 
commitment 
of 
the 
Group 
to 
collaborating 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
achievement 
of 
its 
goals. 
83. 
Mr. 
ELOUMNI 
(Morocco), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
African 
Group, 
expressed 
particular 
pleasure 
at 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
fiftieth 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
been 
presided 
over 
in 
such 
an 
excellent 
manner 
by 
one 
of 
the 
outstanding 
representatives 
of 
his 
region. 
84. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
thanking 
the 
preceding 
speakers 
for 
their 
kind 
words, 
said 
it 
had 
been 
an 
honour 
and 
a 
privilege 
for 
him, 
his 
country 
and 
his 
continent 
that 
he 
had 
been 
elected 
to 
serve 
as 
President 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
its 
fiftieth 
session. 
The 
cooperation, 
flexibility 
and 
dedication 
of 
delegates 
had 
enabled 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
intensive 
programme 
of 
work 
to 
be 
concluded, 
thereby 
setting 
the 
stage 
for 
collaboration 
to 
be 
further 
enhanced 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
fiftieth 
anniversary 
year. 
The 
record 
number 
of 
high-level 
statements, 
including 
an 
address 
by 
the 
President 
of 
Austria, 
demonstrated 
Member 
StatesÂ 
commitment 
to 
the 
objectives 
and 
purpose 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Oh 
behalf 
of 
the 
Conference, 
he 
thanked 
the 
people 
and 
Government 
of 
Austria 
and 
the 
City 
of 
Vienna 
for 
their 
hospitality, 
not 
only 
during 
the 
fiftieth 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
but 
throughout 
the 
years.

85. 
He 
paid 
particular 
tribute 
to 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole, 
his 
Vice-Chairmen 
and 
the 
chairmen 
of 
the 
working 
groups 
for 
their 
professionalism, 
ensuring 
the 
successful 
conclusion 
of 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
work; 
and 
thanked 
the 
Vice-Presidents, 
the 
Director 
General, 
participating 
in 
the 
Conference 
for 
the 
first 
time 
as 
a 
Nobel 
Laureate, 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Austria 
Center. 
86. 
It 
was 
an 
opportune 
time 
to 
recall 
the 
address 
given 
by 
President 
Eisenhower 
to 
the 
General 
Assembly 
on 
8 
December 
1953 
in 
which 
he 
had 
pledged 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Âto 
help 
solve 
the 
fearful 
atomic 
dilemma 
Â 
to 
devote 
its 
entire 
heart 
and 
mind 
to 
find 
the 
way 
by 
which 
the 
miraculous 
inventiveness 
of 
man 
shall 
not 
be 
dedicated 
to 
his 
death, 
but 
consecrated 
to 
his 
life.Â 
That 
determination 
was 
also 
the 
determination 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
During 
its 
deliberations, 
many 
meetings 
had 
been 
dedicated 
to 
giving 
effect 
to 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon 
fifty 
years 
ago 
but 
remained 
as 
valid 
as 
ever. 
Many 
resolutions 
and 
decisions 
had 
been 
adopted, 
though 
regrettably 
not 
all 
by 
consensus, 
whereby 
the 
Conference 
had 
rededicated 
itself 
to 
expanding 
and 
expediting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
the 
next 
fifty 
years, 
a 
significant 
achievement 
that 
would 
contribute 
to 
achieving 
a 
better 
world 
for 
all, 
consistent 
with 
President 
EisenhowerÂs 
vision. 
That 
should 
be 
Member 
StatesÂ 
shared 
mission. 
87. 
Finally, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
48 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
and 
in 
commemoration 
of 
the 
International 
Day 
of 
Peace 
celebrated 
the 
preceding 
day, 
he 
invited 
the 
Conference 
to 
observe 
one 
minute 
of 
silence 
dedicated 
to 
prayer 
or 
meditation. 
All 
present 
rose 
and 
stood 
in 
silence 
for 
one 
minute. 


88. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
declared 
the 
fiftieth 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
closed. 
The 
meeting 
rose

Â 
Opening 
of 
the 
session 
1. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
declared 
open 
the 
50th 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
The 
meeting 
began 
with 
a 
short 
performance 
by 
the 
MenÂs 
Choir 
of 
the 
Moscow 
Engineering 
and 
Physics 
Institute 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
The 
performance 
was 
at 
the 
invitation 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federal 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency. 


2. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
thanked 
the 
MenÂs 
Choir 
of 
the 
Moscow 
Engineering 
and 
Physics 
Institute. 
3. 
In 
accordance 
with 
Rule 
48 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
he 
invited 
delegates 
to 
observe 
one 
minute 
of 
silence 
dedicated 
to 
prayer 
or 
meditation. 
All 
present 
rose 
and 
stood 
in 
silence 
for 
one 
minute. 


4. 
The 
TEMPORARY 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
taking 
place 
at 
an 
auspicious 
time 
in 
the 
Agency's 
history: 
the 
Agency 
was 
celebrating 
its 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
and 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General, 
Mohamed 
ElBaradei, 
had 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005 
for 
their 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
energy 
from 
being 
used 
for 
military 
purposes 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
used 
in 
the 
safest 
possible 
way. 
The 
Noble 
Prize 
had 
underscored 
the 
value 
and 
the 
relevance 
of 
the 
Agency's 
work. 
5. 
Since 
the 
bombing 
of 
Hiroshima 
and 
Nagasaki, 
when 
in 
one 
second 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
people 
had 
been 
killed, 
humanity 
had 
had 
to 
face 
the 
question 
of 
what 
use 
to 
make 
of 
the 
capacities 
of 
the 
atom. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
sought 
to 
create 
zones 
free 
from 
nuclear 
weapons, 
Latin 
America 
being 
the 
first 
region 
to 
do 
so, 
an 
achievement 
for 
which 
Alfonso 
GarcÃ­a 
Robles, 
who 
had 
conceived 
the 
idea 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
Latin 
America, 
had 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
1982. 
6. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
was 
in 
recognition 
of 
the 
important 
work 
of 
Agency 
staff 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
that 
of 
the 
Director 
General, 
who 
had 
demonstrated 
statesmanship, 
fairness 
and 
impartiality 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
many 
difficult 
topics 
on 
the 
international 
agenda, 
not 
only 
in 
the 
area 
of 
security 
and 
verification, 
but 
also 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
and 
the 
reduction 
of 
poverty.

11. 
The 
PRESIDENT, 
thanking 
delegations 
for 
the 
confidence 
they 
had 
placed 
in 
him 
by 
supporting 
his 
nomination 
as 
President, 
and 
expressing 
in 
particular 
his 
appreciation 
to 
his 
fellow 
Africans 
for 
nominating 
South 
Africa, 
commended 
his 
predecessor 
Ambassador 
Bazoberry 
of 
Bolivia 
for 
steering 
the 
previous 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion. 
12. 
Africa 
had 
not 
only 
benefited 
from 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
but 
had 
also 
greatly 
contributed 
to 
shaping 
the 
Agency's 
development 
and 
the 
practical 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General, 
himself 
a 
son 
of 
Africa 
and 
a 
distinguished 
international 
servant, 
had 
been 
honoured 
by 
the 
receipt 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
2005. 
13. 
The 
continued 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
depended 
on 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies. 
Accordingly, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
its 
work 
on 
establishing 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
and 
facilitating 
their 
application 
worldwide 
to 
avoid 
incidents 
that 
might 
have 
serious 
consequences 
for 
the 
future 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
14. 
The 
Agency's 
verification 
activities 
had 
figured 
prominently 
in 
the 
public 
eye 
over 
the 
previous 
year. 
Those 
activities 
had 
been 
guided 
by 
the 
principles 
of 
objectivity 
and 
impartiality 
and 
by 
high 
standards 
of 
professionalism. 
The 
Agency 
had 
responded 
to 
the 
challenges 
encountered, 
upholding 
the 
authority 
and 
integrity 
of 
the 
multilateral 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
and 
the 
world 
had 
come 
to 
look 
upon 
it 
as 
a 
guarantor 
of 
peace 
and 
safety 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
15. 
During 
the 
current 
session, 
the 
Agency 
was 
hosting 
a 
special 
event 
entitled 
ÂNew 
Framework 
for 
the 
Utilization 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy 
in 
the 
Twenty-First 
Century: 
Assurances 
of 
Supply 
and 
Non-
ProliferationÂ. 
It 
was 
opportune 
that 
the 
special 
event 
was 
dealing 
with 
a 
subject 
that 
was 
central 
to 
the 
Nobel 
citation 
and 
that 
touched 
on 
all 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
Agency's 
activities. 
16. 
He 
recalled 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
Rules 
34 
and 
40 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
the 
Conference 
normally 
elected 
eight 
Vice-Presidents, 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
and 
five 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
Â 
resulting 
in 
a 
General 
Committee 
of 
15 
members. 
However, 
since 
in 
the 
current 
year 
the 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole 
was 
from 
the 
South 
East 
Asia 
and 
the 
Pacific 
Group, 
which 
customarily 
had 
only 
one 
representative 
on 
the 
General 
Committee, 
it 
would 
be 
necessary 
to 
suspend 
Rules 
34 
and 
40 
in 
order 
to 
have 
seven 
Vice-Presidents 
and 
six 
additional 
members 
in 
a 
Committee 
of 
15. 
He 
understood 
that 
there 
was 
full 
agreement 
among 
the 
area 
groups. 
17. 
He 
proposed 
that 
the 
delegates 
of 
Belgium, 
Bolivia, 
Canada, 
Egypt, 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
be 
elected 
as 
Vice-Presidents; 
that 
Mr. 
Shannon 
(Australia) 
be 
elected 
as 
Chairman 
of 
the 
Committee 
of 
the 
Whole; 
and 
that 
the 
delegates 
of 
Cyprus, 
France, 
Poland, 
the 
Syrian 
Arab 
Republic, 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
Venezuela 
be 
elected 
as 
additional 
members 
of 
the 
General 
Committee. 
18. 
The 
PresidentÂs 
proposals 
were 
accepted. 
19. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
further 
proposed 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
deal 
with 
items 
5, 
4, 
3, 
2 
and 
7 
in 
that 
order, 
pending 
receipt 
of 
the 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendation 
on 
the 
provisional 
agenda. 
20. 
The 
PresidentÂs 
proposal 
was 
accepted.

Statement 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
21. 
The 
DIRECTOR 
GENERAL 
said 
that, 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
brevity, 
he 
would 
read 
excerpts 
from 
his 
statement. 
The 
full 
text 
would 
be 
made 
available. 
22. 
Anniversaries 
were 
a 
time 
for 
reflection 
and 
renewal. 
There 
was 
much 
to 
be 
learned 
by 
looking 
back 
on 
the 
50-year 
history 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
in 
its 
many 
applications 
Â 
from 
the 
days 
of 
the 
first 
power 
reactor 
operations, 
safeguards 
inspections, 
safety 
guidance 
and 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
all 
the 
way 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
today. 
23. 
In 
celebrating 
its 
50th 
anniversary, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
goal 
was 
to 
broaden 
awareness 
of 
the 
scope 
of 
its 
mission 
and 
activities 
Â 
its 
contributions 
to 
development, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
Â 
and 
to 
provide 
forums 
to 
review 
the 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
that 
lay 
ahead. 
24. 
Recently 
there 
had 
been 
rising 
expectations 
regarding 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
rapid 
growth 
in 
global 
energy 
demand 
was 
putting 
a 
premium 
on 
all 
energy 
sources. 
Climate 
change 
concerns 
had 
highlighted 
the 
advantages 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
terms 
of 
its 
minimal 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
The 
sustained 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
productivity 
record 
over 
the 
past 
twenty 
years 
had 
made 
nuclear 
operating 
costs 
relatively 
low 
and 
stable. 
25. 
To 
date, 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
concentrated 
in 
industrialized 
countries. 
In 
terms 
of 
new 
construction, 
however, 
the 
pattern 
was 
different. 
Of 
the 
28 
new 
reactors 
under 
construction, 
16 
were 
in 
developing 
countries. 
While 
the 
highest 
percentage 
of 
existing 
reactors 
was 
in 
North 
America 
and 
Western 
Europe, 
recent 
expansion 
had 
been 
concentrated 
in 
Asia 
and 
Eastern 
Europe. 
26. 
China, 
India 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
currently 
had 
the 
most 
ambitious 
plans 
for 
near-term 
nuclear 
expansion. 
Finland 
was 
building 
a 
new 
reactor, 
and 
France 
also 
planned 
to 
begin 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
reactor 
in 
2007. 
Those 
were 
the 
first 
new 
nuclear 
plants 
to 
be 
constructed 
in 
Western 
Europe 
since 
1991. 
South 
Africa 
also 
intended 
to 
start 
construction 
in 
2007 
of 
a 
small 
modular 
reactor. 
The 
previous 
month, 
Argentina 
had 
decided 
to 
restart 
construction 
of 
its 
third 
nuclear 
plant. 
In 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
energy 
companies 
and 
consortia 
had 
announced 
plans 
to 
submit 
applications 
for 
construction 
and 
operating 
licences 
for 
at 
least 
15 
new 
reactors 
over 
the 
following 
two 
years. 
27. 
Speaking 
before 
the 
forty-ninth 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
he 
had 
expressed 
his 
belief 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
focus 
more 
explicitly 
on 
Âenergy 
for 
developmentÂ 
Â 
since 
without 
energy 
there 
could 
be 
no 
development. 
The 
energy 
shortage 
in 
developing 
countries 
was 
a 
staggering 
impediment 
to 
development 
and 
to 
efforts 
to 
eradicate 
poverty. 
To 
lend 
perspective: 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
OECD, 
on 
average, 
consumed 
electricity 
at 
a 
rate 
roughly 
100 
times 
that 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
least 
developed 
countries. 
28. 
In 
that 
regard, 
he 
had 
been 
pleased 
that 
the 
expanded 
G8 
Summit 
in 
St. 
Petersburg 
in 
the 
summer 
had 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
Âglobal 
energy 
securityÂ, 
a 
concept 
which, 
as 
he 
had 
stressed 
during 
his 
participation 
at 
the 
summit, 
meant 
fulfilling 
the 
energy 
needs 
of 
all 
countries. 
29. 
The 
current 
global 
organization 
of 
energy 
resource 
management 
and 
distribution 
was 
fragmented 
Â 
in 
terms 
of 
both 
geographical 
coverage 
and 
the 
types 
of 
energy 
resources 
managed. 
Global 
structures 
for 
setting 
norms, 
oversight 
and 
monitoring 
existed 
in 
many 
other 
key 
sectors 
Â 
such 
as 
WTO, 
ICAO 
or 
the 
Bretton 
Woods 
institutions 
overseeing 
finance. 
However, 
no 
similar 
global 
structure 
currently 
existed 
for 
energy 
overall. 
30. 
As 
a 
sophisticated 
technology, 
nuclear 
power 
required 
a 
correspondingly 
sophisticated 
infrastructure. 
For 
new 
countries 
considering 
nuclear 
power, 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
was 
available. 
That 
included 
many 
components, 
from 
industrial 
infrastructure

such 
as 
manufacturing 
facilities, 
to 
the 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
framework, 
to 
the 
institutional 
measures 
to 
ensure 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
to 
the 
necessary 
human 
and 
financial 
resources. 
The 
Agency 
had 
recently 
published 
guidance 
on 
the 
infrastructure 
needed 
for 
countries 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
power. 


31. 
Technological 
and 
institutional 
innovation 
was 
a 
key 
factor 
in 
ensuring 
the 
long-term 
sustainability 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
International 
Project 
on 
Innovative 
Nuclear 
Reactors 
and 
Fuel 
Cycles 
(INPRO) 
had 
grown 
to 
include 
27 
members. 
In 
Phase 
I, 
a 
methodology 
for 
the 
evaluation 
of 
innovative 
nuclear 
systems 
had 
been 
developed. 
The 
INPRO 
Steering 
Committee 
had 
recently 
decided 
to 
begin 
Phase 
II, 
which 
would 
focus 
on 
issues 
including 
innovative 
approaches 
to 
infrastructure 
and 
institutional 
development 
for 
countries 
beginning 
nuclear 
power 
programmes, 
as 
well 
as 
on 
the 
development 
of 
collaborative 
projects. 
32. 
Much 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
scientific 
work 
was 
focused 
on 
the 
transfer 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
applications 
related 
to 
health, 
agriculture, 
industry, 
water 
management 
and 
preservation 
of 
the 
environment. 
The 
Agency 
was 
working 
to 
build 
up 
Member 
StatesÂ 
scientific 
and 
technical 
capacities 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
supported 
their 
national 
development 
priorities. 
Those 
efforts 
were 
making 
meaningful 
contributions 
to 
social 
and 
economic 
development. 
He 
offered 
a 
few 
examples: 
33. 
Following 
the 
announcement 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
to 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
chosen 
to 
use 
the 
award 
money 
to 
set 
up 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
nutrition, 
the 
Agency 
assisted 
countries 
in 
using 
stable 
isotopes 
as 
tracers 
in 
the 
body 
to 
develop 
and 
evaluate 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
interventional 
nutrition 
strategies. 
Three 
regional 
nutrition 
courses 
had 
been 
scheduled 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
strengthened 
its 
collaboration 
with 
WHO 
and 
UNICEF 
on 
nutrition 
activities. 
34. 
For 
many 
years, 
radiotherapy 
had 
been 
used 
to 
cure 
or 
mitigate 
the 
effects 
of 
cancer. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
Programme 
of 
Action 
for 
Cancer 
Therapy 
(PACT) 
was 
working 
to 
integrate 
radiotherapy 
into 
the 
broader 
framework 
of 
cancer 
prevention 
and 
control. 
Over 
the 
past 
year, 
relationships 
had 
been 
built 
with 
the 
leading 
organizations 
in 
the 
field. 
Collaborative 
efforts 
were 
now 
underway 
to 
create 
model 
demonstration 
sites 
for 
cancer 
control 
in 
Albania, 
Nicaragua, 
Sri 
Lanka, 
the 
United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania, 
Vietnam 
and 
Yemen. 
Those 
sites 
would 
be 
used 
to 
attract 
additional 
donors, 
by 
raising 
the 
profile 
of 
cancer 
as 
a 
global 
health 
concern. 
35. 
Under 
a 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
project, 
countries 
throughout 
Central 
America 
had 
used 
the 
SIT 
as 
part 
of 
an 
environmentally 
friendly 
programme 
for 
fruit 
fly 
control. 
In 
addition 
to 
reducing 
insecticide 
use, 
the 
result 
in 
many 
cases 
was 
far 
greater 
capacity 
to 
produce 
and 
export 
fruits 
and 
vegetables. 
Nicaragua, 
for 
example, 
had 
been 
able 
earlier 
in 
the 
year 
to 
initiate 
commercial 
shipments 
of 
bell 
peppers 
to 
the 
United 
StatesÂ 
market, 
and 
Guatemala 
was 
expected 
to 
do 
so 
later 
in 
the 
year. 
36. 
Mutation 
breeding 
of 
plants 
was 
another 
nuclear 
technique 
to 
improve 
crop 
productivity. 
Recent 
success 
had 
been 
achieved 
in 
Ghana, 
where 
some 
200 
million 
cocoa 
trees 
had 
been 
destroyed 
in 
the 
previous 
50 
years 
by 
the 
cocoa 
swollen 
shoot 
virus. 
Over 
the 
past 
decade, 
the 
Agency 
had 
worked 
with 
the 
Ghana 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority 
to 
develop 
cocoa 
lines 
with 
strong 
resistance 
to 
that 
virus. 
A 
new 
variety 
of 
cocoa 
was 
now 
growing 
on 
25 
farms 
across 
Ghana 
with 
no 
evidence 
of 
a 
resurgence 
of 
the 
disease. 
If 
produced 
on 
a 
larger 
scale, 
the 
new 
variety 
could 
benefit 
cocoa 
production 
not 
only 
in 
Ghana, 
but 
also 
in 
a 
number 
of 
neighbouring 
countries. 
37. 
The 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
around 
the 
globe 
remained 
key 
elements 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
Two 
decades 
after 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident, 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
the 
efforts 
to 
build 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
were 
paying 
off. 
Operational 
safety 
performance 
at 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
remained 
strong. 
Occupational 
radiation 
protection 
indicators 
had 
once 
again 
showed 
improvement 
over 
the 
past 
year. 
More 
Member 
States 
were 
taking 
a 
proactive 
role 
in 
radiation 
source 
safety. 
The 

GC(50)/OR.1 
18

2006,

Agency 
was 
continuing 
to 
make 
strides 
in 
strengthening 
physical 
protection 
at 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
enhancing 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
radioactive 
sources 
worldwide. 


38. 
However 
nuclear 
safety 
was 
not 
an 
issue 
that 
could 
ever 
be 
regarded 
as 
ÂfixedÂ. 
While 
the 
strong, 
steady 
safety 
performance 
of 
recent 
years 
was 
reassuring, 
the 
sporadic 
recurrence 
of 
events 
of 
concern 
made 
clear 
that 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
strong 
safety 
culture 
Â 
for 
both 
operators 
and 
regulators 
Â 
should 
always 
be 
viewed 
as 
Âwork 
in 
progressÂ. 
39. 
With 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
Safety 
Fundamentals 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
the 
previous 
week, 
all 
the 
actions 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
March 
2004 
Action 
Plan 
for 
the 
Development 
and 
Application 
of 
IAEA 
Safety 
Standards 
were 
nearing 
completion. 
The 
transition 
to 
a 
new 
safety 
standard 
structure 
had 
made 
good 
progress 
in 
all 
areas. 
Recent 
reports 
by 
many 
countries 
and 
by 
organizations 
such 
as 
WENRA 
confirmed 
the 
wider 
use 
of 
Agency 
Safety 
Standards, 
both 
as 
a 
benchmark 
for 
harmonization 
and 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
national 
regulations. 
40. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
review 
services 
used 
the 
Agency 
Safety 
Standards 
as 
a 
reference 
point, 
and 
played 
an 
important 
part 
in 
evaluating 
their 
effectiveness. 
In 
2006, 
the 
Agency 
had 
begun 
offering, 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
an 
Integrated 
Regulatory 
Review 
Service 
(IRRS). 
That 
new 
service 
combined 
a 
number 
of 
previous 
services, 
on 
topics 
ranging 
from 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
radiation 
safety 
to 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
nuclear 
security. 
The 
IRRS 
approach 
considered 
international 
regulatory 
issues 
and 
trends, 
and 
provided 
a 
balance 
between 
technical 
and 
policy 
discussions 
among 
senior 
regulators 
to 
harmonize 
regulatory 
approaches 
and 
create 
mutual 
learning 
opportunities 
among 
regulators. 
All 
countries 
should 
take 
advantage 
of 
that 
service, 
and 
he 
stressed 
that 
that 
transparency 
and 
introspection 
were 
essential 
ingredients 
of 
an 
effective 
nuclear 
safety 
culture. 
41. 
Over 
the 
previous 
three 
years, 
the 
number 
of 
Member 
States 
participating 
in 
Agency 
projects 
related 
to 
the 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients 
had 
increased 
more 
than 
threefold, 
from 
21 
to 
a 
current 
total 
of 
78 
States. 
The 
Agency 
was 
continuing 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
better 
safety 
performance 
in 
that 
area, 
including 
through 
improving 
access 
to 
related 
training. 
In 
some 
Member 
States, 
professional 
societies 
were 
taking 
the 
lead 
in 
organizing 
radiation 
protection 
training. 
The 
Agency 
had 
also 
recently 
introduced 
a 
website 
that 
would 
provide 
essential 
information 
on 
the 
topic 
to 
health 
professionals 
as 
well 
as 
to 
patients. 
42. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
continued 
to 
progress 
at 
a 
rapid 
pace. 
The 
Agency 
faced 
a 
challenge 
in 
helping 
Member 
States 
to 
implement 
the 
enhanced 
regime 
of 
international 
legal 
instruments 
relevant 
to 
nuclear 
security. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
Member 
States, 
guidance 
based 
on 
international 
best 
practices 
was 
being 
published 
by 
the 
Agency 
as 
part 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
security 
series. 
43. 
Over 
the 
previous 
year, 
over 
30 
evaluation 
missions 
related 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
security 
had 
been 
carried 
out 
Â 
in 
some 
cases 
including 
a 
combined 
emphasis 
on 
relevant 
safety 
aspects. 
The 
results 
of 
those 
missions 
helped 
to 
identify 
the 
needs 
of 
States 
and 
had 
provided 
valuable 
inputs 
for 
he 
development 
of 
Integrated 
Nuclear 
Security 
Support 
Plans 
(INSSPs) 
for 
individual 
countries. 
To 
date, 
dozens 
of 
INSSPs 
had 
been 
drafted 
and 
were 
in 
various 
stages 
of 
development 
and 
implementation. 
44. 
Ninety-three 
States 
were 
now 
participating 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Illicit 
Trafficking 
Database. 
Analysis 
of 
the 
database 
was 
providing 
insight 
into 
trends, 
risks, 
and 
trafficking 
methods 
and 
routes. 
The 
number 
of 
incidents 
Â 
more 
than 
100 
per 
year 
for 
the 
past 
three 
years 
Â 
demonstrated 
a 
persistent 
problem 
with 
trafficking, 
thefts, 
losses 
and 
other 
unauthorized 
activities 
involving 
nuclear 
or 
radioactive 
material. 
The 
number 
of 
incidents 
involving 
detection 
of 
materials 
at 
borders 
had 
increased 
substantially 
in 
recent 
years, 
clearly 
due, 
in 
part, 
to 
the 
increased 
deployment 
by 
States 
of 
detection 
and 
monitoring 
equipment.

45. 
Over 
90% 
of 
the 
funding 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
continued 
to 
be 
provided 
through 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund, 
and 
sustained 
adequate 
funding 
for 
the 
2006Â2009 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
was 
not 
yet 
assured 
by 
any 
means. 
46. 
The 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
arms 
control 
regime 
continued 
to 
face 
a 
broad 
set 
of 
challenges, 
and 
the 
past 
few 
years 
had 
underscored 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
role 
in 
preventing 
proliferation. 
The 
number 
of 
States 
with 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
had 
steadily 
increased. 
Since 
the 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
in 
2005, 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreements 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
for 
six 
States. 
Additional 
protocols 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
for 
nine 
States, 
making 
a 
total 
of 
78 
States 
with 
additional 
protocols 
in 
force. 
However, 
over 
100 
States 
Â 
including 
25 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
activities 
Â 
had 
yet 
to 
bring 
additional 
protocols 
into 
force. 
47. 
Moreover, 
36 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
not 
even 
fulfilled 
their 
legal 
obligation 
to 
bring 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency 
into 
force. 
The 
Agency 
naturally 
could 
not 
draw 
any 
safeguards 
conclusions 
for 
those 
States. 
48. 
Since 
the 
end 
of 
December 
2002, 
when 
Agency 
verification 
activities 
had 
been 
terminated 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
DPRK, 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
draw 
any 
conclusions 
regarding 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities. 
He 
continued 
to 
believe 
in 
the 
importance 
and 
urgency 
of 
finding 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
to 
the 
current 
situation. 
The 
Agency 
stood 
ready 
to 
work 
with 
the 
DPRK, 
and 
with 
all 
others, 
towards 
a 
solution 
that 
addressed 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
DPRK 
were 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
while 
addressing 
the 
security 
and 
other 
needs 
of 
the 
DPRK. 
49. 
The 
implementation 
of 
the 
NPT 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
been 
on 
the 
BoardÂs 
agenda 
for 
more 
than 
three 
years, 
and 
lately 
also 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council. 
On 
31 
July 
2006, 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
adopted 
resolution 
1696, 
in 
which 
it 
called 
upon 
Iran 
to 
take 
the 
steps 
required 
by 
the 
Board 
in 
its 
resolution 
of 
4 
February 
2006. 
Those 
steps 
had 
included 
the 
necessity 
of 
the 
Agency 
continuing 
its 
work 
to 
clarify 
all 
outstanding 
issues 
relating 
to 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
and 
the 
re-establishment 
by 
Iran 
of 
full 
and 
sustained 
suspension 
of 
all 
its 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
In 
his 
report 
of 
31 
August 
to 
the 
Board 
and 
to 
the 
Security 
Council, 
regarding 
IranÂs 
fulfilment 
of 
the 
requirements 
of 
that 
resolution, 
he 
had 
stated 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
suspended 
its 
enrichment-related 
activities, 
nor 
had 
the 
Agency 
been 
able 
to 
make 
progress 
on 
resolving 
the 
outstanding 
issues, 
due 
to 
the 
absence 
of 
the 
necessary 
transparency 
on 
the 
part 
of 
Iran. 
50. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
current 
verification 
activities 
in 
Iran, 
he 
remained 
hopeful 
that, 
through 
the 
ongoing 
dialogue 
between 
Iran 
and 
its 
European 
and 
other 
partners, 
the 
conditions 
would 
be 
created 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
long 
overdue 
negotiation 
aiming 
to 
achieve 
a 
comprehensive 
settlement 
that, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
would 
address 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
concerns 
about 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
while 
on 
the 
other 
addressing 
IranÂs 
economic, 
political 
and 
security 
concerns. 
51. 
He 
had 
continued 
consultations 
with 
the 
States 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
on 
the 
application 
of 
full-scope 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
on 
the 
development 
of 
model 
agreements 
as 
a 
necessary 
step 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
Middle 
East 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
However, 
he 
regretted 
that, 
as 
in 
previous 
years, 
no 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
on 
either 
front. 
52. 
For 
fifty 
years, 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
been 
a 
principal 
mechanism 
for 
implementing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
basic 
mission 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace. 
However, 
over 
that 
time, 
the 
relationship 
between 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
evolved. 
Many 
Member 
State 
institutions 
now 
had 
capabilities 
equal 
to 
or 
exceeding 
those 
of 
the 
Secretariat. 
As 
a 
result, 
experience 
gained 
in 
one 
Member 
State 
was 
often 
called 
upon 
by 
another 
Member 
State 
through 
a 
variety 
of 
mechanisms.

53. 
For 
example, 
Ghana 
had 
joined 
the 
Agency 
in 
1960. 
Over 
the 
intervening 
years, 
GhanaÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
covered 
topics 
ranging 
from 
isotope 
hydrology 
and 
industrial 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy. 
As 
GhanaÂs 
technical 
institutions 
and 
capabilities 
had 
grown, 
they 
had 
provided 
more 
than 
80 
international 
experts 
to 
support 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
Africa 
and 
other 
regions. 
They 
had 
hosted 
some 
30 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors, 
and 
more 
than 
25 
training 
events. 
Recently, 
the 
Agency 
had 
supported 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
School 
of 
Nuclear 
and 
Allied 
Sciences 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Ghana 
in 
Accra, 
a 
new 
regional 
training 
resource 
that 
the 
Government 
intended 
to 
use 
not 
only 
to 
train 
local 
specialists, 
but 
also 
to 
make 
available 
to 
engineers 
and 
scientists 
from 
neighbouring 
countries 
and 
the 
region. 
54. 
Brazil 
had 
joined 
the 
Agency 
in 
1957. 
Its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
reflected 
the 
GovernmentÂs 
interest 
in 
establishing 
strong 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 
technology 
institutes, 
with 
a 
particular 
focus 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
to 
improve 
health 
services. 
Brazil 
had 
become 
the 
largest 
resource 
country 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
the 
Latin 
American 
region. 
It 
had 
provided 
over 
800 
international 
experts, 
hosted 
over 
1300 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors, 
as 
well 
as 
some 
65 
training 
events. 
BrazilÂs 
National 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
managed 
four 
national 
nuclear 
research 
institutes 
and 
was 
currently 
inaugurating 
a 
fifth 
in 
the 
north 
of 
the 
country. 
55. 
Those 
Member 
States, 
and 
many 
others, 
were 
the 
best 
demonstration 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Properly 
harnessed, 
the 
programme 
promoted 
sustainable 
growth 
and 
human 
security. 
56. 
Looking 
to 
the 
future, 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
a 
number 
of 
related 
challenges 
were 
to 
be 
faced. 
The 
increase 
in 
global 
energy 
demand 
was 
driving 
a 
potential 
expansion 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
while 
concern 
was 
clearly 
mounting 
regarding 
the 
proliferation 
risks 
created 
by 
the 
further 
spread 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology, 
such 
as 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
plutonium 
reprocessing. 
There 
was 
clearly 
a 
need 
for 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
framework 
for 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
The 
establishment 
of 
a 
framework 
that 
was 
equitable 
and 
accessible 
to 
all 
users 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
acting 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
norms 
would 
certainly 
be 
a 
complex 
endeavour, 
and 
in 
his 
view 
best 
addressed 
through 
a 
series 
of 
progressive 
phases. 
The 
first 
phase 
would 
establish 
mechanisms 
for 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants; 
the 
second 
would 
develop, 
as 
needed, 
assurances 
regarding 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactors; 
and 
the 
third 
would 
facilitate 
the 
conversion 
of 
existing 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
facilities 
from 
national 
to 
multilateral 
operations, 
and 
would 
encourage 
limiting 
future 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
to 
multilateral 
operations. 
57. 
A 
broad 
range 
of 
ideas, 
studies 
and 
proposals 
had 
been 
put 
forward 
on 
the 
topic. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
discussions 
during 
the 
special 
event 
that 
week 
would 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
develop 
a 
roadmap 
for 
moving 
forward, 
in 
close 
consultation 
and 
with 
the 
active 
involvement 
of 
Member 
States. 
58. 
Wherever 
one 
turned 
in 
todayÂs 
world, 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
the 
intertwined 
issues 
of 
security 
and 
development 
continued 
to 
be 
the 
most 
daunting 
challenges 
facing 
humanity. 
It 
was 
becoming 
more 
evident 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
both 
fields. 
With 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency, 
there 
was 
no 
better 
introduction 
to 
the 
time 
of 
reflection 
and 
renewal 
Â 
nor 
any 
greater 
honour 
Â 
than 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
However, 
with 
recognition 
and 
achievement 
came 
also 
the 
responsibility 
to 
maintain 
and 
strengthen 
the 
commitment 
to 
the 
mission 
with 
which 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
entrusted.

Message 
from 
the 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
59. 
Mr. 
ANNAN 
(United 
Nations 
Secretary-General) 
gave 
the 
following 
videotaped 
message: 
ÂFor 
the 
past 
50 
years, 
the 
IAEA 
has 
carried 
out 
its 
mandate 
with 
professionalism 
and 
dignity. 
It 
has 
advanced 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
promoted 
economic 
development. 
It 
as 
contributed 
to 
technical 
progress 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
medicine 
and 
agriculture. 
It 
has 
strengthened 
its 
safeguards 
system, 
and 
that 
system 
has 
now 
been 
accepted 
by 
more 
than 
100 
States. 


ÂLast 
year, 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
came 
as 
richly 
deserved 
recognition 
of 
the 
achievements 
of 
the 
IAEA 
and 
its 
distinguished 
Director 
General, 
my 
good 
friend 
Dr. 
Mohamed 
ElBaradei. 
These 
are 
real 
achievements 
in 
improving 
the 
human 
condition 
and 
in 
strengthening 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 


ÂAt 
this 
milestone 
Conference, 
you 
are 
not 
only 
reflecting 
on 
the 
past, 
but 
looking 
to 
the 
challenges 
ahead. 
The 
challenges 
will 
be 
many 
and 
varied. 
Your 
agenda 
is 
growing 
every 
year, 
in 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
in 
non-proliferation, 
in 
technology 
for 
development 
and 
in 
safety 
and 
security, 
including 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


ÂFor 
me, 
this 
Conference 
is 
also 
an 
opportunity 
to 
express 
my 
sincere 
gratitude 
for 
our 
partnership 
during 
the 
10 
years 
I 
have 
served 
as 
Secretary-General 
of 
the 
United 
Nations. 
Today, 
I 
prepare 
to 
leave 
office 
with 
a 
sense 
of 
profound 
reassurance 
that 
the 
stewardship 
of 
the 
peaceful 
atom 
is 
in 
such 
competent 
and 
reliable 
hands. 
I 
thank 
you 
for 
your 
support 
and 
wish 
you 
every 
success 
in 
your 
mission 
in 
the 
years 
ahead.Â 


3. 
Statement 
by 
the 
Federal 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria 
60. 
Mr. 
FISCHER 
(Federal 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria) 
said 
that 
he 
had 
followed 
with 
great 
interest 
and 
close 
attention 
the 
report 
of 
the 
Director 
General, 
which 
had 
confirmed 
once 
again 
how 
valuable 
and 
important 
the 
AgencyÂs 
tasks 
were. 
The 
Agency 
was 
celebrating 
an 
anniversary, 
and 
it 
was 
a 
source 
of 
great 
pleasure 
to 
him 
to 
be 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 
convey 
his 
warmest 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Agency 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Austria 
Â 
its 
host 
country 
Â 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
50th 
General 
Conference. 
An 
anniversary 
of 
that 
kind 
was 
a 
memorable 
occasion 
and 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
look 
at 
the 
development 
of 
the 
organization, 
and 
to 
look 
forward 
cautiously 
to 
future 
challenges. 
61. 
Nuclear 
technology 
was 
an 
invention 
of 
the 
20th 
century 
with 
far-reaching 
and 
historic 
consequences. 
It 
could 
be 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
such 
as 
energy 
generation, 
but 
also 
for 
weapons 
of 
destruction 
that 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
humanity. 
Even 
the 
so-called 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
raised 
problems, 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
responsibility 
was 
great. 
Moreover, 
people 
trusted 
in 
the 
Agency 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
agreements, 
treaties 
and 
regulations 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
energy. 
62. 
The 
50th 
anniversary 
and 
General 
Conference 
were 
taking 
place 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
Agency 
was 
receiving 
much 
international 
attention. 
The 
danger 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
at 
the 
forefront 
of 
political 
debate 
and 
was 
one 
of 
the 
great 
challenges 
facing 
the 
international 
community.

The 
Agency, 
which, 
in 
its 
early 
stages 
had 
been 
an 
organization 
primarily 
technical 
in 
nature, 
had 
become 
an 
important 
actor 
in 
a 
particularly 
sensitive 
political 
field. 


63. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
responsibilities 
under 
the 
NPT 
could 
not 
be 
overestimated 
in 
current 
times. 
The 
Agency 
fulfilled 
its 
mandate 
with 
a 
profound 
sense 
of 
responsibility, 
impartiality 
and 
professionalism, 
and 
those 
qualities 
had 
earned 
more 
than 
justified 
recognition, 
not 
least 
through 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
He 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
that 
exceptional 
honour 
which 
had 
been 
truly 
deserved. 
64. 
The 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
NPT, 
which 
formed 
the 
foundation 
of 
an 
edifice 
of 
multilateral 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
constructed 
over 
decades, 
was 
now 
being 
put 
to 
the 
test. 
Any 
form 
of 
further 
nuclear 
proliferation 
by 
States 
or 
non-State 
actors 
must 
be 
seen 
as 
weakening 
the 
central 
standard 
that 
was 
the 
NPT. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
failures 
to 
fulfil 
commitments 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
and 
the 
widespread 
feeling 
that 
the 
Treaty 
system 
was 
fundamentally 
inegalitarian, 
could 
not 
go 
unmentioned. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
the 
international 
community 
present 
a 
united 
front 
in 
the 
face 
of 
such 
developments, 
as 
a 
solution 
could 
only 
be 
found 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
broad 
consensus. 
65. 
Access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
becoming 
ever 
easier 
from 
a 
technical 
point 
of 
view. 
In 
contrast 
to 
the 
past, 
there 
were 
now 
a 
growing 
number 
of 
actors 
that 
had 
the 
technical 
capacity 
required 
to 
master 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
The 
political 
and 
legal 
barrier 
between 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
the 
development 
of 
a 
military 
nuclear 
programme 
on 
the 
other 
was 
becoming 
ever 
more 
significant 
in 
maintaining 
confidence 
in 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
control 
regime. 
Maintaining 
and 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
non-proliferation 
system 
should 
therefore 
be 
a 
common 
goal. 
66. 
Those 
States 
that 
wished 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes 
must 
be 
able 
to 
exercise 
that 
right; 
however, 
it 
should 
be 
done 
in 
a 
way 
that 
left 
no 
room 
for 
doubts 
regarding 
their 
underlying 
intentions. 
The 
role 
and 
responsibility 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
monitoring 
and 
evaluating 
in 
that 
regard 
was 
extremely 
extensive, 
and 
would 
expand 
further 
in 
the 
future. 
While 
it 
was 
his 
firm 
intention 
not 
to 
take 
sides, 
particularly 
since 
Austria 
did 
not 
even 
command 
the 
information 
required 
to 
formulate 
a 
detailed 
opinion, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
make 
several 
basic 
points. 
First, 
Austria 
strongly 
supported 
the 
position 
that 
the 
NPT 
must 
be 
complied 
with 
to 
the 
letter. 
Second, 
his 
country 
was 
convinced 
that 
in 
such 
a 
sensitive 
area 
maximum 
transparency 
really 
could 
and 
should 
be 
demanded. 
The 
Agency 
should 
be 
given 
all 
the 
information 
it 
had 
requested 
and 
all 
inspection 
possibilities, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
accurate 
and 
reliable 
judgements 
on 
which 
every 
individual 
Member 
State 
could 
rely 
without 
hesitation. 
Third, 
the 
path 
of 
negotiations 
should 
be 
fully 
exhausted; 
it 
would 
be 
mistaken 
to 
depart 
from 
an 
approach 
based 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
United 
Nations. 
The 
broader 
the 
consensus 
in 
the 
international 
community 
on 
such 
problems 
the 
better. 
The 
greater 
the 
readiness 
for 
fair, 
honest 
and 
serious 
negotiations, 
the 
broader 
the 
consensus 
would 
be. 
67. 
The 
many 
other 
aspects 
of 
the 
broad 
range 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
might 
perhaps 
have 
slipped 
somewhat 
from 
the 
forefront 
of 
public 
attention 
in 
the 
face 
of 
current 
developments. 
However, 
all 
pillars 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
Â 
verification, 
safety 
and 
technology 
Â 
remained 
equally 
valid 
and 
important. 
68. 
Austria 
had 
decided 
by 
a 
referendum 
against 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
electricity 
generation, 
and 
Austrians 
therefore 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
elaboration 
of 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
highest 
possible 
safety 
standards 
in 
that 
regard. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
fully 
the 
AgencyÂs 
ongoing, 
high-quality 
work 
in 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
field, 
and 
the 
achievements 
in 
the 
improvement 
of 
relevant 
standards. 
The 
Agency 
had 
made 
great 
strides 
over 
the 
last 
fifty 
years 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
activity, 
and 
could 
count 
on 
the 
respect 
and 
thanks 
of 
all 
Member 
States.

69. 
Austria 
was 
proud 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
and 
continued 
to 
make 
those 
achievements 
in 
Vienna. 
Since 
the 
Agency 
had 
established 
its 
Headquarters 
in 
Vienna, 
the 
city 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
duty 
stations 
for 
international 
organizations. 
Austria 
had 
much 
cause 
to 
be 
grateful 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
and 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
particular. 
He 
wished 
the 
Agency 
the 
greatest 
success 
in 
its 
future 
activities, 
in 
the 
interest 
of 
all, 
and 
the 
very 
best 
for 
the 
future. 
2. 
Applications 
for 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
(GC(50)/9, 
10, 
11 
and 
19) 


70. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
drew 
attention 
to 
documents 
GC(50)/9, 
GC(50)/19, 
GC(50)/10 
and 
GC(50)/11 
containing 
applications 
for 
membership 
by 
the 
Republic 
of 
Malawi, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Montenegro, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Mozambique 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Palau 
respectively. 
The 
four 
applications 
had 
been 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
which 
had 
also 
submitted 
four 
draft 
resolutions 
for 
adoption 
by 
the 
General 
Conference. 
71. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
the 
four 
draft 
resolutions. 
72. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
73. 
Mr. 
DOS 
SANTOS 
(Republic 
of 
Mozambique), 
speaking 
under 
Rule 
30, 
thanked 
delegations 
for 
their 
support 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
application 
for 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
assured 
them 
that 
the 
Republic 
of 
Mozambique 
intended 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations 
as 
a 
member 
and 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
purpose 
and 
principles 
of 
the 
Charter 
of 
the 
United 
Nations. 
74. 
It 
was 
a 
happy 
coincidence 
that 
his 
countryÂs 
application 
had 
been 
accepted 
in 
the 
year 
of 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
and 
it 
was 
relevant 
and 
appropriate 
to 
take 
stock 
of 
the 
Agency's 
achievements 
Â 
which 
had 
been 
recognized 
by 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
Â 
and 
to 
consider 
the 
possible 
constraints 
that 
the 
Agency 
might 
face 
in 
implementing 
its 
objectives 
in 
the 
future. 
The 
aims 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
set 
out 
over 
50 
years 
ago, 
and 
yet 
were 
even 
more 
valid 
at 
present, 
as 
technological 
breakthroughs 
in 
past 
years 
meant 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
used 
increasingly 
in 
applications 
all 
over 
the 
world, 
in 
areas 
of 
importance 
to 
development. 
75. 
He 
stressed 
the 
need 
to 
strengthen 
technical 
cooperation, 
and 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
in 
developing 
countries 
such 
as 
his 
own. 
Results 
would 
only 
be 
achieved 
when 
the 
technological 
gap 
between 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries 
was 
bridged, 
and 
when 
developing 
countries 
had 
full 
access 
to 
all 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
to 
eliminate 
the 
poverty 
and 
diseases 
which 
claimed 
millions 
of 
lives 
in 
Africa 
every 
year. 
76. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
entailed 
a 
number 
of 
special 
responsibilities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
his 
country 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
strict 
observance 
of 
safety 
standards.

7. 
Contributions 
to 
the 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Fund 
for 
2007 
(GC(50)/20) 


77. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that, 
pursuant 
to 
an 
agreement 
reached 
in 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2006, 
the 
Board 
had 
recommended 
a 
figure 
of 
US 
$80 
million 
as 
the 
target 
for 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
a 
table 
in 
the 
attachment 
to 
document 
GC(50)/20 
which 
showed 
the 
contributions 
that 
each 
Member 
State 
would 
need 
to 
make 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
its 
share 
of 
that 
target. 
78. 
The 
early 
pledging 
and 
payment 
of 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
greatly 
helped 
the 
Secretariat 
in 
planning 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
programmes. 
Delegations 
in 
a 
position 
to 
do 
so 
were 
therefore 
urged 
to 
notify 
the 
Secretariat 
during 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
current 
session 
of 
the 
contributions 
that 
their 
governments 
would 
be 
making 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007. 
79. 
He 
would 
report 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
session, 
under 
a 
later 
agenda 
item, 
on 
the 
contributions 
which 
had 
been 
pledged 
up 
to 
that 
time. 
He 
hoped 
to 
be 
able 
to 
report 
favourably 
on 
the 
percentage 
of 
the 
2007 
TCF 
target 
figure 
already 
pledged. 
8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(GC(50)/4) 


80. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
authorized 
him, 
under 
Rule 
50 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
to 
limit 
the 
duration 
of 
general 
debate 
statements 
to 
15 
minutes. 
81. 
It 
was 
so 
agreed. 
82. 
Mr. 
CANALES 
CLARIOND 
(Mexico) 
said 
that 
the 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
power 
being 
used 
for 
destructive 
purposes 
had 
rightly 
led 
to 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
He 
joined 
others 
in 
celebrating 
that 
historic 
event, 
with 
the 
renewed 
conviction 
that 
all 
members 
of 
the 
international 
community 
should 
continue 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
institutions 
that 
contributed 
to 
peace, 
such 
as 
the 
Agency. 
He 
thanked 
the 
host 
country, 
Austria, 
and 
its 
people 
for 
their 
support 
of 
the 
Agency. 
83. 
Mexico 
had 
been 
collaborating 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
since 
1958 
and 
fully 
shared 
its 
objectives 
and 
ideals, 
particularly 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
current 
threats 
facing 
the 
international 
community 
highlighted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
responsibility 
to 
continue 
working 
towards 
a 
safe 
world 
for 
all. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
had 
been 
the 
central 
objectives 
of 
MexicoÂs 
foreign 
policy 
for 
more 
than 
half 
a 
century. 
The 
complete 
and 
definitive 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
was 
the 
only 
effective 
way 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
proliferation. 
Mexico 
was 
a 
signatory 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
also 
a 
signatory, 
promoter 
and 
depository 
of 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty. 
Its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
had 
been 
in 
force 
since 
1973, 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
it 
had 
signed 
in 
March 
2004 
was 
ready 
for 
ratification. 
Mexico 
had 
also 
subscribed 
to 
the 
majority 
of 
international 
legal 
instruments 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
and 
was 
preparing 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention.

84. 
He 
expressed 
concern 
that 
disarmament 
was 
not 
being 
appropriately 
prioritized 
within 
the 
United 
Nations 
reform 
process; 
it 
had 
not 
been 
mentioned 
in 
the 
outcome 
document 
of 
the 
High-Level 
Plenary 
Meeting 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly 
in 
2005, 
or 
in 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
2005 
Review 
Conference 
of 
the 
Parties 
to 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Non-Proliferation 
of 
Nuclear 
Weapons. 
Over 
the 
previous 
ten 
years, 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
had 
not 
reached 
a 
consensus 
on 
its 
programme 
of 
work; 
nor 
had 
agreement 
been 
reached 
on 
a 
monitoring 
mechanism 
for 
the 
programme 
of 
action 
to 
prevent, 
combat 
and 
eradicate 
the 
illicit 
trade 
in 
small 
arms 
and 
light 
weapons. 
In 
addition, 
some 
States 
had 
experienced 
difficulties 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
timeframes 
established 
for 
destruction 
of 
their 
chemical 
arsenals. 
Accordingly, 
it 
was 
vital 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
and 
enable 
it 
to 
meet 
more 
efficiently 
its 
non-proliferation 
responsibilities, 
while 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
the 
good 
of 
humanity. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
concerning 
a 
multilateral 
mechanism 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel, 
without 
limiting 
the 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
the 
full 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
was 
interesting 
and 
should 
be 
carefully 
considered 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Board 
and 
subsequently 
the 
General 
Conference. 
85. 
Mexico 
was 
one 
of 
the 
33 
countries 
constructively 
using 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
twenty-five 
years 
of 
reactor 
experience 
had 
enabled 
his 
country 
to 
see 
first 
hand 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
power 
generation. 
For 
more 
than 
a 
hundred 
years, 
hydrocarbons 
had 
provided 
for 
unprecedented 
prosperity, 
opened 
markets 
and 
facilitated 
the 
movement 
of 
people 
by 
air, 
land 
and 
sea. 
Today, 
however, 
the 
circumstances 
were 
different. 
Environmental 
deterioration 
caused 
by 
the 
extraction, 
burning 
and 
processing 
of 
fossil 
fuels, 
and 
recurring 
difficulties 
in 
meeting 
the 
growing 
demand, 
presented 
serious 
challenges. 
A 
change 
of 
strategy 
to 
emphasize 
the 
large-scale 
use 
of 
alternative 
sources 
of 
energy 
and 
to 
modify 
consumer 
patterns 
was 
required. 
Nuclear 
power 
had 
a 
key 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
energy 
migration, 
as 
did 
renewable 
energy 
sources. 
86. 
Nuclear 
power 
plants 
guaranteed 
security 
and 
reliability 
of 
supply, 
two 
increasingly 
valued 
characteristics. 
Furthermore, 
it 
was 
estimated 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
fissionable 
material 
-uranium 
and 
thorium 
-was 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
global 
demand 
for 
several 
centuries 
to 
come. 
Mexico 
was 
therefore 
taking 
steps 
to 
increase 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
the 
national 
electricity 
grid, 
which 
currently 
had 
an 
installed 
capacity 
of 
49000 
MW(e) 
and 
was 
growing 
at 
a 
rate 
of 
5% 
per 
annum. 
The 
decision 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
expand 
MexicoÂs 
nuclear 
programme, 
and 
an 
ad 
hoc 
committee 
had 
already 
been 
set 
up 
to 
make 
the 
related 
technical 
decisions. 
In 
the 
short 
term, 
the 
capacity 
of 
the 
Laguna 
Verde 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
would 
be 
increased 
by 
19% 
to 
1629 
MW(e). 
In 
the 
medium 
term, 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support, 
Mexico 
would 
be 
carrying 
out 
the 
necessary 
studies 
to 
extend 
the 
operating 
licence 
of 
the 
Laguna 
Verde 
reactors, 
and 
implementing 
recommendations 
to 
improve 
the 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
87. 
Mr. 
BODMAN 
(United 
States 
of 
America) 
began 
his 
statement 
by 
reading 
out 
an 
excerpt 
from 
a 
message 
from 
President 
Bush: 
ÂMy 
Administration 
has 
announced 
a 
bold 
new 
proposal 
called 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership. 
We 
will 
work 
through 
that 
partnership 
with 
countries 
to 
meet 
their 
growing 
energy 
needs, 
dispose 
of 
waste 
safely, 
advance 
non-proliferation, 
and 
keep 
nuclear 
technology 
out 
of 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorist 
networks 
and 
terrorist 
States. 


ÂWe 
will 
encourage 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
countries 
that 
agree 
to 
forego 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
activities. 
Together, 
we 
can 
ensure 
that 
cheap, 
safe, 
and 
clean 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
benefits 
are 
enjoyed 
by 
all 
who 
are 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
non-
proliferation 
obligations." 


88. 
Turning 
to 
some 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
recent 
non-proliferation 
successes, 
he 
said 
that 
through 
close 
co-operation 
with 
Russia, 
the 
security 
for 
hundreds 
of 
metric 
tons 
of 
weapons-usable 
materials 
in

Russia 
had 
been 
strengthened 
and 
efforts 
to 
complete 
that 
work 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2008 
were 
on 
track. 
More 
than 
250 
metric 
tons 
of 
Russian 
highly 
enriched 
uranium 
had 
been 
blended 
down 
and 
sold 
as 
commercial 
fuel. 
Furthermore, 
plans 
to 
eliminate 
surplus 
United 
StatesÂ 
and 
Russian 
plutonium 
were 
continuing. 


89. 
The 
United 
States 
and 
Russia 
had 
recently 
announced 
the 
new 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
that 
built 
on 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
the 
recently 
amended 
CPPNM, 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
related 
instruments. 
The 
measures 
should 
be 
implemented 
fully 
in 
order 
to 
control 
proliferation 
and 
secure 
the 
safe 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
use 
worldwide. 
90. 
Under 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative, 
his 
country 
had 
recently 
worked 
with 
Russia 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
secure 
and 
return 
highly 
enriched 
uranium 
and 
other 
materials 
at 
risk 
from 
countries 
including 
Bulgaria, 
the 
Czech 
Republic, 
Latvia, 
Libya, 
Poland, 
Serbia 
and 
Uzbekistan. 
Efforts 
should 
be 
redoubled 
to 
secure 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
material 
and 
expand 
further 
cooperative 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
91. 
Although 
the 
world 
still 
relied 
primarily 
on 
coal, 
natural 
gas 
and 
oil 
to 
generate 
electrical 
power, 
nuclear 
energy 
provided 
a 
host 
of 
benefits 
that 
fossil 
fuels 
could 
not 
match. 
However, 
in 
order 
to 
realize 
the 
full 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
four 
basic 
conditions 
had 
to 
be 
met. 
First, 
nuclear 
power 
must 
be 
cost-competitive. 
In 
the 
United 
States, 
legislation 
had 
been 
enacted 
providing 
financing, 
as 
well 
as 
tax, 
insurance 
and 
licensing 
incentives 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
new 
facilities, 
and 
some 
27 
new 
reactors 
were 
now 
in 
various 
stages 
of 
planning 
and 
design. 
Second, 
nuclear 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel 
must 
be 
managed 
responsibly. 
The 
Department 
of 
Energy 
was 
pushing 
aggressively 
to 
open 
the 
Yucca 
Mountain 
Repository 
by 
2017, 
and 
the 
United 
States 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
by 
other 
nations 
such 
as 
Finland 
and 
Sweden 
with 
regard 
to 
geological 
repositories. 
Third, 
nuclear 
power 
must 
be 
safe, 
and 
the 
outstanding 
safety 
record 
over 
the 
previous 
twenty 
years 
must 
continue. 
Fourth, 
the 
firmest 
safeguards 
over 
nuclear 
materials 
must 
be 
maintained; 
any 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
must 
not 
result 
in 
additional 
States 
acquiring 
nuclear 
weapons. 
92. 
The 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership 
announced 
by 
President 
Bush 
in 
January 
would 
complement 
the 
proposal 
put 
forward 
by 
President 
Putin 
to 
establish 
international 
nuclear 
fuel 
service 
centres. 
Those 
plans, 
together 
with 
ideas 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
Agency, 
aimed 
to 
facilitate 
the 
global 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
to 
meet 
global 
energy 
needs, 
limit 
carbon 
emissions 
and 
reduce 
proliferation 
dangers. 
Through 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership, 
the 
United 
States 
was 
proposing 
the 
development 
and 
deployment 
of 
advanced 
technologies 
for 
recycling 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
that 
did 
not 
yield 
separated 
plutonium. 
It 
aimed 
to 
work 
with 
others 
to 
develop 
advanced, 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
appropriate 
for 
the 
power 
grids 
and 
needs 
of 
developing 
economies. 
Most 
critically, 
it 
hoped 
to 
cooperate 
with 
partners 
from 
nuclear 
supplier 
and 
recipient 
States 
to 
provide 
reliable 
fuel 
services 
on 
a 
competitive 
basis 
worldwide 
by 
assuring 
the 
supply 
and 
return 
of 
spent 
fuel 
for 
recycling 
to 
nations 
that 
agreed 
not 
to 
pursue 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
capabilities. 
93. 
An 
international 
framework 
for 
an 
assured 
fuel 
supply 
was 
critical 
in 
meeting 
the 
world's 
energy 
needs 
and 
in 
advancing 
non-proliferation 
goals, 
and 
the 
United 
States 
welcomed 
the 
special 
event 
concerning 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
to 
be 
held 
during 
the 
General 
Conference. 
His 
country 
intended 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
all 
other 
willing 
partners 
to 
create 
a 
framework 
for 
reliable 
fuel 
guarantees 
at 
fair 
market 
prices, 
and 
for 
the 
storage, 
transport 
and 
processing 
of 
spent 
fuel. 
It 
would 
also 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
promote 
dialogue 
between 
suppliers 
and 
recipients, 
foster 
acceptance 
of 
technological 
advances 
and 
help 
countries 
build 
the 
skills 
necessary 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
effectively. 
The 
United 
States 
was 
seeking 
mutually 
beneficial 
agreements 
with 
other 
like-
minded 
nations 
sharing 
its 
vision 
for 
a 
responsible, 
expanded 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy.

94. 
An 
assured 
fuel 
supply 
would 
increase 
considerably 
energy 
independence 
and 
thus 
the 
political 
and 
strategic 
independence 
of 
all 
nations, 
in 
particular 
the 
smaller 
ones. 
Accordingly, 
he 
called 
for 
the 
rapid 
adoption 
of 
the 
concept 
for 
a 
multilateral 
mechanism 
for 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
put 
forward 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
by 
France, 
Germany, 
the 
Netherlands, 
Russia, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America. 
95. 
Obstacles 
to 
the 
safe 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
remained. 
The 
defiance 
and 
violations 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
the 
DPRK, 
and 
risks 
of 
catastrophic 
nuclear 
terror 
must 
be 
addressed. 
All 
States 
must 
act 
decisively 
and 
responsibly 
to 
prevent 
proliferation 
and 
thwart 
terrorists 
bent 
on 
nuclear 
or 
radiological 
violence. 
96. 
In 
the 
fifty 
years 
since 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
founded 
great 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
In 
his 
opinion 
however, 
the 
next 
fifty 
years 
would 
be 
the 
real 
"nuclear 
age". 
Through 
continued 
progress 
in 
science 
and 
technology, 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
could 
be 
improved 
and 
the 
challenge 
of 
waste 
disposal 
solved. 
However, 
only 
through 
a 
global 
partnership 
benefiting 
the 
world's 
economies 
and 
the 
environment 
and 
limiting 
proliferation 
risks 
could 
the 
"Atoms 
for 
Peace" 
vision 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
founded 
to 
pursue 
be 
realized. 
97. 
Mr. 
TORSTILA 
(Finland), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
said 
that 
the 
acceding 
countries 
Bulgaria 
and 
Romania, 
the 
candidate 
countries 
Croatia, 
Turkey 
and 
the 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia, 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Stabilization 
and 
Association 
Process 
and 
potential 
candidates 
Albania, 
Bosnia 
and 
Herzegovina, 
and 
Serbia, 
the 
EFTA 
countries 
Iceland 
and 
Norway, 
members 
of 
the 
European 
Economic 
Area, 
as 
well 
as 
Moldova 
and 
Ukraine, 
associated 
themselves 
with 
the 
statement 
that 
he 
was 
about 
to 
make. 
98. 
On 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary, 
it 
was 
time 
to 
look 
back 
with 
appreciation 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accomplishments 
and 
reflect 
on 
the 
reasons 
why 
its 
work 
had 
become 
so 
important. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
worldÂs 
focal 
point 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety, 
and 
played 
an 
indispensable 
global 
role 
in 
preventing 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
countering 
new 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Its 
professional 
and 
impartial 
expertise 
was 
widely 
valued 
by 
all 
Member 
States. 
99. 
The 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
received 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
in 
2005 
was 
both 
the 
Âjewel 
in 
the 
crownÂ 
of 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
celebrations 
and 
a 
most 
remarkable 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements. 
The 
European 
Union 
wholeheartedly 
congratulated 
Dr. 
Mohamed 
ElBaradei 
and 
his 
staff 
on 
the 
award. 
100. 
The 
European 
Union 
continued 
to 
regard 
the 
NPT 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime, 
and 
Article 
IV 
as 
the 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
and 
an 
important 
element 
in 
further 
developing 
nuclear 
energy 
applications 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
It 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
three 
pillars 
on 
which 
it 
was 
based. 
101. 
Non-compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
safeguards 
obligations 
stemming 
from 
it 
was 
the 
most 
important 
non-proliferation 
challenge 
facing 
the 
international 
community. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
produce 
a 
consensus 
document 
on 
those 
and 
other 
issues. 
The 
European 
Union 
hoped 
that 
the 
next 
NPT 
review 
cycle 
would 
yield 
tangible 
results 
in 
all 
three 
areas 
of 
the 
NPT, 
which 
would 
help 
to 
reinforce 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
European 
UnionÂs 
common 
position 
adopted 
for 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
would 
continue 
to 
form 
the 
basis 
of 
its 
common 
approach 
for 
the 
forthcoming 
review 
cycle. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
first 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
of 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2007, 
which 
might 
take 
place 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
contributing 
actively 
to 
a 
successful 
outcome 
of 
that 
meeting.

102. 
As 
an 
important 
contribution 
to 
strengthening 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
the 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
had 
adopted 
a 
Strategy 
against 
the 
Proliferation 
of 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
in 
2003. 
The 
strengthening 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
multilateral 
non-
proliferation, 
arms 
control 
and 
disarmament 
treaties, 
and 
strict 
implementation 
and 
compliance 
with 
those 
instruments, 
were 
at 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
action. 
103. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
convinced 
that 
a 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
international 
security, 
including 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
was 
the 
best 
way 
to 
maintain 
peace 
and 
stability. 
It 
continued 
to 
work 
towards 
universal 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
called 
on 
those 
States 
not 
yet 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
join 
that 
Treaty 
as 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
The 
European 
Union 
also 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
in 
particular 
since 
2006 
marked 
the 
tenth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
TreatyÂs 
opening 
for 
signature. 
104. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
new 
momentum 
created 
in 
2006 
in 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
on 
starting 
negotiations 
on 
an 
FMCT, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
participation 
of 
Agency 
representatives 
in 
recent 
discussions 
in 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament. 
105. 
The 
European 
Union 
strongly 
supported 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Agency 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that, 
almost 
10 
years 
after 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
model 
additional 
protocol, 
105 
States 
had 
still 
not 
brought 
an 
additional 
protocol 
into 
force, 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
sign, 
ratify 
and 
implement 
an 
additional 
protocol 
without 
delay. 
The 
European 
Union 
also 
regretted 
that 
30 
States 
had 
yet 
to 
fulfil 
even 
their 
basic 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
to 
bring 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
the 
Agency 
into 
force. 
106. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
together 
with 
additional 
protocols 
constituted 
the 
current 
Agency 
verification 
standard 
and 
enabled 
the 
Agency 
to 
provide 
credible 
assurances 
of 
the 
non-
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
materials 
and 
activities 
within 
a 
State. 
The 
universalization 
of 
additional 
protocols 
would 
strengthen 
the 
international 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
security 
of 
all 
States. 
In 
addition, 
it 
would 
greatly 
increase 
the 
confidence 
necessary 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
107. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
repeatedly 
said 
that 
the 
model 
additional 
protocol 
must 
become 
the 
standard 
for 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
in 
order 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
fulfil 
its 
verification 
responsibilities 
in 
a 
credible 
manner. 
The 
time 
had 
come 
for 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
to 
recognize 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
as 
todayÂs 
Agency 
safeguards 
standard; 
a 
draft 
resolution 
would 
be 
submitted 
to 
the 
present 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
seeking 
to 
put 
that 
recommendation 
into 
effect. 
108. 
The 
conclusion 
by 
all 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
should 
be 
a 
priority 
for 
the 
international 
community 
as 
a 
whole, 
and 
would 
make 
a 
crucial 
contribution 
to 
an 
overall 
improvement 
in 
security 
and 
confidence 
in 
the 
region. 
The 
European 
Union 
called 
on 
all 
States 
in 
the 
region 
to 
make 
the 
Middle 
East 
into 
an 
effectively 
verifiable 
zone 
free 
from 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
delivery 
systems. 
109. 
The 
European 
Union 
commended 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
its 
efforts 
to 
encourage 
and 
facilitate 
the 
conclusion 
of 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
The 
European 
Union, 
for 
its 
part, 
promoted 
universalization 
in 
its 
relations 
with 
third 
countries, 
and 
provided 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
support 
to 
countries 
requiring 
assistance 
in 
concluding 
and 
implementing 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
110. 
The 
European 
Union 
remained 
seriously 
concerned 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
verify 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
the 
DPRK 
since 
December 
2002. 
It 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
comply 
with 
all 
its 

GC(50)/OR.1

international 
commitments 
fully, 
unconditionally 
and 
without 
delay, 
in 
particular 
with 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
under 
the 
NPT. 
The 
European 
Union 
called 
upon 
the 
DPRK 
to 
abandon 
and 
completely 
dismantle 
any 
programme 
related 
to 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner. 
It 
fully 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006), 
which 
strongly 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
immediately 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
precondition 
and 
implement 
the 
joint 
statement 
concluded 
in 
September 
2005. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
working 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
and 
negotiated 
settlement 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 


111. 
The 
European 
Union 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
seek 
clarification 
from 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
to 
verify 
that 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
took 
a 
serious 
view 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
assessment 
that, 
after 
nearly 
four 
years 
of 
intense 
inspections, 
the 
Agency 
remained 
unable 
to 
make 
further 
progress 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
verify 
the 
correctness 
and 
completeness 
of 
IranÂs 
declarations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
confirming 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
European 
Union 
fully 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006), 
which 
demanded 
that 
Iran 
suspend 
all 
enrichment-related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities, 
including 
research 
and 
development. 
Suspension 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
voluntary 
confidence-building 
measure, 
but 
an 
international 
obligation. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
fulfilled 
the 
obligations 
established 
by 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696, 
or 
taken 
the 
steps 
required 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Prompt 
and 
full 
compliance 
by 
Iran 
with 
the 
relevant 
international 
obligations 
and 
other 
requirements 
would 
facilitate 
negotiations 
for 
a 
diplomatic 
solution. 
The 
European 
Union 
once 
again 
encouraged 
Iran 
to 
engage 
positively 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
proposals 
made 
by 
six 
countries, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
European 
UnionÂs 
High 
Representative, 
for 
a 
long-term 
comprehensive 
arrangement, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
meetings 
between 
the 
High 
Representative 
and 
the 
Iranian 
chief 
nuclear 
negotiator. 
112. 
Nuclear 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
technologies 
were 
the 
subject 
of 
particular 
attention 
because 
of 
their 
potential 
military 
application. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
encourage 
access 
guarantees 
to 
nuclear 
fuel-related 
services 
or 
to 
the 
fuel 
itself, 
under 
appropriate 
conditions 
and 
on 
a 
voluntary 
basis, 
without 
unduly 
interfering 
with 
market 
mechanisms 
or 
conflicting 
with 
relevant 
international 
instruments. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
special 
event 
to 
be 
held 
during 
the 
present 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
participating 
in 
discussions 
on 
different 
proposals, 
such 
as 
a 
concept 
for 
a 
multilateral 
mechanism 
for 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel. 
113. 
Illicit 
trade 
in 
nuclear 
equipment 
and 
technology 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
serious 
concern. 
The 
European 
Union 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
efforts 
to 
investigate 
illicit 
trade 
patterns 
and 
fully 
endorsed 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
call 
for 
full 
cooperation 
from 
all 
States 
in 
identifying 
supply 
routes 
and 
sources 
of 
technology, 
equipment 
and 
materials. 
It 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
strong 
national 
and 
internationally 
coordinated 
export 
controls, 
notably 
in 
the 
NSG 
and 
the 
Zangger 
Committee, 
and 
welcomed 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
mandate 
of 
the 
committee 
established 
pursuant 
to 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
114. 
The 
European 
Union 
continued 
to 
attribute 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism, 
and 
strongly 
supported 
all 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear, 
biological, 
chemical 
and 
radiological 
weapons 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery, 
including 
the 
G8 
Global 
Partnership, 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative 
and 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative. 
It 
noted 
with 
interest 
the 
new 
global 
initiative 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
announced 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
in 
July 
2006, 
and 
supported 
efforts 
to 
minimize, 
wherever 
technically 
and 
economically 
feasible, 
the 
use 
of 
HEU 
in 
the 
civilian 
nuclear 
sector 
and 
to 
facilitate 
conversion 
to 
LEU. 
115. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
particularly 
through 
the 
NSF, 
to 
which 
the 
European 
Union 
was 
currently 
the 
largest 
donor. 
The 
European 
Union 
had 
recently 

GC(50)/OR.1

approved 
a 
Council 
Joint 
Action 
worth 
almost 
Â7 
million, 
to 
support 
Agency 
activities 
in 
partner 
countries. 


116. 
Effective 
physical 
protection 
was 
of 
paramount 
importance 
for 
preventing 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
ensuring 
protection 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
other 
malicious 
acts. 
The 
European 
Union 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
become 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
its 
amendment, 
and 
to 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
He 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
follow 
the 
example 
of 
the 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
declare 
their 
political 
commitment 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
implement 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
117. 
The 
current 
year 
marked 
the 
20th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident. 
The 
memory 
of 
the 
disaster 
and 
its 
consequences 
continued 
to 
keep 
the 
international 
community 
alert 
to 
enhancing 
safety 
in 
all 
nuclear 
facilities. 
The 
European 
Union 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide. 
Although 
safety 
was 
a 
national 
responsibility, 
it 
had 
implications 
beyond 
national 
boundaries, 
and 
international 
cooperation 
on 
the 
issue 
was 
indispensable. 
The 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
fostering 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime, 
and 
in 
particular, 
the 
efforts 
made 
in 
recent 
years 
to 
update 
and 
extend 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
to 
cover 
all-important 
thematic 
areas, 
facilities 
and 
activities. 
118. 
The 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
together 
with 
their 
peer 
review 
processes, 
constituted 
an 
important 
tool 
for 
establishing 
and 
maintaining 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
The 
European 
Union 
called 
on 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
those 
two 
Conventions 
and 
to 
apply 
the 
resulting 
obligations 
in 
full. 
119. 
It 
also 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
become 
contracting 
parties 
to 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention. 
The 
European 
Union 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
preparedness 
and 
response 
system, 
and 
encouraged 
all 
States 
to 
improve 
their 
national 
capabilities 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
emergencies. 
120. 
The 
global 
need 
for 
long-term 
and 
more 
environmentally 
friendly 
energy 
required 
a 
large 
increase 
in 
research 
efforts 
worldwide 
on 
energy 
sources 
to 
replace 
fossil 
fuels. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
a 
party 
to 
ITER, 
a 
major 
international 
scientific 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
project, 
and 
the 
experimental 
reactor 
would 
be 
sited 
at 
Cadarache, 
France. 
121. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
following 
closely 
the 
development 
of 
innovative 
projects 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles; 
26 
countries 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
were 
currently 
participating 
in 
INPRO. 
122. 
Enhanced 
coordination 
among 
the 
United 
Nations 
agencies 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
an 
effective 
and 
sustainable 
impact 
on 
human 
health, 
agricultural 
development, 
the 
environment, 
and 
other 
areas. 
The 
European 
Union 
endorsed 
the 
recommendation 
by 
the 
External 
Auditor 
that 
the 
Agency 
should 
embrace 
the 
objectives 
of 
UNDAF 
in 
order 
to 
bring 
greater 
coherence 
to 
United 
Nations 
programmes 
of 
assistance 
at 
the 
country 
level. 
A 
positive 
example 
of 
such 
enhanced 
coordination 
was 
PACT; 
the 
European 
Union 
welcomed 
the 
Secretariat's 
efforts 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
radio 
diagnosis 
and 
radiotherapy, 
to 
address 
the 
growing 
problem 
of 
cancer, 
particularly 
in 
developing 
countries. 
123. 
The 
European 
Union 
encouraged 
the 
many 
peaceful 
and 
beneficial 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
through 
multilateral 
and 
bilateral 
programmes. 
It 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
instruments 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
development, 
and 
attached 
importance 
to 
adequate 
financial 
and 
human 
resources 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
meet 
its 
responsibilities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
effectively.

124. 
Strong 
government 
commitment 
was 
also 
essential 
for 
successful 
technical 
cooperation. 
All 
projects 
should 
relate 
to 
national 
priorities, 
as 
defined 
in 
CPFs, 
and 
he 
encouraged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
ensure 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
funds 
were 
spent 
first 
and 
foremost 
in 
developing 
countries 
that 
had 
actually 
contributed 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
did 
not 
have 
any 
NPC 
arrears. 
125. 
The 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
technology, 
equipment 
and 
materials 
could 
only 
take 
place 
in 
an 
environment 
in 
which 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
as 
well 
as 
security, 
were 
ensured. 
The 
European 
Union 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
education 
and 
training 
programmes, 
which 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
updating 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
in 
both 
developing 
and 
developed 
countries. 
126. 
The 
Agency 
must 
have 
the 
financial 
and 
human 
resources 
necessary 
to 
accomplish 
its 
statutory 
tasks. 
The 
25 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
provided 
a 
substantial 
part 
of 
the 
Regular 
Budget, 
and 
a 
significant 
share 
of 
voluntary 
contributions. 
All 
States 
should 
pay 
their 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time, 
and 
contribute 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
127. 
The 
Agency 
was 
held 
in 
high 
regard 
and 
was 
widely 
seen 
as 
a 
well 
run 
and 
dynamic 
organization. 
Much 
of 
the 
credit 
was 
due 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
staff. 
The 
European 
Union 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
Agency, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
Medium 
Term 
Strategy 
for 
2006Â2011. 
128. 
Mr. 
AGHAZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
one 
of 
the 
topics 
of 
the 
Conference 
was 
utilization 
of 
atomic 
energy 
in 
the 
21st 
century 
and 
supply 
and 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
fuel; 
the 
topic 
had 
been 
discussed 
on 
many 
occasions 
during 
the 
previous 
three 
decades, 
but 
no 
tangible 
result 
had 
ever 
been 
arrived 
at. 
Some 
progress 
had 
now 
been 
made, 
but 
there 
was 
still 
no 
hope 
of 
a 
final 
achievement, 
as 
many 
Member 
States 
remained 
sceptical 
because 
the 
intentions 
and 
objectives 
of 
the 
issueÂs 
proponents 
were 
still 
ambiguous 
and 
questionable. 
There 
was 
still 
a 
lack 
of 
confidence 
and 
trust 
regarding 
what 
was 
on 
the 
table 
and 
what 
remained 
hidden. 
The 
reason 
should 
be 
sought 
in 
the 
approach 
and 
conduct 
of 
certain 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
vis-Ã -vis 
the 
rights 
and 
obligations 
of 
Member 
States. 
129. 
At 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
1995, 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
had 
misled 
the 
non-nuclear-
weapon 
States 
into 
accepting 
an 
unlimited 
extension 
of 
the 
NPT 
by 
making 
promises 
and 
undertaking 
commitments 
on 
a 
superficial 
level. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
most 
of 
the 
developing 
countries 
were 
sceptical 
as 
to 
the 
goodwill 
of 
those 
countries, 
since 
the 
25-year 
history 
of 
the 
NPT 
had 
been 
full 
of 
failures 
in 
their 
commitments. 
For 
that 
reason, 
the 
extension 
had 
been 
adopted 
conditionally, 
as 
reflected 
in 
the 
statements 
and 
formal 
reservations 
by 
the 
majority 
of 
States 
parties. 
It 
was 
profoundly 
regrettable 
that 
after 
only 
a 
short 
period 
it 
had 
become 
clear 
that 
their 
pessimism 
was 
not 
without 
justification. 
130. 
The 
commitments 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament 
had 
been 
breached 
on 
a 
regular 
basis, 
and 
in 
some 
cases 
had 
even 
been 
reversed. 
The 
NPTÂs 
universality 
had 
become 
meaningless 
by 
the 
implicit 
recognition 
of 
some 
emerging 
nuclear 
weapons 
capabilities. 
Israeli 
nuclear 
weapons 
had 
continued 
to 
be 
ambiguous, 
and 
there 
had 
been 
no 
intention 
to 
dismantle 
them. 
Countries 
outside 
the 
NPT 
had 
been 
rewarded 
by 
access 
to 
nuclear 
equipment, 
capabilities 
and 
materials 
and 
by 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
cooperation. 
In 
contrast, 
the 
majority 
of 
parties 
had 
continued 
to 
be 
deprived 
of 
peaceful 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
restrictions 
had 
not 
been 
reduced; 
instead 
they 
had 
been 
increased. 
It 
had 
come 
as 
no 
surprise, 
therefore, 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
totally 
failed. 
The 
responsibility 
for 
those 
failures 
rested 
fully 
on 
the 
shoulders 
of 
those 
nuclear 
States 
that 
had 
ignored 
their 
undertakings 
under 
the 
previous 
NPT 
Review 
Conferences. 
131. 
Against 
that 
background, 
there 
was 
serious 
concern 
over 
the 
hidden 
and 
transparent 
measures 
and 
attempts 
aimed 
at 
depriving 
other 
countries 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
production 
capability 
and 
its 
related 
technology. 
The 
attempts 
could 
be 
deceiving 
and 
misleading, 
as 
it 
was 
said 
that 
nuclear 
fuel

capabilities 
would 
be 
tantamount 
to 
a 
capability 
for 
diversion 
from 
peaceful 
purposes. 
It 
was 
therefore 
argued 
that 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
a 
few 
countries 
-including 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
and 
those 
that 
had 
rejected 
the 
NPT 
-others 
must 
accept 
a 
denial 
of 
their 
inalienable 
rights. 
Determined 
efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
turn 
the 
NPT, 
which 
had 
been 
founded 
on 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
peaceful 
cooperation 
and 
non-proliferation, 
into 
a 
unipolar 
Treaty 
resting 
on 
the 
single 
column 
of 
non-
proliferation. 
That 
approach 
would 
lead 
only 
to 
the 
fragility 
and 
vulnerability 
of 
the 
NPT. 


132. 
It 
was 
now 
generally 
agreed 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
constitute 
the 
main 
part 
of 
the 
global 
energy 
mix 
in 
the 
coming 
decades, 
so 
that 
achieving 
the 
capability 
for 
fuel 
production 
would 
be 
critical 
for 
developing 
countries. 
The 
reduction 
or 
removal 
of 
restrictions 
on 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactors 
was 
not 
very 
significant; 
what 
was 
essential 
was 
the 
ability 
to 
produce 
oneÂs 
own 
nuclear 
fuel, 
and 
not 
be 
dependent 
on 
others. 
That 
was 
why 
developed 
countries, 
except 
those 
restricted 
by 
their 
environmental 
policies, 
were 
determined 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
enrichment, 
and 
continued 
to 
invest 
in 
and 
subsidize 
that 
technology 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
lack 
of 
economic 
justification 
and 
even 
the 
loss 
of 
profit 
by 
their 
companies 
involved 
in 
nuclear 
fuel 
production. 
In 
other 
words, 
since 
they 
had 
the 
capability 
to 
produce 
the 
atomic 
bomb 
they 
had 
permission 
to 
have 
nuclear 
fuel 
capability. 
With 
the 
same 
logic 
they 
would 
permit 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
that 
had 
rejected 
the 
NPT 
to 
produce 
nuclear 
fuel. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
other 
developing 
countries 
that 
had 
joined 
the 
NPT 
and 
rejected 
nuclear 
weapons 
must 
not 
pursue 
nuclear 
fuel 
production 
since 
it 
might 
be 
diverted 
to 
prohibited 
purposes. 
It 
was 
a 
strange 
form 
of 
logic. 
133. 
The 
developing 
countries 
should 
not 
neglect 
the 
fact 
that 
developed 
countries 
were 
seeking 
to 
create 
a 
monopoly 
on 
the 
production 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
Â 
a 
strategic 
and 
critical 
commodity. 
That 
monopoly 
should 
not 
be 
accepted. 
Restricting 
or 
prohibiting 
Member 
States, 
not 
only 
Iran, 
from 
exercising 
their 
inalienable 
rights 
to 
develop 
and 
pursue 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
was 
not 
acceptable. 
Before 
the 
gap 
within 
the 
NPT 
and 
among 
the 
AgencyÂs 
members 
widened 
and 
before 
the 
positions 
of 
the 
two 
sides 
were 
further 
polarized, 
that 
devastating 
process 
must 
stop. 
Over 
the 
past 
three 
years, 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
had 
been 
in 
the 
forefront 
of 
such 
issues, 
and 
if 
it 
withdrew 
from 
its 
position 
they 
would 
apply 
that 
as 
a 
model 
to 
other 
developing 
countries. 
For 
that 
reason 
they 
had 
spared 
no 
efforts 
in 
intimidating 
and 
threatening 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
At 
the 
recently 
concluded 
14th 
summit 
meeting 
of 
the 
NAM, 
held 
in 
Havana, 
Cuba, 
the 
116 
Heads 
of 
State 
and 
Government 
of 
the 
NAM 
countries 
had 
unanimously 
reaffirmed 
the 
basic 
and 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
develop, 
research, 
produce, 
and 
utilize 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
any 
discrimination 
and 
in 
conformity 
with 
their 
respective 
legal 
obligations, 
and 
that 
the 
choices 
and 
decisions 
of 
States 
in 
the 
field 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
its 
fuel 
cycle 
must 
be 
respected. 
The 
Iranian 
people 
and 
Government 
expressed 
their 
sincere 
appreciation 
for 
the 
valuable 
support 
of 
the 
NAM 
over 
the 
past 
three 
years. 
134. 
The 
BoardÂs 
decision 
to 
convey 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
issue 
to 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
had 
no 
legal 
basis 
and 
was 
in 
contradiction 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
its 
practice. 
How 
could 
a 
programme 
be 
considered 
a 
Âthreat 
against 
international 
peace 
and 
securityÂ 
and 
conveyed 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
when 
the 
Agency, 
after 
three 
years 
of 
intrusive 
and 
robust 
inspection 
and 
investigation, 
had 
not 
found 
any 
evidence 
of 
diversion 
to 
prohibited 
purposes? 
More 
surprising 
still 
had 
been 
that 
the 
Board 
should 
have 
changed 
the 
voluntary 
and 
non-legally 
binding 
measure 
to 
a 
mandatory 
obligation; 
without 
doubt 
that 
signalled 
a 
new 
trend 
and 
constituted 
a 
deplorable 
precedent 
in 
the 
history 
of 
the 
Agency. 
135. 
The 
overwhelming 
legal 
opinion 
of 
renowned 
international 
jurists 
asserted 
that 
the 
Board 
was 
not 
empowered 
to 
make 
such 
a 
judgement 
or 
to 
act 
beyond 
its 
statutory 
mandate. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
therefore 
had 
no 
legal 
obligation 
to 
accept 
such 
demands. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
purpose 
and 
function 
was 
both 
to 
safeguard 
and 
to 
facilitate 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities; 
the 
two 
were 
intertwined. 
If 
it 
were 
not 
able 
to 
live 
up 
to 
its 
commitments 
vis-Ã -vis 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran, 
and 
restricted

IranÂs 
access 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
undermined 
its 
inalienable 
rights, 
the 
Agency 
would 
be 
in 
breach 
of 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
Statute 
and 
the 
bilateral 
safeguards 
agreement. 
In 
such 
a 
case, 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
would 
also 
have 
no 
legal 
obligation 
towards 
the 
Agency. 
There 
should 
also 
be 
no 
doubt 
that 
any 
hostile 
action 
by 
the 
Security 
Council 
would 
lead 
to 
a 
limitation 
of 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Such 
a 
unilateral 
approach 
aggressively 
pursued 
by 
one 
or 
two 
States 
was 
bound 
to 
cause 
loss 
and 
damage 
to 
all. 


136. 
Achieving 
a 
solution 
was 
by 
no 
means 
beyond 
reach. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
believed 
that 
an 
agreement 
could 
be 
reached 
through 
negotiations, 
relying 
on 
good 
faith, 
political 
will 
and 
flexibility. 
His 
country 
was 
prepared 
for 
negotiations 
and 
a 
political 
compromise, 
and 
believed 
that 
a 
peaceful 
solution 
of 
the 
issue 
through 
political 
understanding 
would 
pave 
the 
way 
for 
more 
significant 
and 
extended 
agreements, 
reducing 
and 
removing 
the 
tensions, 
and 
bringing 
stability 
to 
the 
region. 
To 
that 
end, 
his 
country 
had 
received 
the 
EU-3 
package 
proposal 
and, 
despite 
all 
its 
ambiguities 
and 
shortcomings, 
had 
considered 
it 
a 
step 
forward. 
After 
an 
in-depth 
study 
by 
Iranian 
experts, 
a 
comprehensive 
response 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
IranÂs 
counterparts 
on 
the 
announced 
date 
of 
22 
August 
2006, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
paving 
the 
way 
for 
discussions 
and 
negotiations 
to 
achieve 
a 
comprehensive 
agreement. 
137. 
He 
said 
that 
the 
intentions 
of 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
were 
exclusively 
peaceful; 
it 
had 
no 
intention 
of 
violating 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT; 
it 
was 
prepared 
to 
maintain 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
under 
the 
surveillance 
of 
the 
Agency; 
it 
had 
accepted 
the 
Agency 
inspections 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
which 
was 
implemented 
on 
a 
routine 
basis; 
it 
was 
prepared 
to 
accept 
any 
partnership 
in 
its 
nuclear 
fuel 
production 
programme 
with 
any 
country 
that 
was 
interested; 
it 
believed 
in 
regional 
cooperation 
on 
its 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-
weapon-free 
zone; 
and 
it 
was 
against 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
was 
seeking 
their 
total 
elimination 
in 
the 
region 
and 
the 
world. 
The 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
opted 
for 
conciliation, 
and 
hoped 
that 
logic 
would 
gradually 
prevail 
over 
force 
and 
that 
compromise 
would 
overcome 
hostility 
and 
confrontation. 
138. 
Mr. 
MATSUDA 
(Japan), 
welcoming 
Malawi, 
Montenegro, 
Mozambique 
and 
Palau 
as 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
congratulating 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
said 
that 
his 
country, 
as 
the 
only 
one 
to 
have 
suffered 
atomic 
bombings, 
once 
again 
called 
upon 
all 
countries 
to 
demonstrate 
their 
firm 
determination 
to 
realize 
a 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
world 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Japan 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
closely 
with 
it 
in 
various 
areas; 
as 
part 
of 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary 
celebrations, 
Japan 
would 
be 
hosting 
an 
Agency 
symposium 
on 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
April 
2007. 
139. 
In 
recent 
years, 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
been 
re-evaluated 
and 
the 
momentum 
for 
the 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
grown 
across 
the 
globe. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
needed 
to 
be 
promoted 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
fully 
took 
into 
account 
non-proliferation, 
safety 
and 
security. 
From 
that 
perspective, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
had 
become 
even 
more 
important. 
140. 
In 
October 
2005, 
Japan 
had 
announced 
its 
framework 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
policy. 
Having 
identified 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
key 
source 
of 
electricity, 
Japan 
was 
seeking 
to 
establish 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
strictly 
limiting 
its 
use 
to 
peaceful 
purposes. 
It 
would 
be 
promoting 
research 
and 
development 
of 
fast 
breeder 
reactor 
cycle 
technology, 
and 
was 
prepared 
to 
share 
results 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
141. 
The 
international 
community 
needed 
to 
reinforce 
the 
NPT 
regime, 
which 
remained 
under 
strain 
with 
such 
challenges 
as 
the 
nuclear 
issues 
of 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
Efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
needed 
to 
be 
redoubled. 
Japan 
welcomed 
the 
various 
proposals 
that 
had 
been 
made 
to 
reinforce 
the 
NPT 
regime, 
but 
bringing 
them 
forward 
was 
a 
challenging 
yet 
important 
task. 
Consideration 
had 
to 
be 
given 
to 
how 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of

nuclear 
energy 
while 
ensuring 
consistency 
with 
non-proliferation 
requirements, 
notably 
such 
questions 
as 
whether 
the 
right 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
would 
not 
be 
unduly 
restricted, 
and 
whether 
an 
additional 
burden 
would 
not 
be 
imposed 
on 
those 
countries 
that 
fully 
complied 
with 
relevant 
international 
rules. 


142. 
The 
assurance 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
was 
the 
most 
pressing 
issue 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
addressed. 
At 
the 
session 
of 
the 
Board 
in 
June 
2006, 
a 
six-nation 
initiative 
concerning 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
had 
been 
brought 
to 
the 
attention 
of 
Member 
States. 
Japan 
was 
proposing 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
Agency 
standby 
arrangements 
system 
for 
the 
assurance 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
complementing 
the 
six-nation 
initiative. 
The 
system 
covered 
not 
only 
uranium 
enrichment 
but 
also 
all 
phases 
of 
the 
whole 
front-end 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
so 
that 
many 
countries 
would 
be 
allowed 
to 
participate 
and 
to 
make 
contributions. 
Japan 
would 
play 
its 
part 
in 
securing 
the 
smooth 
launching 
of 
the 
preparatory 
process 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
due 
to 
commence 
in 
2007 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ensuring 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
success. 
143. 
While 
the 
nuclear 
issues 
of 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
remained 
as 
matters 
of 
immediate 
and 
grave 
concern, 
the 
Libyan 
Arab 
JamahiriyaÂs 
decision 
to 
abandon 
its 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
had 
set 
a 
good 
precedent, 
and 
it 
was 
important 
that 
the 
international 
community 
make 
a 
positive 
response. 
It 
should 
demonstrate 
the 
benefits 
of 
a 
strategic 
decision 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
international 
community 
and 
to 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
mainstream, 
and 
should 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
extend 
cooperation 
to 
Libya 
so 
that 
that 
country 
could 
become 
a 
role 
model 
for 
others. 
144. 
Nearly 
a 
year 
had 
passed 
since 
the 
six-party 
talks 
had 
adopted 
the 
joint 
statement 
in 
which 
the 
DPRK 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
abandoning 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes. 
As 
had 
been 
clearly 
stated 
in 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006), 
the 
international 
community 
had 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
immediately 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
precondition 
and 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
expeditious 
implementation 
of 
the 
joint 
statement. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
also 
respond 
to 
other 
security 
and 
humanitarian 
concerns, 
including 
early 
resolution 
of 
the 
abduction 
issue. 
The 
DPRKÂs 
multiple 
launches 
of 
ballistic 
missiles 
in 
July 
2006 
were 
closely 
related 
to 
the 
nuclear 
issue, 
given 
the 
potential 
of 
such 
systems 
to 
be 
used 
as 
a 
means 
of 
WMD 
delivery. 
They 
were 
a 
matter 
of 
grave 
concern 
to 
the 
security 
of 
Japan 
and 
to 
the 
peace 
and 
security 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
as 
well 
as 
from 
the 
perspective 
of 
non-proliferation 
of 
WMDs. 
Furthermore, 
it 
was 
a 
deplorable 
act 
that 
impeded 
the 
efforts 
by 
the 
countries 
concerned 
for 
the 
resumption 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
Japan 
was 
determined 
to 
strive 
for 
the 
steady 
implementation 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695. 
145. 
Turning 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue, 
he 
said 
that 
it 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
been 
continuing 
uranium 
enrichment 
in 
defiance 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006). 
The 
issue 
was 
not 
about 
whether 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
had 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes; 
what 
was 
important 
was 
that 
that 
right 
could 
only 
be 
exercised 
on 
the 
premise 
that 
Iran 
restore 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
international 
community 
that 
had 
been 
lost 
because 
of 
its 
past 
activities. 
Japan 
supported 
the 
comprehensive 
proposals 
presented 
by 
the 
EU-3, 
China, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
and 
strongly 
urged 
Iran 
to 
accept 
the 
Security 
Council 
resolution, 
immediately 
suspend 
uranium 
enrichment-related 
activities 
and 
return 
to 
the 
negotiation 
table. 
146. 
It 
was 
imperative 
that 
the 
international 
community 
collectively 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
security 
in 
order 
to 
counter 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Japan 
had 
been 
conducting 
intensive 
consultations 
domestically 
for 
the 
early 
conclusion 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
their 
early 
entry 
into 
force. 
Japan 
would 
be 
hosting 
an 
Agency 
seminar 
on 
nuclear 
security, 
including 
the 
issue 
of 
smooth 
implementation 
of 
those 
Conventions, 
in 
Tokyo 
in 
November. 
Japan 
welcomed 
the 
Global 
Initiative 
to 
Combat 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
announced 
by 
Presidents 
Bush 
and 
Putin 
on 
15 
July 
2006, 
which, 
it 
believed, 
would 
help 
strengthen 
measures 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism.

147. 
Japan 
attached 
significance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
and 
had 
been 
making 
a 
considerable 
contribution 
to 
the 
Regional 
Cooperative 
Agreement 
for 
Research, 
Development 
and 
Training. 
Japan 
was 
also 
one 
of 
the 
few 
Member 
States 
to 
have 
continuously 
contributed 
100% 
of 
its 
share 
to 
the 
TCF 
despite 
tight 
budgetary 
constraints. 
It 
strongly 
encouraged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
share 
of 
the 
target 
in 
full 
and 
without 
delay, 
and 
urged 
recipient 
countries 
to 
fulfil 
their 
shared 
responsibilities. 
The 
Forum 
for 
Nuclear 
Cooperation 
in 
Asia 
was 
a 
framework 
that 
had 
promoted 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
Asia, 
and 
a 
similar 
forum 
could 
be 
beneficial 
to 
achieving 
the 
same 
objective 
in 
other 
regions 
such 
as 
Africa. 
Japan 
would 
like 
to 
extend 
its 
support 
through 
the 
Agency 
framework, 
and 
work 
towards 
strengthening 
such 
regional 
forums. 
Innovative 
technologies 
should 
be 
applied 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
Japan 
would 
spare 
no 
efforts 
in 
supporting 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
respect. 
148. 
In 
order 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
ensuring 
safety 
was 
the 
fundamental 
precondition. 
In 
particular, 
it 
was 
useful 
to 
conduct 
policy 
dialogue 
and 
a 
peer 
review 
among 
high-
level 
officials 
of 
regulatory 
authorities 
of 
countries 
with 
advanced 
nuclear 
safety 
regulations. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Japan 
was 
planning 
to 
receive 
an 
IRRS 
in 
2007 
in 
cooperation 
with 
relevant 
countries, 
and 
would 
like 
to 
encourage 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
receive 
such 
a 
service 
in 
order 
to 
enhance 
nuclear 
safety. 
149. 
The 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
was 
essential 
for 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Japan 
was 
willing 
to 
maintain 
dialogue 
between 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
States, 
aimed 
at 
improving 
mutual 
understanding 
and 
building 
confidence. 
Japan 
had 
found 
very 
useful 
the 
TranSAS 
mission 
that 
had 
been 
conducted 
in 
Japan 
in 
2005, 
and 
had 
verified 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
JapanÂs 
regulatory 
practices 
in 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
materials. 
150. 
There 
was 
no 
doubt 
that 
sufficient 
financial 
resources 
were 
necessary 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
play 
its 
expected 
role. 
In 
preparing 
the 
2008-2009 
programme 
and 
budget 
proposals, 
however, 
the 
Secretariat 
should 
pay 
due 
consideration 
to 
the 
budgetary 
situation 
of 
Member 
States 
and 
should 
continue 
its 
efforts 
towards 
improving 
efficiency 
in 
budget 
management 
through 
prioritization 
of 
projects 
and 
reduction 
of 
costs. 
151. 
Mr. 
KIM 
Woo 
Sik 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
said 
that 
as 
a 
clean 
and 
low-cost 
energy 
source, 
nuclear 
energy 
met 
16% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
electricity 
demand. 
Furthermore, 
nuclear 
technology 
contributed 
not 
only 
to 
the 
wellbeing 
of 
human 
society, 
but 
also 
to 
environmental 
preservation 
and 
scientific 
development. 
His 
countryÂs 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
contribution 
to 
world 
peace 
and 
human 
security 
through 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
152. 
Having 
fulfilled 
a 
pivotal 
role 
for 
the 
last 
five 
decades, 
the 
Agency 
was 
facing 
new 
challenges, 
with 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
demand 
expected 
to 
double 
by 
2050. 
Oil 
prices 
were 
soaring 
as 
demand 
shot 
up 
and 
fossil 
fuels 
were 
depleting 
rapidly. 
The 
new 
mission 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
to 
maximize 
the 
contribution 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
serious 
problems 
the 
world 
was 
facing 
such 
as 
global 
warming, 
environmental 
destruction, 
water 
and 
food 
shortages, 
cancer 
and 
AIDS. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
securing 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
protecting 
humanity 
against 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
war 
should 
also 
be 
regarded 
more 
seriously. 
153. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
was 
one 
of 
the 
biggest 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
had 
a 
history 
of 
rapid, 
yet 
secure, 
growth 
on 
nuclear 
programmes 
with 
Agency 
assistance. 
In 
addition 
to 
technological 
development, 
it 
was 
finding 
ways 
of 
managing 
nuclear 
waste 
and 
appropriate 
sites. 
Such 
action 
helped 
to 
resolve 
public 
concerns, 
and 
his 
country 
would 
be 
willing 
to 
share 
its 
experience 
in 
that 
regard. 
154. 
Due 
to 
its 
limited 
natural 
resources, 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
had, 
in 
the 
past, 
had 
to 
rely 
heavily 
on 
imported 
fossil 
fuels 
to 
generate 
electricity. 
Over 
the 
years 
it 
had 
decreased 
its 
dependency 
on 
oil,

and 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
a 
natural 
choice 
as 
it 
offered 
a 
low-cost, 
stable 
energy 
supply. 
His 
country 
now 
operated 
one 
of 
the 
most 
active 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
the 
world, 
with 
20 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
supplying 
40% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
electricity. 
In 
the 
past, 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
had 
been 
brought 
in 
from 
the 
United 
States, 
but 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
was 
now 
supplying 
main 
components 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
such 
as 
the 
steam 
generator, 
to 
the 
United 
States. 


155. 
Based 
on 
technology 
transferred 
from 
partner 
states, 
his 
country 
had 
designed 
and 
built 
six 
1000 
MW(e) 
LWRs. 
It 
had 
also 
developed 
a 
new 
1400 
MW(e) 
reactor 
with 
significantly 
improved 
safety 
and 
economic 
efficiency, 
and 
an 
application 
for 
a 
construction 
permit 
for 
that 
reactor 
was 
currently 
being 
reviewed. 
156. 
His 
country 
had 
been 
participating 
actively 
in 
the 
development 
of 
future 
nuclear 
energy 
systems 
in 
projects 
such 
as 
the 
GIF, 
and 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
GIF 
would 
provide 
advanced 
nuclear 
energy 
systems 
with 
enhanced 
cost-efficiency, 
sustainability, 
safety 
and 
nuclear 
proliferation-resistance 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
His 
Government 
welcomed 
China 
and 
Russia 
on 
board 
and 
hoped 
that 
they 
would 
take 
an 
active 
part 
in 
GIF 
development. 
157. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
welcomed 
the 
successful 
conclusion 
of 
Phase 
I 
of 
INPRO. 
Phase 
II 
was 
now 
underway, 
and 
he 
hoped 
that 
the 
activities 
of 
GIF 
and 
INPRO 
would 
come 
together 
in 
harmony 
to 
ensure 
the 
successful 
development 
of 
an 
innovative 
system. 
158. 
The 
ITER 
project 
represented 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
making 
fusion 
a 
viable 
energy 
source. 
He 
hoped 
that 
ITER 
members 
would 
pay 
more 
attention 
to 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
of 
future 
fusion 
facilities, 
such 
as 
demonstration 
and 
commercial 
plants, 
and 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
take 
a 
leading 
role 
in 
developing 
safety 
principles, 
guidelines 
and 
technical 
standards 
for 
fusion 
systems. 
159. 
The 
four 
principles 
on 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
announced 
in 
2004 
had 
become 
the 
main 
priority 
of 
Korean 
nuclear 
policies. 
In 
accordance 
with 
its 
policy 
of 
expanding 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
his 
Government 
was 
setting 
up 
a 
five-year 
plan 
that 
included 
various 
programmes 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
nuclear 
energy 
systems, 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
environmental 
preservation. 
It 
was 
also 
establishing 
seven 
regional 
cyclotron 
centres 
throughout 
the 
country 
in 
order 
to 
extend 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
medicine. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
various 
types 
of 
research 
were 
underway 
to 
apply 
radiation 
technology 
in 
fields 
including 
the 
environment, 
biotechnology, 
food 
engineering, 
life 
science, 
agriculture 
and 
the 
aerospace 
industry. 
160. 
A 
system-integrated 
modular 
advanced 
reactor 
used 
for 
both 
desalination 
and 
power 
generation 
was 
also 
being 
developed. 
As 
water 
shortage 
was 
a 
problem 
for 
a 
considerable 
number 
of 
Member 
States, 
the 
Agency 
should 
expand 
programmes 
to 
facilitate 
the 
exchange 
of 
information 
on 
small-sized 
reactors 
for 
desalination. 
161. 
Safety 
was 
the 
most 
important 
factor 
in 
any 
nuclear 
programme, 
and 
his 
Government 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
meet 
the 
highest 
standards 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
by 
complying 
strictly 
with 
international 
frameworks 
such 
as 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention. 
As 
the 
importance 
of 
safety 
standards 
in 
promoting 
nuclear 
safety 
continued 
to 
increase, 
his 
country 
would 
join 
efforts 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
regulation 
technology. 
162. 
Building 
a 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facility 
was 
a 
major 
problem 
for 
all 
Member 
States, 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
was 
no 
exception. 
His 
country 
had 
designated 
a 
site 
suitable 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
low-and 
medium-level 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facility 
after 
a 
long 
and 
challenging 
process, 
and 
hoped 
to 
share 
its 
experience 
with 
other 
Member 
States. 
163. 
The 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
should 
be 
based 
on 
compliance 
with 
the 
NPT 
and 
transparency 
in 
nuclear 
programmes. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
and 
materials 
that 
might 
be 
misused.

164. 
In 
order 
to 
reinforce 
the 
national 
nuclear 
control 
system, 
his 
country 
had 
established 
the 
Korea 
Institute 
of 
Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation 
and 
Control 
in 
2006, 
as 
an 
independent 
organization 
in 
charge 
of 
the 
SSAC. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
it 
was 
promoting 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
apply 
integrated 
safeguards. 
165. 
Achieving 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
to 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
in 
the 
DPRK 
through 
diplomatic 
means 
was 
vital 
to 
ensure 
lasting 
peace 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
the 
promotion 
of 
peace 
and 
prosperity 
in 
North-East 
Asia. 
His 
Government 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
at 
an 
early 
date 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
joint 
statement 
of 
September 
19, 
2005, 
agreed 
upon 
by 
all 
participants 
in 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
It 
also 
urged 
the 
DPRK, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006), 
to 
return 
immediately 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
precondition 
and 
engage 
in 
consultations 
on 
ways 
to 
implement 
the 
joint 
statement. 
His 
Government 
would 
continue 
to 
exert 
every 
possible 
effort 
to 
achieve 
the 
resumption 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
for 
the 
resolution 
of 
all 
issues 
through 
dialogue, 
while 
endeavouring 
to 
ensure 
the 
faithful 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695.

Arrangements 
for 
the 
Conference 
(a) 
Adoption 
of 
the 
agenda 
and 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion 
1. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
agenda 
for 
the 
current 
session 
consist 
of 
all 
the 
items 
on 
the 
provisional 
agenda 
set 
forth 
in 
document 
GC(50)/1. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
allocation 
of 
items 
for 
initial 
discussion, 
the 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
items 
listed 
in 
that 
document 
be 
taken 
up 
for 
initial 
discussion 
as 
indicated 
there, 
account 
being 
taken 
of 
the 
slight 
re-ordering 
of 
items 
already 
considered 
that 
morning 
at 
the 
PlenaryÂs 
first 
meeting. 
2. 
The 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendations 
were 
accepted. 
(b) 
Closing 
date 
of 
the 
session 
and 
opening 
date 
of 
the 
next 
session 
3. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that 
the 
Conference 
set 
Friday, 
22 
September 
2006 
as 
the 
closing 
date 
of 
the 
fiftieth 
regular 
session 
and 
Monday, 
17

4. 
The 
General 
CommitteeÂs 
recommendation 
was 
accepted. 
Â 
Restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
5. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee, 
which 
had 
had 
before 
it 
requests 
from 
Georgia 
and 
Moldova 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
their 
voting 
rights, 
had 
postponed 
consideration 
of 
the 
requests, 
and 
of 
any 
other 
such 
requests 
received, 
until 
its 
following 
meeting. 
8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(resumed) 
(GC(50)/4) 
6. 
Mr. 
AL-ATHEL 
(Saudi 
Arabia) 
welcomed 
the 
Republics 
of 
Malawi, 
Montenegro, 
Mozambique 
and 
Palau 
as 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency. 
7. 
He 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
The 
Agency 
had 
been 
singled 
out 
for 
its 
achievements 
during 
the 
past 
half 
century 
in 
promoting 
the 
global 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peace 
and 
development 
and 
opposing 
its 
use 
for 
military 
purposes. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
honoured 
for 
his 
courageous 
defence 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
at 
a 
time 
when 
efforts 
to 
promote 
disarmament 
seemed 
to 
have 
reached 
an 
impasse 
and 
there 
was 
a 
growing 
risk 
of 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
to 
both 
States 
and 
terrorist 
groups. 
He 
also 
commended 
the 
use 
of 
the 
prize 
money 
to 
establish 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund, 
which 
provided 
fellowships 
and 
organized 
training 
courses 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
the 
supply 
of 
specialized 
human 
resources 
in 
developing 
regions. 
The 
Nobel 
Prize 
could 
be 
viewed 
both 
as 
an 

GC(50)/OR.2

honour 
and 
as 
a 
challenge 
to 
maintain 
a 
consistently 
high 
level 
of 
professionalism, 
neutrality 
and 
integrity. 


8. 
He 
also 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
in 
particular 
on 
its 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
safeguards, 
verification 
and 
the 
enhancement 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
standards 
in 
order 
to 
reduce 
the 
risks 
to 
people 
and 
property 
to 
the 
absolute 
minimum. 
Focusing 
on 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
its 
mandate, 
the 
Agency 
had 
promoted 
access 
to 
peaceful 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
and 
provided 
support 
for 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety, 
security 
and 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Member 
States 
had 
enjoyed 
scientific 
and 
technological 
support 
in 
areas 
including 
nuclear 
power, 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
food 
production, 
human 
health, 
water 
resources, 
management 
of 
the 
marine 
and 
terrestrial 
environment, 
and 
industrial 
applications. 
9. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
international 
body 
with 
authority 
to 
verify 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
obligations 
and 
to 
ensure 
non-proliferation 
at 
the 
different 
stages 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
It 
had 
consolidated 
the 
safeguards 
regime, 
drawing 
conclusions 
regarding 
StatesÂ 
implementation 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
under 
the 
NPT 
that 
were 
factual 
and 
accurate. 
However, 
some 
States 
that 
had 
signed 
voluntary 
offer 
INFCIRC/66/Rev.2-type 
agreements 
possessed 
and 
were 
developing 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
compelling 
their 
neighbours 
to 
follow 
suit 
and 
undermining 
the 
foundations 
of 
security 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region 
concerned. 
10. 
The 
NPT 
was 
based 
on 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation. 
Yet 
the 
States 
that 
had 
attended 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2005 
and 
the 
World 
Summit 
in 
September 
2005 
considered 
that 
the 
international 
community 
had 
not 
shown 
sufficient 
determination 
to 
bolster 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
complied 
fully 
with 
their 
obligations 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
diversion 
of 
materials 
for 
military 
purposes. 
In 
that 
context, 
they 
had 
called 
for 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
for 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
growing 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
11. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
sovereign 
right 
of 
States 
to 
withdraw 
from 
any 
treaty 
they 
had 
ratified 
and 
noting 
that 
certain 
obligations 
remained 
binding 
on 
parties 
even 
after 
such 
withdrawal, 
he 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
no 
party 
would 
invoke 
the 
prevailing 
circumstances 
as 
a 
pretext 
for 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
NPT. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
exercise 
its 
joint 
responsibility 
to 
prevent 
any 
such 
development 
and 
urged 
States 
to 
redouble 
their 
efforts 
in 
support 
of 
unconditional 
and 
transparent 
global 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
He 
hoped 
that 
agreement 
would 
be 
reached 
on 
an 
international 
legal 
instrument 
banning 
the 
production 
of 
fissile 
material 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
manufacture 
nuclear 
weapons 
or 
other 
explosive 
devices. 
12. 
Some 
15 
years 
after 
it 
had 
first 
been 
placed 
on 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
agenda, 
the 
item 
concerning 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat 
continued 
to 
be 
placed 
on 
the 
agenda 
of 
the 
Conference 
at 
the 
request 
of 
the 
Arab 
Members 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
because 
of 
IsraelÂs 
failure 
to 
comply 
with 
previous 
resolutions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly, 
and 
the 
pursuit 
by 
successive 
Israeli 
Governments 
of 
policies 
that 
obstructed 
the 
peace 
process 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
thwarted 
all 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
zone 
free 
from 
nuclear, 
chemical 
and 
biological 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
He 
noted 
in 
that 
connection 
that 
all 
Arab 
States 
were 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT. 
His 
own 
country, 
whose 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
confined 
to 
the 
areas 
of 
medicine 
and 
education, 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
Treaty 
in 
1989 
and 
subsequently 
signed 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Saudi 
Arabia 
reiterated 
its 
call 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
make 
that 
goal 
a 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
peace 
process 
in 
the 
region. 
It 
had 
a 
duty 
to 
act 
against 
the 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
security 
posed 
by 
IsraelÂs 
possession 
of 
undisclosed 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
since 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
would 
otherwise 
feel 
compelled 
to 
acquire 
similar 
capabilities 
in 
order 
to 
restore 
military 
balance.

13. 
Ms. 
PLASSNIK 
(Austria) 
said 
that 
although 
the 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
system, 
its 
integrity 
was 
being 
increasingly 
undermined 
as 
a 
result 
of 
serious 
non-proliferation 
concerns. 
The 
international 
community 
must 
make 
a 
concerted 
effort 
to 
enforce 
compliance 
with 
the 
Treaty's 
non-proliferation 
obligations. 
14. 
There 
was 
a 
clear 
link 
between 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
The 
only 
sustainable 
long-term 
approach 
to 
address 
the 
dangers 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
was 
to 
reduce 
the 
reliance 
on 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Consequently, 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
must 
honour 
their 
commitments 
and 
take 
serious 
steps 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
For 
Austria, 
the 
strength 
and 
foundation 
of 
the 
NPT 
was 
the 
carefully 
crafted 
balance 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
In 
return 
for 
renouncing 
nuclear 
weapons, 
States 
were 
guaranteed 
access 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
while 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
were 
committed 
to 
the 
gradual 
elimination 
of 
those 
weapons. 
If 
non-compliance 
were 
tolerated 
or 
exceptions 
made, 
the 
system 
would 
be 
seriously 
undermined. 
Today, 
serious 
and 
credible 
efforts 
were 
required 
to 
overcome 
the 
differences 
that 
had 
characterized 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
debate 
over 
the 
previous 
few 
years. 
Attempts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
find 
a 
new 
basic 
consensus 
on 
how 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
vital 
issues 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
No 
more 
opportunities 
could 
be 
wasted. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
and 
the 
deep 
political 
divisions 
that 
had 
become 
so 
apparent, 
Austria, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
European 
Union, 
was 
proposing 
that 
the 
first 
preparatory 
meeting 
for 
the 
next 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
be 
held 
in 
Vienna 
in 
the 
spring 
of 
2007. 
She 
hoped 
that 
NPT 
States 
parties 
would 
consider 
the 
proposal 
in 
a 
positive 
light. 
15. 
Recent 
advances 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
had 
made 
it 
increasingly 
difficult 
for 
even 
the 
Agency 
to 
draw 
a 
precise 
line 
between 
civil 
and 
military 
capacity. 
Austria 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
discussions 
initiated 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
multilateral 
system 
of 
assured 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply, 
which 
would 
enable 
States 
to 
exercise 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
option 
without 
having 
to 
master 
the 
entire 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
in 
particular 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing. 
16. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 
The 
level 
of 
assurances 
that 
could 
be 
expected 
depended 
on 
the 
legal 
authority 
countries 
were 
prepared 
to 
assign 
to 
the 
Agency. 
The 
repeated 
cases 
of 
clandestine 
nuclear 
programmes 
that 
could 
not 
be 
detected 
by 
traditional 
safeguards 
measures 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
need 
for 
a 
strengthened 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
Agency 
must 
be 
able 
to 
provide 
full 
assurances 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activity, 
and 
she 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
to 
conclude 
an 
additional 
protocol 
without 
further 
delay; 
such 
action 
was, 
in 
her 
country's 
opinion, 
a 
legal 
obligation 
for 
the 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT. 
17. 
The 
amended 
CPPNM 
would 
be 
an 
important 
tool 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
and 
she 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
she 
had 
just 
deposited 
AustriaÂs 
instrument 
of 
ratification 
with 
the 
Director 
General. 
All 
States 
parties 
should 
ensure 
the 
earliest 
possible 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
Convention. 
18. 
Nuclear 
security 
in 
the 
widest 
sense 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
nuclear 
co-operation 
and 
trade. 
Those 
States 
supplying 
nuclear 
material 
had 
to 
be 
confident 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
misused 
for 
nuclear 
weapons 
programmes 
or 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
In 
addition 
to 
comprehensive 
safeguards, 
appropriate 
physical 
protection, 
adequate 
measures 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
effective 
export 
controls 
had 
to 
be 
in 
place. 
19. 
It 
was 
worrying 
to 
learn 
from 
the 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Review 
for 
the 
Year 
2005, 
which 
her 
country 
had 
welcomed, 
that 
avoidable 
nuclear 
incidents 
continued 
to 
occur. 
The 
Agency 
should 
strengthen 
its 
activities 
to 
ensure 
the 
utmost 
transparency 
and 
exchange 
of 
information 
among 
all 
Member 
States.

20. 
Austria 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
global 
safety 
regime, 
and 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
fundamental 
safety 
principles 
covered 
both 
the 
radiation 
exposure 
of 
people 
and 
the 
release 
of 
radioactive 
material 
to 
the 
environment. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
should 
become 
legally 
binding. 
While 
cooperation 
with 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
could 
provide 
useful 
input, 
the 
safety 
standards 
should 
not 
be 
guided 
by 
industry 
needs, 
but 
by 
the 
objective 
of 
protecting 
people 
and 
the 
environment. 
21. 
Austria 
was 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
accept 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
support 
of 
the 
development 
of 
new 
and 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactors. 
The 
Agency 
should, 
rather, 
be 
a 
driving 
force 
to 
enhance 
the 
security 
of 
any 
nuclear 
installation. 
22. 
Several 
experts 
had 
predicted 
that 
a 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
imminent, 
yet 
how 
could 
people 
be 
sure 
that 
a 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
respected 
the 
highest 
possible 
safety 
standards? 
In 
Austria's 
assessment, 
neither 
current 
nor 
future 
generations 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
could 
overcome 
the 
main 
shortcomings 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Austria 
therefore 
continued 
to 
advocate 
a 
controlled 
phasing-out 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
focusing 
of 
efforts 
on 
energy 
production 
based 
on 
the 
principle 
of 
sustainability. 
23. 
The 
excellent 
work 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
rightfully 
recognized 
by 
the 
international 
community, 
with 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
Austria 
would 
continue 
to 
lend 
the 
Agency 
its 
full 
support, 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
its 
forthcoming 
term 
on 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
24. 
Mr. 
KIRIENKO 
(Russian 
Federation) 
began 
his 
statement 
by 
reading 
out 
an 
address 
from 
President 
Putin: 
ÂGreetings 
to 
the 
participants 
in 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
International 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency. 


ÂOver 
the 
decades 
the 
IAEA 
has 
remained 
an 
organization 
that 
actively 
fosters 
international 
partnership 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
and 
upholds 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
non-proliferation 
regime. 


ÂThe 
decision 
to 
award 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
was 
a 
confirmation 
of 
the 
IAEAÂs 
great 
role 
and 
importance. 
This 
award 
testifies 
to 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 


ÂI 
consider 
that 
continued 
improvement, 
under 
the 
aegis 
of 
the 
IAEA, 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure 
will 
help 
effectively 
to 
enhance 
its 
security. 
This 
relates 
above 
all 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services 
and 
also 
to 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
as 
was 
reaffirmed 
by 
the 
G8 
leaders 
at 
the 
St. 
Petersburg 
summit 
in 
July 
2006. 


ÂI 
am 
sure 
that 
the 
IAEA 
will 
continue 
to 
make 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
development 
of 
the 
peaceful 
utilization 
of 
atomic 
energy 
and 
will 
actively 
facilitate 
the 
development 
and 
introduction 
of 
ecologically 
safe 
and 
economically 
efficient 
nuclear 
technologies 
to 
meet 
humankindÂs 
growing 
energy 
needs. 


ÂI 
wish 
that 
your 
work 
may 
be 
successful 
and 
fruitful.Â 


25. 
A 
reliable 
energy 
supply 
was 
essential 
for 
political 
stability 
and 
sustainable 
economic 
development. 
As 
the 
G8 
leaders 
had 
stated 
at 
the 
recent 
G8 
summit 
in 
St 
Petersburg 
that 
had 
focused 
on 
global 
energy 
security, 
energy 
was 
essential 
to 
improving 
the 
quality 
of 
life 
and 
opportunities 
in 
developed 
and 
developing 
nations. 
With 
fossil 
fuels 
dwindling, 
the 
challenge 
was 
to 
find 
new 
energy 
sources 
capable 
of 
meeting 
the 
anticipated 
growth 
in 
demand 
as 
well 
as 
modern 
technological 
and 
environmental 
requirements. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
the 
most 
accessible 
and 
developed 
source 
of 
energy 

GC(50)/OR.2

for 
the 
future 
and 
already 
provided 
for 
some 
17% 
of 
global 
electricity 
production 
effectively 
and 
reliably. 
The 
Russian 
Federation 
had 
adopted 
a 
comprehensive 
programme 
for 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
providing 
in 
particular 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
with 
a 
capacity 
of 
no 
less 
that 
2 
GW 
per 
year. 
By 
2030, 
nuclear 
power 
would 
account 
for 
more 
than 
25% 
of 
the 
energy 
mix 
in 
the 
country. 


26. 
There 
was 
a 
direct 
link 
between 
large-scale 
nuclear 
power 
development 
and 
the 
access 
of 
more 
and 
more 
countries 
to 
nuclear 
technologies, 
materials 
and 
equipment. 
That 
in 
turn 
raised 
questions 
about 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
nuclear 
and 
ecological 
security, 
competitiveness 
and 
risk 
reduction. 
27. 
With 
the 
new 
challenges 
and 
threats 
facing 
the 
international 
community, 
the 
NPT 
was 
acquiring 
ever-greater 
significance, 
as 
was 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
only 
international 
organization 
with 
the 
authority 
to 
ensure 
a 
necessary 
balance 
between 
the 
development 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
compliance 
with 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Maintaining 
that 
balance 
was 
no 
easy 
task. 
More 
and 
more 
countries 
were 
choosing 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power 
and 
showing 
an 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
technologies 
including 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing. 
There 
was 
a 
danger 
that 
such 
dual-use 
technologies 
might 
be 
used 
not 
only 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
raising 
the 
question 
of 
how 
to 
guarantee 
countries 
access 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
an 
assured 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
those 
dual-use 
technologies. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
Russian 
President 
had 
put 
forward 
an 
initiative 
in 
January 
concerning 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
global 
infrastructure 
to 
ensure 
fair, 
non-discriminatory 
access 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
all 
interested 
countries 
and 
parties 
provided 
that 
they 
respect 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
and 
standards. 
The 
key 
element 
of 
that 
infrastructure 
was 
a 
system 
of 
international 
centres 
to 
provide 
a 
full 
range 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services 
under 
Agency 
control 
as 
well 
as 
training 
for 
specialists 
involved 
in 
the 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
facilities. 
28. 
An 
international 
centre 
providing 
uranium 
enrichment 
services 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
being 
established 
in 
Russia. 
Members 
of 
the 
centre 
would 
have 
an 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
without 
the 
need 
to 
use 
or 
possess 
enrichment 
technology. 
The 
proposed 
initiative 
should 
in 
no 
way 
undermine 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
use 
or 
provide 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
services 
as 
part 
of 
their 
own 
initiatives. 
29. 
Russia 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
concerning 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
system 
of 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
and 
its 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
innovative 
nuclear 
power 
systems. 
It 
also 
supported 
other 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
initiatives 
proposed 
by 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
including 
the 
Global 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Partnership 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
and 
the 
proposals 
by 
a 
group 
of 
major 
suppliers 
of 
enriched 
uranium 
regarding 
assured 
supplies. 
30. 
Nuclear 
terrorism, 
which 
was 
closely 
linked 
to 
non-proliferation, 
was 
a 
very 
real 
threat. 
Russia 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
leaders 
of 
the 
G8 
had 
supported 
the 
global 
initiative 
to 
combat 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
Presidents 
of 
Russia 
and 
the 
United 
States. 
That 
initiative 
was 
aimed 
at 
mobilizing 
efforts 
by 
States 
to 
meet 
their 
commitments 
under 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
and 
the 
CPPNM. 
Its 
implementation 
would 
strengthen 
and 
complement 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
and 
Russia 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
expressed 
an 
interest 
in 
and 
support 
for 
the 
initiative. 
31. 
Russia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
its 
safeguards 
activities 
and 
its 
ability 
to 
detect 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
Russia 
was 
interested 
in 
enhancing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute. 
The 
Russian 
Federation 
would 
continue 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system.

32. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
assist 
States 
in 
developing 
and 
strengthening 
their 
national 
regulatory 
systems 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
were 
welcome. 
The 
International 
Conference 
on 
Effective 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Systems 
held 
in 
Moscow 
in 
2006, 
had 
been 
the 
first 
of 
its 
type 
to 
discuss 
the 
role, 
responsibility 
and 
functions 
of 
State 
regulatory 
bodies. 
33. 
In 
November 
2005, 
Russia 
had 
ratified 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
attesting 
to 
its 
readiness 
to 
help 
to 
achieve 
and 
uphold 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
the 
area 
of 
waste 
management. 
Russia 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials 
and 
spent 
fuel 
management. 
34. 
Russia 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
appreciated 
the 
work 
done 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard. 
35. 
At 
the 
recent 
G8 
summit 
in 
St 
Petersburg, 
the 
development 
of 
innovative 
nuclear 
power 
systems 
had 
been 
considered 
an 
important 
element 
for 
efficient 
and 
safe 
nuclear 
energy 
development. 
In 
that 
respect, 
Russia 
welcomed 
the 
results 
achieved 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
INPRO 
project. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
support 
for 
the 
project, 
including 
financial 
assistance 
and 
called 
on 
all 
the 
countries 
involved 
to 
do 
likewise. 
The 
INPRO 
project 
and 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum 
had 
become 
major 
initiatives 
to 
address 
issues 
associated 
with 
large-scale 
nuclear 
power 
development 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
international 
cooperation. 
36. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
significant 
events 
in 
2005 
was 
the 
preparation 
of 
a 
draft 
agreement 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
international 
organization 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
ITER 
project. 
37. 
More 
attention 
should 
be 
paid 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
The 
existing 
mechanism 
for 
formulating 
the 
TCF 
should 
be 
maintained, 
since 
it 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
effectiveness. 
Russia, 
for 
its 
part, 
was 
taking 
steps 
to 
ensure 
the 
payment 
in 
full 
of 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF. 
38. 
Mr. 
SUN 
Qin 
(China) 
said 
that 
in 
an 
ever-changing 
world 
the 
Agency 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
principles 
and 
spirit 
of 
its 
Statute 
and 
unceasingly 
improved 
its 
functions. 
Its 
achievements 
had 
been 
universally 
recognized 
with 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
39. 
In 
the 
future, 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
face 
arduous 
tasks 
and 
his 
delegation 
wished 
to 
make 
four 
proposals 
to 
enhance 
the 
AgencyÂs 
sound 
development. 
First, 
the 
Agency 
should 
make 
greater 
efforts 
in 
the 
area 
of 
technical 
co-operation. 
His 
Government 
unreservedly 
approved 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
efforts 
and 
was 
pleased 
to 
note 
that 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
been 
strengthened 
through 
measures 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
NPC 
mechanism 
and 
reorganization 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation. 
The 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
one 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
two 
major 
responsibilities; 
however, 
safeguards 
were 
still 
given 
more 
priority 
than 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
-a 
situation 
that 
showed 
every 
sign 
of 
worsening. 
Moreover, 
the 
issue 
of 
insufficient 
funding 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
had 
not 
been 
fundamentally 
addressed, 
and 
difficulties 
were 
being 
experienced 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
in 
particular 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
provision 
of 
experts 
and 
training. 
Member 
States, 
notably 
the 
developed 
countries, 
should 
attach 
greater 
importance 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
ensure 
the 
smooth 
implementation 
of 
the 
Agency's 
statutory 
promotional 
activities. 
40. 
Second, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
build 
and 
promote 
a 
nuclear 
safety 
culture. 
China 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
commendable 
achievements 
in 
contributing 
to 
the 
improvement 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
worldwide 
by 
strengthening 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
mechanism, 
formulating 
and 
promoting 
nuclear 
safety 
standards, 
establishing 
and 
improving 
international 
legal 
instruments 
and

national 
regulatory 
structures, 
and 
providing 
safety 
review 
services 
and 
training. 
On 
29 
April, 
China 
had 
ratified 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
in 
its 
nuclear 
safety 
efforts. 


41. 
Third, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
provide 
strong 
guarantees 
for 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
security. 
China 
welcomed, 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
Opposing 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
was 
one 
of 
his 
countryÂs 
fundamental 
foreign 
policies 
and, 
having 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
joined 
the 
NSG, 
China 
had 
participated 
in 
all 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
mechanisms. 
Its 
export 
policies 
and 
non-proliferation 
measures 
were 
currently 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
international 
practice. 
His 
Government 
had 
always 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
security 
and 
had 
decided 
to 
join 
the 
AgencyÂs 
illicit 
trafficking 
database. 
Prevention 
of 
a 
nuclear 
terrorist 
attack 
was 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
security 
work 
for 
the 
2008 
Olympic 
Games 
to 
be 
held 
in 
Beijing, 
and 
China 
would 
be 
drawing 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
rich 
experience 
in 
that 
connection. 
42. 
Fourth, 
the 
Agency 
must 
retain 
its 
objectivity 
and 
impartiality, 
and 
play 
an 
active 
role 
in 
settling 
matters 
of 
concern 
to 
the 
international 
community, 
such 
as 
the 
DPRK 
and 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issues, 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
and 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
43. 
ChinaÂs 
rapid 
economic 
growth 
was 
placing 
increasing 
demands 
on 
energy 
supply. 
Nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
incorporated 
into 
the 
overall 
national 
plan 
for 
the 
development 
of 
the 
power 
sector. 
In 
March, 
the 
State 
Council 
of 
China 
had 
adopted 
the 
mid-and 
long-term 
(2005-2020) 
nuclear 
power 
development 
plan, 
which 
set 
out 
an 
energy 
strategy 
actively 
promoting 
nuclear 
power 
construction. 
Under 
that 
plan, 
ChinaÂs 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
capacity 
would 
reach 
40 
000 
MW 
by 
2020, 
accounting 
for 
about 
4% 
of 
total 
power 
generation, 
and 
another 
18 
000 
MW 
of 
power 
generation 
capacity 
would 
be 
under 
construction. 
In 
order 
to 
achieve 
that 
goal, 
a 
series 
of 
PWR 
units 
would 
be 
constructed 
using 
proven 
and 
reliable 
technology, 
and 
although 
there 
would 
be 
cooperation 
with 
international 
partners, 
China 
was 
to 
play 
the 
major 
role. 
New 
and 
advanced 
nuclear 
power 
technologies 
would 
also 
be 
developed 
through 
independent 
research 
and 
development 
and 
international 
cooperation. 
In 
promoting 
nuclear 
power 
construction, 
China 
would 
adhere 
to 
the 
principle 
that 
safety 
and 
quality 
should 
come 
first. 
Construction 
and 
operational 
management 
capability 
would 
follow 
international 
practice, 
and 
regulations 
as 
well 
as 
a 
system 
of 
standards 
for 
nuclear 
power 
would 
be 
developed. 
44. 
China 
had 
adopted 
a 
Âthree-stepÂ 
approach 
to 
long-term 
nuclear 
power 
development, 
involving 
a 
thermal 
neutron 
reactor, 
a 
fast 
breeder 
reactor 
and 
controlled 
fusion 
reactor. 
It 
was 
an 
INPRO 
member 
and 
ITER 
participant, 
and 
had 
already 
made 
a 
formal 
application 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
45. 
Nuclear 
power 
development 
could 
not 
be 
achieved 
without 
an 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel. 
China 
would 
be 
strengthening 
its 
domestic 
uranium 
prospecting, 
increasing 
its 
uranium 
output 
and 
setting 
up 
a 
stable, 
assured 
supply 
system 
for 
nuclear 
fuel. 
It 
was 
willing 
to 
cooperate 
with 
other 
partners 
in 
exploring 
overseas 
uranium 
resources. 
46. 
The 
maintenance 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
its 
denuclearization 
were 
in 
the 
common 
interests 
of 
people 
all 
over 
the 
world. 
Several 
rounds 
of 
six-party 
talks 
had 
been 
held, 
and 
positive 
results 
achieved 
-most 
notably, 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
during 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
talks 
setting 
forth 
the 
overall 
target 
for 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Peninsula. 
The 
talks 
had 
proven 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
in 
promoting 
the 
normalization 
of 
relations 
between 
the 
DPRK 
and 
other 
countries, 
and 
an 
important 
forum 
for 
dialogue 
and 
consultation. 
External 
pressure 
would 
only 
exacerbate 
the 
situation, 
and 
China 
hoped 
that 
a 
positive 
political 
atmosphere 
would 
be 
created 
in 
order 
to 
resolve 
the 
issue. 
It 
appealed 
to 
all 
the 
parties 
concerned 
to 
exercise 
calm 
and 
restraint 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
progress, 
mutual

understanding 
and 
confidence. 
China, 
for 
its 
part, 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
constructive 
role, 
and 
seek 
an 
early 
breakthrough 
for 
the 
resumption 
of 
negotiations. 


47. 
China 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
in 
playing 
a 
positive 
role 
in 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue. 
The 
peaceful 
settlement 
of 
the 
issue 
through 
diplomatic 
negotiation 
was 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
right 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
NPT 
obligations. 
The 
parties 
concerned 
should 
demonstrate 
flexibility, 
make 
full 
use 
of 
diplomatic 
wisdom 
and 
choose 
dialogue 
over 
confrontation. 
They 
should 
take 
into 
full 
account 
the 
interests 
and 
concerns 
of 
all 
sides 
and 
adopt 
a 
pragmatic 
attitude 
in 
seeking 
a 
lasting 
solution. 
48. 
Ms. 
GRABAR-KITAROVIC 
(Croatia) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005, 
which 
was 
the 
most 
fitting 
recognition 
of 
the 
unique 
role 
the 
Agency 
had 
played 
over 
the 
preceding 
fifty 
years. 
49. 
Croatia 
particularly 
welcomed 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
a 
strengthened 
safeguards 
regime, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
active 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
acceptance 
of 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
managing 
the 
proliferation-sensitive 
aspects 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
50. 
Croatia 
was 
committed 
to 
furthering 
its 
productive 
relationship 
with 
the 
Agency, 
including 
by 
implementing 
its 
international 
obligations. 
Her 
country 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
Member 
States 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
and 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute. 
It 
had 
also 
recently 
deposited 
its 
instrument 
of 
approval 
regarding 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
and 
its 
domestic 
procedure 
for 
amending 
the 
text 
of 
the 
SQP 
was 
approaching 
completion. 
Croatia 
had 
presented 
its 
second 
national 
report 
on 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
at 
the 
Second 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
earlier 
in 
the 
year. 
Croatia 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
strengthening 
national 
capacity 
for 
export 
control. 
In 
2005 
it 
had 
begun 
to 
participate 
in 
several 
informal 
non-proliferation 
regimes 
and 
had 
also 
recently 
informed 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
its 
support 
for 
both 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
51. 
Croatia 
valued 
highly 
its 
close 
and 
successful 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
and 
support 
in 
implementing 
various 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
research 
agreements. 
It 
was 
hoped 
that 
the 
proposed 
projects 
for 
the 
new 
biennial 
cycle 
that 
focused 
on 
health, 
the 
environment 
and 
capacity 
building, 
would 
be 
evaluated 
and 
that 
the 
CPF 
would 
be 
revised 
in 
2007. 
Croatia 
had 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
the 
following 
year. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
also 
had 
special 
value, 
and 
Croatia 
welcomed 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
foreign 
participants, 
at 
various 
events 
in 
the 
country. 
Croatian 
institutions 
had 
offered 
to 
act 
as 
a 
leading, 
or 
alternate 
leading, 
counterpart 
in 
preparation 
for 
several 
2007 
regional 
projects. 
Croatia 
was 
ready 
to 
strengthen 
its 
proactive 
role 
in 
that 
regard, 
since 
coordinated 
and 
effective 
regional 
measures 
contributed 
not 
only 
to 
maximizing 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
but 
also 
to 
confronting 
the 
growing 
risks 
of 
proliferation. 
52. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
tackling 
complex 
security 
threats 
in 
the 
changed 
global 
environment, 
in 
particular 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
and 
terrorism. 
The 
most 
successful 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
common 
concerns 
was 
through 
a 
strengthened 
cooperative 
approach 
and 
rule-based 
international 
order, 
regardless 
of 
the 
latterÂs 
inevitable 
shortcomings. 
Croatia 
appreciated 
ideas 
that 
had 
been 
formulated 
in 
that 
regard, 
notably 
the 
valuable 
report 
presented 
in 
June 
by 
the 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction 
Commission. 
In 
the 
deteriorating 
climate 
for 
arms 
control 
and 
disarmament, 
it 
was 
of 
essential 
importance 
to 
strengthen 
the 
integrity 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
reinforce 
the

AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Treaty, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
field 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
verification. 
The 
international 
community 
had 
to 
be 
assured 
that 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
were 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Efforts 
to 
secure 
a 
negotiated, 
peaceful 
solution 
to 
urgent 
problems 
of 
compliance 
and 
verification 
therefore 
needed 
to 
be 
pursued 
vigorously 
and 
consistently. 


53. 
The 
world 
was 
at 
a 
crossroads 
and 
a 
clear 
message 
had 
to 
be 
sent 
about 
the 
path 
to 
be 
followed. 
There 
was 
no 
alternative 
to 
the 
course 
of 
active 
engagement, 
dialogue 
and 
negotiated 
agreement, 
leading 
to 
sustainable 
non-proliferation 
and 
genuine 
Âatoms 
for 
peaceÂ. 
54. 
Monsignor 
PAROLIN 
(Holy 
See) 
said 
that 
after 
50 
years, 
the 
Agency 
remained 
an 
invaluable 
point 
of 
reference 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
for 
development. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
was 
well-deserved 
recognition 
of 
the 
important 
contribution 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
its 
activities. 
55. 
Of 
all 
the 
challenges 
facing 
the 
Agency, 
the 
Holy 
See 
was 
most 
concerned 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
non-compliance 
with 
safeguards 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
That 
Treaty, 
which 
was 
the 
only 
multilateral 
legal 
instrument 
intended 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
world, 
must 
not 
be 
weakened. 
56. 
The 
Holy 
See 
supported 
all 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
conclusion 
by 
all 
States 
of 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
would 
reinforce 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
regime 
and 
increase 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
Holy 
See 
likewise 
reaffirmed 
its 
support 
for 
the 
CTBT, 
and 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Treaty 
without 
delay, 
particularly 
those 
States 
whose 
ratification 
was 
required 
before 
the 
Treaty 
could 
enter 
into 
force. 
It 
had 
also 
recently 
concluded 
with 
the 
Director 
General 
the 
exchange 
of 
letters 
to 
give 
effect 
to 
the 
standardized 
text 
and 
modified 
criteria 
for 
the 
SQP. 
57. 
The 
importance 
of 
safety 
in 
nuclear 
facilities 
was 
shown 
by 
the 
tragic 
consequences 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
nuclear 
accident 
20 
years 
previously, 
and 
all 
States 
that 
sought 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
must 
strive 
to 
ensure 
effective 
protection 
for 
their 
citizens 
and 
the 
environment. 
58. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
the 
growing 
insecurity 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
he 
called 
upon 
all 
the 
States 
of 
the 
region 
to 
conclude 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
and 
to 
enter 
into 
a 
serious 
dialogue 
with 
a 
view 
to 
creating 
a 
region 
free 
from 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
The 
Holy 
See 
was 
also 
convinced 
that 
the 
current 
issues 
associated 
with 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
could, 
and 
must, 
be 
overcome 
through 
diplomatic 
channels. 
59. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
including 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
agriculture, 
hydrology, 
food 
security 
and 
medicine, 
had 
helped 
to 
improve 
the 
living 
conditions 
of 
many 
people. 
The 
Holy 
See 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
and 
strengthen 
its 
activities, 
in 
particular 
in 
improving 
child 
health, 
the 
fight 
against 
malnutrition, 
cancer 
management, 
radiation 
oncology 
and 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
improve 
the 
nutrition, 
health 
and 
wellbeing 
of 
people 
with 
HIV. 
Access 
to 
safe 
drinking 
water, 
which 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
sustainable 
development, 
was 
another 
area 
of 
concern 
for 
the 
Holy 
See. 
60. 
Mr. 
AHMAD 
(Pakistan) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
in 
well-deserved 
recognition 
of 
their 
work 
and 
achievements 
in 
a 
complex 
and 
challenging 
international 
environment. 
61. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
earliest 
members 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Pakistan 
was 
deeply 
satisfied 
to 
join 
the 
international 
community 
in 
celebrating 
the 
Agency's 
fiftieth 
anniversary, 
which 
coincided 
with 
the 
Pakistan 
Atomic 
Energy 
CommissionÂs 
golden 
jubilee. 
Fifty 
years 
ago, 
Pakistan 
did 
not 
have 
any 
nuclear 
facilities 
or 
trained 
manpower. 
It 
now 
had 
several 
training 
centres 
and 
a 
university 
for 
nuclear

sciences 
and 
engineering. 
Those 
institutions 
not 
only 
met 
the 
countryÂs 
needs 
for 
technical 
manpower 
but 
also 
accepted 
foreign 
scholars, 
including 
through 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Pakistan 
had 
established 
the 
entire 
range 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities; 
two 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
were 
in 
operation 
and 
a 
third 
was 
under 
construction. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
Pakistan 
had 
established 
an 
extensive 
programme 
for 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
radioisotopes 
in 
agriculture, 
hydrology 
and 
the 
medical 
and 
industrial 
sectors. 
Four 
nuclear 
agricultural 
research 
centres 
were 
engaged 
in 
research 
to 
help 
farmers 
to 
enhance 
the 
quantity 
and 
quality 
of 
their 
crops. 
The 
Pakistan 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
established 
thirteen 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
oncology 
centres 
that 
provided 
diagnostic 
and 
treatment 
facilities 
to 
several 
hundred 
thousand 
patients 
each 
year; 
six 
further 
centres 
were 
being 
built. 
Some 
70% 
of 
patients 
received 
their 
treatment 
free 
of 
charge. 


62. 
Pakistan 
was 
particularly 
grateful 
for 
the 
valuable 
assistance 
and 
cooperation 
it 
had 
received 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
developing 
its 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programme. 
Pakistan, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
been 
extremely 
cooperative 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
had 
never 
violated 
any 
of 
its 
obligations 
flowing 
from 
the 
agreements 
concluded 
with 
the 
Agency. 
63. 
Pakistan 
had 
maintained 
an 
economic 
growth 
rate 
of 
some 
6% 
over 
the 
previous 
several 
years. 
In 
order 
to 
maintain 
such 
growth, 
large 
inputs 
of 
energy 
were 
required 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
that 
regard. 
Pakistan 
had 
launched 
an 
energy 
security 
plan 
that 
sought 
to 
increase 
the 
share 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
from 
0.8 
to 
4.5% 
by 
2030. 
The 
task 
was 
a 
daunting 
one 
for 
Pakistan 
given 
its 
limited 
resources, 
and 
the 
active 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
assistance 
from 
other 
countries 
would 
be 
required 
if 
it 
were 
to 
be 
achieved. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
assistance 
and 
cooperation 
extended 
by 
China. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
energy 
security, 
the 
special 
event 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
being 
held 
on 
the 
margins 
of 
the 
Conference 
was 
of 
particular 
interest. 
64. 
An 
important 
step 
towards 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
PakistanÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
was 
the 
establishment 
in 
2001 
of 
the 
independent 
Pakistan 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority, 
which 
had 
a 
fully 
functional 
mechanism 
for 
effective 
and 
continuous 
regulatory 
controls 
for 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
operation 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
installations, 
and 
also 
issued 
import 
and 
export 
licences 
for 
nuclear 
substances. 
Pakistan 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
countries 
to 
pass 
legislation 
to 
control 
technologies, 
materials 
and 
equipment 
related 
to 
nuclear 
and 
biological 
weapons 
and 
their 
delivery 
systems. 
Legislation 
to 
control 
the 
export 
of 
related 
chemical 
materials 
had 
been 
enacted 
in 
2000. 
His 
country 
would 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
its 
nuclear 
establishments 
and 
appreciated 
the 
valuable 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency. 
65. 
Pakistan 
had 
greatly 
benefited 
from 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
significantly 
enhanced 
his 
countryÂs 
socio-economic 
development. 
In 
return, 
it 
had 
made 
efforts 
to 
contribute 
to 
Agency 
initiatives 
and 
provided 
expert 
services 
to 
some 
Member 
States 
through 
the 
Agency. 
It 
also 
participated 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
advisory 
and 
expert 
groups, 
including 
INDAG, 
INPRO 
and 
SAGTAC. 
Pakistan 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
coordinate 
and 
disseminate 
information 
on 
the 
latest 
developments 
in 
nuclear 
power 
technology; 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
and 
information 
services 
would 
be 
useful. 
66. 
In 
the 
present 
international 
political 
climate, 
it 
was 
understandable 
that 
the 
Agency 
focus 
on 
its 
regulatory 
and 
verification 
role. 
However, 
that 
work 
must 
not 
be 
carried 
out 
at 
the 
expense 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
promotional 
activities, 
and 
a 
balance 
must 
be 
struck 
between 
the 
regulatory 
and 
promotional 
aspects 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
In 
the 
broader 
context 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work, 
Pakistan 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
proposal 
to 
expand 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
make 
it 
more 
representative. 
It 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
consider 
the 
issue 
with 
an 
open 
mind 
and 
take 
early 
action.

67. 
The 
world 
was 
a 
global 
village 
where 
everyone 
was 
influenced 
by 
events 
occurring 
elsewhere. 
Some 
of 
the 
global 
challenges 
humanity 
was 
facing 
such 
as 
climate 
change, 
the 
increasing 
scarcity 
of 
fresh 
water 
and 
new 
risks 
to 
health, 
had 
potential 
grave 
consequences 
for 
the 
future. 
Fortunately, 
those 
challenges 
could 
be 
met 
effectively 
using 
the 
technological 
advances 
in 
the 
nuclear 
and 
the 
non-
nuclear 
field. 
The 
Agency, 
with 
its 
proven 
record, 
was 
ideally 
suited 
to 
addressing 
those 
challenges. 
It 
should 
therefore 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
setting 
up 
a 
study 
group, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
Member 
States, 
to 
identify, 
prioritize 
and 
recommend 
relevant 
action. 
68. 
Ms. 
SONJICA 
(South 
Africa) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
receiving 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
Such 
an 
award 
was 
a 
great 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
and 
would 
encourage 
the 
Agency 
to 
face 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
challenges 
with 
new 
resolve. 
69. 
She 
welcomed 
the 
Republics 
of 
Malawi, 
Mozambique, 
Montenegro 
and 
Palau 
to 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
growing 
representation 
by 
developing 
countries 
in 
the 
Agency 
attested 
to 
the 
increasing 
relevance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
potential 
contribution 
to 
socio-economic 
development. 
70. 
The 
increasing 
recognition 
of 
the 
role 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
play 
in 
meeting 
energy 
requirements 
in 
the 
21st 
century 
had 
prompted 
a 
review 
of 
countriesÂ 
energy 
policies. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
renewed 
international 
commitment 
to 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
increased 
international 
cooperation 
was 
required 
to 
ensure 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
its 
use 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
South 
Africa 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
continuous 
review 
and 
strengthening 
of 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
including 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
However, 
real 
progress 
in 
protecting 
the 
world 
from 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
could 
only 
be 
achieved 
through 
concomitant 
progress 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Only 
if 
States 
complied 
fully 
with 
their 
legal 
obligations 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament 
could 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
be 
brought 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
all. 
There 
was 
growing 
concern 
that, 
while 
demands 
were 
being 
made 
for 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
agree 
to 
new 
measures 
in 
the 
name 
of 
non-proliferation, 
concrete 
actions 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament 
were 
being 
neglected. 
South 
Africa 
could 
not 
support 
unwarranted 
restrictions 
on 
the 
NPTÂs 
guarantee 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
capabilities 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
by 
States 
that 
were 
fully 
compliant 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
Treaty. 
The 
imposition 
of 
additional 
restrictive 
measures 
on 
some 
States 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT, 
while 
others 
were 
allowed 
access 
to 
such 
capabilities 
only 
served 
to 
exacerbate 
existing 
inequalities 
that 
were 
already 
inherent 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
undermined 
one 
of 
its 
central 
bargains. 
71. 
South 
Africa 
remained 
concerned 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
in 
finding 
a 
lasting 
solution 
to 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
appealed 
to 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
NPT, 
to 
eliminate 
all 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
72. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
safeguards 
in 
Iran, 
the 
recent 
preliminary 
discussions 
between 
Iran 
and 
the 
European 
Union 
High 
Representative 
were 
encouraging 
and, 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since 
August 
2005, 
there 
seemed 
to 
be 
a 
real 
possibility 
of 
resuming 
negotiations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
resolving 
differences. 
South 
Africa 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
all 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
finding 
a 
sustainable, 
long-term 
agreement 
that 
took 
full 
account 
of 
the 
rights, 
obligations, 
concerns, 
needs 
and 
legitimate 
aspirations 
of 
all 
parties 
involved. 
The 
world 
could 
not 
afford 
a 
further 
major 
crisis 
in 
a 
region 
of 
high 
tension, 
conflict, 
and 
instability. 
If 
all 
parties 
continued 
to 
exercise 
restraint 
and 
show 
the 
necessary 
flexibility, 
any 
differences 
could 
be 
resolved 
without 
the 
need 
to 
resort 
to 
confrontation 
and 
coercive 
measures. 
South 
Africa 
hoped 
that 
all 
concerned 
would 
act 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
would 
build 
the 
necessary 
trust 
and 
confidence 
to 
normalize 
such 
a 
complex 
matter. 
The 
Agency 
remained 
the 
sole 
competent 
authority 
responsible 
for 
verifying 
and 
assuring 
IranÂs 
compliance 
with 
its 
safeguards 
agreement. 
In 
order 
to 
preserve 
the 
AgencyÂs 
integrity, 
authority 
and 
credibility 
in 
confirming 
the

peaceful 
nature 
of 
national 
nuclear 
programmes, 
all 
Member 
States 
had 
a 
responsibility 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
a 
proactive 
and 
prompt 
manner. 


73. 
South 
Africa 
was 
a 
country 
with 
abundant 
natural 
resources, 
and 
was 
continuously 
seeking 
ways 
of 
maximizing 
their 
utilisation. 
Its 
integrated 
energy 
plan 
recognized 
the 
need 
for 
nuclear 
power 
to 
play 
a 
role 
in 
meeting 
national 
energy 
needs 
and 
in 
contributing 
to 
security 
of 
supply 
through 
diversity. 
Good 
progress 
was 
being 
made 
with 
the 
innovative 
pebble 
bed 
modular 
reactor 
and 
it 
was 
hoped 
that 
the 
demonstration 
plant 
would 
be 
completed 
by 
2011, 
with 
the 
first 
commercial 
modules 
planned 
for 
2013. 
The 
building 
of 
other 
baseload 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
using 
advanced 
versions 
of 
existing 
technologies 
was 
also 
under 
consideration, 
and 
a 
study 
of 
beneficiation 
of 
national 
uranium 
resources 
would 
be 
undertaken. 
A 
cost-benefit 
analysis 
would 
also 
be 
performed 
to 
determine 
which 
areas 
of 
the 
fuel 
cycle 
could 
be 
pursued. 
South 
Africa 
would 
be 
methodical 
in 
that 
process 
and 
would 
act 
within 
the 
confines 
of 
all 
its 
obligations. 
74. 
In 
July 
2005, 
the 
South 
African 
Government 
had 
approved 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
SAFARI-1 
research 
reactor 
at 
Pelindaba 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU 
fuel. 
The 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Corporation 
of 
South 
Africa 
was 
progressing 
well 
with 
the 
establishment 
of 
technology 
for 
manufacturing 
LEU 
silicide 
fuel. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
peer 
review 
team 
had 
made 
a 
favourable 
report 
on 
the 
demonstration 
of 
the 
borehole 
disposal 
concept 
for 
spent 
sealed 
sources, 
and 
the 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Corporation 
of 
South 
Africa 
had 
been 
contracted 
to 
design 
and 
construct 
a 
system 
for 
the 
safe 
handling 
of 
spent, 
high-activity 
radioactive 
sources. 
75. 
Under 
AFRA, 
South 
Africa 
had 
continued 
to 
send 
experts 
to 
participate 
in 
missions 
in 
AFRA 
Member 
States, 
in 
such 
fields 
as 
the 
promotion 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
self-reliance 
in 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology, 
the 
conditioning 
and 
safe 
storage 
of 
spent 
radium 
sources 
and 
the 
auditing 
of 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
facilities. 
South 
AfricaÂs 
appreciation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
support 
of 
the 
AFRA 
initiatives 
could 
not 
be 
overemphasized. 
76. 
South 
Africa 
highly 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
improve 
the 
lives 
of 
countless 
numbers 
of 
people 
and 
contribute 
to 
sustainable 
development. 
A 
new 
CPF 
for 
South 
Africa 
had 
been 
completed 
and 
her 
Government 
had 
set 
aside 
additional 
funding 
to 
scale 
up 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
the 
country 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ensuring 
their 
sustainability. 
The 
excellent 
support 
rendered 
by 
the 
Agency 
under 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
made 
an 
indelible 
contribution 
to 
her 
countryÂs 
socio-economic 
development, 
and 
South 
Africa 
would 
continue 
to 
pay 
its 
assessed 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
77. 
South 
Africa 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
skills 
development 
and 
was 
therefore 
pleased 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regional 
postgraduate 
course 
in 
radiation 
protection 
would 
resume 
the 
following 
year. 
78. 
South 
Africa 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
initiatives 
to 
harmonize 
and 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear, 
radiation, 
transport 
and 
waste 
safety 
through 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
safety 
standards 
programme. 
It 
continued 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
four 
safety 
standards 
committees 
and 
the 
Safety 
Standards 
Commission. 
The 
CommissionÂs 
recent 
endorsement 
of 
the 
Safety 
Fundamentals 
was 
a 
major 
step 
forward 
in 
harmonizing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Safety 
Standards 
Series. 
South 
Africa 
also 
welcomed 
the 
proposed 
revision 
of 
the 
Basic 
Safety 
Standards, 
given 
the 
need 
for 
consistency 
in 
international 
standards. 
Careful 
attention 
would 
however 
have 
to 
be 
given 
to 
the 
merit 
of 
any 
changes 
proposed 
during 
the 
revision 
process. 
79. 
South 
Africa 
strongly 
supported 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety, 
and 
had 
studied 
in 
detail 
the 
conclusions 
made 
in 
the 
summary 
report 
of 
the 
Third 
Review 
Meeting 
of 
the 
Convention, 
with 
the 
objective 
of 
identifying 
future 
potential 
shortcomings 
in 
the 
South 
African 
context 
and, 
where 
necessary, 
implementing 
preventive 
measures.

80. 
The 
South 
African 
parliament 
had 
approved 
the 
countryÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
and 
in 
November 
2005, 
the 
Government 
had 
approved 
the 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
policy 
and 
strategy. 
81. 
To 
assist 
in 
strengthening 
regulatory 
effectiveness 
on 
a 
regional 
basis, 
South 
Africa 
was 
investigating 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
regional 
nuclear 
safety 
regulatory 
forum 
that 
would 
seek 
to 
promote 
the 
strengthening 
of 
regulatory 
frameworks 
and 
infrastructure, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
harmonization 
of 
safety 
standards. 
South 
Africa 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
82. 
South 
Africa 
welcomed 
the 
report 
by 
the 
External 
Auditor 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
2005 
and 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
assessed 
contributions 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full, 
so 
as 
to 
assure 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
major 
programmes. 
83. 
It 
was 
imperative 
that 
the 
Agency 
remain 
diligent 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
continued 
development 
and 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
taking 
into 
consideration 
the 
needs 
of 
under-developed 
areas 
of 
the 
world. 
South 
Africa 
remained 
fully 
committed 
to 
assisting 
in 
those 
efforts. 
84. 
Mr. 
CAPPAGLI 
(Argentina) 
congratulated 
Malawi, 
Montenegro, 
Mozambique 
and 
Palau 
on 
becoming 
new 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
welcomed 
the 
new 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
that 
had 
been 
signed 
over 
the 
previous 
year. 
85. 
The 
world 
was 
at 
a 
crucial 
stage 
in 
terms 
of 
the 
shared 
objectives 
that 
inspired 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
Argentina 
firmly 
believed 
in 
the 
right 
of 
all 
countries 
to 
develop 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
including 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
international 
obligations. 
Any 
attempt 
to 
alter 
the 
delicate 
balance 
of 
rights 
and 
obligations 
set 
forth 
in 
the 
NPT, 
calling 
into 
question 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
StatesÂ 
efforts 
to 
develop 
technologies 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes 
could 
undermine 
the 
widely-accepted 
NPT 
regime. 
Any 
proposal 
for 
modification 
that 
could 
be 
interpreted 
as 
being 
unjust 
and 
sought 
to 
reallocate 
rights 
and 
obligations 
ran 
the 
risk 
of 
weakening 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
that 
Argentina 
strongly 
supported. 
Such 
would 
be 
the 
case 
for 
any 
initiative 
seeking 
to 
curtail 
State 
sovereignty 
and 
the 
independent 
ownership 
and 
control 
of 
a 
key 
technological 
sector, 
such 
as 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
thus 
restricting 
the 
potential 
benefits 
of 
those 
activities 
and 
technologies 
to 
a 
small 
number 
of 
countries. 
However, 
given 
the 
current 
challenges 
faced, 
continued 
efforts 
needed 
to 
be 
made 
to 
find 
solutions 
to 
the 
problems 
of 
proliferation 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
those 
in 
compliance 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT 
could 
reap 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
86. 
The 
most 
important 
development 
in 
Argentina's 
nuclear 
activities 
over 
the 
previous 
year 
had 
been 
the 
Government's 
decision 
to 
resume 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
country 
and 
the 
adoption 
of 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
operational 
capacity 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
sector. 
A 
nuclear 
plan 
for 
the 
short 
and 
medium 
term, 
which 
focused 
on 
the 
large-scale 
generation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
industry, 
had 
been 
developed. 
The 
nuclear 
option 
would 
be 
consolidated 
through 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
Atucha 
II 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
Embalse 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
the 
conduct 
of 
preliminary 
feasibility 
studies 
regarding 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
fourth 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Argentina, 
and 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
prototype 
of 
the 
CAREM 
reactor. 
The 
nuclear 
plan 
further 
aimed 
at 
improving 
the 
management 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle: 
technological 
capacities 
for 
design 
engineering 
would 
be 
strengthened; 
enrichment 
activities 
at 
the 
Pilcaniyeu 
plant 
resumed; 
uranium 
mining 
revived; 
and 
the 
production 
of 
heavy 
water 
at 
the 
Arroyito 
plant 
resumed. 
The 
resumption 
of 
enrichment 
activities 
would 
not 
only 
place 
Argentina 
among 
those 
countries 
that 
possessed 
such 
technology, 
but 
also 
enable 
it 
to 
meet 
the 
demand 
for 
LEU 
for 
its 
research 
and 
power 
reactors, 
and 
for 
reactors 
exported 
to 
third 
countries.

87. 
Argentina 
had 
always 
been 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
to 
non-proliferation. 
It 
was 
party 
to 
several 
legally 
binding 
instruments, 
which 
provided 
the 
international 
community 
with 
assurances 
regarding 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
national 
nuclear 
programmes, 
such 
as 
the 
NPT, 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty. 
Argentina 
was 
also 
a 
member 
of 
the 
NSG 
and 
had 
concluded 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements. 
Strict 
national 
legislation 
governed 
the 
transfer 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology, 
equipment 
and 
materials. 
88. 
With 
regard 
to 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
field 
of 
health, 
he 
said 
that 
an 
image 
diagnostics 
centre 
would 
be 
opening 
shortly 
in 
Buenos 
Aires. 
Its 
state-of-the-art 
equipment 
would 
make 
it 
one 
of 
the 
most 
advanced 
centres 
in 
South 
America 
for 
oncology, 
cardiology 
and 
neurology. 
The 
centre 
would 
offer 
assistance 
to 
the 
public, 
carry 
out 
medical 
science 
research 
and 
train 
highly 
qualified 
nuclear 
medicine 
specialists. 
89. 
The 
National 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
was 
currently 
reorganizing 
its 
science 
and 
technology 
programmes 
into 
four 
broad 
thematic 
areas: 
nuclear 
energy, 
nuclear 
applications, 
security 
and 
the 
environment, 
and 
research 
and 
non-nuclear 
applications. 
The 
programmes 
would 
cover 
projects 
and 
developments 
with 
respect 
to 
power 
and 
research 
reactors, 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
spent 
fuel 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
nuclear 
energy 
applications, 
and 
relevant 
research 
and 
development. 
90. 
Argentina 
would 
continue 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
joint 
international 
efforts 
to 
develop 
new 
generation 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
with 
greater 
operational 
safety 
that 
produced 
much 
less 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
ensured 
that 
there 
was 
no 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation. 
One 
such 
example 
was 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
project, 
to 
which 
Argentina 
had 
provided 
cost-free 
experts 
and 
extrabudgetary 
contributions. 
91. 
In 
line 
with 
the 
conclusions 
of 
the 
2004 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
International 
PartnersÂ 
Conference, 
Argentina 
was 
converting 
the 
core 
of 
the 
RA-6 
reactor 
Â 
the 
only 
HEU 
research 
reactor 
in 
operation 
in 
Argentina 
Â 
to 
LEU. 
The 
return 
to 
the 
State 
of 
origin 
almost 
all 
uranium 
enriched 
to 
90% 
had 
been 
initiated 
and 
was 
due 
to 
be 
completed 
in 
2007. 
92. 
Argentina 
remained 
open 
to 
establishing 
and 
strengthening 
cooperation 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
both 
multilaterally 
and 
through 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
ARCAL. 
It 
sponsored 
courses, 
workshops 
and 
scientific 
meetings, 
trained 
fellows 
and 
foreign 
visiting 
scientists, 
and 
made 
experts 
and 
lecturers 
available 
to 
the 
Agency. 
Furthermore, 
it 
had 
concluded 
bilateral 
cooperation 
agreements 
on 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
with 
over 
30 
countries. 
93. 
Argentina 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
with 
respect 
to 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
and 
the 
safe 
transport 
and 
management 
of 
waste. 
The 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
fostering 
a 
safety 
culture 
was 
particularly 
noteworthy. 
He 
drew 
attention 
to 
steps 
taken 
regarding 
information 
and 
communication 
networks 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
and 
to 
the 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
national 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
for 
the 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
The 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Nuclear 
Regulators, 
which 
Uruguay 
had 
recently 
joined, 
also 
carried 
out 
a 
number 
of 
relevant 
activities. 
94. 
With 
regard 
to 
radiation 
protection, 
the 
twelfth 
International 
Congress 
of 
the 
International 
Radiation 
Protection 
Association 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Buenos 
Aires 
in 
2008. 
The 
Congress 
had 
been 
declared 
an 
event 
of 
national 
interest 
and 
would 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
international 
safety 
standards. 
His 
Government 
hoped 
that 
the 
Secretariat 
would 
lend 
its 
support 
to 
the 
event 
to 
ensure 
a 
successful 
outcome.

95. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
the 
area 
of 
physical 
security 
helped 
to 
promote 
coordination 
of 
relevant 
national 
and 
international 
efforts. 
In 
implementing 
those 
activities 
however, 
the 
Agency 
should 
bear 
the 
different 
treatment 
to 
be 
given 
to 
nuclear 
and 
non-nuclear 
radioactive 
materials, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
dealing 
with 
the 
issue 
in 
a 
balanced 
manner 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
any 
negative 
impact 
on 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
the 
Agency 
gave 
priority 
to 
those 
areas 
and 
activities 
clearly 
defined 
in 
its 
Statute, 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
problems 
associated 
with 
orphan 
sources 
and 
high-risk 
sources. 
96. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system 
was 
an 
effective 
mechanism 
to 
provide 
the 
international 
community 
with 
assurances 
of 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
programmes. 
However, 
Argentina 
would 
encourage 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
strive 
for 
greater 
efficiency 
in 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards, 
and 
noted 
that 
a 
profound 
cultural 
change 
was 
required 
for 
the 
adequate 
design 
and 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
He 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
Brazilian-Argentine 
Agency 
for 
Accounting 
and 
Control 
of 
Nuclear 
Materials, 
noting 
that 
cooperation 
between 
ABACC 
and 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
be 
consolidated 
for 
the 
more 
effective 
and 
efficient 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
connection 
with 
the 
Quadripartite 
Agreement. 
The 
fifteenth 
anniversary 
of 
ABACC 
in 
July 
2006 
had 
been 
an 
incentive 
to 
continue 
working 
towards 
that 
goal. 
97. 
The 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
with 
regard 
to 
education 
and 
training 
in 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
were 
essential. 
Argentina 
had 
recently 
requested 
an 
Agency 
expert 
mission 
with 
a 
view 
to 
qualification 
as 
regional 
education 
and 
training 
centre 
for 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean, 
which 
would 
allow 
it 
to 
share 
the 
experience 
gained 
by 
running 
postgraduate 
courses 
in 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
for 
more 
than 
25 
years. 
His 
Government 
had 
already 
begun 
to 
implement 
the 
plan 
of 
action 
set 
out 
in 
the 
missionÂs 
final 
report. 
It 
was 
willing 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
development 
of 
a 
long-term 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
support 
the 
continuing 
provision 
of 
regional 
postgraduate 
courses 
and 
facilitate 
the 
introduction 
of 
other 
specialized 
courses 
and 
a 
range 
of 
training 
activities. 
98. 
Mr. 
SAEED 
(Sudan) 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
strategy 
it 
had 
developed 
over 
the 
previous 
50 
years 
to 
serve 
the 
interests 
and 
meet 
the 
needs 
of 
its 
Member 
States, 
and 
on 
its 
unstinting 
efforts 
to 
promote 
safe 
and 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
thereby 
helping 
to 
achieve 
at 
least 
five 
of 
the 
eight 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
relating 
to 
environmental 
sustainability, 
combating 
disease, 
reducing 
hunger 
and 
poverty 
and 
ensuring 
maternal 
and 
child 
health. 
99. 
The 
NPT 
was 
a 
key 
international 
instrument 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
strengthening 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
All 
parties 
to 
the 
Treaty 
must 
therefore 
comply 
to 
the 
full 
with 
their 
obligations 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
They 
should 
also 
promote 
awareness 
of 
their 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
Articles 
I, 
II 
and 
III 
of 
the 
Treaty 
and 
of 
the 
provisions 
relating 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
set 
out 
in 
Article 
IV. 
100. 
The 
Conference 
on 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
the 
21st 
Century 
convened 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
Paris 
in 
March 
2005 
had 
been 
a 
turning 
point 
in 
terms 
of 
peopleÂs 
perception 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
the 
key 
to 
meeting 
the 
energy 
needs 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries 
and 
ensuring 
sustainable 
development. 
Developing 
countries 
that 
were 
introducing 
a 
nuclear 
power 
programme 
faced 
a 
major 
challenge 
in 
establishing 
an 
appropriate 
infrastructure. 
Sudan 
hoped 
to 
obtain 
the 
requisite 
support 
in 
that 
regard. 
101. 
His 
country 
recognized 
the 
alienable 
right 
of 
all 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
use 
and 
produce 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
to 
undertake 
research 
without 
discrimination. 
It 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
IranÂs 
constructive 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reassuring 
the 
international 
community 
about 
the 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme, 
and 
encouraged 
both 
Iran 
and 
the 
international

community 
to 
pursue 
diplomatic 
negotiations 
transparently 
and 
in 
good 
faith 
to 
ensure 
that 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
did 
not 
deviate 
from 
its 
peaceful 
path. 


102. 
Sudan 
considered 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
NWFZs 
was 
an 
effective 
means 
of 
ensuring 
non-
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
complete 
disarmament. 
It 
therefore 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
apply 
safeguards 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
necessary 
step 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
a 
zone 
in 
order 
to 
protect 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region 
from 
the 
use 
or 
threat 
of 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
All 
States 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
were 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
except 
Israel, 
which 
had 
clearly 
no 
intention 
of 
permitting 
the 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
Â 
a 
position 
that 
constituted 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
region. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
States, 
especially 
those 
possessing 
nuclear 
weapons, 
to 
bring 
pressure 
to 
bear 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
and 
the 
Security 
Council 
to 
compel 
Israel 
to 
comply 
with 
United 
Nations 
resolutions, 
in 
particular 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981) 
and 
Agency 
resolutions 
urging 
it 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Israel 
should 
furthermore 
announce 
its 
intention 
to 
abandon 
its 
nuclear 
armament 
programme 
and 
present 
a 
full 
description 
of 
its 
existing 
arsenal 
and 
nuclear 
materials 
to 
the 
Security 
Council 
and 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
103. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
partnership 
with 
international 
and 
regional 
development 
organizations 
to 
promote 
African 
development 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
trade, 
human 
resources 
development, 
combating 
malaria, 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
and 
HIV/AIDS, 
science 
and 
technology 
and 
infrastructure 
development. 
He 
stressed, 
however, 
that 
more 
financial 
resources 
and 
technical 
skills 
and 
further 
coordinated 
efforts 
were 
needed 
to 
combat 
malaria, 
an 
activity 
to 
which 
Sudan 
gave 
high 
priority. 
Molecular 
methods 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
use 
of 
isotopes 
had 
proved 
successful 
in 
the 
early 
detection 
of 
asymptomatic 
disease 
vectors. 
Such 
techniques 
had 
helped 
to 
prevent 
the 
spread 
of 
malaria 
during 
the 
dry 
season 
in 
villages 
used 
for 
pilot 
projects. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
experiments 
in 
applying 
the 
sterile 
insect 
technique 
to 
malaria 
would 
also 
be 
successful. 
104. 
Another 
obstacle 
to 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
in 
Africa 
was 
trypanosomiasis. 
The 
Agency's 
technical 
and 
practical 
assistance 
to 
African 
States 
in 
establishing 
tsetse-free 
zones 
by 
using 
the 
sterile 
insect 
technique 
was 
highly 
appreciated. 
He 
also 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
strategic 
partnership 
with 
the 
African 
Development 
Bank 
in 
eradicating 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
and 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
sponsorship 
of 
the 
bilateral 
agreement 
on 
tsetse 
fly 
eradication 
between 
Sudan 
and 
Ethiopia. 
105. 
As 
the 
average 
number 
of 
cancer 
cases 
had 
been 
steadily 
increasing 
in 
Sudan, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
for 
the 
countryÂs 
anti-cancer 
programme 
and 
the 
training 
of 
human 
resources 
would 
be 
appreciated, 
as 
would 
its 
continued 
support 
for 
the 
project 
to 
establish 
a 
national 
radiotherapy 
network. 
106. 
He 
praised 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
promoting 
cooperation 
among 
African 
countries 
through 
the 
Model 
Project 
on 
radiation 
protection, 
and 
enhancement 
of 
capacities 
through 
the 
coordination 
of 
legislation 
and 
human 
resources 
development. 
He 
trusted 
that 
further 
support 
would 
be 
provided 
through 
the 
proposed 
projects. 
107. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
partnership 
between 
the 
Agency, 
the 
UNDP 
and 
the 
GEF 
in 
support 
of 
the 
countries 
sharing 
the 
Nubian 
sandstone 
aquifer 
system, 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
those 
joint 
efforts 
would 
result 
in 
the 
rationalized 
use 
of 
water 
resources. 
He 
also 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
connection 
with 
an 
action 
programme 
for 
the 
integrated 
management 
of 
the 
aquifer 
and 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
its 
work 
on 
the 
use 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
to 
define 
the 
characteristics 
of 
the 
aquifer 
would 
prove 
successful. 
Sudan 
supported 
the 
relevant 
national 
and 
regional 
plans 
of 
action 
concluded 
by 
all 
parties 
in 
December 
2005.

108. 
His 
country 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
complete 
its 
consultations 
with 
the 
UNDP 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
in 
water 
resources 
management 
in 
support 
of 
the 
Nile 
Basin 
Initiative 
(involving 
Sudan, 
Ethiopia, 
Kenya, 
Uganda 
and 
Tanzania) 
aimed 
at 
determining 
the 
water 
balance 
in 
Lake 
Victoria, 
the 
Upper 
Nile 
Basin 
and 
the 
Blue 
Nile 
Basin. 
109. 
The 
AFRA 
agreement 
had 
proved 
highly 
successful 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
human 
resources 
development, 
food 
security, 
health, 
and 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safety. 
Sudan 
strongly 
supported 
its 
programmes 
for 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
and 
coordination 
of 
nuclear 
science 
curricula. 
AFRA 
also 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
streamlining 
and 
coordinating 
technical 
cooperation 
frameworks 
among 
African 
countries 
involved 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
regional 
projects 
under 
major 
programmes 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
similarity 
between 
AFRAÂs 
programmes 
and 
those 
of 
NEPAD, 
some 
kind 
of 
arrangement 
should 
be 
made 
for 
cooperation. 
110. 
Sudan 
had 
established 
an 
Academy 
of 
Sciences 
specializing 
in 
fields 
including 
nuclear 
science. 
It 
had 
begun 
to 
implement 
a 
masterÂs 
programme 
in 
medical 
physics, 
which 
would 
be 
of 
valuable 
assistance 
to 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
services, 
as 
well 
as 
a 
diploma 
in 
nuclear 
science 
which 
would 
serve 
as 
a 
basic 
qualification 
for 
those 
wishing 
to 
obtain 
a 
master's 
degree 
and 
a 
doctorate 
in 
nuclear 
science. 
111. 
Mr. 
KAMWI 
(Namibia) 
acknowledged 
the 
immense 
contribution 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
over 
the 
past 
fifty 
years 
towards 
safeguarding 
world 
peace 
and 
developing 
nuclear 
technologies 
for 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
socio-economic 
condition 
of 
peoples 
around 
the 
globe. 
112. 
Namibia 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
platform 
for 
collaboration 
and 
cooperation 
with 
Member 
States 
under 
the 
CPF, 
and 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
integrating 
the 
CPF 
into 
national 
development 
plans. 
NamibiaÂs 
CPF 
was 
currently 
under 
review, 
at 
a 
time 
when 
its 
Third 
National 
Developmental 
Plan, 
which 
defined 
the 
strategy 
for 
attaining 
the 
Vision 
2030 
goals, 
was 
also 
being 
elaborated. 
The 
CPF 
was 
playing 
a 
pivotal 
role 
in 
helping 
realize 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Second 
National 
Developmental 
Plan 
and 
had 
contributed 
towards 
achieving 
those 
of 
Vision 
2030 
and 
the 
targets 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
113. 
Nearly 
ten 
years 
had 
elapsed 
since 
the 
establishment, 
through 
collaborative 
efforts 
with 
the 
Agency, 
of 
a 
radiation 
therapy 
centre 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
cancer. 
During 
that 
period, 
an 
average 
of 
500 
patients, 
who 
would 
otherwise 
have 
not 
had 
access 
to 
such 
treatment, 
had 
been 
treated 
annually. 
An 
estimated 
2 
000 
persons 
contracted 
cancer 
in 
Namibia 
every 
year, 
and 
the 
service 
must 
be 
strengthened 
and 
expanded 
to 
the 
heavily 
populated 
northern 
regions. 
The 
high 
cancer 
incidence 
rate 
identified 
was 
an 
indication 
of 
good 
diagnostic 
capabilities 
through 
the 
application 
of 
radioisotopes. 
114. 
Malaria 
was 
the 
prime 
cause 
of 
illness 
in 
Namibia. 
The 
Agency's 
efforts 
to 
improve 
malaria 
diagnostic 
techniques 
and 
develop 
the 
SIT 
for 
the 
eradication 
of 
malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes 
would 
complement 
existing 
tools 
to 
control 
the 
disease. 
115. 
Namibia 
was 
encouraged 
by 
the 
Agency's 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
capacity 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
developing 
and 
assessing 
nutrition 
intervention 
programmes 
for 
HIV/AIDS 
management, 
particularly 
for 
children. 
It 
hoped 
to 
draw 
from 
the 
Agency's 
expertise 
and 
the 
experiences 
of 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
the 
initiative 
a 
viable 
option 
for 
its 
National 
AIDS 
Control 
Programme. 
116. 
Food 
security 
was 
a 
high 
priority 
in 
NamibiaÂs 
national 
development 
plans, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
challenges 
had 
still 
to 
be 
met. 
In 
ensuring 
food 
security, 
priority 
had 
been 
given 
to 
improving 
agricultural 
productivity, 
enhancing 
accessibility 
to 
water 
for 
the 
population 
in 
rural 
areas 
and 
preventing 
environmental 
degradation, 
which 
was 
due 
mostly 
to 
intensive 
livestock 
production. 
The 
Agency 
had 
made 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
capacity-building 
for 
the 
integration 
and 
applications 
of 

GC(50)/OR.2

isotope 
techniques 
in 
the 
agricultural 
sector. 
That 
capacity 
must 
be 
strengthened 
and 
sustained 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
Vision 
2030 
objectives. 
The 
northern 
part 
of 
the 
country 
still 
needed 
to 
be 
freed 
from 
epizootic 
diseases 
among 
livestock, 
mainly 
contagious 
bovine 
pleuropneumonia 
and 
foot 
and 
mouth 
disease, 
giving 
the 
inhabitants 
access 
to 
international 
beef 
markets. 
The 
Agency 
had 
assisted 
in 
the 
establishment 
of 
diagnostic 
facilities 
at 
the 
Central 
Veterinary 
Laboratory 
in 
Windhoek. 
A 
similar 
capacity 
level 
was 
planned 
for 
Ondangwa, 
in 
the 
north. 
Namibia 
would 
host 
the 
coordination 
meeting 
to 
review 
the 
project 
and 
devise 
work 
plans 
for 
the 
control 
of 
contagious 
bovine 
pleuropneumonia. 


117. 
Namibia 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
the 
enormous 
contribution 
being 
made 
under 
the 
AFRA, 
ARASIA, 
ARCAL 
and 
RCA 
regional 
agreements 
to 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
socio-economic 
development, 
and 
trusted 
that 
adequate 
funding 
would 
be 
allocated 
in 
that 
regard. 
118. 
Namibia 
valued 
the 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
sustainable 
utilization 
and 
management 
of 
land 
and 
water. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
through 
existing 
projects 
would 
accelerate 
the 
development 
and 
adoption 
of 
improved 
soil, 
water 
and 
nutrient 
management 
practices 
to 
support 
crop 
and 
livestock 
production. 
The 
use 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
to 
promote 
the 
understanding 
and 
management 
of 
underground 
water 
resources 
was 
highly 
appreciated. 
Isotopic 
investigations 
in 
the 
Oshivelo 
and 
Stampriet 
aquifers 
had 
been 
concluded, 
and 
considerable 
success 
had 
been 
achieved 
in 
developing 
local 
capabilities 
and 
creating 
awareness 
of 
the 
potential 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
techniques. 
As 
a 
result, 
activities 
were 
being 
expanded, 
and 
new 
and 
similar 
projects 
were 
currently 
underway 
in 
the 
Platveld, 
Kalahari, 
Hochfeld 
and 
Cuvelai 
Basin 
aquifers. 
Namibia 
would 
also 
consider 
the 
merits 
of 
sea 
water 
desalination 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
way 
of 
addressing 
its 
water-resource 
needs 
within 
the 
CPF 
context. 
119. 
Of 
equal 
importance 
to 
food 
security 
was 
the 
countryÂs 
fisheries 
and 
marine 
resources. 
Phase 
I 
of 
the 
regional 
project 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
sustainable 
development 
and 
management 
of 
the 
marine 
coastal 
environment 
had 
been 
successfully 
concluded. 
A 
task 
force 
had 
mapped 
out 
future 
activities 
under 
Phase 
II 
of 
the 
project. 
120. 
Namibia 
was 
becoming 
one 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
largest 
uranium 
mining 
countries. 
That 
activity 
and 
the 
ever-increasing 
use 
of 
sealed 
radioactive 
and 
other 
sources 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
called 
for 
stringent 
controls 
and 
monitoring 
to 
avoid 
or 
minimize 
the 
radiological 
risks 
associated 
with 
nuclear 
technology 
applications. 
Namibia 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
internationally 
recommended 
radiation 
safety 
standards, 
such 
as 
the 
International 
Basic 
Safety 
Standards 
and 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
It 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
provisions 
of 
those 
instruments 
would 
be 
accommodated 
in 
the 
national 
legislative 
framework 
and 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
Namibia 
in 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
its 
regulatory 
infrastructure, 
which 
would 
help 
to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
all 
sources 
and 
activities 
involving 
ionizing 
radiation. 
121. 
Namibia 
was 
preparing 
to 
meet 
its 
obligations 
under 
international 
treaties 
and 
conventions 
within 
the 
scope 
of 
the 
Agency 
mandate. 
Preparations 
included 
the 
creation 
of 
an 
institutional 
infrastructure 
to 
fulfil 
those 
obligations 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Atomic 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Act. 
Legislation 
was 
in 
place 
that 
would 
enable 
Namibia 
to 
be 
in 
compliance 
once 
it 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
relevant 
instruments. 
122. 
The 
success 
of 
NamibiaÂs 
development 
goals 
depended 
on 
the 
financial 
and 
human 
resources 
at 
its 
disposal. 
His 
delegation 
acknowledged 
the 
role 
that 
the 
Agency 
and 
donor 
Governments 
had 
played 
in 
developing 
its 
core 
group 
of 
specialists 
in 
nuclear 
applications, 
and 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
allocate 
adequate 
resources 
to 
technical 
programmes 
to 
enhance 
NamibiaÂs 
capabilities 
to 
apply 
nuclear 
technology 
effectively 
in 
order 
to 
attain 
the 
Vision 
2030 
goals. 
123. 
Namibia 
would 
continue 
to 
meet 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
It 
was, 
however, 
concerned 
about 
the 
lack 
of 
funding 
of 
activities 
related 
to 
nuclear 
science 
and

technology, 
and 
urged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
explore 
possibilities 
for 
resource 
mobilization 
to 
ensure 
that 
work 
in 
those 
fields 
was 
carried 
out. 
The 
Agency 
should 
also 
make 
concerted 
efforts 
to 
inform 
the 
international 
community 
about 
its 
initiatives 
in 
the 
area 
of 
socio-economic 
development. 


124. 
Mr. 
HADHRI 
(Tunisia) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
and 
welcomed 
the 
decision 
to 
use 
the 
prize 
money 
awarded 
to 
the 
Agency 
to 
set 
up 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund. 
125. 
Tunisia 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
developing 
countries 
to 
establish 
an 
integrated 
national 
research 
and 
development 
and 
technological 
modernization 
programme. 
In 
2004, 
1% 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
GDP 
had 
been 
earmarked 
for 
research 
and 
development, 
and 
it 
was 
hoped 
to 
increase 
that 
figure 
to 
1.25%. 
Modern 
scientific 
and 
technological 
advances 
were 
being 
adapted, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
international 
bodies, 
for 
use 
in 
TunisiaÂs 
development 
programmes. 
126. 
During 
the 
current 
year, 
the 
Agency 
was 
financing 
13 
national 
projects 
in 
different 
sectors 
and 
Tunisia 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
41 
regional 
and 
7 
interregional 
projects. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
extend 
its 
customary 
support 
to 
the 
proposed 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
for 
2007 
and 
2008. 
Tunisia 
had 
also 
begun 
work 
on 
its 
CPF 
for 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
the 
period 
2007-2011 
and 
hoped 
to 
produce 
a 
final 
version 
in 
consultation 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
its 
adoption 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
opportunity. 
127. 
Soaring 
energy 
prices 
in 
world 
markets 
were 
seriously 
impeding 
development 
efforts. 
Tunisia, 
which 
had 
limited 
stocks 
of 
fossil 
fuels, 
was 
therefore 
seriously 
thinking 
of 
switching 
to 
alternative 
energy 
sources. 
It 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
need 
to 
build 
a 
medium-sized 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
by 
2015 
and 
hoped 
to 
reach 
agreement 
on 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard. 
128. 
Tunisia 
was 
seeking 
to 
consolidate 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
friendly 
countries 
in 
promoting 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
to 
that 
end 
hosted 
the 
headquarters 
of 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency, 
which 
served 
the 
joint 
interests 
of 
the 
Arab 
States. 
He 
renewed 
his 
call 
for 
closer 
cooperation 
and 
a 
scientific 
partnership 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Arab 
counterpart 
with 
a 
view 
to 
assisting 
the 
latter 
in 
implementing 
its 
programmes, 
whose 
objectives 
coincided 
with 
those 
of 
the 
Agency. 
129. 
Tunisia 
also 
continued 
to 
cooperate 
with 
African 
States, 
particularly 
under 
the 
AFRA 
Agreement, 
and 
was 
currently 
participating 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
16 
projects. 
It 
had 
so 
far 
hosted 
two 
workshops 
during 
2006 
and 
planned 
to 
host 
five 
more 
later 
in 
the 
year. 
It 
continued 
to 
place 
its 
human 
resources 
and 
scientific 
and 
research 
facilities 
at 
the 
disposal 
of 
African 
trainees 
and 
had 
so 
far 
hosted 
nine 
recipients 
of 
Agency 
fellowships. 
It 
was 
prepared 
to 
welcome 
more 
trainees 
in 
the 
future. 
130. 
Tunisia 
consistently 
sought 
to 
honour 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
by 
paying 
its 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
the 
TCF 
and 
its 
share 
of 
national 
participation 
costs. 
It 
had 
completed 
the 
constitutional 
formalities 
required 
for 
ratification 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
XIV.A 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
on 
12 
June 
2006 
and 
expected 
to 
complete 
the 
formalities 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
amendment 
to 
Article 
VI 
within 
weeks. 
131. 
Full 
enjoyment 
of 
the 
benefits 
of 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
sustainable 
development 
should 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
action 
to 
ensure 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
materials, 
support 
for 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
to 
avert 
the 
risks 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
and 
appropriate 
steps 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism 
while 
respecting 
relevant 
provisions 
of 
international 
law 
that 
guaranteed 
every 
countryÂs 
right 
to 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
energy. 
Tunisia, 
which 
had 
concluded 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
reiterated 
its 
request 
for 
assistance 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
establishing 
a 
State 
system 
of 
accounting 
for 
and 
control 
of 
nuclear 
materials 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
keep 
a 
record 
of 
such 
materials 
as 
well 
as 
materials 
used 
for 
non-nuclear 
purposes.

132. 
Like 
other 
Arab 
countries, 
all 
of 
which 
were 
parties 
to 
the 
NPT, 
Tunisia 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
including 
nuclear 
weapons, 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
However, 
IsraelÂs 
continued 
defiance 
of 
the 
international 
community 
by 
refusing 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
constituted 
a 
permanent 
threat 
to 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
Tunisia 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
about 
that 
situation 
and 
called 
on 
the 
General 
Conference 
to 
urge 
Israel 
to 
ratify 
the 
relevant 
international 
treaties, 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
open 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
to 
Agency 
inspection 
in 
order 
to 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
a 
just 
and 
lasting 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
133. 
Mr. 
VARGAS 
CARREÃO 
(Agency 
for 
the 
Prohibition 
of 
Nuclear 
Weapons 
in 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean) 
referred 
to 
the 
main 
provisions 
of 
the 
Treaty 
of 
Tlatelolco 
establishing 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone, 
to 
which 
all 
33 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
States 
were 
parties. 
Pursuant 
to 
Additional 
Protocol 
II 
to 
the 
Treaty, 
China, 
France, 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
of 
Great 
Britain 
and 
Northern 
Ireland 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
had 
undertaken 
not 
to 
use 
or 
threaten 
to 
use 
nuclear 
weapons 
against 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
of 
the 
Treaty. 
That 
guarantee 
of 
nuclear 
security 
for 
the 
region 
was 
of 
enormous 
importance, 
but 
further 
progress 
could 
also 
be 
made 
if 
the 
nuclear 
powers 
withdrew 
or 
modified 
those 
parts 
of 
the 
interpretative 
declarations 
in 
respect 
of 
the 
Treaty 
that 
they 
had 
formulated 
in 
other 
circumstances 
several 
decades 
previously. 
134. 
The 
Treaty 
of 
Tlatelolco 
had 
inspired 
the 
Treaties 
of 
Rarotonga, 
Bangkok, 
Pelindaba 
and 
Semipalatinsk 
establishing 
of 
NWFZs 
in 
other 
regions. 
In 
all, 
some 
115 
States 
were 
parties 
to 
the 
five 
NWFZ 
treaties. 
OPANAL 
was 
confident 
that 
such 
zones 
could 
also 
be 
established 
in 
other 
regions. 
135. 
The 
existence 
of 
the 
NWFZs 
had 
given 
rise 
to 
the 
need 
for 
mutual 
cooperation 
on 
a 
common 
policy 
towards 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States, 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
and 
various 
disarmament 
fora, 
and 
the 
Agency 
in 
particular. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
first 
Conference 
of 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zones 
that 
had 
been 
held 
in 
April 
2005 
in 
Mexico 
City, 
at 
which 
the 
parties 
to 
the 
Treaties 
of 
Tlatelolco, 
Rarotonga, 
Bangkok 
and 
Pelindaba, 
and 
Mongolia, 
had 
drafted 
a 
declaration 
setting 
out 
their 
positions 
and 
agreed 
to 
establish 
a 
coordination 
and 
cooperation 
mechanism. 
Many 
of 
the 
viewpoints 
set 
out 
in 
the 
declaration 
referred 
specifically 
to 
the 
important 
role 
that 
the 
Agency 
played. 
136. 
The 
commitments 
into 
which 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
had 
entered 
under 
the 
Treaty 
of 
Tlatelolco 
would 
be 
meaningless 
without 
an 
effective 
system 
for 
monitoring, 
safeguards 
and 
verification. 
While 
reaffirming 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination, 
OPANAL 
underscored 
the 
Agency's 
important 
contribution 
in 
verifying 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
used 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
It 
reiterated 
its 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
applying 
and 
verifying 
the 
international 
safeguards 
regime 
provided 
for 
in 
both 
the 
Treaty 
of 
Tlatelolco 
and 
the 
NPT, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime, 
including 
the 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol. 
137. 
OPANAL 
sought 
to 
intensify 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
been 
ongoing 
since 
972. 
It 
was 
important 
for 
the 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
system 
to 
function 
as 
smoothly 
as 
possible, 
so 
that 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
could 
be 
ensured 
while 
regional 
interests 
were 
preserved. 
The 
regional 
seminar 
on 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
held 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
Quito, 
Ecuador, 
in 
April 
and 
attended 
by 
OPANAL, 
testified 
to 
the 
latterÂs 
growing 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
138. 
OPANAL 
also 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
that 
had 
made 
valuable 
contributions 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
human 
health, 
food 
and 
environmental 
protection, 
in 
particular 
for 
developing 
countries.

139. 
Lastly, 
OPANAL 
actively 
supported 
the 
Agency's 
initiatives 
to 
confront 
the 
growing 
danger 
that 
non-State 
actors 
might 
gain 
access 
to 
nuclear 
weapons. 
The 
best 
way 
of 
preventing 
such 
an 
eventuality 
was 
through 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons.

(GC(50)/4) 
1. Mr. BUGAT (France) said that the fiftieth regular session of the General Conference was an 
opportunity to take stock of what had made the Agency a success. The organizationÂs strength lay in 
the balance between its three main areas of activity: safeguards, technology and verification; and 
between the right to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and the obligation to respect all 
international non-proliferation commitments. The challenges in the latter area were numerous and the 
international community had to remain ready to strengthen the non-proliferation regime, of which the 
NPT was the cornerstone. France therefore supported initiatives by the G8, the European Union and 
others promoting universal adherence to safeguards, and called upon all States which had not yet done 
so to sign and ratify an additional protocol to their safeguards agreement. It welcomed the AgencyÂs 
efforts to improve the effectiveness of the safeguards system, in particular by developing new 
information management tools and new monitoring techniques. 
2. Closer control over transfer of sensitive nuclear technology, equipment and material was 
equally necessary to prevent proliferation and the Agency had a central role to play in providing 
assurances that nuclear technology and equipment were only being used for peaceful purposes. In that 
connection, France hoped that the CTBT would enter into force soon and supported the initiation of 
negotiations in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament on a fissile material cut-off treaty. 
3. France was fully engaged in the efforts to resolve the issues raised by the nuclear programme of 
Iran. A negotiated solution needed to be found which met the legitimate demands of the international 
community. 
4. The risk of nuclear or radioactive material being used for terrorist acts was a concern which had 
not diminished. The Agency had a vital role to play in ensuring the security of nuclear material and 
installations and France supported its activities in that area both financially and technically. It 
welcomed the efforts to achieve ratification of the amendment to the CPPNM, and the work of AdSec. 
5. France strongly supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, paid its contributions 
to the TCF in full every year and made extrabudgetary contributions to footnote-a/ projects. He 
pointed out that the financing of technical cooperation was the joint responsibility of all States. France 
was also involved in relevant bilateral cooperation projects and had recently signed an agreement with 
Libya on the production of medical radioisotopes and nuclear desalination technology. 
6. His country greatly appreciated the AgencyÂs activities in the field of nuclear safety. It had 
requested an IRRS mission which should be conducted towards the end of 2006. It likewise 
appreciated the work of the Commission on Safety Standards and welcomed the adoption of the 
Fundamental Safety Principles covering all aspects of safety. He called upon all States to ratify the 
Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and 
on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. France was also continuing its efforts to increase 
mutual understanding and trust in relation to the safety of maritime transport of nuclear material. 
7. A number of new laws relating to nuclear issues had been adopted in France in the preceding 
year. The first, adopted on 13 June 2006, had established the Nuclear Safety Authority as an 
independent administrative agency. The second, adopted on 28 June 2006, provided for a national 
management plan for radioactive material and waste. That plan defined a programme of research and

was based on three main approaches: reduction of the quantity and harmfulness of waste; interim 
storage; and deep geological disposal of long-lived intermediate-and high-level waste. The rules 
governing the treatment and storage of waste from other countries had been made more transparent 
and a legal framework had been introduced for financing the dismantling of nuclear installations. 

8. Nuclear power was an integral part of FranceÂs ambitious yet responsible energy policy which 
aimed to ensure security of supply and sustainable development and to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. The new European pressurized water reactor was due to enter into service around 2011 and 
a fast prototype neutron reactor was planned for 2020. A new research reactor would also be built, 
principally for fuel and materials studies. 
9. For some time, France had acknowledged that the major emerging economies had to have 
access to nuclear energy to meet their energy needs for economic development. In that connection, 
France was working to improve IndiaÂs access to peaceful nuclear technology and the two countries 
had announced the beginning of negotiations on a bilateral nuclear energy cooperation agreement in 
February 2006. 
10. International cooperation in the nuclear field was essential. Preparations for the establishment of 
ITER at Cadarache were well under way. France was also participating actively in the Generation IV 
International Forum and INPRO. France and five other countries that supplied enrichment services had 
developed a plan for multilateral assurances of access to nuclear fuel. France welcomed the other 
suggestions which had been put forward with the same aim, and the special event on that issue which 
was taking place during the General Conference. 
11. In conclusion, he congratulated the Agency and its Director General on the award of the Nobel 
Peace Prize, which paid tribute to the AgencyÂs vital contribution to the cause of non-proliferation. 
12. Mr. POPOVIC (Serbia) congratulated the Director General and the Secretariat for their 
excellent work which had been recognized by the award of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
13. He drew attention to the recent constitutional changes in his country. The Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia had been transformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003. 
The State Union had represented the interests of the two Member States and had constituted the legal 
entity in international relations, including membership of the United Nations and the Agency. The 
recent declaration of independence by Montenegro meant that Serbia was now an independent 
sovereign State which succeeded to all the rights and obligations of the State Union, including the 
continuation of its Agency membership. His country remained firmly committed to the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and to all the fundamental principles and goals of the Agency. 
14. Serbia continued to support the AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of verification 
measures and to develop integrated safeguards in accordance with the NPT. He commended the efforts 
of the Secretariat to negotiate and conclude safeguards agreements and additional protocols. His 
country intended to sign an additional protocol as soon as it had the technical capabilities and human 
and administrative resources required to fulfil its obligations. Preparations had already begun and the 
Agency had provided a great deal of assistance to help the country overcome difficulties from the past. 
15. The frequent terrorist attacks all over the world brought the issue of security into focus. 
Activities under the auspices of the Agency to counter the threat of nuclear terrorism were part of 
common efforts to prevent terrorists and other non-State actors from acquiring sensitive nuclear 
material and technologies. In that connection, his country fully supported the Nuclear Security Fund 
and nuclear security programmes. 
16. Serbia was strongly committed to the universal non-proliferation regime and had been active in 
strengthening mechanisms for combating illicit trafficking, improving physical protection systems and

gaining control over orphan sources. It supported the efforts of the international community and 
adhered to the provisions of international legal instruments and related conventions, guidelines and 
other documents, integrating their requirements into its national legal system. 

17. In July 2006, Serbia had ratified the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of 
Nuclear Terrorism. It had also signed the amendment to the CPPNM and supported other common 
initiatives such as the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), 
further strengthening of the Nuclear Safety Fund, IAEA/EU joint action and the incorporation of 
provisions from the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources into national 
documents. 
18. In view of the potential threat of terrorist attacks and the importance of countering global 
terrorism, Serbia had always been prepared to cooperate in that area. Our example thereof was the 
transport of the fresh nuclear fuel from the Vinca Institute of Nuclear Sciences to the Russian 
Federation in 2002, which had been made possible by the intensive cooperation with the governments 
of the United States and the Russian Federation, the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Agency. 
Cooperation of that nature was essential to resolve outstanding issues such as the removal of the spent 
nuclear fuel, the management of low-and intermediate-level radioactive waste and the full 
decommissioning of the nuclear reactor in the Vinca Institute. The tremendous complexity of the 
operation and budgetary constraints had placed a considerable burden on his country, but his 
Government was committed to achieving its goal and to protecting his countryÂs capital from the 
environmental and human health risks. 
19. He thanked the Agency for the assistance it provided to countries in reaching a higher level of 
safety and security and in improving control of the use of nuclear energy. The Agency should continue 
its efforts in that regard. Activities related to the Vinca nuclear decommissioning programme remained 
his countryÂs highest priority. 
20. The State structure of his country and its statutory systems had caused the Agency some extra 
efforts. The Secretariat, and in particular the Department of Technical Cooperation, had demonstrated 
great understanding and patience, despite those complexities and the different needs of the former 
Serbia and Montenegro. The new single State of Serbia should make cooperation and communication 
simpler. 
21. His country had successfully taken part in several national projects and nearly 20 regional 
projects reflecting the most important needs of the country. They encompassed various areas, from the 
Vinca nuclear decommissioning programme, nuclear and radiation safety and security and regulatory 
infrastructure modernization, to human health and nuclear applications in various fields. Serbia aimed 
to strengthen cooperation further and it had therefore submitted new national project proposals and 
had expressed an interest in participating in an even greater number of regional projects. It had hosted 
an Agency workshop in MayÂJune 2006 with a further workshop planned for October, both in the 
nuclear decommissioning field. 
22. Mr. CRAXI (Italy) said that the Agency was the natural forum for discussion and cooperation 
with a view to finding ways to reconcile the aims of nuclear non-proliferation and effective 
verification with the need for growth and development through the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
Therefore, Italy supported the activities carried out by the Agency in fulfilment of its statutory 
functions in all its three main areas of activity. 
23. The NPT constituted the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation regime and was an essential 
basis for nuclear disarmament. The Treaty should be fully implemented and strengthened, especially 
in view of the widespread dissemination of nuclear knowledge and technical capabilities in the modern 
world, which increased the risk of nuclear weapon proliferation.

24. Compliance with multilateral regulations and laws was essential and it was vital to be able to 
verify compliance and detect violations. Additional protocols were an integral part of the safeguards 
system and he called for universal adherence to that instrument. The entry into force of comprehensive 
safeguards and additional protocols in the Middle East would make a significant contribution to 
establishing security and trust in that region. Italy therefore invited all the States concerned to commit 
themselves to creating a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in the region. 
25. His country recognized the important role played by new international cooperation initiatives 
such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative, the Global Nuclear 
Energy Partnership and the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of 
Mass Destruction in combating nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The adoption by consensus in 2005 
of the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism showed the 
widespread concern and the common need to address that threat with new, appropriate legal 
instruments. 
26. It was also necessary to consider controlling the nuclear fuel cycle and Italy therefore attached 
great importance to the special event that was being held during the General Conference which could 
contribute to defining new multilateral approaches to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It also called 
for the entry into force of the CTBT and fully supported the implementation of that Treaty through the 
establishment of the International Monitoring System and the International Data Centre. Furthermore, 
it attached high priority to the initiation of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty within the 
framework of the Conference on Disarmament. It was very encouraging that the Conference on 
Disarmament had received a new impetus in 2006 through focused and structured debate and through 
the presentation of a draft treaty by the United States. Italy welcomed the participation of Agency 
representatives in the discussion on the fissile material cut-off treaty and emphasized the important 
contribution the Agency could make to that process. 
27. Each country needed to accord top priority to nuclear safety in its nuclear programme. 
International cooperation was also essential to achieving the highest and most consistent nuclear safety 
standards. Italy fully supported the development of a global nuclear safety regime based around the 
conventions, codes of conduct, and standards prepared by the Agency, and the promotion of an 
international action plan to strengthen preparedness for and response to nuclear and radiological 
emergencies. Italy had also been one of the countries most committed to the amendment of the 
CPPNM. 
28. His country fully supported the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and had recently 
passed a bill granting the Government the necessary resources to fund those activities. It hoped that 
the general public would learn to see the Agency as an institution which not only carried out 
verification work but also helped less developed countries to achieve better living standards. It had 
also allocated significant extrabudgetary resources to programmes of particular interest, such as those 
on optimization of cancer radiotherapy techniques and the use of isotope techniques in connection 
with nutrition in Africa. 
29. ItalyÂs academic and health institutions had long-standing experience of cooperation with the 
Agency, especially in the field of nuclear medicine, through the organization of scientific visits and 
fellowships, where the country was making a notable contribution. 
30. Through UNESCO, Italy contributed more than 80% of the budget of the ICTP whose activities 
and programmes aimed at promoting international cooperation among scientists from all countries. It 
appreciated the AgencyÂs support for the ICTP and felt encouraged thereby to continue and increase 
its support for the Centre and to enhance the latterÂs role in closing the North-South technological and 
scientific divide.

31. Mr. WUERMELING (Germany) said that, over the 50 years of its existence, the Agency had 
faced and successfully solved a broad range of sometimes extremely complex problems, guided by a 
spirit of consensus, continuity and objectivity. Its efforts to enhance the international safeguards and 
non-proliferation regime, to build and strengthen a worldwide framework for safety and security, and 
to provide scientific and technological support had made it one of the most highly recognized 
international organizations, which was reflected in its growing membership and the award of the 2005 
Nobel peace Prize. 
32. IranÂs nuclear programme was a matter of deep concern to the international community which, 
together with the Agency, had spared no efforts to shed light on that countryÂs clandestine nuclear 
activities. That work had to continue until there was a sufficient guarantee that IranÂs nuclear 
programme was and would remain exclusively for peaceful purposes. Only then could confidence be 
restored. 
33. The Board of Governors had repeatedly called upon Iran to cooperate and to suspend the most 
sensitive parts of its nuclear programme. United Nations Security Council resolution 1696 (2006) had 
made such action mandatory. At the same time, the international community had offered Iran 
considerable support for the development of a safe, proliferation-proof and economically viable 
nuclear programme, and the prospect of a new dimension of cooperation. 
34. The Iranian reaction so far had been ambiguous. Progress seemed to have been made in the 
recent meeting between EU High Representative, Mr. Solana, and the Iranian chief negotiator, 
Mr. Larijani, but clear signs were needed to open the way for new negotiations and it was to be hoped 
that other meetings could be held soon. After three years of intensive talks, Germany had learned to be 
cautious in its expectations. Iran needed to make a strategic decision between the cooperation offered 
and increased isolation, and it would have to do so soon. The international community would react to 
whichever choice Iran made and his country was confident that it would react in a united manner. 
35. The universalization of the safeguards system, including the additional protocol, was a matter of 
highest priority and would make a major contribution to the effectiveness of the AgencyÂs verification 
activities and thus to global security. The implementation of integrated safeguards on the basis of 
comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols would significantly enhance the 
efficiency of verification measures. The comprehensive safeguard agreement together with the 
additional protocol should be regarded as the AgencyÂs verification standard; yet, one decade after its 
approval, many Member States had not yet brought an additional protocol into force. Germany called 
upon those States to do so as soon as possible. 
36. He noted the efforts to establish a framework for assurances of supply and non-proliferation. 
That was a key question not only with respect to the case of Iran but also for the future of nuclear 
technology. Together with France, the Netherlands, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and 
the United States of America, Germany had submitted a communication to the Board in June 
containing a concept for assurances for a reliable supply of enrichment services or enriched uranium. 
The potential misuse of sensitive fuel cycle technologies was a serious challenge to the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. Providing reliable access to nuclear fuel services and allowing States to refrain, 
on a voluntary basis and without undue interference with the market mechanism, from developing 
indigenous sensitive fuel cycle capabilities could help meet that objective. However, similar 
endeavours in past decades, as well as recent initiatives and discussions, had shown that many 
questions remained open. The proposed concept offered a sound basis for further discussions. The 
preceding day, Germany had proposed the establishment of an independent, multilaterally organized 
uranium enrichment capability which would be under Agency control and managed by companies 
from all interested States. The enriched fuel could be released solely by Agency decision to all 
countries in line with their non-proliferation obligations. The proposal had attracted favourable

comments and his country looked forward to further discussion with the interested parties and 
welcomed additional ideas. 

37. Germany had supported the establishment of the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and 
Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute in 2005 and remained committed to its 
objective of further strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards system. 
38. Safety and security constituted one of the most important issues in the nuclear field. The need 
for a worldwide culture of nuclear safety and security would increase even further in the future, with 
the ageing of reactors, the closure of research reactors, the multiplication of radiation sources, illicit 
trafficking and the threat of nuclear terror. 
39. The adoption of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the 
associated Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources was an important initiative in 
that regard. Germany had been one of the first States to incorporate those guidelines into national law. 
A national catalogue of sealed radioactive sources and devices was already in place. Germany was 
ready to cooperate with interested countries on developing detailed guidelines and instructions for the 
implementation of the Guidance. 
40. It greatly appreciated the outcome of the second review meeting under the Joint Convention on 
the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which 
had taken place in May and at which considerable progress had been made. Nevertheless, there was 
still a need for further action in many areas. 
41. The fight against nuclear terrorism and illicit trafficking required greater international 
cooperation. Germany welcomed and supported the work of the Secretariat in that field. The project to 
develop and implement radiological security measures for the World Cup 2006 in Germany, carried 
out jointly with the Agency, had been a good example in that regard. Germany also supported the 
work of the European Commission on a European standard for radiation monitoring at border 
crossings. With its experience, the Agency could make a valuable contribution to that project. 
42. Mr. BOYKO (Ukraine) recalled that his country, a founder member of the Agency, had 
voluntarily given up the third most powerful nuclear arsenal in the world and considered the peaceful 
use of nuclear energy to be a defining component in the sustainable development of its national 
economy. The role of nuclear energy in Ukraine could hardly be overestimated. Nuclear power would 
play a major role in assuring the countryÂs energy supply in the medium and long term. In future years, 
the significance of nuclear power would grow even further, which was reflected in UkraineÂs energy 
strategy for the period up to 2030, passed by his Government at the beginning of 2006. Given the 
increased competition for possession of hydrocarbons caused by limited stocks and delivery routes, 
and the exacerbation of environmental problems caused by the use of fossil fuel, including climate 
change issues, the importance of nuclear energy would grow steadily. A number of States, including 
Ukraine, were adopting programmes that assigned a major role to nuclear power, which proved that 
confidence in it was gradually being restored. 
43. The AgencyÂs activities in the field of research into meeting energy demands was especially 
important, in particular its work to support and develop the analytical potential of Member States for 
carrying out energy research using Agency tools. Those activities should be continued and expanded, 
including through the technical cooperation programme. 
44. Ensuring the reliability and safety of nuclear reactors and management of spent nuclear fuel and 
radioactive waste were some of the main priorities of UkraineÂs State bodies and the operating 
organization. Those priorities corresponded exactly to the AgencyÂs Medium Term Strategy. Ukraine 
valued highly the AgencyÂs work on the nuclear fuel cycle and new, safe reactors. It fully supported

the conclusions of the International Symposium on Uranium Production and Raw Materials for the 
Nuclear Fuel Cycle concerning the adequacy of uranium resources for the anticipated use of nuclear 
energy. The availability of sufficient, economically viable uranium resources was one of the factors 
leading UkraineÂs energy sector towards the expanded use of atomic energy. Moreover, the confirmed 
uranium resources in Ukraine were sufficient to meet not only its own long-term requirements but also 
the demands of other countries, and Ukraine was open to international cooperation in that field. In the 
context of the development of nuclear fuel cycle technology, Ukraine valued the AgencyÂs work on 
the elaboration of guidelines and recommendations which formed a basis for the elaboration of 
national standards. 

45. As a country with considerable scientific potential in nuclear technology and with long-term 
plans for the development of nuclear energy, Ukraine supported the AgencyÂs work in the field of 
innovative and advanced nuclear technologies and reactor designs. In 2005, it had joined INPRO and 
it also supported the AgencyÂs activities within the framework of the Generation IV International 
Forum. 
46. As regards nuclear knowledge management and preservation in order to ensure the availability 
of human resources for national nuclear energy development programmes, Ukraine appreciated the 
AgencyÂs efforts to create databases and nuclear information systems. Bearing in mind that nuclear 
energy development programmes had been frozen for a number of years, and taking into account the 
growth of competitive markets for technical professions, maintaining the required level of knowledge 
in the nuclear technology field was an exceptionally pressing task. Utilization of expert potential and 
the training base of the Agency and Member States could be an effective means of solving a number 
of problems in that area. 
47. As a State that had experienced the consequences of a major man-made disaster, Ukraine 
recognized the importance of the AgencyÂs work on ensuring the necessary levels of nuclear safety. 
That was a priority for Ukraine, which had 15 nuclear power plant units in operation, as well as 
research reactors, and observed strictly its obligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The 
safety level of those nuclear power plant units conformed to the requirements of the relevant national 
and international standards and the country was implementing a large-scale programme to improve 
nuclear safety, which involved improving legislation and strengthening the institutional capabilities of 
its national regulatory body. International cooperation in that field was expanding and nuclear safety 
issues were an important part of the cooperation agreement between the Cabinet of Ministers of 
Ukraine and Euratom and the Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation between Ukraine 
and the European Union signed on 1 December 2005. The conclusions and recommendations of the 
third review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety had provided a 
basis for applying best practices in the field. The AgencyÂs OSART missions were an effective tool for 
increasing the safety levels of nuclear facilities in operation. In 2006, a mission had been sent to the 
Zaporozhe nuclear power plant and another was planned to the South Ukraine nuclear power plant in 
October. The AgencyÂs work to develop nuclear safety guides within the framework of the Nuclear 
Safety Standards Committee was exceptionally important. Ukraine thanked all donor countries and 
international financial organizations that provided support for programmes to improve nuclear safety. 
48. Another important area of the AgencyÂs work related to radiation safety and radioactive waste 
management. UkraineÂs national report on its compliance with its obligations under the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management, and the discussion thereof, had again shown the appropriateness of the approaches it had 
adopted. Ukraine was demonstrating clearly its intentions to achieve a high level of safety in the 
management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste in order to protect the public and the 
environment against ionizing radiation. The adoption of a law and the creation of mechanisms to fund 
the decommissioning of nuclear facilities had been an important step in solving problems related to 

GC(50)/OR.3

8 


radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel management. UkraineÂs national strategy on radioactive waste 
management included modern approaches to the following: evaluating the safety of radioactive waste 
management, including waste generated by the Chernobyl accident; waste management in the uranium 
mining and reprocessing industry; management of waste generated by the operator; and temporary 
storage of radioactive waste on site. Another exceptionally important and complex task was the 
management of radioactive waste generated by the decommissioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant and the transformation of the Shelter facility into an environmentally safe system. That goal 
could not be met without international support. There were still problems and delays caused by 
contractors not fulfilling their contractual obligations, and affecting mainly radioactive waste 
processing capacity, the spent nuclear fuel storage facility and construction of the new safe 
confinement. He called on the governments of Member States that donated to the relevant funds to 
make additional efforts to resolve the existing problems. 

49. For Ukraine, the problems of dealing with the consequences of the Chernobyl accident remained 
extremely significant, as had been confirmed by the conclusions of the international conference held to 
mark the twentieth anniversary of the accident in Kiev on 24Â26 April 2006. The AgencyÂs 
involvement in the preparation and holding of the conference was appreciated. Cleaning up the 
consequences of the accident and decommissioning the Chernobyl nuclear power plant took up a 
considerable portion of the State budget. Although the mandate of the United Nations Chernobyl 
Forum had ended, the Agency should not reduce its efforts in that area and should continue to 
cooperate with Ukraine to solve the outstanding problems. 
50. Ukraine was concerned at the newly emerging threats posed by nuclear terrorism. It saw a need 
for broad international cooperation to reduce the global threat of nuclear and radioactive material 
being used for terrorist purposes. It welcomed the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of 
Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the Global Threat Reduction Initiative and other 
international and regional programmes. It also valued the AgencyÂs work in support of international 
initiatives to increase the security of nuclear and radioactive material and prevent illicit trafficking 
therein, and was in favour of strengthening the regime for the physical protection of nuclear material. 
Ukraine was implementing a set of measures to strengthen the security of radioactive sources in 
accordance with the basic principles of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources. A State system for the registration, accounting and control of sources was in force and 
legislative changes had been introduced aimed at strengthening export and import controls and 
requirements for the physical protection of ionizing radiation sources. The results of international 
projects implemented in Ukraine in that field were highly valued. No effort to improve the physical 
protection of nuclear facilities and material could be considered superfluous. With regard also to the 
project to build a new safe confinement over the destroyed Unit 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power 
plant site, both Ukraine and the Agency should assign the highest priority to securing nuclear and 
radioactive material and implementing safeguards. 
51. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to increase the effectiveness of the safeguards 
system and saw the NPT as a vital instrument in the prevention of nuclear proliferation. To strengthen 
the non-proliferation regime, it was important for States to implement additional protocols. Ukraine 
had ratified its additional protocol on 16 November 2005 and was grateful to the Agency for the 
practical assistance it had provided with the preparation of the initial declaration. He called on all 
Member States to make maximum efforts to provide guarantees of the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons and the non-diversion of nuclear technologies for military purposes. 
52. Ukraine valued the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, the results of which showed 
that the organization could respond appropriately and swiftly to the needs of Member States. 
Participation in the technical cooperation programme was very important to Ukraine, since it gave the 
country the opportunity to benefit from the best international experience and to share its own

9 


experience with other interested Member States. His country appreciated and supported fully the areas 
identified as priorities under the technical cooperation programme, namely: management of equipment 
lifetime and extension of the operating life of nuclear power plants; preservation of knowledge and 
experience in the nuclear power sector; nuclear safety and improving the capacities of regulatory 
bodies; and physical protection and radioactive waste management. It also supported the AgencyÂs 
work to strengthen cooperation in the field of nuclear science, in particular where it related to radiation 
medicine and biology. 

53. Mr. WESEKA (Kenya), having congratulated the Agency and the Director General on the 
award of the Nobel Peace Prize and on the fiftieth anniversary of the organization, said that the 
Agency had been established to realize two aspirations of the international community: the total 
elimination of nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Its 
fiftieth anniversary provided an occasion to reflect on progress in those areas. 
54. On the one hand, it was deeply disappointing that so little progress had been made in terms of 
non-proliferation; on the other, there had been significant developments in nuclear technology transfer, 
particularly to developing countries. However, 50 years should have been sufficient to achieve total 
disarmament and the failure of the recent NPT Review Conference, as well as the failure to reach 
consensus on a single paragraph in the declaration of the World Summit during the 60th session of the 
United Nations General Assembly, was not encouraging. He urged all nuclear-weapon States to make 
a greater effort to fulfil their treaty obligations, and all those wishing to develop or test nuclear 
weapons to refrain from doing so. 
55. His countryÂs principled position on the NPT corresponded with that of the NAM, which was in 
accordance with the Article IV of the NPT which guaranteed the right of all Member States to develop 
nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Kenya was also a signatory of the Pelindaba Treaty 
establishing an African nuclear-weapon-free zone and hoped that such zones would be established all 
over the world. 
56. Kenya appreciated Agency activities aimed at promoting global nuclear safety and security, and 
the assistance provided to Member States to help strengthen national nuclear safety and security 
infrastructures. In that connection, it had continued to develop appropriate infrastructure for the safety 
and security of radioactive sources, setting aside 10 acres of land to expand services for the processing 
and storage of radioactive waste and illicit radiation sources. The sum of US $150 000 had been 
allocated by the Government for a central radioactive waste processing facility which should be 
functional in the near future. Agency assistance in that regard would be welcome. The University of 
Nairobi continued to train local personnel in nuclear techniques and radiation safety and the competent 
authority had been carrying out research into medical exposure through established Agency regional 
projects on radiation protection. The results of the research had proved useful in applying dose 
reduction methods for patients. Renewal of the regional projects in question would therefore be 
appreciated. 
57. Furthermore, his country had increased the budget for radiation protection regulatory activities 
by 40% in order to facilitate capacity building, employ eight scientists and open two additional 
regional offices before the end of the year, bringing the total number of regional regulatory offices to 
three and thereby enhancing the safety and security of radiation sources. To counter illicit trafficking 
in radioactive and nuclear material, scanners had been installed at international ports of entry into 
Kenya and specialist agencies had been created. 
58. With regard to the recent amendment of the CPPNM, he had already signed the Cabinet 
memorandum seeking approval for Kenya to complete the ratification process. Similarly, his countryÂs

comprehensive safeguards agreement and additional protocol would also be before the Cabinet for 
conclusion in the near future. 

59. The Radiation Protection Board had also continued to foster positive collaboration with other 
institutions regarding the security of radioactive sources. In August 2006, in conjunction with the 
Agency it had conducted a successful one-week national training course on the detection of illicit 
radiation sources for customs, police and other Government officials. The Agency had also donated 
basic radiation safety instruments to officials working at border points with neighbouring countries 
and at major international ports of entry. Kenya had hosted a similar Agency course for the Africa 
region in December 2005. Furthermore, the Governor had created a database on radioactive material in 
use in the country and put in place the necessary security measures for such material. 
60. Through the National Council for Science and Technology, his country had taken the initiative 
to form a Society for the Promotion of Peaceful Applications of Nuclear Science and Technology 
(SPANS-K) and had held the first national seminar on public awareness of the peaceful uses of nuclear 
science and technology in cooperation with the Agency in 2005. 
61. Nuclear energy was becoming increasingly important in meeting the serious world energy 
deficit, particularly in developing countries. It was clear that there could be no development without 
energy and Kenya would therefore be seeking further cooperation and technical assistance in the 
development of nuclear energy. 
62. With regard to capacity building in nuclear technology, the Institute of Nuclear Sciences and 
Technology at the University of Nairobi offered a masters programme in nuclear science technology 
and its programmes were also open to other countries. The Agency and the Kenyan Government had 
continuously supported the Institute by providing equipment and fellowships. However, owing to 
emerging environmental challenges there was now a need to upgrade the equipment and introduce new 
nuclear-related techniques. 
63. Technical cooperation activities in Kenya covered many sectors of socio-economic 
development. The priority areas identified in KenyaÂs CPF for 2004Â2009 included human health, 
agriculture production and livestock development, radiation protection, energy and water resources 
development. 
64. In the agricultural sector, the application of nuclear and biotechnology techniques in crop 
improvement and management had progressed so well that the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute 
was recognized as a national centre of competence in plant breeding. Further plans were under way to 
develop a curriculum on mutation breeding and related biotechnology at Moi University in Eldoret 
with Agency support, as part of a project to promote university teaching of nuclear applications for 
development. 
65. He highlighted the importance of nuclear techniques for the sustainable management of the soilplant-
water system in order to improve food production. In that regard, Kenya took a keen interest in 
implementing programmes which used nuclear techniques to address concerns about soil degradation, 
and water and nutrient management practices to prevent land degradation and desertification. It was 
also implementing a project on combating desertification through the use of nuclear techniques and on 
the use of isotope hydrology techniques in water resources management. In October 2005, it had 
hosted a joint FAO/IAEA technical meeting on combating soil degradation to enhance food security in 
Africa. It was thus firmly committed to embracing nuclear technology to address environmental 
issues. 
66. The transmission of trypanosomosis by the tsetse fly in humans and domestic animals posed a 
serious threat to lives and livelihoods and was an obstacle to livestock and crop production. Kenya 

GC(50)/OR.3

was addressing tsetse-related problems in collaboration with other countries in the region. A mass 
rearing facility had been established at the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute Trypanosomiasis 
Research Centre with Agency collaboration. The unit focused on meeting the rapidly growing need for 
tsetse flies for use in a SIT-based eradication campaign which was being spearheaded by PATTEC 
and was being executed in Kenya by the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development. The aim 
was to remove the trypanosomosis constraint by eliminating tsetse from a surface area of 
approximately 92 000 square kilometres, which would in turn increase livestock productivity and 
alleviate poverty. In order to carry out that aim, a gamma source irradiator had been acquired with 
Agency support and installed in a purpose-built radioisotope facility funded by the Kenyan 
Government. Quality assurance procedures for the tsetse flies produced in the colony had been 
developed and standard operating procedures were at an advanced stage of preparation. 

67. The use of nuclear techniques was also playing a significant role in the management of major 
diseases in Kenya. Malaria and tuberculosis were among the most prevalent diseases for which proper 
diagnosis and treatment were crucial. The Kenya Medical Research Institute had made significant 
progress in the field of the molecular genetics involved in resistance to front-line antimalarial and 
anti-tuberculosis drugs through the implementation of a project on the detection of drug-resistant 
malaria and tuberculosis. 
68. With regard to HIV/AIDS, Kenya was actively implementing a project on initiatives in HIV-1 
molecular epidemiology and immunology and appreciated the equipment and training support that had 
been provided to the Kenya AIDS Vaccine Initiative laboratories by the Agency. His country was also 
actively participating in implementing a project on the use of isotope techniques to assess nutrition 
intervention programmes related to HIV/AIDS. 
69. In the field of radiotherapy, a new gamma camera supplied as part of a project to improve 
nuclear medicine services had been installed and commissioned at Kenyatta National Hospital and was 
operational. A project concept submitted to the Agency for the technical cooperation programme for 
2007-2008 aimed to strengthen radiotherapy services at the Kenyatta National Hospital and to expand 
those services to two other provincial hospitals. His country also supported Agency activities under 
the PACT programme 
70. His country was also pleased that the Agency had already accepted six project concepts for the 
next technical cooperation programme cycle and it hoped that the proposals would receive the 
necessary support. 
71. In conclusion, Kenya was committed to meeting its financial contributions to the Agency. His 
own Ministry had also recommended to the cabinet that it facilitate the ratification of the amendment 
to Article XIV.A of the AgencyÂs Statute. 
72. Mr. EL-EISSAWI (Iraq), having congratulated the Agency and its Director General on being 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and on the fiftieth anniversary of the organization, said it was a great 
honour to address the General Conference as a representative of the first Iraqi Government to be 
elected under the Constitution approved by the people of Iraq. The Government represented all strata 
and every component of Iraqi society, the aim being to create a State based on the rule of law and 
human rights. The Government was determined to surmount current difficulties, especially in terms of 
security, and to begin implementing its programme, which had been agreed upon by all the countryÂs 
political actors. He urged all countries to assist in ensuring its success, particularly the national 
reconciliation plan announced by the Prime Minister. Iraq had been a member of the Agency 
since 1959. The present Government intended to compensate for the previous regimeÂs reckless and 
misguided policies by building a new Iraq on peaceful foundations and pursuing integrated 
development as a respected and trusted member of the international community.

73. The Agency had responded to IraqÂs request for assistance in dealing with the contamination of 
its facilities and environment and it was to be hoped that the positive outcome of the meeting held at 
the AgencyÂs Headquarters from 21 to 23 February 2006 and attended by a number of Member States 
would lead to the effective implementation of that project. With a view to retraining IraqÂs specialized 
technical staff, the Agency had organized a course in conjunction with the Australian Government 
from 19 to 23 June 2006 on the implementation of safeguards and on nuclear material accounting and 
control. A workshop on border controls to prevent illicit trafficking in radioactive sources and 
material, organized by the Agency in conjunction with the United States Department of Energy from 
11 to 15 June 2006, had been attended by 30 Iraqi officials from ministries and other relevant bodies. 
74. However, Iraq required further Agency assistance and emergency support since it was no easy 
matter to deal with the enormous damage and destruction that the country had sustained. IraqÂs share 
of technical assistance should be increased to compensate for the sanctions imposed on it from 1990 so 
that it could rebuild its institutions and retrain its staff, and make full use of nuclear energy for 
peaceful purposes in agriculture, health, the environment and power generation. The country hoped for 
a positive response from the Agency and its Member States, particularly with a view to accelerating 
the decontamination of destroyed nuclear sites and facilities, developing a strategy and policy for 
radioactive waste management, selecting sites for the burial of radioactive waste, drafting legislation 
and regulations on decontamination, ensuring the safe transport of contaminated radioactive material, 
supporting joint research projects in the areas of health, water resources, the environment and radiation 
protection, and increasing training opportunities and scientific visits for specialized staff. 
75. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards regime played a vital role in maintaining international 
peace and security and was the cornerstone of the non-proliferation regime. Iraq was concerned about 
the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and stressed the importance of 
establishing a zone free of all weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, in the region. 
He urged all countries to accede to international treaties aimed at preventing the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, in particular the NPT. The AgencyÂs comprehensive safeguards regime 
should be applied throughout the Middle East. It was therefore of the utmost importance to enjoin 
Israel to accede to the NPT and to place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive Agency safeguards 
as a confidence-building measure and as a step towards achieving a just and lasting peace in the 
region. 
76. With regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, while Iraq affirmed the inalienable right of States under 
the NPT to possess and use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, it called on the AgencyÂs senior 
officials and Iran to engage in a serious dialogue on the application of the AgencyÂs resolutions 
concerning IranÂs nuclear programme in order to spare the region further tensions and create a climate 
in which States could focus on development. 
77. The AgencyÂs Annual Report for 2005 contained a section on verification in Iraq pursuant to 
United Nations Security Council resolutions. He pointed out that present-day Iraq, whose Government 
he represented, had no connection with the period prior to 9 April 2003 in terms of its policies and its 
vision of IraqÂs future. He called on the Agency to send a special team to Iraq to verify that it was free 
from all prohibited nuclear activities and programmes. The continuation of the current improper state 
of affairs would have an adverse impact on the people of Iraq and would exhaust the countryÂs 
financial resources. 
78. Having learned from bitter experience, and in the interests of its national security, Iraq had 
announced its commitment to respect international treaties pertaining to weapons of mass destruction 
and non-proliferation and had enshrined that commitment in its Constitution. The country was 
currently looking into the possibility of signing and ratifying an additional protocol with the Agency. 

GC(50)/OR.3 
19 
September 
2006, 
Page 
13 


A high-level committee had been established for that purpose and was about to submit its 
recommendations. 

79. In conclusion, he reaffirmed IraqÂs intention to become a force for stability at regional and 
international level. His country had nothing to conceal and its GovernmentÂs overriding goal was to 
rebuild the country on the basis of international law and human rights. 
80. Mr. GVALADZE (Georgia) said that his country remained committed to supporting the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime and verification mechanisms. The 
Georgian parliament had ratified the Agreement between the Republic of Georgia and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in Connection with the Treaty 
on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the protocol additional thereto in 2003. With regard 
to the related issue of illicit trafficking, most Georgian border crossings had been equipped with 
radiation detection systems as part of an ongoing joint project with the United States. 
81. Global terrorism was an issue of special concern, especially the interest among terrorist groups 
and organizations in nuclear, radioactive and other hazardous materials. The issue of Georgian 
territorial integrity remained unresolved and separatist enclaves continued to serve as shelters for 
terrorists and criminals. The danger of illicit trafficking in nuclear material was particularly acute in 
the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions where there was no central Government control, which in turn 
increased the danger of illegal movement of nuclear and radioactive material throughout the Caucasus 
region. 
82. Despite those difficulties, Georgia had conducted several projects, including the 
Agency-supported survey of orphan sources which had commenced in 2002 and had achieved 
significant results. A draft plan on national emergency preparedness and response to nuclear and 
radiation emergencies would be submitted to the Georgian parliament in autumn 2006. The Agency 
had provided expert assistance with the preparation of the plan. 
83. One of the most important areas of cooperation between the Agency and Georgia was human 
health. Regional and national technical cooperation projects relating to cancer management and X-ray 
and computer tomography optimization had first priority. Georgia firmly supported international 
standards for the radiological protection of patients and medical staff. 
84. Thanks to the assistance provided by the Agency and the United States Department of Energy, 
radioactive sources were being temporarily stored in accordance with international standards. 
85. His country was interested in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership announced by the United 
States. Energy independence and energy source diversification were strategic components of Georgian 
policy. 
86. Georgia relied on support from the Agency to conduct activities related to peaceful uses of 
nuclear energy and to implement the AgencyÂs objectives in general, and it was grateful for the 
assistance it received. 
87. Despite serious financial difficulties, his Government remained committed to fulfilling its 
financial obligations to the Agency. Georgia had officially requested the conclusion of a ten-year 
payment plan agreement starting in 2007 to pay off its arrears to the Regular Budget, as well as a 
three-year payment plan agreement to settle its assessed programme cost arrears. 
88. Mr. VALLIM GUERREIRO (Brazil) said that, as a founding member of the Agency, Brazil had 
worked intensively for the past fifty years to advance the AgencyÂs dual mission to assist the 
development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes and to apply the safeguards established by 
disarmament and non-proliferation treaties. The Brazilian nuclear programme had always been based 

GC(50)/OR.3 
19 
September 
2006, 
Page 
14 


on an unequivocal commitment to safety and peaceful use. Thus, his country had adhered to and 
implemented pertinent international instruments and the AgencyÂs voluntary directives and guidelines. 
Most recently, an agreement had been concluded with the Agency on a safeguards approach for the 
enrichment facility in Resende and Brazil had expressed its commitment to the Code of Conduct on 
the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and the associated Guidance on the Import and Export 
of Radioactive Sources. 

89. Strengthening of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities was crucial to maintaining a 
balance between the three pillars of the organizationÂs activities and to reinforcing its legitimacy. The 
substantial increase in the resources allocated to verification and safety activities had exacerbated the 
imbalance between the three pillars. His country continued to support efforts to strengthen 
implementation of the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programmes, in which Brazil participated as 
both donor and recipient. He congratulated the Resident Representatives of Sri Lanka and Norway on 
their excellent work which had resulted in a consensus on financing of the TCF for 2007Â2008 and on 
IPFs for 2009Â2011. 
90. With regard to safety and security, Brazil relied on a consistent national regulatory and 
supervisory structure capable of ensuring the physical protection of nuclear and radioactive material in 
use, storage and transport. The main responsibility for ensuring the safety and physical protection of 
nuclear facilities lay with States, which should therefore be the primary actors in international efforts 
to strengthen pertinent instruments. That effort often required technical and financial cooperation at 
international level to strengthen institutions and train human resources. The Brazilian National 
Nuclear Energy Commission had developed programmes and procedures with that aim in mind. Brazil 
maintained an extensive cooperation programme in coordination with the Agency, within the 
framework of ARCAL, and was ready to share its experience with other countries in the region. 
91. Developing a safety culture was of crucial importance for the definition by regulatory bodies of 
norms and procedures for the handling of nuclear and radioactive sources; it was also vital to all 
processes related to the operation of nuclear facilities and the handling, storage or transport of nuclear 
and radioactive sources. He drew attention to the Ibero-American Forum of Nuclear Regulators, one of 
whose main objectives was to establish the Ibero-American Radiation Safety Network, which was a 
useful instrument for sharing of knowledge and expertise on safety standards, licensing procedures, 
control of radioactive sources, protection of patients and education and training. 
92. In November 2005, Brazil and Argentina had signed a Memorandum of Understanding under 
the bilateral agreement on nuclear cooperation to facilitate the harmonization of legislation and 
procedures concerning radioactive sources. He expressed the hope that other countries in the region 
might benefit from that experience. 
93. The efforts made to strengthen the international regime on safety and physical protection of 
nuclear and radioactive sources, and the introduction of new international instruments to protect 
against nuclear terrorism, while praiseworthy, were insufficient. There was a need to reinforce systems 
for monitoring illicit transactions involving nuclear and radioactive material, including the control and 
verification of atypical financial flows. United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) had 
been a positive development in that regard. The Brazilian Government had established the National 
Sensitive Products Programme (PRONABENS), which aimed at keeping actors in the nuclear sector 
informed about the obligations undertaken by the country and about proliferation risks. The 
programme also aimed at fostering confidence to encourage those actors to keep the Government 
informed about potential clients and future commercial transactions. International cooperation could 
play an important role in that area. As a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, Brazil had conveyed 
to the committee established under resolution 1540 its readiness to share experience with interested 
countries on technology, material and dual-use transfer controls.

94. The balance between the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, verification and 
disarmament lay at the core of the NPT, which remained the cornerstone of the international 
disarmament and non-proliferation regime. In order to reinforce the NPT, the international community 
should strive for progress with respect to all three pillars of the Treaty, which were mutually 
reinforcing. StatesÂ inalienable right to develop and use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes should 
not be restricted and compliance with Article IV of the Treaty was vital. The non-proliferation pillar of 
the Treaty was of paramount importance and Brazil acknowledged the professionalism of the Agency 
in applying the safeguards foreseen by Article III of the Treaty. Proliferation concerns had become 
more acute in recent years, in particular with respect to the risk that weapons of mass destruction or 
radioactive material might fall in the hands of non-State actors. However, the challenges with regard 
to weapons of mass destruction were not limited to contemporary proliferation trends. Traditional 
challenges remained, and it became increasingly clear that disregard for the provisions of Article VI of 
the NPT could negatively affect the TreatyÂs implementation. 
95. The possession of weapons of mass destruction by a few States continued to be a matter of 
grave concern for all mankind. Disarmament and non-proliferation were interrelated and mutually 
reinforcing. Implementation of a sustainable and long-term strategy depended on the simultaneous 
adoption of measures in the fields of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Balanced 
implementation of all three pillars of the NPT was essential for the achievement of its objectives. The 
NPT had reached a decisive moment in its history. In view of the threats to international peace and 
security posed by the possession of nuclear weapons and their potential proliferation, the international 
community could not afford further failures in addressing the issues that jeopardized full 
implementation of the Treaty. 
96. Serious efforts also needed to be made to achieve the entry into force of the CTBT, which was a 
centrepiece of the disarmament and non-proliferation regime. Brazil also looked forward to the early 
initiation of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty at the Conference on Disarmament. 
97. A proposal had been put forward for a mechanism to assure supplies of nuclear fuel in the 
context of a possible new framework for the nuclear fuel cycle. Given the commercial, economic and 
strategic implications of that proposal, it should be examined carefully, both in the context of the 
Agency and the NPT Review Conference. Any analysis should take account of the need to preserve 
the right of States to develop nuclear technology for peaceful uses, including the fuel cycle, as well as 
corresponding progress in the field of disarmament and arms control on the part of nuclear-weapon 
States. The special event on the fuel cycle which was being held during the General Conference could 
provide useful technical input for the thorough consideration of the issue in the appropriate fora. 
98. Any proposals made by the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the 
Framework of the IAEA Statute should be strictly in conformity with the legal framework of the 
Statute and the three different types of safeguards agreements. The Committee should focus primarily 
on measures that might enhance the efficiency of safeguards implementation, bearing in mind the need 
to avoid additional financial obligations for developing countries. 
99. There was a clear trend towards the dissemination of nuclear technologies and increased use of 
nuclear power in civil activities. Nuclear power had established itself as an economically competitive 
and environmentally sound alternative to meet the growing demand for electricity. No country could 
therefore renounce the use of those technologies, which were particularly important for sustainable 
development. In that connection, he commended the Secretariat for its initiatives in the area of 
capacity building and nuclear knowledge management and preservation. 
100. Brazil attached the utmost important to the cooperation between the ABACC and the Agency in 
the application of safeguards under the Quadripartite Agreement. The two agencies should continue to 

GC(50)/OR.3 
19 
September 
2006, 
Page 
16 


work in a coordinated manner to avoid duplication of effort, improve cost efficiency and minimize 
possible disruptions to the operation of nuclear facilities in Brazil and Argentina. 

101. Speaking on behalf of the delegations of Brazil and Argentina, he recalled that 2006 marked the 
fifteenth anniversary of ABACC, which had been established to uphold safeguards in respect of 
Brazilian and Argentine nuclear activities and to provide assurances to the international community of 
the peaceful nature of those activities. Since its inception, ABACC had carried out over 1000 
inspections in nuclear facilities in Argentina and Brazil, had participated in the global debate on 
nuclear safeguards and had issued over 60 technical publications relating to its activities. The 
relationship between ABACC and the Agency enshrined in the Quadripartite Agreement was crucial 
to the conduct of joint safeguards activities and to improving pertinent work carried out by ABACC. 
ABACC had become a key player in the global non-proliferation system and had enabled Brazil and 
Argentina to produce material evidence of their commitment to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and 
the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
102. Ms. MELIN (Sweden) said that the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Agency and its 
Director General in 2005 had been a well-deserved and timely recognition of the AgencyÂs 
contribution to making the world safer both from nuclear proliferation and from nuclear accidents. It 
was also a recognition of the clear voice of its Director General in his efforts to move the disarmament 
and non-proliferation agenda forward. That was particularly important at the present time, when the 
multilateral system was under attack. 
103. Looking back over the five decades of the AgencyÂs history, certain events stood out: the bold 
vision of an organization for Atoms for Peace; the NPT and the AgencyÂs role in that Treaty; and the 
experiences in the early 1990s which had led to efforts to sharpen the safeguards system and at the 
same time create tools to improve nuclear safety worldwide. 
104. Sweden had enjoyed decades of excellent cooperation with the Agency and had profited greatly 
from the AgencyÂs work in nuclear and radiation safety and verification. Sweden had also had the 
great honour of providing the Agency with two of its Directors General, Dr. Sigvard Eklund and 
Dr. Hans Blix. 
105. The creation of the Agency, through the adoption of its Statute in October 1956, had marked the 
end of unsuccessful efforts to control nuclear energy. Failure to reach agreement during the early years 
after the Second World War had resulted in an impasse that had been broken by President 
EisenhowerÂs Atoms for Peace speech before the United Nations General Assembly on 
8 December 1953. 
106. The concept of a nuclear material bank managed by the Agency had been a central issue of 
Atoms for Peace since the beginning. Even at that time it had been stated that such a bank would have 
to be absolutely secure from theft or attack, which was in effect the first mention of what was much 
later to become known as nuclear terrorism. Those requirements had been followed up later in the 
CPPNM and the AgencyÂs nuclear security programme. 
107. The idea of a nuclear material bank had been discussed time and again at the Agency, be it in 
the Committee on Assurances of Supply in the 1980s or as the theme of the special event that was 
being held during the current session of the General Conference. As a nuclear power nation with no 
national enrichment capacity, Sweden stressed the need for reliable access to nuclear fuel. If that could 
be achieved without expensive investment in enrichment facilities, so much the better. Sweden 
remained prepared to take a positive look at the various proposals for multilateral approaches to the 
nuclear fuel cycle which were under discussion. It was open to proposals which aimed to minimize the 
proliferation risks connected with enrichment and reprocessing technologies. Moreover, the Agency 
should be used as a forum for exploring various ways to reduce such risks.

108. The entry into force of the NPT in 1970 had been one of the most important events in the 
history of disarmament and non-proliferation. The NPT remained the cornerstone of the multilateral 
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. As the body responsible for implementing nonproliferation 
obligations pursuant to the NPT, the Agency was the sole international authority for 
nuclear verification. 
109. Comprehensive safeguards agreements had turned out to be less comprehensive than originally 
envisioned, as events in Iraq after the first Gulf War had shown. The ensuing efforts to strengthen the 
AgencyÂs safeguards system had eventually resulted in the creation of the additional protocol. During 
that process, Sweden had provided opportunities for field trials relating to certain draft provisions of 
the protocol. Those trials, aimed as they were at reassuring critics of the practical feasibility of those 
provisions, had successfully contributed to the significant achievement of establishing the Model 
Additional Protocol. 
110. On a more political note, Sweden agreed with the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission 
which stressed the importance of the additional protocol in enhancing the effectiveness of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime. Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with additional protocols 
constituted the current Agency verification standard. 
111. The terrorist attacks five years ago had been the starting point for the rapid development of the 
AgencyÂs efforts to strengthen nuclear security worldwide. The Nuclear Security Fund had been 
established with voluntary contributions from both Member States and non-governmental 
organizations to finance measures to prevent nuclear terrorism. The AgencyÂs nuclear security 
programme had undergone a significant transition in terms of both quantity and quality. Furthermore, 
Member States had taken steps relevant to their nuclear activities to prevent nuclear terrorism. Sweden 
was no exception: legally binding revised regulations would come into force by 1 January 2007 
requiring virtually every nuclear licensee to strengthen the physical protection of their facilities. 
112. As a reaction to the tragic Chernobyl accident in 1986, extensive efforts to improve nuclear 
safety worldwide had been initiated. As a result, the Convention on Nuclear Safety and the Joint 
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management had been established and both had received widespread recognition. In Sweden they 
formed, together with the AgencyÂs safety standards, the basis for revised regulations on nuclear safety 
and nuclear waste management. 
113. The Swedish nuclear power programme had been established in the 1960s. Since that time, 
regulations had evolved from focusing solely on technical issues to include human factors related to 
the management of nuclear facilities. The recently approved nuclear safety standards were of high 
quality and served as a good platform for issuing national regulations. The announcement by the 
Swedish industry that it intended to extend operation of its nuclear reactors had prompted extensive 
work on retrofitting regulations based on the AgencyÂs safety standards. 
114. The incident in the Forsmark nuclear power plant on 25 July 2006, where the emergency power 
system had partly failed, had highlighted the need for international cooperation in such areas as 
interdependency of reactor emergency power systems, arrangements for experience feedback and the 
complexity of introducing new technology in existing plants. Sweden was prepared to share its 
experience with the rest of the international community and intended to host an international 
conference to address those issues. 
115. Two of the three pillars of the Agency, safety and verification, were explicitly mentioned as 
functions in the Statute. The third pillar, technical cooperation, had also been established at an early 
point and was already well in place by 1960. The technical cooperation programme had developed into 

GC(50)/OR.3 
19 
September 
2006, 
Page 
18 


a well functioning mechanism to solicit and respond to Member StatesÂ needs through the 
implementation of projects with the full support of governments. 

116. Sweden fully appreciated the need for predictable funding of the technical cooperation 
programme and had therefore consistently contributed its share to the TCF. It had pledged its full 
share to the TCF for 2007. 
117. The end of the Cold War had resulted, among other things, in a number of potential nuclearweapon 
States abandoning weapons development programmes and becoming non-nuclear-weapon 
States. The non-proliferation significance of those events could not be overemphasized. Nor could it 
be overemphasized that those developments were not enough. The entire non-proliferation and 
disarmament regime was under stress. The DPRK had announced its withdrawal from the NPT and 
had declared that it possessed nuclear weapons. Serious concerns remained about IranÂs nuclear 
programme. The risk that terrorists could acquire weapons of mass destruction was another threat to 
collective security. The limited progress towards nuclear disarmament also undermined multilateral 
agreements. The US-Indian civil nuclear cooperation initiative, although understandable from the 
perspective of IndiaÂs energy needs, posed serious problems from the point of view of the multilateral 
non-proliferation system. 
118. Those challenges had to be tackled collectively and multilaterally. No one country could face 
them alone. There had to be a combination of measures, decisions and agreements. The Weapons of 
Mass Destruction Commission had put forward a wide range of recommendations which deserved 
serious consideration. The Commission had also highlighted the role of the Agency with respect both 
to verification and the nuclear fuel cycle. The Director General, in his Nobel lecture, had identified 
three concrete steps: protect material and strengthen verification; control the fuel cycle; accelerate 
disarmament efforts. For the non-proliferation part of those steps, the Agency remained indispensable. 
Looking to the next 50 years, the Agency would certainly be an even more important force in ensuring 
that nuclear energy was used solely for peaceful purposes. Judging from its history, the AgencyÂs 
activities would be as keen as ever, and would probably reach out to interesting new fields in 
combination with ingenious new methodologies. 
119. Mr. KUANYSHEV (Kazakhstan) stressed the importance of ensuring the effectiveness of the 
NPT and of promoting international efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. Compliance 
with the obligations entered into by parties to the NPT was unconditional. 
120. Kazakhstan was participating actively in the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of 
Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the United States 
Global Threat Reduction Initiative. It supported the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
announced by the Russian Federation and the United States and had signed the International 
Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
121. His country had taken measures to strengthen radiation monitoring at its borders and to upgrade 
its system for combating illicit trafficking in nuclear and other radioactive material and it firmly 
supported United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 (2006). 
122. KazakhstanÂs export control policy was in keeping with all generally accepted norms. As a 
member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, it had taken effective measures to meet its obligations in the 
area of strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Its system for combating illegal transfers of 
nuclear material and technologies was in place and was being continuously improved. 
123. His country was very concerned that a number of countries possessing elements of a nuclear 
fuel cycle had still not joined international regimes for the control of nuclear transfers, thereby leaving 
open the possibility of illicit trafficking in nuclear material and illegal transfer of technologies. On the

other hand, careful consideration was needed before implementing new restrictions on transfers of 
nuclear technologies so as to avoid creating unreasonable obstacles to the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy. 

124. Aware of the potential hazards of highly enriched material, the Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy 
and Mineral Resources had adopted a five-year programme to convert a research reactor to operate on 
low-enriched nuclear fuel. Work was continuing on the safe decommissioning of the BN-350 fast 
breeder reactor in Aktau and on the downblending of highly enriched uranium at the Ulba 
Metallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk. 
125. Kazakhstan had begun implementation of the provisions of the revised Code of Conduct on the 
Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. Projects had been successfully implemented to strengthen 
the control of ionizing radiation sources and ensure the safe and secure management of strong sources. 
A national register of sources of ionizing radiation had been established and an inventory taken of 
radioactive sources in the country. He thanked the Agency and the countries participating in those 
projects for the assistance they had provided. 
126. With the support of the Government of Kazakhstan, a joint stock company had recently been 
registered in Kurchatov which it was expected would serve as a base for developing peaceful 
applications of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan, including nuclear power. The Government was also 
supporting a number of large-scale projects, including the construction of a heavy ion accelerator in 
Astana, due to be commissioned imminently, and the construction of a materials research tokomak in 
Kurchatov. A major nuclear medicine centre was being planned in Almaty. 
127. His country had played an active part in the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in 
Central Asia. The Treaty establishing the zone had been signed on 8 September by Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and his own country. The zone had a number of unique features: 
it included a State (Kazakhstan) which in the past had had the worldÂs fourth largest nuclear arsenal; it 
was the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in the northern hemisphere; it was the first multilateral security 
agreement bringing together all five Central Asian countries; and it was the first time that a nuclearweapon-
free zone had been established in a region that bordered upon two nuclear States. The Treaty, 
which banned the development, manufacture, stockpiling, acquisition or possession of nuclear 
explosive devices within the zone, would strengthen the security of Central Asia and promote regional 
confidence-building and cooperation. It was also an effective contribution to combating serious threats 
to peace and security and preventing fissile material from falling into the hands of terrorist groups. 
The Russian Federation and China had already welcomed the Treaty. 
128. Every country had the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful uses in accordance with the 
AgencyÂs Statute and the Agency should provide all necessary assistance to that end. It was important 
to find ways of resolving conflict situations that had recently arisen and of rebuilding the confidence 
of the international community in the nuclear activities of countries, without restricting their right to 
technological development or their access to knowledge. 
129. In his statement at the G8 Summit in July 2006, the President of Kazakhstan had noted that, in 
order to ensure global security, it was vital to move forward towards full nuclear disarmament, since 
nuclear weapons, like all weapons of mass destruction, were a direct threat to humanity. The time had 
come to give thought to alternative energy sources and to global energy security. Like other countries 
that had or were planning to build nuclear power plants, Iran should be given the opportunity to 
conduct scientific and technical research, improve the safety of its nuclear power plants and deal with 
problems of nuclear fuel and waste. Those activities should be transparent and the international 
community should be able to monitor them.

130. It was important to prevent fissile material from being used for military purposes. To that end, it 
would be useful to consider establishing a body under Agency auspices to assure supplies of fuel for 
nuclear power plants and manage storage and waste processing. That would help control any diversion 
of the raw materials needed for the production of nuclear devices for military use. 
131. Mr. AL OWAIS (United Arab Emirates) said that his country was committed to the 
establishment of an international order based on the principles of solidarity, peace, justice and equality 
and had therefore participated actively in all the AgencyÂs activities and programmes, giving high 
priority to cooperation in the development of science and technology and to support for the peaceful 
use of nuclear technology in a variety of sectors. 
132. The AgencyÂs many technical and operational achievements since its foundation 50 years ago 
had laid a solid basis for Member StatesÂ confidence in its ability to perform effectively the functions 
assigned to it under its Statute in an evolving international environment. 
133. In particular, he praised the AgencyÂs efforts to consolidate international cooperation in support 
of peaceful and safe uses of nuclear energy in the areas of development, the economy and human 
health. He also commended its continuous efforts to maintain international security and to free the 
world from nuclear weapons, as well as the excellent cooperation between the United Arab Emirates 
and the Agency on the funding of a number of technical cooperation projects under the national, 
regional and interregional cooperation programmes. Training opportunities had enabled a large 
number of national specialists to enhance their expertise in many different areas. His country trusted 
that the Agency would continue to provide that kind of support so that it could establish an advanced 
technological infrastructure for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It also hoped that the Agency 
would support the technical cooperation projects submitted by the United Arab Emirates for 2007 
and 2008. 
134. His country had hosted a number of scientific workshops and regional meetings in recent years 
under the auspices of the Agency and had made available human and scientific resources for training 
purposes. He thanked the AgencyÂs Department of Technical Cooperation for its assistance in 
organizing the courses and meetings concerned. The United Arab Emirates demonstrated its support 
for the AgencyÂs development programmes by punctually paying its contributions. 
135. His country supported the AgencyÂs efforts to apply safeguards to all nuclear activities in the 
Middle East as a necessary step towards the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass 
destruction in general and nuclear weapons in particular. He expressed concern about the international 
communityÂs failure to respond to Arab initiatives aimed at the application of the safeguards system to 
all nuclear activities in the region. 
136. Mr. OLIVEIRA (ABACC) said that, in the fifteen years since its creation, ABACC had been 
successfully applying the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (SCCC), 
that had been created by the related Agreement between the Republic of Argentina and the Federative 
Republic of Brazil that had entered into force in December 1991. The Quadripartite Agreement, which 
was the legal instrument that regulated the relationship between ABACC and the Agency and defined 
the cooperation activities that should be implemented in relation to nuclear safeguards, had been 
signed in the same month. That Agreement was based on the SCCC and aimed at avoiding 
unnecessary duplication of effort. 
137. Fifteen years after its creation, ABACC could demonstrate to the world the significant 
experience it had gained in carrying out its mandate. During that time, it had become a highly credible 
bi-national safeguards implementation organization that contributed to the international nonproliferation 
regime. Thus it was able to assert with certainty that both countries had carried out their 
nuclear activities in compliance with all their safeguards and non-proliferation obligations. However, 

GC(50)/OR.3

21 


that did not mean that ABACCÂs mission had drawn to an end. Rather, safeguarding the nuclear 
installations of both countries was an ongoing and challenging task. Both countries supported that 
work by providing human and financial resources and the required scientific and technical 
infrastructure. 

138. One of the greatest challenges facing ABACC had been to maintain the quality of its work and 
the technical competency of its technical personnel and inspectors. Thus, ABACC had been 
developing an intensive training programme since its conception, in line with constantly changing 
technology and safeguards concepts. That training programme had also been opened to Agency 
inspectors, thus facilitating the use of common procedures for auditing accounting records, operating 
equipment and carrying out inspections. Argentina and Brazil had on various occasions emphasized 
the importance of continually improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the work of ABACC and 
the Agency to avoid duplication of inspection efforts. 
139. During the preceding session of the General Conference, ABACC had highlighted the work 
being done by ABACC, the Agency and the National Nuclear Energy Commission of Brazil to 
develop a safeguards approach for the first commercial uranium enrichment plant in Brazil under the 
Quadripartite Agreement. On 23 March 2006, that safeguards approach had been approved and the 
basis for the implementation of the inspection regime agreed upon. Since that time, ABACC had 
provided the elements needed to complete the installation of the surveillance system, which had been 
validated and verified by the Agency. ABACC, together with the Agency and the National Nuclear 
Energy Commission of Brazil, had organized the first training course on inspection procedures for the 
enrichment plant, allowing the entry into force of the unannounced inspection regime for that 
installation. That showed what could be achieved through open and constructive dialogue. 
140. With regard to future activities, ABACC would be holding a meeting of its technical 
subcommittee on 26 and 27 September 2006, with the participation of the Agency and the national 
authorities of Argentina and Brazil. Since the Agency was hoping to implement its new safeguards 
approach based on short-notice random inspections as of January 2007, it was hoped that meeting 
would facilitate a fruitful discussion with the national authorities on the relevant points of the new 
approach, so as to make progress on its implementation. That meeting would also be an appropriate 
forum to exchange views on other safeguards-related issues, such as the remote transmission of the 
operational status of modern surveillance systems. As surveillance systems with those and other 
remote capabilities had been installed at the Embalse nuclear power plant in Argentina and the 
commercial uranium enrichment plant in Brazil, it was hoped that the next meeting would establish the 
appropriate conditions for testing remote transmission in order to facilitate the implementation of that 
capability in the near future. ABACC hoped that the subcommittee meeting would give rise to 
initiatives and clear guidelines which would facilitate the continued efficient and effective regional 
implementation of safeguards. Flexible communication between both agencies was essential in that 
regard. 
141. In conclusion, he recognized the contribution of Dr. Jorge Antonio Coll, the first Secretary of 
ABACC, who had passed away in the course of the year.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(continued) 
(GC(50)/4) 
1. 
Mr. 
ISOUN 
(Nigeria) 
welcomed 
the 
crucial 
role 
the 
Agency 
continued 
to 
play 
as 
a 
catalyst 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
socio-economic 
development, 
especially 
in 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
radioisotopes 
to 
increase 
food 
production, 
for 
disease 
control 
and 
eradication, 
water 
resources 
management 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
decision 
to 
award 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
Director 
General 
and 
considered 
that 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
organization 
provided 
a 
golden 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen 
the 
promotion 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
He 
urged 
the 
Agency 
not 
to 
rest 
on 
its 
laurels 
but 
to 
continue 
to 
exploit 
and 
expand 
the 
range 
of 
opportunities 
provided 
by 
nuclear 
technology. 
2. 
Nigeria 
continued 
to 
be 
concerned 
about 
the 
devastating 
effects 
of 
pests 
such 
as 
tsetse 
flies 
and 
malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes 
on 
human 
and 
livestock 
development 
in 
Africa, 
as 
they 
constituted 
a 
major 
obstacle 
to 
poverty 
alleviation. 
It 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
2005Â2006 
biennium 
to 
support 
PATTEC 
using 
both 
the 
TCF 
and 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
and 
was 
grateful 
to 
those 
countries 
that 
had 
made 
extrabudgetary 
contributions. 
He 
also 
thanked 
the 
FAO 
and 
the 
WHO 
for 
participating 
in 
the 
campaign. 
3. 
Remarkable 
success 
had 
been 
achieved 
in 
the 
area-wide 
application 
of 
the 
SIT 
to 
create 
a 
tsetse-free 
zone 
in 
Africa, 
and 
Nigeria 
welcomed 
the 
feasibility 
study 
on 
development 
of 
the 
SIT 
for 
the 
control 
and 
eradication 
of 
malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes. 
Research 
and 
development 
in 
that 
area 
had 
already 
commenced 
in 
both 
the 
laboratory 
and 
the 
field, 
and 
he 
urged 
development 
partners 
to 
allocate 
sufficient 
financial, 
technical 
and 
material 
resources 
to 
promote 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
study 
as 
early 
as 
possible. 
4. 
The 
Nigerian 
Gamma 
Irradiation 
Facility 
had 
been 
licensed 
to 
operate 
and 
had 
been 
opened 
by 
the 
Nigerian 
President 
in 
July 
2006. 
The 
multi-purpose 
facility 
was 
intended 
for 
both 
industrial 
and 
research 
applications, 
had 
an 
innovative 
design 
with 
significantly 
enhanced 
versatility 
and 
was 
thus 
able 
irradiate 
a 
wide 
spectrum 
of 
products. 
Its 
main 
features 
included 
the 
340 
kilocurie 
cobalt-60 
radiation 
source 
(upgradeable 
to 
1000 
kilocurie), 
fully 
automated 
operation 
and 
adequate 
laboratories 
to 
support 
comprehensive 
research 
and 
development 
activities. 
He 
called 
upon 
the 
Agency 
to 
support 
the 
building 
of 
the 
requisite 
capacity 
for 
the 
effective 
utilization 
of 
the 
gamma 
radiation 
facility, 
particularly 
in 
the 
application 
of 
SIT 
for 
eradication 
of 
tsetse 
flies 
and 
malaria-transmitting 
mosquitoes, 
and 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
use 
the 
facility, 
which 
had 
the 
capacity 
to 
serve 
the 
entire 
African 
continent 
and 
the 
neighbouring 
region 
as 
a 
sterile 
insect 
breeder. 
Nigeria 
welcomed 
the 
report 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
April 
2006 
expert 
mission 
to 
make 
an 
initial 
assessment 
of 
the 
application 
of 
the 
SIT 
for 
control 
of 
mosquitoes 
and 
it 
would 
like 
the 
Agency 
to 
follow 
up 
on 
that 
mission 
with 
greater 
specificity 
and 
focus. 
5. 
The 
miniature 
neutron 
source 
reactor 
in 
Zaria 
had 
been 
operating 
safely 
for 
over 
two 
years 
and 
was 
making 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
to 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
Nigeria 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
soil 
fertility 
studies, 
geothermal 
mapping 
and 
education 
and 
manpower 
development. 
6. 
Nigeria 
was 
committed 
to 
exploring 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
its 
future 
energy 
plans, 
while 
remaining 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
His 
countryÂs 
President 
had 
re-confirmed 
NigeriaÂs 
non-proliferation 
credentials 
in 
July 
2006 
during 
the 
inauguration 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
the 
Nigeria 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission. 
On 
that 
occasion, 
the 
President 
had 
requested 
that 
the 

GC(50)/OR.4

Commission 
provide 
the 
necessary 
institutional 
framework 
to 
explore, 
exploit 
and 
harness 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
applications 
for 
the 
socio-economic 
development 
of 
Nigeria. 
It 
was 
expected 
that 
Nigeria 
would 
continue 
to 
enjoy 
the 
support 
and 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
in 
achieving 
its 
development 
objectives. 


7. 
His 
country 
was 
mindful 
that 
the 
adoption 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
had 
global 
implications 
requiring 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
cooperation 
for 
a 
coordinated 
approach 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency. 
It 
therefore 
was 
seeking 
a 
partnership 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
order 
to 
foster 
ties 
with 
other 
interested 
Member 
States 
with 
a 
view 
to 
cooperation 
on 
the 
development 
of 
a 
sustainable 
nuclear 
energy 
programme, 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
key 
components 
of 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
safeguards, 
were 
entrenched 
in 
the 
programme. 
8. 
In 
a 
bid 
to 
reassure 
neighbours 
in 
Africa 
and 
the 
international 
community 
of 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
energy 
plans, 
Nigeria 
had 
organized 
an 
international 
workshop 
in 
June 
2006 
on 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty, 
which 
it 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
African 
countries 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify. 
The 
objective 
of 
the 
workshop 
had 
been 
to 
raise 
awareness 
among 
African 
States 
of 
the 
need 
to 
bring 
the 
Treaty 
into 
force 
10 
years 
after 
it 
had 
been 
opened 
for 
signature. 
Representatives 
from 
African 
diplomatic 
missions 
in 
Nigeria, 
the 
permanent 
members 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
Spain, 
Portugal 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
all 
attended. 
9. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
special 
event 
on 
assurance 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
which 
was 
being 
held 
during 
the 
General 
Conference. 
The 
initiatives 
in 
that 
area 
seemed 
to 
be 
enjoying 
growing 
support 
among 
Member 
States 
and 
Nigeria 
was 
prepared 
to 
join 
the 
discussions 
on 
the 
understanding 
that 
the 
legal 
and 
technical 
implications 
would 
be 
explored 
in 
a 
transparent 
manner. 
10. 
With 
regard 
to 
radiation 
protection, 
the 
Nigerian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
had 
set 
in 
motion 
the 
process 
to 
ratify 
and 
accede 
to 
the 
relevant 
treaties 
and 
additional 
instruments 
necessary 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
a 
successful 
national 
nuclear 
power 
programme, 
including 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention. 
It 
had 
hosted 
a 
technical 
meeting 
on 
the 
ratification 
of 
the 
outstanding 
international 
legislative 
requirements 
for 
a 
sustainable 
and 
successful 
nuclear 
power 
programme 
in 
August 
2006 
which 
had 
been 
attended 
by 
all 
stakeholders. 
Nigeria 
had 
also 
established 
an 
SSAC 
and 
submitted 
annual 
reports 
to 
the 
Agency. 
11. 
Radiation 
safety 
regulations 
for 
diagnostic 
and 
interventional 
radiology, 
industrial 
radiology, 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
Nigeria 
had 
been 
officially 
published 
and 
efforts 
intensified 
to 
develop 
an 
adequate 
technical 
framework 
for 
a 
national 
audit 
of 
the 
radiation 
safety 
of 
selected 
interventional 
radiology 
facilities 
and 
nuclear 
gauges 
in 
the 
manufacturing 
sector, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
complete 
database 
of 
all 
users 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
in 
the 
country. 
A 
good 
measure 
of 
sustainable 
occupational 
exposure 
control 
had 
been 
achieved 
by 
accrediting 
dosimetry 
service 
providers 
within 
the 
country, 
and 
efforts 
to 
promote 
a 
culture 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
safety 
to 
strengthen 
national 
capacity 
for 
the 
provision 
of 
dosimetry 
services 
were 
ongoing. 
Regulatory 
guidance 
for 
dosimetry 
service 
providers 
was 
being 
developed. 
The 
scope 
of 
the 
national 
calibration 
laboratory 
was 
being 
expanded, 
for 
which 
exercise 
the 
Agency 
was 
providing 
expert 
services 
for 
evaluation. 
12. 
The 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
instrument 
for 
ensuring 
compliance 
with 
the 
Treaty. 
Nigeria 
encouraged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
made 
a 
non-proliferation 
commitment 
to 
fulfil 
their 
legal 
obligations 
by 
concluding 
the 
required 
agreements. 
It 
called 
upon 
States 
outside 
the 
system 
to 
adhere 
strictly 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
thereby 
contribute 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Nigeria 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
2001. 
With 
the 
cooperation 
of 
all 
Member 
States, 
the 
Agency 

GC(50)/OR.4

should 
continue 
to 
do 
its 
utmost 
to 
maintain 
public 
confidence 
by 
maintaining 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
ensuring 
global 
peace 
and 
security. 


13. 
Turning 
to 
the 
proposed 
TCF 
target 
figure 
of 
US 
$80 
million 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
biennium, 
he 
said 
that, 
although 
it 
represented 
an 
increase 
over 
the 
target 
for 
2005Â2006 
in 
numerical 
terms, 
in 
real 
terms 
it 
reflected 
zero 
real 
growth, 
taking 
into 
account 
the 
increasing 
needs 
and 
requests 
of 
Member 
States 
for 
technical 
assistance. 
He 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
reconsider 
the 
matter 
and 
contribute 
more 
resources 
to 
the 
TCF 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
carry 
out 
its 
very 
important 
activities 
in 
that 
area 
in 
the 
future. 
Nigeria 
intended 
to 
pledge 
to 
the 
TCF 
a 
sum 
equal 
to 
its 
assessed 
contribution 
for 
the 
year 
2007. 
14. 
Mr. 
GONZÃLEZ 
BERMÃDEZ 
(Cuba) 
said 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
an 
appropriate 
occasion 
to 
recognize 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
role 
in 
promoting 
peace 
and 
development. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
in 
2005 
had 
rightly 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and, 
in 
that 
connection, 
he 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund. 
15. 
The 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
highlighted 
the 
growing 
expectations 
of 
nuclear 
power 
worldwide. 
Cuba 
supported 
all 
actions, 
including 
those 
relating 
to 
public 
information 
and 
popularization, 
designed 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
played 
a 
decisive 
role 
in 
global 
energy 
development. 
16. 
A 
greater 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
counteract 
the 
negative 
image 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
media 
as 
a 
Ânuclear 
watchdogÂ, 
which 
distorted 
its 
verification 
and 
safeguards 
mandate 
and 
obscured 
its 
work 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
17. 
The 
resurgence 
of 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
was 
linked 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
which 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
become 
the 
monopoly 
of 
the 
few. 
His 
country 
recognized 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
to 
analyse 
that 
complex 
and 
delicate 
issue. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
all 
interested 
Member 
States 
take 
an 
active 
and 
transparent 
part 
in 
that 
analysis. 
Any 
decision 
should 
be 
taken 
by 
consensus 
and 
win 
the 
approval 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Policy-Making 
Organs. 
18. 
Cuba 
was 
particularly 
interested 
in 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
their 
applications 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
health, 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
industry, 
hydrology 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
His 
Government 
was 
trying 
to 
revitalize 
those 
areas 
and 
had 
invested 
significantly 
in 
diagnostic 
and 
therapeutic 
equipment 
for 
hospitals 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
PACT 
programme 
and 
stressed 
the 
need 
to 
provide 
adequate 
funding 
for 
it. 
19. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
maintain 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities. 
In 
that 
context, 
he 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
for 
developing 
countries. 
Cuba 
gave 
a 
high 
priority 
to 
technical 
cooperation, 
as 
demonstrated 
by 
its 
full 
and 
timely 
compliance 
with 
its 
commitments 
to 
the 
TCF, 
the 
full 
payment 
of 
its 
NPCs, 
the 
87% 
implementation 
rate 
for 
its 
national 
projects, 
and 
its 
provision 
of 
more 
than 
300 
experts 
over 
10 
years 
for 
technical 
missions 
to 
other 
countries, 
despite 
the 
unjust 
and 
destructive 
economic, 
commercial 
and 
financial 
sanctions 
imposed 
upon 
it 
by 
the 
United 
States 
which 
made 
acquiring 
equipment 
difficult 
and 
hindered 
the 
participation 
of 
Cuban 
experts 
in 
Agency 
events. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
tireless 
efforts 
in 
seeking 
solutions 
to 
those 
problems. 
Cuba 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
cooperation 
between 
developing 
countries 
and 
therefore 
supported 
ARCAL. 
It 
hoped 
that 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
would 
help 
strengthen 
and 
increase 
efficiency 
in 
that 
area. 
20. 
His 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
complete, 
unconditional 
and 
verifiable 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Many 
countries 
that 
shared 
that 
goal 
had 
placed 
their 
hopes 
in 
the 
NPT. 
Cuba 
had 
always 
considered 
the 
NPT 
to 
be 
insufficient 
and 
discriminatory. 
However, 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
its 
commitment 
to 
multilateralism, 
it 
had 
adhered 
to 
the 
Treaty 
and 
had 
ratified 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty. 
It 
complied 
strictly 

GC(50)/OR.4 
19 
September 
2006, 
Page

with 
its 
commitments 
under 
those 
Treaties 
and 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 


21. 
Cuba 
shared 
the 
frustration 
of 
a 
large 
number 
of 
countries 
regarding 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
with 
respect 
to 
disarmament 
and 
the 
prevailing 
tendency 
to 
focus 
efforts 
on 
non-proliferation. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
had 
received 
special 
attention 
at 
the 
recent 
14th 
summit 
of 
Heads 
of 
State 
or 
Government 
of 
the 
NAM 
held 
in 
Havana. 
The 
documents 
from 
that 
meeting 
would 
be 
distributed 
shortly 
but 
he 
wished 
to 
highlight 
some 
of 
the 
views 
expressed 
on 
disarmament 
and 
the 
Agency. 
The 
NAM 
Heads 
of 
State 
or 
Government 
had 
reaffirmed 
their 
positions 
of 
principle 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
which 
continued 
to 
be 
NAMÂs 
highest 
priority, 
and 
the 
related 
issue 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
They 
had 
emphasized 
their 
concern 
regarding 
the 
threat 
to 
humanity 
posed 
by 
the 
existence 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
their 
possible 
use, 
or 
the 
threat 
of 
their 
use. 
They 
had 
expressed 
profound 
concern 
over 
the 
slow 
progress 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
by 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
toward 
eliminating 
their 
arsenals. 
They 
had 
reaffirmed 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
developing 
countries 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination 
and 
had 
expressed 
concern 
over 
continuing 
excessive 
restrictions 
on 
the 
export 
of 
material, 
equipment 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
to 
developing 
countries. 
They 
had 
emphasized 
that 
proliferation 
concerns 
would 
be 
better 
met 
through 
multilateral, 
universal, 
comprehensive 
and 
non-discriminatory 
agreements, 
that 
non-proliferation 
agreements 
should 
be 
transparent 
and 
open 
to 
all 
States, 
and 
that 
no 
restriction 
should 
be 
imposed 
on 
access 
to 
material, 
equipment 
and 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
required 
by 
developing 
countries 
to 
further 
their 
development. 
They 
had 
rejected 
the 
attempts 
of 
any 
Member 
State 
to 
use 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
as 
a 
political 
tool 
in 
violation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
They 
had 
emphasized 
the 
positive 
role 
played 
by 
NAM 
members 
in 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
noted 
the 
need 
for 
all 
members 
to 
respect 
the 
Statute. 
They 
had 
stressed 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
should 
not 
be 
subjected 
to 
any 
pressure 
or 
improper 
interference, 
especially 
in 
the 
area 
of 
verification, 
that 
could 
jeopardize 
the 
organizationÂs 
efficiency 
and 
credibility. 
They 
had 
recognized 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
competent 
authority 
to 
verify 
compliance 
with 
obligations 
entered 
into 
under 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
had 
reaffirmed 
the 
need 
to 
make 
a 
clear 
distinction 
between 
such 
legal 
obligations 
and 
voluntary 
commitments. 
Finally 
they 
had 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
receiving 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
2005 
and 
had 
expressed 
their 
full 
confidence 
in 
the 
impartiality 
and 
professionalism 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Following 
the 
summit, 
Cuba 
was 
taking 
over 
the 
presidency 
of 
NAM 
for 
the 
coming 
3 
years 
and, 
consequently, 
would 
be 
coordinating 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Vienna 
Chapter. 
He 
thanked 
Malaysia 
for 
its 
leadership 
of 
NAM 
in 
recent 
years. 
22. 
Mr. 
KADIMAN 
(Indonesia) 
said 
that, 
over 
the 
past 
50 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
contributed 
greatly 
to 
the 
advancement 
of 
humanity 
through 
nuclear 
applications, 
promoting 
socio-economic 
development, 
maintaining 
world 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
promoting 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
He 
thanked 
and 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General, 
Agency 
staff 
and 
Member 
States 
for 
contributing 
effectively 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programmes, 
which 
had 
been 
recognized 
by 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
2005. 
23. 
Like 
other 
developing 
countries, 
Indonesia 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
was 
the 
basic 
instrument 
for 
promoting 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development 
in 
Member 
States. 
In 
that 
connection, 
his 
country 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
on 
the 
level 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007Â2008 
and 
the 
IPFs 
for 
2009Â2011. 
The 
consensus 
figures 
confirmed 
the 
commitment 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
Any 
decrease 
in 
the 
support 
for 
the 
TCF 
would 
be 
detrimental 
to 
developing 
Member 
States 
and 
would 
undermine 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
leading 
to 
a 
serious 
imbalance 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
main 
functions. 
The 
Agency 
should 
be 
provided 
with 
sufficient, 
assured 
and 
predictable 
resources 
for 
those 
activities. 
Thanking 
all 
countries 
that 
had 
made 
their 
contributions 

GC(50)/OR.4

regularly 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time, 
he 
noted 
that 
Indonesia 
had 
consistently 
met 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Fund 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
do 
so. 


24. 
Decisions 
on 
TCF 
targets 
and 
IPFs 
should 
take 
account 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
maintaining 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
AgencyÂs 
various 
statutory 
activities 
and 
the 
need 
to 
promote 
technical 
cooperation. 
Efforts 
to 
make 
TCF 
resources 
more 
predictable 
and 
assured 
should 
aim 
at 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
should 
not 
impose 
an 
additional 
financial 
burden 
on 
Member 
States, 
especially 
developing 
countries. 
25. 
Certain 
emerging 
issues, 
including 
funding 
for 
the 
PACT 
programme, 
had 
financial 
implications. 
Bearing 
in 
mind 
the 
crucial 
importance 
of 
fighting 
cancer, 
Indonesia 
supported 
the 
proposal 
that 
the 
Board 
should 
authorize 
the 
use 
of 
part 
of 
the 
2004 
Regular 
Budget 
surplus 
to 
cover 
the 
costs 
of 
PACT 
in 
2006 
and 
2007. 
His 
country 
looked 
forward 
to 
an 
early 
agreement 
on 
the 
funding 
of 
the 
programme. 
26. 
The 
Agency 
had 
embarked 
on 
a 
new 
approach 
to 
improve 
CPFs. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
publication 
of 
the 
CPF 
operational 
guidelines 
as 
a 
tool 
to 
develop 
a 
systematic 
process 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
a 
specific 
and 
detailed 
plan 
of 
action 
for 
a 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
concept. 
However, 
the 
experience 
and 
difficulties 
in 
developing 
the 
Programme 
Cycle 
Management 
Framework 
should 
be 
taken 
into 
account 
to 
facilitate 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
new 
approach. 
27. 
Since 
its 
inception, 
the 
Agency 
had 
witnessed 
population 
growth 
and 
rising 
demands 
for 
energy 
to 
improve 
living 
standards. 
Nuclear 
technology 
played 
an 
important 
and 
often 
unique 
role 
in 
many 
aspects 
of 
human 
life, 
both 
as 
regards 
its 
potential 
for 
meeting 
global 
energy 
demands 
and 
through 
non-energy 
applications. 
Experience 
had 
shown 
that 
traditional 
energy 
sources 
were 
inadequate 
to 
meet 
demand. 
28. 
Against 
that 
backdrop, 
Indonesia 
was 
developing 
its 
nuclear 
energy 
programme 
and 
was 
building 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
due 
to 
become 
operational 
in 
2016. 
Government 
regulations 
on 
the 
licensing 
of 
nuclear 
reactors 
would 
be 
signed 
by 
the 
President 
shortly. 
Presidential 
Decree 
No. 
7 
on 
the 
national 
energy 
policy 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
had 
been 
enacted 
early 
in 
2006. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
support 
the 
Agency 
was 
giving 
through 
three 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
hoped 
that 
that 
assistance 
would 
be 
further 
strengthened 
with 
a 
view 
to 
enhancing 
the 
capability 
of 
IndonesiaÂs 
regulatory 
authority 
to 
develop 
standard 
specifications 
and 
train 
qualified 
staff 
to 
supervise 
and 
operate 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Intensive 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
cooperation 
with 
countries 
with 
greater 
experience 
in 
the 
field 
was 
also 
crucial. 
29. 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
contributed 
considerably 
to 
increasing 
Member 
StatesÂ 
capacities 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
applications, 
which 
had 
improved 
quality 
of 
life 
especially 
in 
developing 
countries. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
appreciated 
in 
particular 
its 
support 
for 
radiation-induced 
breeding 
of 
new 
varieties 
of 
plants. 
The 
cultivation 
of 
biofuel 
plants 
was 
in 
line 
with 
IndonesiaÂs 
recently 
formulated 
Green 
Energy 
Action 
Plan, 
which 
aimed 
at 
developing 
alternative 
energy 
sources, 
especially 
for 
transportation 
and 
electricity. 
Over 
25 
new 
and 
improved 
varieties 
of 
staple 
food 
crops 
had 
been 
released 
in 
2005. 
Indonesia 
had 
planted 
high-quality 
mutant 
rice 
varieties 
which 
were 
expected 
to 
cover 
an 
area 
of 
1 
million 
hectares 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2006. 
30. 
Indonesia 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
installations. 
Information 
provided 
by 
the 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
was 
disseminated 
to 
Indonesian 
universities 
and 
the 
academic 
community 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
and 
share 
nuclear 
safety 
knowledge 
among 
young 
people. 
In 
addition, 
a 
website 
had 
been 
established 
to 
share 
his 
countryÂs 
experience 
and 
knowledge 
on 
nuclear 
safety.

31. 
In 
2005, 
the 
Agency 
had 
maintained 
a 
good 
record 
on 
safe 
operation 
of 
research 
reactors 
and 
Indonesia 
welcomed 
in 
particular 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
national 
project 
on 
inspection 
procedures 
and 
methods 
for 
assessing 
the 
condition 
of 
reactor 
tank 
liners. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy, 
Indonesia 
had 
improved 
the 
operational 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
its 
three 
research 
reactors. 
32. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
INPRO 
activities 
and 
welcomed 
the 
application 
of 
the 
INPRO 
user 
methodology 
in 
multiple 
contexts 
as 
part 
of 
assessing 
innovative 
nuclear 
systems. 
33. 
Turning 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
radiation 
safety 
and 
security, 
he 
noted 
that 
Indonesia 
had 
established 
an 
information 
system 
on 
licensing 
and 
inspection 
of 
radiation 
facilities 
and 
radioactive 
sources. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
it 
had 
carried 
out 
a 
field 
exercise 
on 
radiation 
dispersion 
devices 
in 
the 
Jakarta 
Province 
and 
had 
successfully 
conducted 
a 
training 
course 
for 
first 
responders 
to 
radiological 
emergencies. 
34. 
Although 
his 
country 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
issue 
of 
denial 
of 
shipments 
had 
been 
resolved 
successfully, 
the 
security 
aspect 
of 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
should 
be 
addressed 
as 
a 
priority. 
Security 
was 
also 
a 
concern 
when 
transporting 
radioactive 
waste 
from 
remote 
areas 
to 
centralized 
waste 
management 
sites. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
Indonesia 
was 
revising 
its 
regulations 
on 
the 
safety 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Basic 
Safety 
Standards. 
35. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
work 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
to 
ensure 
non-proliferation. 
However, 
proliferation 
concerns 
and 
safeguard 
issues 
were 
best 
addressed 
through 
multilaterally 
negotiated, 
universal, 
comprehensive 
and 
non-discriminatory 
agreements. 
Non-proliferation 
control 
arrangements 
should 
be 
transparent 
and 
open 
to 
the 
participation 
of 
all 
States 
and 
should 
not 
impose 
restrictions 
on 
access 
to 
material, 
equipment 
and 
technology. 
As 
a 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol, 
Indonesia 
supported 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
States 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination 
and 
in 
conformity 
with 
the 
NPT. 
Nothing 
in 
that 
Treaty 
should 
be 
interpreted 
as 
affecting 
that 
right, 
which 
constituted 
one 
of 
its 
fundamental 
objectives. 
Each 
countryÂs 
decision 
in 
that 
regard 
should 
be 
respected, 
without 
jeopardizing 
its 
policies, 
international 
cooperation 
agreements, 
arrangements 
for 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
or 
its 
fuel 
cycle 
policies. 
36. 
Indonesia 
was 
gravely 
concerned 
about 
the 
stagnation 
of 
the 
peace 
process 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
the 
continuing 
flagrant 
violation 
by 
Israel 
of 
international 
law. 
It 
endorsed 
the 
declaration 
adopted 
by 
the 
14th 
NAM 
summit 
in 
Havana 
calling 
for 
intensified 
international 
efforts 
to 
revive 
the 
peace 
process 
and 
ensure 
respect 
for 
international 
law. 
Resumption 
of 
the 
peace 
process 
was 
crucial 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
region. 
37. 
The 
lack 
of 
progress 
with 
regard 
to 
full 
implementation 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
result 
of 
IsraelÂs 
continuing 
intransigence 
was 
also 
regrettable. 
IsraelÂs 
deplorable 
attitude 
reflected 
a 
total 
disregard 
for 
the 
needs 
and 
concerns 
of 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Director 
General 
should 
continue 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
urgency. 
All 
parties 
concerned 
should 
implement 
the 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
concerning 
the 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
He 
urged 
Israel 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
without 
delay. 
38. 
The 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
crucial 
to 
maintaining 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
that 
region. 
All 
parties 
should 
sustain 
their 
efforts 
in 
pursuit 
of 
that 
goal, 
especially 
through 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
Indonesia 
endorsed 
the 
support 
expressed 
by 
NAM 
leaders 
at 
the 
Havana 
Summit 
for

the 
joint 
statement 
of 
principles 
on 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
of 
19 
September 
2005 
and 
called 
for 
its 
expeditious 
and 
faithful 
implementation. 


Ms. 
Gervais-Vidricaire 
(Canada), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


39. 
Mr. 
KIRAKOSSIAN 
(Armenia) 
congratulated 
all 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
staff 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
very 
important 
role 
in 
non-proliferation, 
verification 
and 
safety 
and 
security. 
In 
retrospect, 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
the 
decision 
to 
establish 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
a 
very 
important 
one. 
Since 
that 
time, 
the 
Agency 
had 
carried 
out 
thousands 
of 
missions 
all 
over 
the 
world 
and 
had 
improved 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
NPT, 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
additional 
protocols 
and 
the 
CTBT 
were 
the 
main 
legal 
instruments 
guiding 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work. 
Armenia 
had 
recently 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
and 
appealed 
to 
all 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Treaty 
as 
evidence 
of 
their 
peaceful 
intentions 
and 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
40. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
strength 
was 
that 
it 
had 
been 
a 
forum 
for 
dialogue 
and 
diplomacy 
rather 
than 
conflict 
and 
confrontation, 
and 
it 
should 
remain 
so 
in 
the 
future 
as 
current 
and 
future 
challenges 
would 
require 
the 
Agency 
to 
make 
fair 
and 
transparent 
assessments 
of 
nuclear 
issues. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
bore 
testimony 
to 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
professionalism 
and 
the 
dedication 
of 
its 
staff. 
That 
notwithstanding, 
additional 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
improve 
further 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
the 
fuel 
cycle, 
particularly 
at 
a 
time 
when 
there 
was 
more 
intense 
cooperation 
in 
the 
international 
community 
to 
combat 
terrorism 
and 
other 
new 
threats. 
In 
coming 
years, 
the 
energy 
market 
would 
come 
to 
rely 
on 
nuclear 
power 
to 
a 
greater 
extent. 
In 
the 
past, 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
had 
been 
restricted 
to 
a 
few 
countries, 
but 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
developing 
countries 
were 
implementing 
ambitious 
plans 
to 
construct 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
It 
was 
therefore 
important 
to 
upgrade 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
operation 
and 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
other 
radioactive 
sources. 
41. 
The 
recent 
visit 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
Armenia 
had 
resulted 
in 
very 
fruitful 
discussions. 
It 
had 
become 
clear 
that 
there 
was 
a 
certain 
lack 
of 
coordination 
with 
respect 
to 
various 
activities 
and 
projects 
for 
Armenia. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
international 
assistance 
more 
efficient, 
the 
Director 
General 
had, 
in 
December 
2005, 
convened 
a 
special 
technical 
meeting 
for 
the 
coordination 
of 
international 
assistance 
to 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
which 
representatives 
of 
various 
Agency 
divisions 
and 
donor 
countries 
had 
participated. 
The 
summary 
of 
the 
meeting 
had 
presented 
a 
careful 
analysis 
of 
design, 
seismic, 
and 
operational 
safety 
issues, 
and 
regulatory 
issues, 
and 
of 
the 
relationship 
between 
safety 
issues 
in 
IAEA 
TECDOCs 
and 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
upgrading 
programme. 
Under 
that 
programme, 
his 
country 
had 
committed 
itself 
to 
implementing 
a 
number 
of 
additional 
measures 
aimed 
at 
upgrading 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
power 
plant 
and 
the 
Armenian 
Government 
had 
allocated 
an 
additional 
US 
$1.8 
million 
for 
the 
purpose. 
The 
measures 
were 
due 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
October 
2006 
during 
the 
plantÂs 
annual 
outage 
and 
refuelling. 
The 
next 
technical 
meeting 
for 
coordination 
of 
international 
assistance 
was 
to 
be 
held 
in 
Yerevan 
in 
October 
2006 
and 
would 
consider 
the 
measures 
already 
taken 
and 
make 
further 
recommendations. 
The 
Armenian 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
licenced 
by 
the 
Armenian 
National 
Regulatory 
Authority 
in 
2006. 
42. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
the 
protection 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
an 
inventory 
of 
existing 
radioactive 
sources 
had 
been 
taken 
and 
orphan 
sources 
were 
being 
investigated 
as 
part 
of 
an 
ongoing 
project. 
43. 
In 
2006, 
Armenia 
had 
taken 
up 
chairmanship 
of 
the 
Cooperation 
Forum 
for 
WWER 
Regulators 
and 
had 
hosted 
the 
13th 
annual 
meeting 
in 
Yerevan 
in 
June. 
The 
Forum 
allowed 
regulators 
to 
share 
experiences 
and 
exchange 
relevant 
information 
and 
knowledge. 
The 
discussions 
had 
been 
very 
fruitful 
and 
transparent, 
and 
three 
new 
Member 
States 
Â 
China, 
India 
and 
Iran 
Â 
had 
joined 
the 
Forum.

44. 
Armenia 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
provided, 
in 
particular 
for 
its 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
and 
ArmeniaÂs 
permanent 
partners, 
a 
number 
of 
projects 
had 
been 
prepared 
and 
implemented 
in 
various 
fields. 
A 
project 
had 
been 
approved 
for 
the 
next 
biennium 
for 
a 
feasibility 
study 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
development 
in 
Armenia 
which 
would 
assess 
the 
cost 
of 
constructing 
new 
nuclear 
reactors 
taking 
into 
account 
existing 
infrastructure 
and 
the 
professionalism 
of 
the 
staff 
operating 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
The 
political 
instability 
in 
the 
region 
and 
the 
continued 
attempts 
by 
two 
neighbouring 
countries 
to 
isolate 
the 
country 
economically 
meant 
that 
the 
feasibility 
study 
was 
highly 
important 
for 
ArmeniaÂs 
future 
energy 
policy. 
Under 
the 
2006Â2007 
TACIS 
programme, 
his 
Government 
was 
working 
on 
a 
project 
to 
assist 
the 
Armenian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
with 
the 
development 
of 
a 
decommissioning 
plan 
for 
Unit 
2 
of 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
45. 
Armenia 
took 
a 
great 
interest 
in 
the 
INPRO 
project 
and, 
in 
view 
of 
its 
importance 
for 
countries 
planning 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
energy, 
felt 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
the 
Board 
should 
avail 
themselves 
of 
any 
opportunity 
to 
allocate 
funds 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
so 
that 
INPRO 
did 
not 
have 
to 
rely 
exclusively 
on 
extrabudgetary 
contributions. 
46. 
He 
conveyed 
the 
sincere 
gratitude 
of 
his 
Government 
to 
all 
donor 
countries, 
especially 
those 
with 
which 
it 
had 
been 
cooperating 
on 
a 
bilateral 
basis 
since 
operation 
of 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
resumed 
in 
1995. 
The 
assistance 
provided 
by 
the 
Czech 
Republic, 
the 
United 
States, 
France, 
Slovakia, 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
Bulgaria 
had 
been 
very 
important 
for 
the 
country. 
47. 
Mr. 
WASZCZYKOWSKI 
(Poland), 
having 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
award 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
said 
that 
recent 
years 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
vital 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
verifying 
non-proliferation 
commitments 
and 
providing 
assurances 
to 
the 
international 
community 
regarding 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities. 
The 
award 
had 
also 
provided 
an 
excellent 
opportunity 
for 
the 
Agency 
to 
promote 
its 
work 
in 
nuclear 
sciences 
and 
applications. 
Poland 
welcomed 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision 
to 
use 
the 
prize 
money 
for 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund, 
to 
which 
Poland 
would 
make 
a 
substantial 
voluntary 
contribution. 
To 
mark 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Poland 
together 
with 
France, 
had 
donated 
a 
bust 
of 
the 
double 
Nobel 
Prize 
winner, 
Maria 
Sklodowska-Curie, 
to 
the 
Agency. 
48. 
A 
universal 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
backed 
by 
a 
strong 
international 
safeguards 
system 
was 
an 
essential 
basis 
for 
global 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
and 
maintain 
security 
by 
pursuing, 
inter 
alia, 
nuclear 
disarmament 
in 
line 
with 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Poland 
deeply 
regretted 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
which 
did 
not 
however 
change 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
organization 
responsible 
for 
implementing 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
His 
country 
strongly 
supported 
the 
universal 
introduction 
of 
integrated 
safeguards. 
It 
had 
had 
a 
bilateral 
additional 
protocol 
in 
force 
since 
2000 
and 
had 
recently 
completed 
internal 
ratification 
of 
the 
trilateral 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
related 
additional 
protocol 
between 
the 
European 
Atomic 
Energy 
Community, 
EU 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Agency. 
He 
urged 
all 
States 
which 
had 
not 
concluded 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
to 
do 
so 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
He 
also 
encouraged 
the 
States 
concerned 
to 
sign 
and 
implement 
the 
modified 
version 
of 
the 
SQP. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
had 
to 
adapt 
to 
new 
challenges 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
was 
a 
step 
in 
the 
right 
direction. 
Finally, 
he 
appealed 
to 
all 
countries 
recognizing 
the 
importance 
and 
legitimacy 
of 
the 
CTBT 
to 
adhere 
to 
it. 
49. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
verifying 
the 
nature, 
scope 
and 
direction 
of 
programmes 
which 
might 
lead 
to 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
capabilities 
was 
vital. 
Knowledge 
of 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities 
had 
become 
drastically 
limited 
following 
the 
expulsion 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inspectors 
in 
2003. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
professional 
and 
comprehensive 
reports 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 

GC(50)/OR.4

safeguards 
in 
Iran 
provided 
the 
international 
community 
with 
the 
information 
needed 
to 
devise 
a 
solution 
which 
would 
contribute 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
while 
addressing 
legitimate 
needs 
for 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Poland 
strongly 
supported 
the 
actions 
taken 
by 
both 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
United 
Nations, 
whose 
resolutions 
should 
be 
respected 
and 
implemented. 
It 
also 
supported 
the 
diplomatic 
efforts 
undertaken 
by 
a 
group 
of 
countries 
with 
the 
direct 
and 
active 
involvement 
of 
the 
EU 
High 
Representative. 
Furthermore, 
his 
country 
was 
disturbed 
by 
the 
recent 
trends 
in 
the 
proliferation 
of 
uranium 
enrichment 
technologies. 
It 
strongly 
supported 
the 
initiatives 
relating 
to 
assurance 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
supplies, 
which 
would 
enable 
countries 
with 
modest 
nuclear 
energy 
programmes 
to 
forgo 
such 
proliferation-sensitive 
technologies. 


50. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
planning 
and 
coordinating 
efforts 
to 
protect 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
CPPNM, 
as 
amended 
in 
2005, 
was 
a 
valuable 
instrument 
in 
that 
regard. 
Poland 
had 
signed 
the 
amendment 
and 
the 
ratification 
procedure 
would 
soon 
be 
complete. 
It 
hoped 
that 
other 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Convention 
would 
do 
the 
same. 
In 
order 
to 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
HEU 
in 
its 
peaceful 
applications, 
as 
part 
of 
its 
involvement 
in 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative, 
Poland 
had 
decided 
to 
convert 
its 
research 
reactor 
core 
to 
use 
LEU 
fuel, 
and 
the 
transfer 
of 
its 
unirradiated 
HEU 
fuel 
stockpiles 
to 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
had 
been 
completed 
in 
August 
2006. 
It 
was 
grateful 
to 
all 
parties 
involved 
in 
that 
process. 
It 
had 
also 
taken 
note 
of 
the 
new 
initiative 
announced 
by 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
first 
meeting 
under 
that 
initiative 
in 
October 
2006. 
Poland 
had 
also 
made 
a 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
in 
2005. 
51. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
role 
of 
international 
legal 
instruments 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
worldwide. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
results 
of 
the 
third 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
It 
also 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
and 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
apply 
them 
voluntarily. 
Twenty 
years 
after 
the 
Chernobyl 
disaster, 
he 
urged 
those 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Convention 
on 
Early 
Notification 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
Assistance 
in 
the 
Case 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
or 
Radiological 
Emergency. 
52. 
Poland 
was 
reconsidering 
the 
nuclear 
power 
option 
and 
therefore 
wished 
to 
reactivate 
its 
nuclear 
research 
and 
education 
activities. 
Initiatives 
like 
the 
regional 
networks 
and 
the 
nuclear 
knowledge 
packages 
proposed 
during 
the 
conference 
on 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
held 
in 
Saclay, 
France, 
in 
2004, 
or 
the 
education 
and 
training 
activities 
organized 
by 
the 
ICTP 
could 
be 
very 
valuable 
in 
that 
context. 
A 
conference 
on 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
for 
Poland 
had 
recently 
been 
held 
in 
Warsaw 
and 
recent 
meetings 
and 
discussions 
on 
the 
application 
of 
high-temperature 
reactor 
technologies 
to 
the 
reprocessing 
of 
hard 
coal 
and 
for 
hydrogen 
production 
could 
provide 
important 
new 
solutions 
for 
Poland, 
as 
one 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
leading 
coal 
producers. 
53. 
Technical 
cooperation 
remained 
an 
important 
Agency 
activity. 
He 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
considerable 
progress 
towards 
increasing 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
and 
the 
new 
Programme 
Cycle 
Management 
Framework 
would 
contribute 
to 
that 
aim. 
54. 
The 
financing 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
be 
assured, 
sufficient 
and 
predictable, 
and 
all 
Member 
States 
should 
demonstrate 
their 
commitment 
to 
the 
programme 
by 
paying 
their 
TCF 
target 
shares 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full. 
As 
in 
previous 
years, 
Poland 
was 
prepared 
to 
pledge 
and 
pay 
its 
target 
share.

55. 
Mr. 
SKOKNIC 
(Chile) 
conveyed 
his 
countryÂs 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
all 
the 
staff 
at 
the 
Agency 
for 
their 
productive 
and 
professional 
work 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
organizationÂs 
50th 
anniversary. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
undoubtedly 
constituted 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
landmarks 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
history 
and 
was 
a 
deserved 
recognition 
of 
the 
prestige 
and 
significance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
under 
the 
competent 
and 
balanced 
leadership 
of 
its 
Director 
General. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
over 
the 
preceding 
five 
decades 
had 
been 
significant, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation, 
application 
of 
safeguards, 
and 
technical 
assistance 
and 
cooperation 
for 
the 
development 
and 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
technologies, 
and 
they 
had 
contributed 
to 
improving 
the 
welfare 
of 
all 
countries. 
However, 
despite 
the 
progress 
made, 
there 
was 
still 
a 
long 
way 
to 
go. 
Chile 
remained 
dedicated 
to 
achieving 
worldwide 
peace 
and 
security 
based 
on 
the 
application 
of 
international 
law. 
The 
best 
way 
of 
contributing 
to 
that 
objective 
was 
by 
ratifying 
the 
relevant 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
in 
particular 
those 
concerning 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
56. 
Chile, 
together 
with 
the 
other 
States 
in 
the 
Latin 
American 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
region, 
had 
maintained 
a 
common 
vision 
regarding 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
it 
was 
profoundly 
pacifist 
in 
its 
unconditional 
compliance 
with 
international 
law. 
Thus, 
it 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
through 
which 
the 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
region 
had 
become 
the 
first 
densely 
populated 
region 
in 
the 
world 
to 
be 
declared 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
In 
addition, 
it 
had 
ratified 
the 
CTBT. 
Chile 
was 
also 
party 
to 
other 
international 
instruments 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
emergency 
assistance, 
civil 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage 
and 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
That 
legal 
framework 
should 
become 
the 
basis 
for 
a 
safer 
and 
more 
predictable 
international 
situation. 
57. 
ChileÂs 
commitment 
did 
not 
end 
with 
the 
ratification 
of 
such 
international 
legal 
instruments. 
It 
was 
making 
a 
serious 
effort 
to 
apply 
them 
rigorously 
within 
the 
country 
and 
to 
disseminate 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
by 
participating 
in 
various 
regional 
cooperation 
projects. 
The 
importance 
of 
renouncing 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
military 
purposes 
could 
not 
and 
should 
not 
to 
used 
as 
an 
argument 
for 
limiting 
or 
preventing 
scientific 
research 
and 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
which 
right 
all 
States 
enjoyed 
under 
the 
NPT. 
58. 
Chile 
believed 
that 
the 
main 
challenge 
facing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
was 
the 
need 
to 
gain 
more 
international 
support. 
That 
meant 
more 
States 
signing 
and 
subsequently 
ratifying 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
Strengthening 
verification 
capacities 
and 
international 
safeguards 
instruments 
should 
include 
strengthening 
the 
SQP, 
which 
was 
currently 
not 
an 
effective 
instrument. 
For 
that 
reason, 
Chile 
supported 
giving 
the 
Agency 
more 
authority 
to 
carry 
out 
on-site 
verification 
activities. 
59. 
His 
country 
had 
signed 
and 
ratified 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency, 
which 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
April 
2004. 
Since 
then, 
Chile 
had 
complied 
fully 
with 
the 
schedule 
established 
by 
the 
Agency, 
supplying 
all 
the 
declarations 
requested. 
During 
the 
annual 
safeguards 
visit 
to 
the 
facilities 
of 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission, 
the 
inspections 
required 
under 
the 
additional 
protocol 
had 
been 
performed 
with 
satisfactory 
results. 
60. 
The 
issue 
of 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
Iran 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
concern 
to 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
various 
reports 
on 
the 
matter, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
subsequently 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council, 
had 
been 
clear 
in 
calling 
on 
Iran 
to 
collaborate 
fully 
and 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
provide 
the 
information 
required 
to 
clarify 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
development 
plan. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
not 
received 
the 
cooperation 
requested 
and 
he 
urged 
Iran 
to 
meet 
the 
AgencyÂs 
requirements 
in 
line 
with 
its 
international 
obligations 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
Chile 
had 
observed 
with 
interest 
the 
recent 
meetings 
between 
the 
European 
and 
Iranian 
authorities 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
problem 

GC(50)/OR.4

of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
could 
be 
overcome 
through 
constructive 
dialogue 
with 
the 
cooperation 
of 
the 
international 
community. 


61. 
All 
States 
were 
affected 
by 
the 
challenge 
that 
terrorism 
posed 
to 
security, 
the 
prevalence 
of 
which 
obliged 
governments 
to 
be 
on 
constant 
alert. 
Alongside 
all 
domestic 
measures 
that 
governments 
could 
adopt, 
international 
agreements 
were 
invaluable 
instruments 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
terrorism 
and 
the 
protection 
of 
citizens 
against 
terrorist 
acts. 
Chile 
had 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
the 
thirteenth 
anti-terrorist 
instrument 
adopted 
by 
the 
United 
Nations, 
after 
it 
had 
been 
approved 
by 
consensus 
at 
the 
General 
Assembly. 
62. 
His 
country 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
which 
was 
why 
it 
had 
insisted 
on 
the 
need 
to 
keep 
the 
topic 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
agenda. 
An 
appropriate 
framework 
for 
such 
transport 
had 
to 
include 
clear 
regulations 
for 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
covering 
protection 
of 
the 
marine 
environment, 
and 
rules 
to 
prevent 
pollution, 
timely 
information 
on 
the 
choice 
and 
frequency 
of 
use 
of 
maritime 
routes 
and 
information 
on 
volumes 
of 
cargo, 
inter 
alia. 
The 
consultations 
between 
representatives 
of 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States 
that 
had 
been 
taking 
place 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
proving 
very 
useful. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
they 
would 
continue, 
since 
they 
served 
to 
maintain 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
trust 
that 
facilitated 
a 
rapprochement 
on 
politically 
sensitive 
issues. 
63. 
Technical 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
in 
Chile 
been 
given 
new 
impetus 
by 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
in 
1964. 
During 
the 
42 
years 
of 
the 
CommissionÂs 
existence, 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
on 
the 
production 
of 
radioisotopes 
and 
radiopharmaceuticals, 
the 
application 
of 
tracers 
in 
medicine, 
mining, 
industry, 
the 
environment 
and 
agriculture, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
intense 
gamma-ray 
sources 
to 
preserve 
and 
sterilize 
food 
and 
pharmaceutical 
and 
medical 
products. 
That 
had 
all 
been 
made 
possible 
thanks 
to 
the 
valuable 
support 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Since 
the 
1980s, 
Chile 
had 
taken 
part 
in 
108 
national 
projects 
and 
81 
regional 
and 
interregional 
projects. 
64. 
In 
the 
coming 
years, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
assistance 
programme 
would 
be 
focusing 
on 
physical 
infrastructure 
and 
training 
of 
human 
resources. 
Recently, 
in 
line 
with 
the 
new 
technical 
cooperation 
strategies 
established 
by 
the 
Agency, 
Chile 
had 
attempted 
to 
solve 
problems 
with 
an 
economic 
and 
social 
impact 
in 
sectors 
related 
to 
the 
countryÂs 
development, 
such 
as 
health, 
agriculture, 
industry, 
mining, 
water 
resources 
and 
the 
environment. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
various 
free 
trade 
agreements 
the 
country 
had 
signed, 
ChileÂs 
projects 
relating 
to 
the 
export 
of 
agricultural 
products 
were 
aimed 
at 
meeting 
export 
market 
requirements 
in 
terms 
of 
quality, 
hygiene 
and 
food 
safety, 
in 
particular 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
use 
of 
chemicals. 
ChileÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
the 
2007-2008 
biennium 
focused 
on 
development 
areas 
of 
national 
priority 
based 
on 
the 
countryÂs 
CPF, 
which 
had 
been 
signed 
in 
September 
2005. 
Those 
areas 
included 
strengthening 
of 
the 
nuclear 
safety 
regulatory 
infrastructure, 
management 
of 
low-and 
intermediate-level 
radioactive 
waste, 
and 
nuclear 
applications 
to 
consolidate 
techniques 
for 
the 
detection 
and 
early 
warning 
of 
red 
tide. 
Aware 
as 
it 
was 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
technical 
cooperation, 
Chile 
was 
up 
to 
date 
with 
its 
commitments 
to 
the 
TCF. 
The 
ARCAL 
agreement, 
which 
had 
been 
ratified 
by 
Chile 
in 
November 
2005, 
played 
an 
important 
role 
in 
regional 
cooperation. 
65. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
December 
2005 
there 
had 
been 
a 
radiological 
accident 
in 
a 
national 
enterprise 
in 
the 
south 
of 
Chile 
and 
workers 
had 
been 
exposed 
to 
radiation 
from 
a 
source 
from 
a 
piece 
of 
industrial 
equipment. 
The 
relevant 
authorities 
had 
taken 
urgent 
measures 
to 
protect 
the 
workersÂ 
health 
and 
evaluate 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
accident. 
They 
had 
notified 
the 
Agency 
in 
good 
time 
and 
requested 
assistance, 
under 
the 
relevant 
conventions. 
The 
Agency 
had 
responded 
to 
the 
request 
immediately 
by 
sending 
a 
multidisciplinary 
expert 
mission 
comprising 
professionals 
from 
France, 
Argentina, 
Brazil

and 
Russia, 
which 
had 
arrived 
in 
Chile 
only 
four 
days 
after 
the 
accident 
and 
had 
carried 
out 
various 
tasks. 
Chile 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
outstanding 
professional 
staff 
for 
their 
swift 
response 
and 
appreciated 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
mission, 
which 
had 
visited 
the 
country 
twice. 
It 
was 
also 
grateful 
to 
the 
Governments 
of 
France, 
Argentina, 
Brazil 
and 
Mexico 
for 
the 
solidarity 
they 
had 
shown 
during 
those 
months, 
and 
to 
the 
doctors 
and 
medical 
team 
at 
the 
Percy 
military 
hospital 
in 
Paris, 
France, 
for 
successfully 
treating 
the 
worst 
affected 
patient. 
Chile 
had 
learnt 
many 
lessons 
from 
that 
regrettable 
incident, 
which 
it 
hoped 
would 
never 
be 
repeated. 
With 
that 
in 
mind, 
an 
Agency 
mission 
had 
evaluated 
the 
countryÂs 
management 
system 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
emergencies, 
and 
the 
Nuclear 
and 
Radiation 
Safety 
Department 
of 
the 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
been 
reorganized. 


66. 
In 
May 
2006, 
the 
conversion 
of 
the 
RECH-1 
research 
reactor, 
which 
was 
located 
in 
Santiago 
and 
belonged 
to 
Chilean 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Commission, 
to 
the 
use 
of 
LEU 
had 
been 
completed. 
That 
marked 
the 
end 
of 
a 
process 
that 
had 
begun 
20 
years 
previously 
and 
showed 
the 
countryÂs 
commitment 
to 
a 
peaceful 
nuclear 
policy 
and 
to 
non-proliferation. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Chile 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Norwegian 
Government 
which, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency, 
had 
organized 
a 
seminar 
and 
technical 
workshop 
on 
fuel 
conversion. 
67. 
Mr. 
ZNIBER 
(Morocco) 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
many 
achievements 
in 
carrying 
out 
its 
noble, 
yet 
delicate 
mission 
of 
strengthening 
peace 
and 
security 
in 
the 
world. 
The 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Price 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
a 
just 
recognition 
of 
their 
work. 
Notwithstanding 
the 
challenges 
in 
a 
difficult 
international 
context, 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
goal 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
while 
maintaining 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
three 
main 
pillars 
of 
its 
activities, 
and 
Member 
States 
should 
provide 
it 
with 
the 
financial, 
staffing, 
political 
and 
moral 
support 
it 
needed. 
68. 
The 
verification 
activities 
entrusted 
to 
the 
Agency 
by 
the 
international 
community 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
efforts 
to 
safeguard 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
with 
the 
safeguards 
system 
as 
its 
essential 
instrument. 
69. 
Morocco 
had 
supported 
all 
initiatives 
to 
combat 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
had 
encouraged 
all 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
disarmament 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
and 
had 
promoted 
the 
introduction 
of 
a 
credible 
Agency 
verification 
regime. 
It 
therefore 
welcomed 
the 
conclusion 
of 
new 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
that 
strengthened 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
it 
had 
organized 
a 
seminar 
on 
the 
additional 
protocol 
in 
December 
2005 
for 
African 
officials 
responsible 
for 
safeguards-related 
issues. 
The 
credibility 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
depended 
both 
on 
its 
capacity 
to 
detect 
illicit 
activities 
and 
on 
its 
universal, 
transparent 
and 
just 
implementation. 
Therefore, 
ways 
had 
to 
be 
found 
to 
encourage 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
70. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
no 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
resolution 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
its 
forty-ninth 
session 
on 
the 
application 
of 
IAEA 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
IsraelÂs 
persistent 
refusal 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
place 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
was 
a 
serious 
obstacle 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
to 
just 
and 
sustainable 
peace 
in 
the 
region. 
Israel 
should 
take 
urgent 
steps 
to 
rectify 
that 
situation. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
consider 
the 
concerns 
arising 
from 
the 
deployment 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
in 
a 
serious, 
fair 
and 
equitable 
manner. 
71. 
The 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
should 
also 
be 
taken 
seriously 
and 
all 
States 
should 
be 
given 
the 
assistance 
they 
needed 
to 
establish 
nuclear 
security 
infrastructures. 
He 
urged 
States 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
equipment 
and 
in 
combating 
illicit

trafficking, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
preventing 
malicious 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
programmes 
and 
tools 
the 
Agency 
had 
developed 
in 
that 
field, 
such 
as 
missions 
to 
assess 
national 
infrastructures 
and 
nuclear 
security 
needs, 
were 
commendable 
and 
should 
be 
developed 
further. 


72. 
Morocco 
welcomed 
the 
notifications 
of 
support 
by 
83 
countries 
for 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
voluntary 
information 
exchange 
mechanism 
on 
application 
of 
the 
Code. 
His 
country 
had 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
to 
notify 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
its 
acceptance 
of 
the 
Code 
and 
had 
hosted 
a 
seminar 
for 
French-speaking 
African 
countries 
on 
the 
protection 
and 
control 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
He 
called 
on 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009. 
73. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
low-and 
medium-power 
reactors. 
The 
first 
Moroccan 
Triga 
II-type 
research 
reactor 
would 
be 
inaugurated 
in 
late 
2006 
and 
he 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
assistance 
with 
that 
project. 
74. 
Safety 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
future 
and 
public 
acceptance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
his 
Government 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
improving 
domestic 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
in 
order 
to 
strengthen 
the 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Legislation 
drafted 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
currently 
being 
considered 
for 
adoption. 
75. 
The 
progress 
made 
in 
the 
past 
year 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
safe 
operation 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
research 
reactors, 
transport 
safety 
and 
occupational 
radiation 
protection 
was 
commendable. 
Guaranteeing 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
required 
continuous 
efforts 
and 
scrupulous 
respect 
for 
international 
standards. 
Training 
and 
information 
exchange 
were 
vital 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
area 
should 
continue. 
76. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Morocco 
would 
be 
hosting 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
on 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors 
in 
November 
2006. 
It 
was 
also 
pursuing 
its 
training 
activities 
for 
African 
experts 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
protection: 
a 
fourth 
postgraduate 
course 
was 
scheduled 
to 
commence 
in 
October 
2006 
in 
Rabat. 
The 
Agency 
should 
strengthen 
its 
technical 
and 
financial 
support 
for 
such 
postgraduate 
training 
and 
might 
wish 
to 
explore 
the 
possibility 
of 
concluding 
a 
long-term 
agreement 
to 
guarantee 
the 
continuation 
of 
such 
courses. 
77. 
Currently, 
nuclear 
power 
met 
only 
16% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
energy 
requirements. 
However, 
in 
view 
of 
the 
enormous 
energy 
demand, 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
material, 
and 
the 
increased 
economic 
competitiveness 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
considerable 
growth 
was 
expected 
in 
that 
sector, 
especially 
in 
developing 
countries 
to 
meet 
their 
rising 
demand 
for 
energy 
and 
drinking 
water. 
The 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
context 
was 
twofold: 
it 
should 
step 
up 
its 
efforts 
to 
publicize 
the 
advantages 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
compared 
to 
other 
energy 
sources 
and 
to 
dispel 
misconceptions 
about 
the 
dangers 
of 
nuclear 
power, 
and 
it 
should 
strive 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
went 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
effective 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
non-proliferation 
measures. 
78. 
Technological 
innovation, 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
the 
cost 
and 
construction 
time 
of 
small 
and 
medium-size 
nuclear 
facilities, 
and 
safety 
assurances 
would 
have 
a 
major 
impact 
on 
the 
attractiveness 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
developing 
countries. 
Morocco 
was 
following 
with 
interest 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
development 
of 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
that 
allowed 
the 
safe, 
peaceful 
and 
environmentally 
friendly 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
including 
activities 
carried 
out 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
INPRO 
project 
and 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum. 
79. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
progress 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
non-energy 
applications 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
the 
environment 
and 
water 
resources. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
the 
challenges 
facing 
humanity 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nutrition, 
health, 
water 
and 
energy, 
nuclear 
technologies 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play.

He 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
SIT 
activities 
which 
had 
yielded 
positive 
results 
in 
terms 
of 
health 
and 
nutrition 
in 
several 
developing 
countries, 
and 
had 
had 
considerable 
economic 
impact. 
The 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
study 
the 
possibility 
of 
using 
nuclear 
technologies 
to 
combat 
locusts. 
81. 
The 
African 
continent 
had 
a 
great 
need 
for 
human 
resources 
and 
equipment. 
Efforts 
to 
strengthen 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
reduce 
proliferation 
risks 
should 
not 
be 
allowed 
to 
become 
obstacles 
to 
the 
transfer 
of 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
right 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
recognized 
in 
the 
NPT. 
82. 
Morocco 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
which 
enabled 
developing 
countries 
to 
benefit 
from 
atomic 
energy 
in 
a 
number 
of 
areas 
that 
were 
crucial 
to 
their 
socio-economic 
development. 
He 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
planning 
and 
implementation 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
to 
promote 
cooperation 
with 
all 
Member 
States. 
It 
was 
essential 
that 
Member 
States 
provide 
adequate 
financial 
resources 
to 
enable 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
meet 
the 
ever 
growing 
needs 
of 
developing 
countries. 
All 
Member 
States 
should 
honour 
their 
financial 
commitments 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
should 
contribute 
generously 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
financing 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
was 
sufficient, 
predictable 
and 
assured. 
83. 
Although 
adopted 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
1998, 
the 
amendment 
of 
Article 
VI 
of 
the 
Statute 
had 
still 
not 
entered 
into 
force. 
So 
far, 
only 
46 
countries, 
among 
them 
Morocco, 
had 
deposited 
their 
instrument 
of 
acceptance. 
The 
slow 
progress 
in 
that 
regard 
undermined 
the 
democratic 
principles 
underlying 
international 
organizations. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
accept 
the 
amendment. 
84. 
Ms. 
GASSAMA 
DIA 
(Senegal) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
2005 
which 
was 
a 
just 
recognition 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities. 
85. 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
Senegal 
focused 
primarily 
on 
training, 
technology 
transfer, 
exchange 
of 
experts 
and 
scientific 
meetings 
in 
various 
fields, 
including 
water 
resources 
management, 
improvement 
of 
agricultural 
production, 
development 
of 
livestock 
production 
through 
the 
programme 
to 
combat 
the 
tsetse 
fly, 
cancer 
treatment 
and 
prevention, 
and 
research 
relating 
to 
malnutrition. 
Senegal 
was 
determined 
to 
develop 
education, 
health, 
agriculture, 
trade 
and 
energy 
using 
science 
and 
technology. 
The 
promotion 
of 
a 
strong 
national 
industrial 
sector 
and 
the 
provision 
of 
services 
in 
all 
economic 
sectors 
would 
help 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
sustainable 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
in 
Senegal. 
Apart 
from 
a 
StateÂs 
responsibility 
to 
implement 
national 
development 
policies, 
nowadays 
it 
was 
accepted 
that 
civil 
society 
and 
the 
private 
sector 
also 
had 
an 
important 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
development 
process. 
A 
new 
type 
of 
partnership 
was 
needed 
between 
all 
parties 
concerned. 
Such 
partnership 
could 
be 
seen 
in 
the 
NEPAD 
initiative. 
86. 
Her 
country 
was 
known 
for 
its 
support 
for 
the 
universal 
values 
of 
work 
culture, 
the 
spirit 
of 
dialogue 
and 
initiative, 
as 
well 
as 
solidarity, 
peace 
and 
justice. 
The 
Agency, 
which 
worked 
for 
peace 
by 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
was 
an 
obvious 
strategic 
partner 
for 
a 
country 
like 
Senegal. 
Thus, 
it 
had 
joined 
the 
Agency 
after 
gaining 
its 
independence 
in 
1960. 
Since 
that 
time, 
it 
kept 
up 
to 
date 
with 
its 
contributions 
and 
had 
ratified 
various 
instruments, 
the 
most 
recent 
one 
being 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty. 
87. 
Nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
the 
related 
risk 
of 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
substances 
was 
a 
real 
threat 
to 
security 
and 
health 
and 
to 
peace 
throughout 
the 
world. 
Following 
the 
example 
of 
other 
African 
countries 
and 
the 
international 
community, 
Senegal 
had 
recognized 
the 
need 
to 
put 
in 
place 
a 
global 
coordinated 
strategy 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
She 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
area, 
as 
well 
as 
its 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
field 
of 
physical 
protection, 
regulatory 
control 
and 
the 
detection 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
integration 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
systems.

88. 
The 
oil 
crisis 
had 
plunged 
the 
world, 
and 
countries 
in 
the 
South 
in 
particular, 
into 
an 
unprecedented 
energy 
crisis. 
There 
were 
many 
solutions 
to 
that 
problem. 
The 
Government 
of 
Senegal 
was 
not 
as 
yet 
considering 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
electricity 
generation, 
as 
no 
resolution 
of 
the 
problem 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
was 
on 
the 
horizon 
for 
African 
countries. 
Senegal 
was 
currently 
looking 
at 
bioenergy 
as 
an 
alternative. 
The 
economic, 
environmental 
and 
political 
issues 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
into 
consideration. 
African 
researchers 
needed 
the 
support 
of 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
study 
biofuel 
options 
in 
greater 
depth. 
89. 
Her 
country 
was 
concerned 
over 
the 
lack 
of 
resources 
and 
equipment 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
problem 
of 
dumping 
of 
toxic 
waste. 
As 
a 
matter 
of 
urgency, 
effective 
detection 
and 
protection 
measures 
need 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place 
in 
Africa, 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
to 
protect 
vulnerable 
populations 
from 
large-scale 
pollution 
caused 
by 
irresponsible 
and 
criminal 
acts. 
90. 
The 
Agency 
should 
maintain 
and 
strengthen 
its 
support 
to 
African 
States 
in 
priority 
areas 
such 
as 
health, 
water 
resources 
management, 
agriculture, 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
Nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
were 
already 
being 
used 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development. 
However, 
scientific 
and 
technical 
capacity 
needed 
to 
be 
strengthened 
and 
the 
problems 
of 
waste 
management 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
solved. 
91. 
In 
conclusion, 
she 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
and 
their 
impact 
on 
the 
NEPAD 
initiative 
would 
help 
shorten 
the 
long 
road 
towards 
social 
and 
economic 
development 
in 
Africa. 
92. 
Mr. 
SCHALLER 
(Switzerland), 
also 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
Liechtenstein, 
said 
that, 
since 
the 
preceding 
General 
Conference, 
important 
developments 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
cooperation 
had 
dominated 
the 
international 
agenda, 
especially 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
diplomatic 
efforts 
which 
had 
been 
made. 
In 
its 
response 
of 
22 
August 
to 
the 
proposals 
made, 
Iran 
had 
signalled 
its 
willingness 
to 
engage 
in 
discussions 
on 
all 
aspects 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue 
should 
be 
resolved 
through 
diplomacy 
and 
he 
called 
on 
all 
parties 
to 
return 
to 
the 
negotiating 
table 
to 
prevent 
the 
situation 
from 
escalating, 
which 
would 
have 
repercussions 
on 
all 
States. 
93. 
While 
hopes 
had 
been 
high 
in 
2005 
that 
negotiations 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
nuclear 
issue 
might 
resume, 
various 
rumours 
about 
possible 
nuclear 
testing 
by 
the 
DPRK 
had 
given 
rise 
to 
new 
concerns. 
His 
country 
called 
on 
all 
parties 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
to 
show 
a 
spirit 
of 
consensus 
to 
facilitate 
the 
resumption 
of 
negotiations 
and 
it 
urged 
the 
Government 
of 
the 
DPRK 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT. 
94. 
The 
United 
StatesÂIndia 
civilian 
nuclear 
cooperation 
initiative 
continued 
to 
pose 
fundamental 
questions 
about 
the 
future 
of 
the 
NPT-based 
non-proliferation 
system. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
involvement 
was 
considerable, 
in 
terms 
of 
defining 
the 
safeguards 
measures 
to 
be 
applied. 
The 
project, 
which 
liberalized 
nuclear 
cooperation 
with 
India, 
stood 
in 
stark 
contrast 
with 
a 
number 
of 
recent 
proposals 
to 
impose 
even 
greater 
restrictions 
on 
access 
to 
so-called 
sensitive 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
technologies. 
The 
right 
to 
cooperation 
and 
access 
to 
sensitive 
technologies 
should 
remain 
subject 
to 
accession 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
strict 
implementation 
of 
its 
provisions. 
95. 
His 
country 
was 
satisfied 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
accounts 
for 
2005 
and 
the 
proposed 
budget 
for 
2007. 
Every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
expenses 
were 
covered 
by 
the 
Regular 
Budget; 
recourse 
to 
extrabudgetary 
funds 
should 
be 
limited 
and 
regulated. 
Excessive 
use 
of 
extrabudgetary 
resources 
could 
undermine 
StatesÂ 
willingness 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
management 
of 
the 
Agency.

96. 
For 
internal 
reasons, 
Switzerland 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
pay 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
the 
preceding 
two 
years. 
Measures 
had 
been 
taken 
to 
address 
the 
situation 
and 
an 
additional 
payment 
would 
be 
made 
shortly 
for 
2006. 
97. 
His 
country 
was 
impressed 
by 
the 
continued 
improvement 
in 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
activities 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
especially 
the 
development 
of 
regional 
and 
interregional 
partnerships 
and 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
the 
system 
of 
NPCs. 
98. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
all 
States 
subject 
to 
safeguards 
took 
a 
positive 
view 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
area. 
While 
recognizing 
the 
need 
for 
a 
high-quality, 
effective 
safeguards 
system, 
his 
country 
was 
convinced 
that, 
above 
all 
in 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
field, 
every 
State 
had 
to 
respect 
the 
rights 
and 
concerns 
of 
others 
and 
fulfil 
its 
obligations. 
Those 
two 
aspects 
were 
complementary 
and 
crucial 
to 
fostering 
confidence 
and 
cooperation 
in 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
annual 
report 
on 
safeguards 
but 
expressed 
concern 
over 
the 
progressive 
increase 
in 
costs. 
One 
year 
after 
SwitzerlandÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
its 
investments 
in 
terms 
of 
time 
and 
human 
resources 
had 
increased 
considerably. 
For 
example, 
the 
breakdown 
of 
a 
remote 
surveillance 
system 
had 
prompted 
an 
additional 
visit 
by 
inspectors. 
Thus, 
the 
introduction 
of 
more 
efficient 
and 
modern 
equipment 
had 
led 
to 
additional 
controls 
and 
increased 
workload 
for 
the 
Agency, 
operators 
and 
the 
SSAC. 
While 
there 
was 
a 
clear 
need 
for 
effective 
surveillance 
by 
the 
Agency, 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
avoid 
costly 
measures 
of 
doubtful 
effectiveness 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
tasks 
were 
not 
simply 
transferred 
to 
national 
authorities 
or 
operators. 
His 
country 
hoped 
that 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
would 
bring 
improvements 
in 
that 
area. 
99. 
Liechtenstein 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
on 
14 
July 
2006 
and 
intended 
to 
implement 
it 
swiftly. 
However, 
a 
number 
of 
issues 
related 
to 
the 
customs 
union 
between 
Switzerland 
and 
Liechtenstein 
were 
currently 
being 
discussed 
and 
would 
need 
to 
be 
resolved 
prior 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
protocol. 
A 
workable 
solution 
should 
be 
found 
shortly. 
100. 
Switzerland 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
activities 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
In 
recent 
months, 
Swiss 
experts 
had 
participated 
actively 
in 
IPPAS 
missions 
and 
the 
country 
had 
benefited 
itself 
from 
one 
such 
mission, 
which 
had 
confirmed 
that 
efforts 
made 
in 
recent 
years 
had 
borne 
fruit. 
Further 
improvements 
had 
been 
proposed 
and 
would 
be 
introduced 
gradually. 
101. 
The 
Swiss 
Government 
had 
announced 
that 
the 
technical 
feasibility 
of 
storage 
of 
radioactive 
material 
had 
been 
confirmed, 
which 
meant 
that 
geological 
disposal 
in 
Switzerland 
was 
possible. 
Thus, 
the 
problem 
of 
nuclear 
waste 
management 
from 
production 
to 
storage 
was 
solved. 
However, 
the 
construction 
of 
an 
underground 
disposal 
facility 
could 
not 
commence 
as 
yet. 
The 
choice 
of 
a 
site 
remained 
open 
and 
would 
necessitate 
extensive 
consultation 
with 
the 
public. 
International 
cooperation 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
a 
multinational 
project 
for 
storage 
of 
high-level 
waste 
also 
remained 
an 
option. 
102. 
Mr. 
JOHANSEN 
(Norway) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
50th 
anniversary 
and 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
which 
was 
to 
be 
used 
to 
develop 
human 
resources 
in 
the 
vital 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
nutrition. 
Norway 
had 
contributed 
4 
million 
Norwegian 
kroner 
to 
the 
IAEA 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund. 
103. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
dealing 
with 
challenges 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
He 
called 
upon 
Iran 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
requirements 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006), 
including 
the 
suspension 
of 
its 
enrichment 
programmes, 
and 
to 
accelerate 
its 
cooperation 
with 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
reaching 
a 
diplomatic 
solution. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
likewise 
allow 
the 
Agency 
to 
monitor 
the 
dismantling 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme.

104. 
The 
new 
NPT 
review 
cycle 
offered 
a 
fresh 
opportunity 
to 
consolidate 
and 
strengthen 
the 
Treaty. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
security 
and 
disarmament 
system. 
A 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
plus 
an 
additional 
protocol 
constituted 
the 
new 
standard 
for 
verification 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
work 
for 
universal 
adherence 
to 
that 
standard. 
105. 
Integrated 
safeguards 
provided 
the 
optimum 
combination 
of 
safeguards 
measures 
and 
gave 
the 
Agency 
more 
flexibility 
in 
deciding 
where 
to 
focus 
its 
efforts 
and 
limited 
resources. 
Norway 
had 
accepted 
integrated 
safeguards 
and 
was 
willing 
to 
share 
its 
experiences 
in 
that 
area 
with 
other 
countries. 
106. 
His 
country 
likewise 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute, 
although 
the 
Committee 
had 
made 
little 
progress 
as 
yet. 
He 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
redouble 
their 
efforts 
to 
agree 
on 
a 
programme 
of 
work. 
107. 
Nuclear-weapon-free 
zones 
were 
important 
for 
both 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament. 
Norway 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
in 
his 
laudable 
efforts 
to 
promote 
safeguards 
and 
eliminate 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
encouraging 
States 
to 
begin 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
108. 
Nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
were 
vital 
elements 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
conventions 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct 
in 
that 
field 
set 
an 
international 
standard 
which 
all 
Member 
States 
should 
strive 
to 
reach. 
The 
international 
nuclear 
security 
regime 
had 
improved 
greatly 
in 
recent 
years, 
thanks 
to 
various 
Security 
Council 
resolutions, 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
of 
2005 
and 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
CPPNM. 
Norway 
was 
currently 
reviewing 
its 
own 
regulatory 
framework 
as 
part 
of 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
amended 
CPPNM. 
109. 
Norway 
had 
received 
valuable 
support 
from 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
preparation 
of 
the 
International 
Symposium 
on 
the 
Minimization 
of 
Highly 
Enriched 
Uranium 
in 
the 
Civilian 
Sector 
held 
in 
Oslo 
in 
June. 
The 
Agency 
was 
well 
positioned 
to 
assist 
States 
with 
HEU 
minimization, 
where 
that 
was 
technically 
and 
economically 
feasible. 
At 
the 
end 
of 
the 
symposium, 
the 
Chair 
had 
concluded 
that 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
research 
reactors 
could 
be 
converted 
to 
LEU 
without 
significant 
loss 
of 
performance. 
More 
effort 
should 
be 
put 
into 
developing 
alternative 
high-density 
LEU 
fuels. 
110. 
Peer 
review 
mechanisms 
were 
very 
useful 
to 
strengthen 
implementation 
of 
international 
legal 
instruments 
and 
codes 
at 
national 
level. 
Norway 
welcomed 
the 
positive 
outcome 
of 
the 
open-ended 
meeting 
on 
the 
application 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
first 
periodic 
meeting 
to 
discuss 
the 
application 
of 
the 
Code, 
which 
would 
help 
make 
the 
review 
mechanisms 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
more 
effective. 
111. 
No 
country 
was 
immune 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
nuclear 
or 
radiological 
emergencies. 
For 
some 
years, 
Norway 
had 
been 
calling 
for 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
international 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
system 
and 
it 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
rapid 
implementation 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
plan 
on 
that 
subject. 
The 
newly 
established 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre 
should 
make 
a 
valuable 
contribution 
in 
that 
regard. 
However, 
sustained, 
predictable 
and 
adequate 
funding 
would 
be 
required 
and 
that 
need 
should 
be 
duly 
taken 
into 
account 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
regular 
programme 
and 
budget 
process. 
112. 
Norway 
appreciated 
the 
efforts 
that 
were 
being 
made 
to 
implement 
the 
action 
plan 
for 
the 
safety 
of 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
and 
the 
work 
of 
INLEX. 
His 
country 
encouraged 
a 
continued 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States. 
113. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
did 
not 
have 
a 
negative 
impact 
on 
the 
environment. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
establish 
an 
international 
framework 
to 
protect 
the 
environment 
from 
the 
effects 
of 
ionizing 
radiation.

proposed 
Agency

Safety 
Principles 
also 
highlighted 
the 
environmental 
dimension. 
Indicators 
should 
be 
developed 
to 
monitor 
possible 
environmental 
damage. 


114. 
The 
Agency 
was 
an 
important 
contributor 
to 
development 
work 
in 
public 
health, 
agriculture, 
water 
management 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
It 
had 
a 
global 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
achievement 
of 
the 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
Norway 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
PACT 
programme 
and 
its 
support 
for 
Member 
States 
in 
their 
use 
of 
radiation 
for 
medical 
purposes. 
115. 
In 
view 
of 
its 
increasingly 
important 
global 
role, 
it 
was 
essential 
the 
Agency 
continue 
to 
be 
well 
managed, 
that 
it 
be 
given 
the 
resources 
and 
flexibility 
it 
needed 
to 
respond 
efficiently 
to 
new 
challenges, 
and 
that 
those 
financial 
resources 
were 
managed 
and 
spent 
efficiently. 
Its 
efforts 
to 
recruit 
well 
qualified 
female 
professionals 
through 
points 
of 
contact 
at 
Member 
StatesÂ 
missions 
were 
constructive, 
but 
more 
needed 
to 
be 
done 
in 
that 
area. 
116. 
Mr. 
AL-JASEM 
(Kuwait) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
which 
had 
demonstrated 
its 
effectiveness 
in 
meeting 
needs 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
agriculture, 
livestock 
production, 
water 
purification 
and 
human 
health, 
and 
in 
enhancing 
scientific 
and 
technological 
expertise 
in 
Member 
States. 
He 
therefore 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
and 
intensify 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
ensure 
continuous 
and 
reliable 
funding 
for 
the 
TCF 
in 
order 
to 
guarantee 
the 
successful 
implementation 
of 
current 
and 
future 
projects 
and 
avoid 
shortfalls 
due 
to 
the 
failure 
of 
some 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
contributions. 
Although 
the 
contributions 
were 
voluntary, 
States 
should 
honour 
their 
political 
obligations 
to 
pay 
them 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
The 
Kuwaiti 
Government 
had 
a 
consistently 
good 
record 
in 
that 
regard. 
117. 
Kuwait 
was 
eager 
to 
strengthen 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
developing 
the 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
sector 
and 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
support 
of 
social 
and 
economic 
development, 
especially 
in 
the 
field 
of 
water 
resources, 
nutrition, 
combating 
disease 
and 
treatment 
of 
health 
problems. 
118. 
He 
commended 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
develop 
strict 
rules 
and 
regulations 
to 
control 
and 
monitor 
movements 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
material. 
Kuwait 
was 
prepared 
to 
collaborate 
in 
all 
activities 
aimed 
at 
enhancing 
the 
safety 
of 
such 
sources 
and 
material 
and 
their 
use, 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
national 
or 
regional 
projects 
with 
the 
Agency 
or 
other 
relevant 
organizations. 
The 
Agency 
should 
work 
with 
Member 
States 
that 
were 
building 
nuclear 
installations 
on 
their 
territory 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
they 
took 
the 
necessary 
precautions, 
and 
should 
continuously 
verify 
that 
their 
authorities 
were 
following 
sound 
procedures 
in 
their 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
accidents. 
119. 
The 
international 
community 
should 
redouble 
its 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
All 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
every 
country 
without 
exception 
should 
be 
placed 
under 
Agency 
safeguards 
as 
a 
matter 
of 
urgency. 
Kuwait 
was 
concerned 
about 
evidence 
of 
cases 
of 
smuggling 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
plan 
of 
activities 
to 
protect 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
could 
be 
implemented 
successfully, 
bringing 
to 
light 
trafficking 
activities 
by 
clandestine 
nuclear 
networks, 
preventing 
theft 
and 
protecting 
nuclear 
installations. 
His 
country 
had 
approved 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
had 
signed 
to 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
It 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
the 
security 
measures 
that 
some 
countries 
were 
taking 
to 
protect 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
provided 
that 
such 
measures 
were 
not 
adopted 
in 
isolation 
but 
as 
part 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
120. 
The 
safeguards 
system 
was 
supported 
by 
most 
countries 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
His 
Government 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the

application 
of 
the 
NPT, 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
It 
urged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
or 
an 
additional 
protocol 
to 
do 
so 
and 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
through 
constructive 
and 
transparent 
dialogue 
in 
order 
to 
dispel 
any 
doubts 
that 
might 
arise 
regarding 
their 
nuclear 
programmes. 


121. 
Kuwait 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
regime 
to 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Unfortunately, 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
States 
in 
the 
region 
were 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards, 
one 
State 
Â 
Israel 
Â 
remained 
outside 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
thereby 
undermining 
regional 
and 
international 
security 
and 
stability. 
Was 
it 
reasonable 
for 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
to 
honour 
their 
obligations 
except 
Israel, 
which 
was 
permitted 
to 
remain 
outside 
the 
legal 
framework 
for 
nuclear 
disarmament? 
122. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
redouble 
its 
efforts 
to 
universalize 
the 
safeguards 
system 
so 
that 
it 
covered 
all 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
activities 
in 
Israel 
and 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
establishing 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
There 
could 
be 
no 
security 
or 
stability 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
while 
Israel 
refused 
to 
place 
its 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
It 
was 
an 
unnatural 
situation 
that 
might 
well 
encourage 
other 
States 
to 
try 
to 
obtain 
or 
manufacture 
nuclear 
weapons 
on 
the 
pretext 
that 
the 
world 
was 
turning 
a 
blind 
eye 
to 
IsraelÂs 
conduct. 
The 
current 
situation 
also 
prevented 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
as 
a 
first 
step 
towards 
ridding 
the 
Middle 
East 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
The 
Government 
of 
Kuwait, 
motivated 
by 
its 
fear 
of 
IsraelÂs 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities, 
called 
on 
the 
entire 
international 
community, 
especially 
countries 
with 
special 
responsibility 
for 
the 
maintenance 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
to 
do 
their 
utmost 
to 
achieve 
the 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
dispel 
the 
fears 
of 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
region. 
123. 
Mr. 
SYCHOV 
(Belarus) 
said 
that 
the 
years 
that 
had 
passed 
since 
the 
founding 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
confirmed 
its 
leading 
role 
in 
ensuring 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
in 
effectively 
monitoring 
compliance 
by 
Member 
States 
with 
their 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
obligations. 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
made 
great 
achievements. 
A 
global 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
regime 
had 
been 
put 
in 
place. 
A 
plan 
of 
action 
for 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism 
was 
being 
successfully 
implemented 
as 
well 
as 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
radiation 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
material. 
Efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
universalize 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Work 
was 
being 
conducted 
on 
nuclear 
knowledge 
preservation 
and 
expert 
training. 
Under 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
Member 
States 
were 
being 
given 
assistance 
with 
solving 
problems 
in 
various 
areas 
through 
the 
application 
of 
advanced 
nuclear 
technology. 
In 
addition, 
the 
organizationÂs 
work 
had 
been 
justly 
recognized 
through 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
which 
should 
lend 
new 
impetus 
to 
its 
statutory 
activities. 
124. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
an 
important 
tool 
for 
fostering 
sustainable 
development. 
Through 
effective 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
Belarus 
had 
established 
and 
strengthened 
its 
radiation 
protection 
and 
health 
and 
safety 
standards 
infrastructure. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
able 
to 
train 
specialists 
from 
other 
countries. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
strengthening 
of 
partnerships 
among 
Agency 
Member 
States. 
125. 
Dealing 
with 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
Chernobyl 
accident 
had 
been 
a 
priority 
area 
of 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
Belarus. 
Technology 
had 
been 
transferred 
allowing 
the 
production 
of 
clean 
produce 
in 
contaminated 
areas 
and 
the 
rehabilitation 
of 
agricultural 
land. 
The 
projects 
implemented 
had, 
inter 
alia, 
set 
up 
production 
lines 
for 
rape 
oil 
and 
flour 
and 
had 
introduced 
effective 
measures 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
strict 
national 
standards 
for 
the 
radionuclide 
content 
of 
foodstuffs 
and 
timber 
products. 
The 
significance 
of 
such 
projects 
for 
the 
contaminated 
areas 
was 
hard 
to 
overestimate. 
126. 
The 
most 
important 
conclusion 
reached 
at 
the 
2005 
concluding 
conference 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Chernobyl 
Forum, 
which 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
proposed 
setting 
up 
during 
his 
visit 
to

Belarus 
in 
2001, 
had 
been 
that 
the 
main 
task 
at 
the 
present 
stage 
was 
to 
overcome 
the 
socio-economic 
consequences 
of 
the 
accident 
while 
continuing 
research 
into 
the 
long-term 
medical 
and 
environmental 
consequences. 
Resolution 
A/RES/60/14 
adopted 
at 
the 
60th 
session 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
had 
praised 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contribution 
to 
international 
cooperation 
on 
Chernobyl 
and 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
provided 
to 
Belarus, 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
and 
Ukraine. 
The 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
promote 
the 
expansion 
of 
international 
cooperation 
on 
Chernobyl 
and 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
recommendations 
made 
at 
the 
international 
conference 
held 
in 
Minsk 
in 
April 
2006 
to 
mark 
the 
twentieth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
accident. 


127. 
Nuclear 
power 
currently 
produced 
16% 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
electricity. 
Ecologically 
safe 
and 
economically 
competitive 
technologies 
would 
be 
needed 
to 
meet 
future 
demand. 
The 
work 
on 
a 
new 
generation 
of 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
could 
provide 
a 
solution. 
In 
that 
connection, 
Belarus 
had 
high 
hopes 
of 
the 
INPRO 
project 
and 
wished 
to 
contribute 
to 
it. 
128. 
As 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
strengthening 
and 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
Belarus 
met 
its 
safeguards 
commitments 
under 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
in 
November 
2005. 
However, 
the 
mechanisms 
of 
the 
NPT 
should 
never 
be 
used 
as 
a 
pretext 
for 
opposing 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes. 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
had 
an 
inalienable 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
as 
well 
as 
an 
obligation 
to 
act 
with 
maximum 
transparency 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
spirit 
and 
the 
letter 
of 
the 
Treaty. 
Moreover, 
non-proliferation 
efforts 
should 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
confidence-building 
measures 
between 
nuclear-weapon 
and 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States. 
129. 
Belarus 
would 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
supported 
its 
highly 
professional 
work 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards. 
However, 
it 
was 
concerned 
at 
the 
trend 
to 
transform 
the 
Agency 
into 
just 
a 
safeguards 
authority. 
The 
IAEA 
had 
acquired 
its 
status 
as 
a 
leading 
international 
organization 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field 
through 
the 
exercise 
of 
all 
its 
statutory 
functions. 
130. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
preserve 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
train 
experts. 
Radiation 
safety 
training 
was 
of 
particular 
interest 
to 
Belarus 
which 
had 
hosted 
several 
events 
on 
that 
subject 
under 
the 
auspices 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
International 
Sakharov 
Environmental 
University 
had 
trained 
many 
experts 
from 
CIS 
States 
and 
Eastern 
Europe 
in 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radiation 
sources. 
He 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
Sakharov 
University 
to 
lay 
the 
foundations 
for 
sustainable 
cooperation 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
in 
that 
area. 
131. 
Finally, 
as 
in 
previous 
years, 
Belarus 
was 
prepared 
to 
pay 
its 
TCF 
target 
share 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
It 
called 
upon 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
take 
the 
necessary 
measures 
to 
ensure 
that 
financing 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
sufficient. 
Mr. 
Bazoberry 
Otero 
(Bolivia), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


132. 
Mr. 
BAHRAN 
(Yemen) 
said 
that, 
since 
its 
establishment, 
the 
Agency 
had 
made 
many 
tangible 
contributions 
to 
the 
daily 
lives 
of 
people 
throughout 
the 
world, 
especially 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
energy. 
He 
congratulated 
it 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
133. 
After 
more 
than 
three 
decades 
of 
stagnation, 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
industry 
was 
experiencing 
a 
global 
expansion 
driven 
by 
three 
sensitive 
international 
issues. 
The 
first 
was 
energy 
security, 
i.e. 
the 
availability 
of 
sufficient 
cheap 
energy 
sources 
to 
support 
current 
economic 
and 
social 
activities 
and 
guarantee 
a 
decent 
life 
for 
future 
generations. 
The 
second 
was 
environmental 
deterioration 
and 
climate 
change. 
Experts 
and 
decision-makers 
agreed 
that 
the 
planetÂs 
survival 
was 
at 
stake 
unless 
immediate 
action 
was 
taken 
to 
halt 
and 
reverse 
current 
trends. 
There 
was 
a 
direct 
link 
between 
the 
deteriorating

environmental 
situation 
and 
the 
immoderate 
use 
of 
fossil 
fuels. 
The 
third 
issue, 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
was 
the 
subject 
of 
major 
political 
and 
legal 
wrangling 
in 
the 
light 
of 
the 
challenges 
facing 
not 
only 
the 
NPT 
but 
the 
international 
non-proliferation 
regime 
as 
a 
whole. 


134. 
The 
NPT 
had 
many 
achievements 
to 
its 
credit 
since 
its 
adoption 
and 
would 
hopefully 
continue 
to 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
and 
development, 
prosperity 
and 
justice 
on 
the 
other. 
His 
country 
therefore 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
freeing 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
general 
and 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
particular. 
That 
would 
not 
happen, 
however, 
until 
Israel 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT, 
abandoned 
its 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
signed 
a 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Israel 
was 
the 
only 
country 
in 
the 
region 
that 
remained 
outside 
the 
vitally 
important 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Any 
strengthening 
of 
that 
system 
had 
to 
focus 
on 
the 
principles 
of 
equality 
and 
justice 
under 
international 
law. 
All 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT, 
especially 
nuclear-weapon 
States, 
should 
be 
asked 
to 
refrain 
from 
transferring 
material 
and 
technological 
data 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
activities 
to 
Israel 
until 
such 
time 
as 
it 
acceded 
to 
the 
Treaty. 
135. 
He 
had 
pleasure 
in 
informing 
the 
Conference 
that 
the 
people 
of 
Yemen 
would 
be 
voting 
the 
following 
day 
in 
presidential 
and 
local 
elections. 
Five 
representatives 
of 
the 
ruling 
and 
opposition 
parties, 
and 
independents, 
were 
running 
for 
the 
office 
of 
President 
and 
thousands 
of 
candidates, 
both 
men 
and 
women, 
were 
running 
for 
seats 
in 
local 
councils. 
Observers 
had 
described 
the 
election 
campaign 
as 
unprecedented 
in 
terms 
of 
political 
pluralism 
and 
freedom 
of 
expression. 
136. 
Yemen 
was 
attempting 
to 
address 
fundamental 
economic 
and 
social 
development 
challenges 
such 
as 
poverty, 
ignorance 
and 
disease. 
Peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
meeting 
those 
challenges 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
energy 
production 
and 
water 
desalination, 
especially 
in 
a 
country 
without 
sufficient 
cheap 
energy 
sources. 
Nuclear 
energy 
was 
an 
environmentally 
friendly 
and 
economically 
competitive 
option. 
137. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
were 
of 
vital 
importance 
to 
many 
countries 
and 
Yemen 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
provided 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
public 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resources. 
Under 
the 
PACT 
programme, 
Yemen 
had 
developed 
and 
was 
implementing 
a 
national 
programme 
covering 
carcinogen 
control, 
public 
education, 
early 
diagnosis 
and 
therapy. 
138. 
Yemen 
supported 
the 
projects 
currently 
being 
implemented 
by 
the 
ARASIA 
group 
of 
countries, 
and 
those 
planned 
for 
the 
future, 
and 
it 
requested 
the 
Agency 
to 
look 
into 
the 
possibility 
of 
strengthening 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Arab 
Atomic 
Energy 
Agency. 
139. 
Ms. 
ÂIAKOVÃ 
(Slovakia) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
achievements 
over 
the 
preceding 
50 
years 
which 
had 
been 
recognised 
by 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
140. 
The 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
not 
provided 
the 
necessary 
guidance 
on 
meeting 
the 
important 
challenges 
to 
that 
regime. 
That 
outcome 
had 
shown 
a 
lack 
of 
political 
will 
and 
had 
confirmed 
the 
continuing 
crisis 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
arms 
control, 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
The 
2005 
United 
Nations 
Summit 
had 
resulted 
in 
a 
similar 
failure. 
Cooperation 
was 
needed 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
crisis 
of 
compliance 
and 
confidence 
faced 
by 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
allow 
it 
to 
fulfil 
its 
purpose. 
141. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
was 
an 
essential 
verification 
tool 
which 
could 
enhance 
confidence 
among 
States 
and 
play 
a 
key 
role 
in 
preventing 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
with 
additional 
protocols 
should 
constitute 
the 
Agency 
verification 
standard, 
which 
should 
foster 
the 
confidence 
necessary 
for 
enhanced 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Unfortunately, 
universal 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols 
was 
still 
far 
from 
a 
reality. 
Her 
country 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
sign, 
ratify 
and 
implement 
an 
additional 
protocol 
as

soon 
as 
possible 
and 
appealed 
to 
those 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
bring 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
into 
force 
without 
further 
delay. 
In 
that 
connection, 
she 
was 
pleased 
to 
announce 
that 
the 
new 
safeguards 
agreement 
between 
EU 
member 
States, 
the 
Agency 
and 
Slovakia, 
and 
the 
protocol 
additional 
thereto, 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
on 
1 
December 
2005. 
Slovakia 
looked 
forward 
to 
fruitful 
cooperation 
with 
Euratom 
and 
the 
Agency. 


142. 
More 
than 
half 
of 
SlovakiaÂs 
electricity 
came 
from 
nuclear 
power 
which 
would 
remain 
an 
important 
source 
of 
energy 
in 
the 
medium 
term 
under 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
strategy. 
The 
shutdown 
of 
two 
units 
at 
the 
Bohunice 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
2006 
and 
2008 
could 
affect 
security 
of 
supply, 
particularly 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
world 
was 
facing 
rising 
energy 
prices 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
fossil 
fuel. 
Her 
Government 
and 
the 
energy 
sector 
were 
trying 
to 
find 
an 
economically 
acceptable, 
reliable 
and 
environmentally 
sound 
source 
of 
electricity. 
Security 
of 
fuel 
supply, 
in 
particular 
nuclear 
fuel, 
was 
crucial 
to 
maintain 
the 
countryÂs 
economic 
growth 
and 
Slovakia 
was 
ready 
to 
discuss 
that 
issue 
with 
the 
international 
community, 
in 
particular 
as 
it 
related 
to 
a 
market-oriented 
economy, 
security 
and 
non-proliferation. 
143. 
Safety 
was 
a 
precondition 
for 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
all 
its 
applications. 
Over 
the 
years, 
regulators 
and 
operators 
had 
exchanged 
experience 
and 
technical 
information 
on 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
a 
number 
of 
fora. 
The 
Agency 
should 
support 
those 
activities 
and 
make 
its 
services 
available 
to 
Member 
States. 
The 
new 
Fundamental 
Safety 
Principles 
represented 
a 
milestone 
in 
the 
development 
of 
Agency 
safety 
standards. 
It 
was 
logical 
to 
combine 
the 
safety 
fundamentals 
for 
nuclear 
installations, 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radiation 
sources 
in 
one 
document. 
Slovakia 
was 
ready 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
development 
of 
subsequent 
safety 
requirements 
and 
safety 
guides. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
peer 
review 
services 
and 
expert 
services 
were 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
international 
cooperation 
and 
a 
confidence-building 
measure 
which 
supported 
the 
national 
regulatory 
decision-making 
process. 
In 
2006, 
Slovakia 
had 
received 
an 
IPPAS 
mission 
and 
an 
OSART 
mission 
at 
the 
Mochovce 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
which 
had 
provided 
valuable 
input 
on 
how 
to 
promote 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
facilities. 
Cooperation 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
other 
relevant 
international 
bodies 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
globalization 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
144. 
The 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Authority 
of 
Slovakia 
considered 
the 
operation 
of 
all 
facilities 
in 
the 
country 
to 
be 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
within 
the 
national 
legal 
framework. 
That 
had 
also 
been 
confirmed 
by 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management. 
There 
was 
no 
cause 
for 
complacency, 
however, 
and 
further 
steps 
were 
being 
taken 
to 
improve 
safety. 
145. 
In 
its 
13 
years 
of 
Agency 
membership, 
Slovakia 
had 
participated 
in 
a 
number 
of 
national, 
regional 
and 
interregional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
Technical 
cooperation 
relating 
to 
human 
resource 
development, 
safe 
long-term 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
operation, 
decommissioning 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
was 
an 
important 
source 
of 
information 
transfer. 
As 
in 
previous 
years, 
Slovakia 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
experts 
and 
training 
facilities 
and 
accept 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Slovakia 
had 
paid 
its 
TCF 
share 
for 
2006 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time 
and 
had 
taken 
measures 
to 
fulfil 
its 
obligations 
in 
that 
regard 
in 
2007 
as 
well. 
146. 
Mr. 
TZOTCHEV 
(Bulgaria) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
receiving 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
which 
was 
a 
remarkable 
recognition 
of 
their 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
energy 
from 
being 
used 
for 
military 
purposes 
and 
to 
ensure 
the 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
147. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
worldÂs 
focal 
point 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
it 
played 
a 
global 
role 
in 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
countering 
the 
threats 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Recent 
developments 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
highlighted 
the 
need 
for 
further 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
NPT.

148. 
The 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
policy 
was 
cause 
for 
concern 
and 
posed 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
safeguards 
regime. 
Bulgaria 
welcomed 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006) 
which 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
any 
preconditions 
and 
to 
fulfil 
its 
commitments 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
joint 
statement 
of 
September 
2005. 
149. 
Bulgaria 
was 
strongly 
committed 
to 
a 
universal 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
reinforced 
by 
a 
strong 
international 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
additional 
protocol 
should 
become 
a 
verification 
standard 
for 
NPT 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
and 
he 
called 
on 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Treaty 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
that 
instrument. 
He 
also 
highly 
commended 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
strengthen 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
including 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols. 
150. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
implementation 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
a 
number 
of 
States. 
To 
improve 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
system, 
the 
Agency 
should 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
introduce 
integrated 
safeguards 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible 
in 
States 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
activities. 
151. 
The 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
would 
contribute 
significantly 
to 
efforts 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Bulgaria 
had 
ratified 
those 
amendments 
in 
February 
2006 
and 
hoped 
that 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
would 
take 
steps 
to 
ensure 
their 
prompt 
ratification. 
152. 
Work 
on 
the 
project 
to 
construct 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Bulgaria 
had 
continued 
in 
2006 
pursuant 
to 
the 
preliminary 
plans 
for 
completion 
of 
the 
tender 
procedure 
for 
granting 
the 
engineering, 
procurement 
and 
construction 
contract. 
The 
technical 
and 
financial 
proposals 
from 
both 
preselected 
vendors 
had 
been 
submitted 
and 
were 
under 
review 
by 
a 
specially 
appointed 
evaluation 
committee. 
The 
bid 
winner 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
announced 
before 
the 
end 
of 
2006 
with 
a 
view 
to 
beginning 
work 
in 
2007. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
many 
initiatives 
were 
being 
implemented 
under 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
with 
a 
view 
to 
developing 
local 
capabilities 
for 
strengthening 
the 
new 
nuclear 
power 
infrastructure. 
153. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
licensing 
process 
for 
the 
new 
nuclear 
units, 
the 
Bulgarian 
Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Agency 
would 
be 
looking 
for 
increased 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
with 
regulatory 
bodies 
and 
technical 
support 
organizations 
from 
other 
countries. 
Such 
cooperation 
would 
be 
required 
for 
all 
stages 
of 
the 
construction 
and 
commissioning 
of 
the 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
for 
all 
the 
support 
it 
had 
provided 
for 
BulgariaÂs 
new 
nuclear 
project. 
154. 
The 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
reflected 
the 
AgencyÂs 
leading 
role 
in 
developing 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
The 
report 
gave 
a 
clear 
and 
analytical 
picture 
of 
the 
broad 
range 
of 
important 
results 
obtained 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
2005, 
and 
the 
significant 
achievements 
it 
had 
made 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
safety, 
verification, 
security 
and 
management. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
establishing 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime 
and 
in 
providing 
technical 
assistance 
to 
Member 
States 
was 
also 
vital. 
155. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
established 
itself 
as 
a 
well-functioning 
mechanism 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
technology 
to 
developing 
Member 
States. 
Bulgaria 
hoped 
that 
the 
new 
structure 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
would 
further 
enhance 
the 
programme 
and 
its 
successful 
implementation. 
Bulgaria 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
areas, 
such 
as 
human 
health, 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
water 
resources 
management, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
knowledge 
management. 
A 
significant 
number 
of 
nuclear 
safety-and 
security-related 
projects 
had 
been 
implemented 
in 
the 
Europe 
region 
at 
national 
and 
regional 
level 
and 
they 
had 
contributed 
significantly 
to 
improving 
safety 
and 
security 
in 
all 
areas 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy.

156. 
Bulgaria 
had 
always 
attached 
high 
priority 
to 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
It 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
organization, 
and 
in 
particular 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Security 
and 
the 
Department 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy, 
for 
providing 
assistance 
with 
upgrading 
the 
safety 
of 
its 
nuclear 
facilities, 
developing 
and 
applying 
new 
technologies 
in 
the 
nuclear 
energy 
field 
and 
increasing 
and 
strengthening 
the 
capabilities 
of 
the 
Bulgarian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Authority. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
the 
field 
of 
medicine 
was 
also 
of 
great 
importance 
and 
it 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
Agency 
activities 
in 
that 
area 
would 
receive 
more 
support 
from 
the 
Member 
States. 
157. 
Bulgaria 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
proposed 
budget, 
which 
maintained 
a 
balance 
between 
the 
main 
priorities 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities. 
It 
had 
met 
its 
financial 
obligations 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
for 
2006 
in 
full 
and 
those 
pertaining 
to 
its 
pledged 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF. 
BulgariaÂs 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2007 
would 
be 
$12 
800. 
158. 
Mr. 
NADER 
(Uruguay) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
peace 
and 
the 
resolution 
of 
conflicts 
in 
accordance 
with 
international 
law. 
It 
used 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
chiefly 
for 
medical 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment. 
Its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
preceding 
year 
had 
been 
very 
fruitful. 
159. 
In 
October 
2005, 
Uruguay 
had 
become 
the 
second 
Latin 
American 
State 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management, 
and 
it 
had 
been 
pleased 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
in 
May 
2006. 
That 
valuable 
experience 
should 
help 
it 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
national 
strategy 
on 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
It 
also 
needed 
a 
strategy 
for 
the 
appropriate 
and 
correct 
storage 
and 
management 
of 
disused 
medical 
and 
industrial 
sources. 
His 
country 
was 
striving 
to 
achieve 
the 
highest 
possible 
level 
of 
safety 
culture. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
National 
Regulatory 
Authority 
had 
been 
established 
and 
a 
new 
draft 
radiation 
protection 
law 
had 
recently 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
Uruguayan 
parliament 
which 
it 
was 
hoped 
would 
enter 
into 
force 
before 
the 
end 
of 
2006. 
160. 
Uruguay 
had 
also 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
Latin 
American 
countries 
to 
establish 
an 
integrated 
nuclear 
security 
support 
plan 
focusing 
on 
the 
prevention 
and 
detection 
of 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material, 
but 
covering 
other 
aspects 
of 
nuclear 
security 
as 
well, 
including 
the 
prevention 
of 
malicious 
use 
of 
sources. 
161. 
In 
July 
2006, 
his 
country 
had 
joined 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Nuclear 
Regulators 
and 
had 
already 
hosted 
a 
meeting 
on 
patient 
protection. 
162. 
Uruguay 
would 
participating 
actively 
in 
the 
next 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle 
both 
through 
its 
national 
project 
proposals 
and 
the 
new 
regional 
projects 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
safety. 
163. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
and 
in 
particular 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
the 
assistance 
they 
had 
provided 
which 
had 
allowed 
Uruguay 
to 
attain 
international 
respect 
in 
the 
radiation 
safety 
field. 
164. 
Mr. 
ERTAY 
(Turkey) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation, 
including 
potential 
proliferation 
to 
non-State 
actors, 
was 
a 
serious 
concern 
for 
his 
country. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
his 
Government 
would 
continue 
to 
promote 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
Treaty 
and 
strengthening 
of 
safeguards, 
as 
well 
as 
reinforcement 
of 
export 
controls, 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT 
and 
the 
immediate 
start 
of 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty. 
165. 
Turkey 
strongly 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system, 
since 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capability 
and 
legal 
authority 
needed 
to 
be 
reinforced 
to 
detect 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities. 
A 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
together 
with 
an 
additional 
protocol 
should 
constitute 
the 
current 
verification 
standard. 
Indeed, 
the 
future 
of 
the 
NPT 
depended 
on 
universal 
compliance 
with 
tighter

verification 
measures. 
All 
States 
party 
to 
the 
Treaty, 
nuclear-weapon 
and 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
alike, 
should 
reaffirm 
their 
commitment 
to 
comply 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
it. 
More 
effective 
regional 
security 
strategies 
needed 
to 
be 
developed 
and 
a 
specific 
and 
balanced 
programme 
of 
action 
agreed 
upon 
to 
strengthen 
compliance 
and 
implementation. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
non-compliance, 
the 
international 
community 
should 
take 
measures 
to 
preserve 
the 
integrity 
and 
authority 
of 
the 
system. 


166. 
The 
absence 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
in 
a 
particular 
region 
would 
allay 
significantly 
the 
security 
concerns 
of 
countries 
in 
that 
region. 
Accordingly, 
Turkey 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
effectively 
verifiable 
zones 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
in 
particular 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
167. 
Turkey 
advocated 
peaceful 
and 
diplomatic 
solutions 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
issues 
currently 
of 
concern 
to 
the 
international 
community. 
It 
therefore 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
to 
abandon 
and 
dismantle 
completely 
any 
nuclear 
weapons-related 
programme 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent 
and 
verifiable 
manner, 
in 
accordance 
with 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006). 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue, 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
political 
and 
diplomatic 
efforts 
to 
find 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
guaranteeing 
IranÂs 
legal 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
while 
ensuring 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Iran 
should, 
without 
further 
delay, 
take 
the 
necessary 
confidence-building 
steps 
and 
resolve 
outstanding 
issues. 
Turkey 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
meetings 
between 
the 
EU 
High 
Representative 
and 
the 
Iranian 
chief 
nuclear 
negotiator 
and 
hoped 
that 
their 
efforts 
would 
result 
in 
a 
positive 
outcome 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
168. 
His 
countryÂs 
energy 
policy 
was 
focused 
on 
the 
security, 
sustainability 
and 
competitiveness 
of 
the 
energy 
supply, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
upholding 
targeted 
socio-economic 
growth. 
There 
had 
been 
an 
almost 
threefold 
increase 
in 
electricity 
demand 
in 
Turkey 
over 
the 
preceding 
15 
years, 
resulting 
in 
the 
need 
to 
introduce 
a 
substantial 
amount 
of 
new 
capacity 
in 
the 
grid. 
Conventional 
energy 
resources 
were 
not 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
TurkeyÂs 
energy 
needs 
and 
a 
significant 
increase 
would 
be 
required 
in 
the 
coming 
years 
in 
both 
energy 
production 
and 
supply 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
demands 
in 
a 
secure 
and 
reliable 
manner. 
169. 
Turkey 
recognized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
the 
crucial 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
regard. 
It 
also 
recognized 
that 
any 
significant 
increase 
in 
nuclear 
power 
would 
only 
be 
possible 
if 
the 
international 
community 
met 
certain 
challenges 
and 
addressed 
concerns 
about 
waste, 
proliferation 
and 
safety 
and 
security. 
Plans 
were 
already 
well 
under 
way 
to 
make 
nuclear 
power 
a 
major 
component 
of 
TurkeyÂs 
supply 
mix 
in 
the 
medium 
to 
long 
term. 
Nuclear 
power 
was 
expected 
to 
enhance 
the 
countryÂs 
strategies 
for 
reducing 
environmental 
emissions. 
His 
Government 
had 
already 
expressed 
its 
intention 
to 
introduce 
nuclear 
energy. 
Priority 
was 
currently 
being 
given 
to 
the 
reorganization 
of 
the 
nuclear 
regulatory 
structure. 
The 
next 
phase 
would 
be 
to 
put 
the 
final 
touches 
to 
a 
programme 
aimed 
at 
making 
the 
first 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
operational 
in 
the 
coming 
decade. 
Turkey 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
throughout 
the 
process 
of 
implementing 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
170. 
His 
country 
remained 
committed 
to 
contributing 
to 
international 
efforts 
to 
combat 
all 
forms 
of 
terrorism, 
including 
malicious 
acts 
involving 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
It 
strongly 
supported 
all 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear, 
biological, 
chemical 
and 
radiological 
weapons 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery. 
Turkey 
was 
party 
to 
all 
universal 
anti-terrorist 
instruments, 
including 
the 
CPPNM. 
It 
would 
shortly 
be 
ratifying 
the 
amendments 
to 
that 
Convention. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
one 
of 
the 
first 
signatories 
of 
the 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
The 
new 
Turkish 
penal 
code 
had 
established 
many 
acts 
involving 
the 
unauthorized 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material 
as 
criminal 
offences. 
Turkey 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
and 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative. 
States 
should 
take 
every 
step 
to

prevent 
illegal 
trade 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
technology, 
and 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
or 
their 
components, 
in 
order 
to 
preserve 
peace 
and 
security. 


171. 
Nuclear 
science, 
technology 
and 
applications 
addressed 
a 
wide 
variety 
of 
basic 
socio-economic 
development 
needs 
of 
Member 
States 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
energy, 
industry, 
food 
and 
agriculture, 
human 
health 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
Scientific 
cooperation 
among 
nations 
had 
a 
role 
to 
play 
in 
contributing 
to 
peace 
and 
security, 
particularly 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Turkey 
strongly 
supported 
collaborative 
scientific 
endeavours, 
such 
as 
the 
SESAME 
project, 
and 
trusted 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
provide 
its 
full 
support 
for 
such 
efforts. 
172. 
A 
global 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
waste 
safety 
culture 
was 
a 
key 
element 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
his 
country 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
building 
and 
enhancing 
such 
a 
culture 
worldwide 
through 
its 
relevant 
programmes. 
It 
appreciated 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
ongoing 
efforts 
to 
update 
and 
extend 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards 
to 
cover 
all 
important 
thematic 
areas 
and 
encouraged 
it 
to 
continue 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
in 
applying 
those 
standards. 
173. 
Turkey 
had 
always 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
promotional 
activities 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
strongly 
supported 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
funding 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
was 
the 
responsibility 
of 
all 
Member 
States 
and 
he 
urged 
each 
Member 
State 
to 
pay 
its 
share 
of 
the 
target 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
His 
country 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
and 
would 
encourage 
further 
cooperation 
in 
that 
regard 
with 
the 
relevant 
United 
Nations 
agencies. 
174. 
Ms. 
PRIJIVOIT 
(Kyrgyzstan) 
said 
that, 
although 
her 
country 
had 
only 
been 
a 
member 
since 
2003, 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
acquired 
definite 
shape 
and 
direction. 
A 
national 
body 
responsible 
for 
cooperation 
had 
been 
established 
in 
2006. 
The 
internal 
procedures 
required 
for 
the 
countryÂs 
accession 
to 
the 
additional 
protocol 
had 
now 
been 
completed 
and 
it 
would 
be 
notifying 
the 
Agency 
accordingly 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
175. 
Her 
country 
was 
also 
in 
the 
final 
stages 
of 
signing 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
agreement 
and 
had 
great 
hopes 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
help 
solve 
many 
pressing 
problems, 
particularly 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
environmental 
protection, 
medicine 
and 
agriculture. 
176. 
On 
8 
September 
2006 
in 
Semipalatinsk, 
five 
Central 
Asian 
countries 
had 
signed 
a 
treaty 
creating 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
region, 
completing 
work 
begun 
in 
1997 
and 
contributing 
to 
the 
prevention 
of 
international 
terrorism, 
in 
particular 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
and 
to 
strengthening 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
global 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Compliance 
with 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
vital 
to 
regional 
security 
in 
view 
of 
Central 
AsiaÂs 
strategic 
location 
and 
the 
abundance 
of 
uranium 
and 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
region, 
whose 
people 
had 
suffered 
from 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
arms 
race 
during 
the 
Cold 
War. 
Her 
Government 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Central 
Asian 
countries 
and 
the 
United 
Nations 
for 
acknowledging 
KyrgyzstanÂs 
trustworthiness, 
and 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
zone, 
by 
designating 
it 
as 
the 
depositary 
for 
the 
Treaty. 
177. 
The 
Treaty 
also 
had 
an 
important 
environmental 
protection 
component 
since 
it 
banned 
the 
establishment 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
storage 
sites 
in 
the 
region. 
On 
more 
than 
one 
occasion, 
her 
country 
had 
drawn 
attention 
to 
the 
grave 
environmental 
problems 
it 
faced, 
which 
threatened 
at 
any 
moment 
to 
develop 
into 
a 
regional 
catastrophe. 
During 
the 
Soviet 
era, 
Kyrgyzstan 
had 
been 
an 
important 
mining 
and 
processing 
area 
for 
heavy 
metals 
and 
uranium 
ore. 
Those 
activities 
had 
lasted 
several 
decades, 
ending 
in 
1970, 
and 
had 
left 
behind 
numerous 
tailings 
dumps 
containing 
vast 
quantities 
of 
radioactive 
waste. 
There 
were 
some 
40 
such 
tailings 
dumps 
in 
Kyrgyzstan, 
the 
largest 
and 
most 
hazardous 
of 
which 
lay 
in 
the 
southern 
regions 
that 
formed 
part 
of 
the 
Fergana 
valley. 
Approximately 
6500 
hectares 
of 
land 
were 
radioactively 
contaminated 
and 
the 
volume 
of 
waste 
approached 
145 
million 
tonnes. 
The 
problem 
extended 
beyond 
the 
borders 
of 
Kyrgyzstan 
and 
posed 
a 
real 
environmental 
threat 
to

neighbouring 
countries. 
Kyrgyzstan 
was 
unable 
to 
meet 
that 
challenge 
alone. 
The 
only 
way 
her 
country 
could 
overcome 
the 
problem 
was 
through 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
and, 
as 
a 
full 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
it 
counted 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
expertise, 
support 
and 
assistance. 


178. 
Finally, 
she 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
all 
their 
efforts, 
which 
had 
been 
justly 
rewarded 
with 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
179. 
Mr. 
HAMZÃ 
(Lebanon) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
180. 
In 
July 
and 
August 
2006, 
his 
country 
had 
been 
the 
target 
of 
brutal 
Israeli 
aggression 
that 
had 
claimed 
the 
lives 
of 
over 
1200 
citizens, 
left 
thousands 
injured 
and 
disabled, 
displaced 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
peaceable 
men, 
women 
and 
children, 
and 
destroyed 
their 
homes 
and 
villages 
in 
a 
ruthless 
campaign 
directed 
against 
human 
life 
and 
the 
Lebanese 
economy 
and 
infrastructure. 
It 
was 
the 
sixth 
war 
waged 
by 
Israel 
against 
Lebanon 
in 
less 
than 
two 
decades. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
expressions 
of 
support 
it 
had 
received 
from 
countries 
all 
over 
the 
world. 
Their 
emergency 
assistance 
had 
helped 
the 
Lebanese 
people 
to 
stand 
firm 
against 
the 
aggression. 
Perhaps 
the 
most 
valuable 
support 
had 
been 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
recognition 
of 
LebanonÂs 
right 
to 
resist 
occupation 
and 
its 
condemnation 
of 
the 
war 
on 
civilians 
and 
IsraelÂs 
use 
of 
types 
of 
weapons 
that 
continued 
to 
inflict 
horrendous 
damage 
even 
after 
the 
military 
operations 
had 
ceased. 
Lebanon 
and 
its 
scientific 
institutions, 
with 
United 
Nations 
support, 
had 
been 
endeavouring 
since 
the 
cessation 
of 
the 
hostilities 
to 
protect 
the 
population 
from 
cluster 
bombs 
that 
claimed 
new 
victims 
daily 
and 
prevented 
farmers 
from 
cultivating 
their 
land 
and 
harvesting 
their 
crops. 
181. 
IsraelÂs 
actions 
in 
Lebanon 
had 
not 
created 
a 
climate 
conducive 
to 
peace 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
were 
at 
odds 
with 
the 
content 
of 
the 
attachment 
to 
document 
GC(50)/18 
submitted 
by 
Israel. 
He 
therefore 
called 
for 
strong 
condemnation 
of 
the 
use 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
munitions 
against 
civilians, 
and 
for 
endorsement 
of 
the 
content 
of 
the 
memorandum 
submitted 
by 
Arab 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency 
contained 
in 
the 
attachment 
to 
document 
GC(50)/17, 
which 
aimed 
at 
bringing 
about 
a 
secure 
and 
stable 
Middle 
East. 
IsraelÂs 
full, 
speedy 
and 
unequivocal 
compliance 
with 
the 
provisions 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1701 
(2006), 
by 
withdrawing 
from 
the 
territory 
it 
was 
still 
occupying 
in 
Lebanon 
and 
handing 
over 
maps 
showing 
the 
location 
of 
cluster 
bombs 
and 
the 
type 
of 
weapons 
used, 
should 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
to 
move 
forward 
with 
a 
just 
and 
equitable 
peace 
process 
that 
was 
long 
overdue, 
a 
fact 
which 
was 
beginning 
to 
have 
detrimental 
consequences 
for 
the 
world 
as 
a 
whole. 
182. 
Under 
its 
regional 
cooperation 
projects, 
the 
Agency 
had 
provided 
Lebanon 
with 
the 
support 
it 
needed 
to 
strengthen 
its 
radiation 
monitoring 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
infrastructure. 
Since 
2005, 
in 
close 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
relevant 
Lebanese 
bodies, 
Lebanon 
had 
published 
regulations 
governing 
all 
matters 
relating 
to 
the 
use 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
in 
the 
country. 
The 
Lebanese 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
acted 
as 
the 
national 
supervisory 
body, 
laying 
the 
foundations 
for 
radiation 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
worked 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
implementing 
LebanonÂs 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
policy. 
It 
applied 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
dealt 
with 
monitoring 
and 
the 
technical 
aspects 
of 
agreements 
between 
Lebanon 
and 
the 
Agency. 
The 
Lebanese 
Government 
had 
recently 
decided 
to 
approve 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
SQP 
and 
would 
sign 
an 
additional 
protocol 
very 
soon. 
183. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
Lebanon 
was 
collaborating 
with 
the 
Agency 
through 
its 
participation 
in 
the 
illicit 
trafficking 
database 
and 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security. 
In 
May 
2006, 
a 
nuclear 
security 
mission 
had 
visited 
the 
country 
to 
investigate 
ways 
of 
enhancing 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
system 
for 
monitoring 
land 
and 
sea 
borders 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
the 
entry 
or 
exit 
of 
radioactive 
or 
nuclear 
material. 
The 
requisite 
legal 
framework 
for 
an 
effective 
system 
was 
currently 
being 
developed.

184. 
He 
thanked 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
for 
reactivating 
LebanonÂs 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
especially 
those 
relating 
to 
the 
use 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
after 
verifying 
the 
steps 
taken 
by 
the 
Government 
to 
enhance 
the 
monitoring 
system. 
185. 
Lebanon 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
a 
culture 
conducive 
to 
the 
safe 
and 
secure 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
development, 
especially 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
agriculture, 
industry, 
medical 
science 
and 
applied 
scientific 
research. 
A 
meticulous 
and 
transparent 
radiation 
monitoring 
system 
was 
essential 
to 
protect 
workers 
and 
the 
environment 
from 
the 
risks 
associated 
with 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
186. 
His 
country 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
speedy 
response 
to 
its 
urgent 
requests 
for 
technical 
assistance. 
The 
political, 
social 
and 
economic 
circumstances 
created 
by 
the 
recent 
Israeli 
aggression, 
and 
the 
damage 
it 
had 
inflicted 
on 
the 
environment 
and 
industry, 
increased 
LebanonÂs 
determination 
to 
step 
up 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
187. 
Mr. 
ZAMBEZI 
(Zambia) 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
activities. 
PACT 
was 
one 
such 
innovative 
activity 
which 
deserved 
support 
to 
ensure 
its 
full 
implementation. 
The 
programme 
on 
radiological 
protection 
of 
patients 
helped 
promote 
the 
safe 
application 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
in 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
diseases. 
Zambia 
would 
benefit 
greatly 
from 
such 
programmes, 
especially 
now 
that 
the 
first 
cancer 
treatment 
centre 
had 
been 
established 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
be 
commissioned. 
188. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
work 
throughout 
the 
world, 
including 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
Safeguards 
measures 
should 
continue 
to 
be 
comprehensive 
and 
non-selective. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
endorsed 
the 
call 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
It 
was 
disappointing 
that, 
ten 
years 
after 
its 
adoption, 
that 
Treaty 
had 
still 
not 
entered 
into 
force. 
The 
need 
for 
it 
was 
greater 
than 
ever 
in 
order 
to 
dispel 
the 
notion 
that 
belonging 
to 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
club 
conferred 
prestige, 
an 
idea 
fuelled 
by 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
disarm 
while 
they 
prevented 
others 
from 
acquiring 
such 
weapons. 
189. 
He 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
and 
commended 
the 
proposed 
use 
of 
the 
prize 
money. 
190. 
Zambia 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
combat 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material 
and 
radioactive 
sources 
by 
strengthening 
its 
legal 
framework. 
Legislation 
making 
the 
regulatory 
authority 
independent 
was 
in 
place. 
The 
country 
was 
also 
in 
the 
process 
of 
finalizing 
consultations 
on 
its 
additional 
protocol. 
191. 
His 
country 
was 
happy 
with 
the 
focus 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
programme 
and 
budget 
for 
2007 
and 
the 
support 
it 
gave 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Zambia 
continued 
to 
build 
on 
the 
benefits 
it 
had 
gained 
from 
that 
programme. 
Developments 
since 
the 
preceding 
General 
Conference 
included, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
completion 
of 
the 
ICT 
telecentre 
that 
would 
shortly 
host 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
on 
ICT-based 
training, 
completion 
of 
the 
cancer 
hospital 
and 
hiring 
of 
expert 
oncologists 
from 
the 
African 
Region, 
expansion 
of 
neonatal 
screening 
across 
the 
country 
by 
establishing 
satellite 
laboratories 
in 
the 
Copperbelt 
province, 
and 
the 
pre-release 
of 
several 
mutant 
bean 
varieties. 
The 
plant 
tissue 
culture 
facility 
continued 
to 
provide 
input 
to 
the 
national 
potato 
seed 
supply 
and 
food 
security 
initiatives. 
Several 
varieties 
of 
cassava 
Â 
a 
drought-tolerant 
food 
crop 
Â 
had 
been 
produced 
and 
were 
being 
micropropagated 
for 
use 
as 
disease-free 
plant 
material 
in 
rural 
areas 
192. 
Zambia 
continued 
to 
support 
AFRA. 
Since 
the 
preceding 
General 
Conference, 
it 
had 
received 
AFRA 
missions 
in 
various 
areas. 
Zambian 
scientific 
and 
technical 
staff 
had 
participated 
in 
training 
courses 
and 
seminars, 
as 
well 
as 
coordinating 
meetings 
and 
programmes. 
He 
appealed 
to 
cooperating 
partners 
to 
continue 
supporting 
AFRA 
financially 
in 
order 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
projects 
planned 
for 
2007-2008 
could 
be 
carried 
out.

193. 
In 
conclusion, 
Zambia 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
2007. 
194. 
Mr. 
RISTORI 
(European 
Commission) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
recognition 
of 
their 
tireless 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
used 
in 
the 
safest 
possible 
manner. 
195. 
The 
Agency 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
shared 
the 
same 
objectives 
with 
regard 
to 
non-proliferation, 
safety, 
secure 
energy 
production, 
and 
research 
and 
development. 
Strengthened 
cooperation 
between 
the 
two 
organizations 
was 
all 
the 
more 
necessary 
in 
view 
of 
the 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
new 
world 
energy 
context. 
Many 
States 
had 
chosen 
nuclear 
power 
as 
one 
of 
the 
most 
effective 
options 
for 
diversification 
and 
one 
which 
could 
also 
help 
reduce 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions. 
In 
order 
to 
realize 
the 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
enhanced 
cooperation 
among 
all 
involved 
was 
required. 
196. 
The 
three 
main 
objectives 
of 
the 
energy 
policy 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
were 
security 
of 
supply, 
competitiveness 
and 
environmental 
protection. 
As 
far 
as 
security 
of 
supply 
was 
concerned, 
at 
current 
rates 
of 
consumption 
global 
uranium 
reserves 
would 
appear 
to 
be 
sufficient; 
moreover, 
the 
geopolitical 
distribution 
of 
resources 
was 
favourable 
in 
stable 
regions. 
The 
European 
Union 
was 
pursuing 
a 
policy 
aimed 
at 
consistent 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
material 
in 
a 
well-functioning 
market. 
In 
that 
connection, 
it 
welcomed 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
assure 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
and 
it 
therefore 
appreciated 
the 
special 
event 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
that 
was 
being 
held 
during 
the 
Conference. 
Costs 
associated 
with 
nuclear 
power 
production 
were 
becoming 
increasingly 
predictable 
and 
competitive, 
and 
less 
sensitive 
to 
rising 
raw 
material 
prices. 
Moreover, 
fuel 
costs 
accounted 
for 
a 
much 
smaller 
share 
of 
overall 
costs 
in 
nuclear 
plants 
than 
in 
traditional 
thermal 
power 
plants. 
As 
far 
as 
the 
environmental 
dimension 
was 
concerned, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
develop 
energy 
sources 
that 
produced 
few 
or 
no 
greenhouse 
gases. 
Accordingly, 
nuclear 
power 
could 
prove 
an 
effective 
choice 
for 
diversification, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
achieving 
the 
Kyoto 
targets. 
197. 
The 
growing 
importance 
of 
energy 
issues 
could 
not 
be 
overestimated. 
In 
March 
2006, 
the 
European 
Commission 
had 
published 
a 
Green 
Paper 
on 
a 
European 
strategy 
for 
sustainable, 
competitive 
and 
secure 
energy. 
World 
energy 
investment 
was 
estimated 
at 
some 
Â12 
trillion; 
Â1 
trillion 
would 
be 
required 
in 
the 
European 
Union 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
two 
decades 
alone 
to 
fill 
the 
void 
in 
energy 
investment 
over 
the 
preceding 
20Â25 
years. 
There 
was 
a 
growing 
awareness 
that 
energy 
savings 
and 
efficiencies 
alone, 
though 
essential, 
would 
not 
be 
sufficient 
to 
meet 
the 
increasing 
energy 
demand. 
198. 
Essential 
conditions 
had 
to 
be 
met 
for 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
priority 
areas 
of 
action 
included 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
waste 
management, 
non-proliferation 
and 
technological 
development. 
With 
respect 
to 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
waste 
management, 
including 
dismantling, 
the 
European 
Union 
had 
been 
striving 
to 
maintain 
the 
highest 
harmonized 
standards. 
Countries 
outside 
the 
Union 
also 
benefited 
from 
its 
efforts, 
for 
example 
through 
the 
TACIS 
programme, 
the 
Chernobyl 
Shelter 
Fund, 
and 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
improve 
the 
safety 
of 
WWER 
reactors. 
The 
EU 
was 
providing 
significant 
financial 
assistance 
for 
the 
dismantling 
of 
certain 
facilities 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
Slovakia 
following 
the 
enlargement 
of 
the 
Union 
in 
2004. 
It 
was 
also 
providing 
assistance 
to 
Bulgaria. 
199. 
The 
sustainable 
management 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel 
was 
another 
essential 
element 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
Member 
States 
had 
to 
develop 
detailed 
programmes 
with 
well 
defined 
milestones 
in 
that 
area. 
There 
were 
scientific 
and 
technical 
challenges 
associated 
with 
the 
management 
of 
long-lived 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
spent 
fuel. 
200. 
Euratom 
was 
party 
to 
a 
large 
number 
of 
nuclear-related 
international 
conventions, 
including 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Spent 
Fuel 
Management 
and 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management, 
the 
Early 
Notification 
Convention 
and 
the 
Assistance 
Convention. 
It 
also 
continued 
to

cooperate 
closely 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
area 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
participated 
actively 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Commission 
on 
Safety 
Standards. 
Ongoing 
cooperation, 
together 
with 
the 
new 
recommendations 
of 
the 
International 
Commission 
on 
Radiological 
Protection, 
would 
promote 
the 
harmonization 
of 
requirements 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
safety 
of 
radiation 
sources. 


201. 
As 
a 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM, 
Euratom 
strongly 
supported 
the 
tightening 
of 
the 
international 
nuclear 
security 
regime. 
Illicit 
trafficking 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
regulatory 
framework 
for 
dual-use 
items 
were 
high 
priorities. 
Safeguards 
were 
also 
a 
major 
political 
priority 
and 
cooperation 
between 
the 
Commission 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
further 
developed 
by 
building 
on 
the 
complementary 
strengths 
of 
the 
two 
organizations. 
An 
additional 
protocol, 
together 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
should 
constitute 
the 
current 
worldwide 
verification 
standard. 
He 
was 
pleased 
to 
report 
that 
an 
additional 
protocol 
was 
in 
force 
in 
all 
25 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
European 
Union 
and 
he 
invited 
all 
members 
of 
the 
Agency 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
202. 
Considerable 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
with 
regard 
to 
technological 
development. 
The 
European 
Union, 
through 
the 
Joint 
Research 
Centre, 
had 
been 
involved 
for 
some 
time 
in 
an 
extensive 
programme 
of 
scientific 
and 
technological 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Euratom 
had 
become 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Generation 
IV 
International 
Forum 
in 
2003, 
and 
in 
2006 
it 
had 
concluded 
the 
Framework 
Agreement 
for 
International 
Collaboration 
on 
Research 
and 
Development 
of 
Generation 
IV 
Nuclear 
Energy 
Systems. 
203. 
The 
European 
Commission 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
undertaken 
by 
the 
Agency 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
INPRO 
to 
evaluate 
innovative 
nuclear 
reactors 
and 
fuel 
cycles 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
economics, 
sustainability, 
the 
environment, 
safety, 
waste 
management 
and 
proliferation 
resistance. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
constructive 
and 
effective 
support 
for 
the 
ITER 
project 
and 
its 
instrumental 
role 
in 
bringing 
the 
ITER 
negotiations 
to 
a 
successful 
conclusion. 
204. 
In 
the 
current 
world 
energy 
context, 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
strengthen 
cooperation 
and 
dialogue 
among 
all 
actors. 
The 
European 
Commission 
would 
enhance 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
all 
areas 
with 
a 
view 
to 
building 
on 
the 
complementary 
strengths 
of 
the 
two 
organizations. 
The 
nuclear 
option 
required 
the 
full 
commitment 
of 
all 
to 
non-proliferation, 
and 
improved 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
European 
Commission, 
for 
its 
part, 
was 
committed 
to 
continuing 
its 
efforts 
to 
that 
end.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(continued) 
(GC(50)/4) 
1. Mr. EGLAJS (Latvia) congratulated the staff of the Agency and its Director General on the 
award of the Nobel Peace Prize which was deserved recognition of the AgencyÂs work over the 
preceding 50 years. 
2. He expressed appreciation for the successful development of the AgencyÂs technical 
cooperation activities. The changes which had been made to the procedures for submitting new 
projects, and the possibility of monitoring all activities via the Internet, were very positive 
developments. His country continued to benefit from technical cooperation projects. The purpose of 
one such project was to establish a biological dosimetry laboratory to provide new opportunities for 
research activities as well as substantial input for radiation protection. 
3. Progress had been made in establishing a multi-purpose cyclotron centre in Latvia. His 
Government had recently approved the relevant concept document which would facilitate further 
implementation of that project. It had decided to opt for a public-private partnership and was therefore 
facing the challenge of finding private investors willing to participate in the development of the 
cyclotron centre. 
4. He thanked the staff of the Department for Technical Cooperation for their outstanding 
performance, cooperation and readiness to assist. Latvia had benefited greatly from its participation in 
technical cooperation activities and felt that the exchange of knowledge and experience provided a 
great opportunity for all countries. 
5. General Conference resolution GC(49)/RES/9 had highlighted the critical role of emergency 
response and the need for appropriate training in dealing with nuclear and radiological accidents. With 
the support of the Phare programme, his country had substantially improved its early warning system 
and had enhanced the capability of its emergency preparedness system. It had modernized its 
monitoring system and had organized additional training for emergency response personnel. It was 
vital that developments in nuclear energy were accompanied by improvements in emergency 
preparedness. The year 2006 marked the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. Latvia had 
suffered from that accident and recognized the importance of developing an effective emergency 
preparedness system. 
6. He welcomed the successful finalization of the international catalogue of sealed radioactive 
sources and devices, which should contribute to improving radiation safety and serve as a tool in cases 
involving the discovery of orphan sources. 
7. A universal nuclear non-proliferation regime supported by a safeguards system was essential in 
ensuring collective security. The strength of the NPT lay in its three pillars: non-proliferation, 
disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. It was therefore regrettable that several States 
party to the Treaty had not concluded comprehensive safeguards agreements. Every State should fulfil 
its obligations under the NPT and contribute to the reinforcement of the international non-proliferation 
regime. Comprehensive safeguards agreements and additional protocols constituted the current 
Agency verification standard. Having analysed the situation in respect of other international 
instruments aimed at preventing the proliferation and development of weapons of mass destruction, his 

GC(50)/OR.5

country considered that there was room for improvement. Currently, only a few dozen countries 
participated in export, import and transit control regimes for dual-use items. 

8. Latvia was implementing the decision, taken in 2002, to decommission the Salaspils research 
reactor, which was the countryÂs sole reactor. It appreciated the assistance provided by the Agency and 
the financial support received from the United States of America under the Global Threat Reduction 
Initiative for the removal of fresh nuclear fuel from the reactor premises. Although negotiations 
regarding the return of spent fuel to the country of origin had proved unsuccessful, it was hoped that 
an agreement would be reached in the current year allowing decommissioning activities to proceed. 
The issue was an important one for Latvia because the removal of the spent fuel was a precondition for 
the successful implementation of the decommissioning plan. 
9. His country continued to engage in activities to extend its radioactive waste disposal site. As 
emphasized in its report at the first review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention 
on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, 
LatviaÂs objective was to ensure the safe management of spent fuel and radioactive waste. Those 
activities needed to be undertaken now and not left for future generations. His Government attached 
great importance to radioactive waste management and intended to spare no effort to resolve the issue. 
10. Mr. IVANAJ (Albania) congratulated the Agency and its Director General on the award of the 
Nobel Peace Prize for 2005. 
11. Albania attached great importance to the implementation of all international conventions and 
treaties on disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular those related to terrorism, and all 
resolutions and decisions adopted by the AgencyÂs General Conference and Board of Governors. It 
had signed and ratified all 12 conventions related to terrorism and had incorporated them into its 
national legislation. It had met all its obligations under the relevant international instruments and 
treaties and would continue to do so in the future, assigning that matter permanent priority in its 
foreign policy. 
12. His country was taking the final legislative steps to complete and adopt a comprehensive 
national atomic law which would cover safeguards-related issues and the relevant structures to ensure 
leadership and control over all nuclear and radiation-related matters and activities in line with 
international obligations, requirements and standards. The Albanian authorities were cooperating 
closely in that regard with the relevant departments of the Agency. 
13. Equal importance was being given to non-safeguards activities. Nuclear applications were 
important for national development and it was his GovernmentÂs policy in the field of non-power 
applications to ensure radiation protection and safety and security, to improve further and consolidate 
the regulatory framework, to adapt and harmonize related national infrastructure and to consolidate the 
legal basis for all nuclear-related activities. 
14. Albania wished to benefit as much as possible from the AgencyÂs unique experience, expertise 
and role through the technical cooperation programme and PACT. It demonstrated the seriousness 
with which it viewed technical cooperation by meeting its financial obligations in full. He called on all 
Member States to do likewise if they wished to receive continued and sustained assistance from the 
Agency. 
15. His country was grateful to the Agency for its continual support, cooperation and assistance in a 
wide range of effective projects which had had a positive impact, in particular in the human health 
sector in the fields of radiation therapy and nuclear medicine. The AgencyÂs cancer control 
programmes enjoyed the full support and high appreciation of the Albanian Government which hoped 
that they would continue to be pursued and strengthened. The oncology service at the Mother Teresa 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20

Hospital should soon become a centre of excellence thanks to the assistance of the Agency and other 
international organizations and financial institutions. A national cancer strategy and plan were in the 
final stages of preparation, through a brachytherapy machine and a linear accelerator would be 
required to achieve the countryÂs goals in that area. Albania would continue to demonstrate its full 
commitment and seriousness, including through cost-sharing. 

16. Continued cooperation was also important in the field of nuclear security to ensure the 
prevention and combating of illicit trafficking in radioactive material and terrorist threats, and to 
reduce radiological threats. 
17. Mr. RAMZY (Egypt) congratulated the Agency and its Director General on being awarded the 
Nobel Peace Prize. 
18. The 50th anniversary of the Agency provided an appropriate opportunity to reflect on the 
direction the organization should take in order to meet new demands arising under new political and 
economic circumstances. The Agency was unique among multilateral institutions as its mandate had 
both a security dimension, involving supervision of the application of the nuclear non-proliferation 
regime and arms control, and an economic and developmental dimension, involving assistance in 
promoting the use of the most sustainable of all forms of energy in support of peaceful development 
goals. Its work should therefore evolve to reflect basic changes in international security and the global 
economy. Egypt aspired to cooperate with the Agency as it developed its vital role in maintaining 
security and stability and in promoting sustainable development in line with its Statute, the NPT and 
the resolutions adopted by various United Nations bodies. 
19. The fact that nuclear power now accounted for 16% of global electricity generation was a 
positive development in view of the rising cost of fossil fuels and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. The Agency, which played a pivotal role in helping developing countries switch to nuclear 
energy, should step up its efforts to provide information and to promote transfer of technology and 
expertise in support of nuclear electricity production, especially since, according to the Annual Report, 
such production was concentrated in an extremely limited number of States. 
20. He expressed concern about the unprecedented increase in uranium prices and growing 
uncertainty regarding the future availability of supplies from secondary sources. It was important to 
promote international cooperation with a view to developing a strategy to meet expected needs. 
21. With regard to nuclear knowledge management, Egypt appreciated the AgencyÂs efforts to 
expand the existing database and to train human resources, especially in developing countries. 
International action in support of such efforts should be increased. 
22. His country welcomed the AgencyÂs work on combating disease, particularly the PACT 
programme, which should be intensified and given increased funding, and the establishment of the 
IAEA Nobel Cancer and Nutrition Fund. 
23. Egypt cooperated closely with the Agency on water resources management, in particular on the 
development of a programme of action for integrated management of the Nubian sandstone aquifer. It 
appreciated the AgencyÂs assistance in studying and assessing groundwater sources in the Saharan 
regions. 
24. He commended the steps taken by the Agency to improve the preparation of technical 
cooperation projects and stressed the importance of augmenting the practical benefits and long-term 
sustainability of such projects. It was to be hoped that the administrative restructuring of the technical 
cooperation programme would enable it to respond effectively to the growing number of projects and 
the increase in the number of developing Member States. There were many projects under way in 
Egypt in the areas of health, environmental protection, water management, pest control and 

GC(50)/OR.5

agriculture. A plan for optimum use of the countryÂs second research reactor had been developed in 
cooperation with the Agency and work on clearing Second World War landmines from the western 
desert was being intensified. Other projects involved the training of human resources Â not only 
Egyptians, but also staff from other Arab countries in cooperation with the Arab Atomic Energy 
Agency, and from African countries in cooperation with AFRA. 

25. He drew attention to the continued imbalance between the three pillars of the AgencyÂs 
mandate. A smaller proportion of financial resources from both the Regular Budget and 
extrabudgetary sources was allotted to the technical cooperation programme and technology transfer 
for development. That gave rise to a misguided image of the Agency as a body whose sole task 
consisted in implementing non-proliferation safeguards. More attention should be paid to the 
important developmental and economic dimensions of the AgencyÂs mandate. The negotiations on the 
resources in the TCF had clearly demonstrated the shortcomings in the AgencyÂs prioritization of its 
activities and the failure to attach the requisite importance to those aspects of its work. The whole 
issue needed to be reviewed in light of the fact that a majority of the AgencyÂs Member States 
accorded priority to technical cooperation. 
26. Turning to nuclear safety and security, he said that the continued improvement in nuclear power 
plant operational safety standards referred to in the Annual Report should not lead to a relaxation of 
efforts in that regard. The Agency should pay more attention to the development of human resources, 
to enhancing the ability of staff to improve the safety of research reactors, and to identifying the best 
disposal options for radioactive waste. The Agency should also assess the risks posed by radioactive 
waste from ageing reactors in the Middle East Â specifically in Israel Â that were not subject to 
safeguards, since they represented a serious threat to neighbouring countries. 
27. He welcomed the increase in the number of Member States that had ratified comprehensive 
safeguards agreements with the Agency and efforts to strengthen application of the SQP and make it 
more consistent with verification and non-proliferation goals. It was important to assess countriesÂ 
technical and operational capabilities, and variations in such capabilities, in the context of attempts to 
ensure the universal application of additional protocols. Before a country took on additional, and more 
costly and complex obligations, it should be clear that it was capable of implementing the required 
safeguards measures and complying with the relevant provisions. 
28. Egypt attached major importance to the use of improved technological capabilities and 
methodologies to detect undeclared nuclear material and activities. It requested more information 
regarding current research and future plans in that regard and more support for developing countries in 
implementing systems of accounting for and control of nuclear material. During 2006, Egypt had 
adopted a decision to restructure its nuclear material control and monitoring system with a view to 
modernizing and developing the application of Agency safeguards in the country. He requested the 
AgencyÂs assistance in training staff to manage the modernized system. 
29. While his country appreciated the action being taken to prevent the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons, it was troubled at continuing efforts to undermine the AgencyÂs role in promoting nuclear 
disarmament. 
30. He congratulated Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan on signing 
an agreement on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia. Egypt strongly supported the 
establishment of a similar zone in the Middle East and called on Israel to engage in serious and 
unequivocal cooperation with a view to achieving that goal. 
31. All countries were jointly responsible for strengthening the non-proliferation regime within the 
limits of their existing technical and economic capabilities. The developed countries, particularly the 
nuclear-weapon States, therefore bore a greater share of responsibility. The general tendency, 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20 
September 
2006, 
Page 
5 


however, was to impose more stringent rules and greater costs on non-nuclear-weapon States which 
had lived up to their responsibilities and demonstrated their commitment to the non-proliferation 
regime. There were two major threats to the regime. The first was the continued failure of the 
nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their obligations. Indeed some were developing their military nuclear 
capabilities. The second was the continued existence of military nuclear programmes and capabilities 
that were not covered by the NPT, particularly those of Israel which pursued a policy of nuclear 
ambiguity and openly relied on a nuclear deterrent policy while claiming that its conventional military 
capability exceeded that of all other countries in the region. Israel was a source of instability on 
account of its occupation of territory and its use of military force against civilians and civilian 
infrastructure. To achieve peace in the Middle East, a firm international commitment was needed to 
build a new security system founded on balance and mutual guarantees. Ridding the region of nuclear 
weapons would constitute an important first step in that direction. 

32. Although 15 years had passed since the General Conference had adopted a resolution calling on 
all States in the Middle East to apply full-scope safeguards, Israel and the major world powers had 
failed to take any step to achieve that goal, although Egypt and all other States in the region were 
parties to the NPT and were implementing safeguards. The continuance of that situation could lead to 
the collapse of the non-proliferation regime in the Middle East and the start of an arms race. He urged 
the General Conference to address the nuclear threat in the Middle East by adopting by consensus the 
draft resolution sponsored by Egypt concerning the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
region. Egypt viewed the adoption of a similar resolution by consensus at each session as a reflection 
of the international communityÂs commitment to well-known positions and principles regarding the 
achievement of peace, stability and security in the Middle East, and of its sincere wish to attain that 
goal. 
33. Mr. KAKODKAR (India) delivered the following message from the Indian Prime Minister, 
Dr. Manmohan Singh, on the occasion of the 50th session of the General Conference of the Agency: 
ÂI am happy to convey my greetings to members of the International Atomic Energy Agency, its 
Director General, and members of the IAEA Secretariat on the occasion of this 50th General 
Conference. Over the past five decades, the Agency has made commendable progress in 
fulfilling its objectives as laid down in its Statute. The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to 
Dr. ElBaradei and the Agency last year is a timely and well deserved tribute to the IAEAÂs 
contribution. 

ÂThe International Atomic Energy Agency is an unique organization in the entire UN system, 
founded on a strong science base and dedicated to spreading understanding of and knowledge 
about the benefits of atomic energy in a safe and secure manner, with special attention to those 
areas of the world where developmental needs and aspirations are yet to be fulfilled and are 
therefore most pressing. With issues related to energy resource sustainability assuming 
increasing salience and global climate change looming large as arguably the most serious 
challenge of our time, atomic energy with its immense energy potential and readily available 
and deployable technologies has become an inevitable and indispensable part of the solution. 

ÂNuclear energy, being unique in its ability to regenerate more fuel from uranium and thorium 
several tenfolds while producing energy, offers us the possibility of meeting global energy 
requirements in a non-polluting and sustainable manner. However, if we are to be successful in 
realizing the potential of the atom in meeting our needs, we need to act in concert consistent 
with the spirit of global harmony and adhering to our respective international commitments. The 
IAEA and Director General deserve high compliments for ensuring that the Agency is an 
effective platform for the global community to work together in its noble mission of Âatoms for 
peace and prosperityÂ.

ÂIndia, home to one sixth of the world population and having embarked on a rapid economic 
growth path, has a strong interest in utilizing the full potential of atomic energy for national 
development. I am confident this will be realized, based on our natural endowment of vast 
thorium resources and the development of effective technologies for their utilization. 

ÂWe have developed advanced technological capability based on our own self-reliant efforts, 
while having maintained an unblemished record of responsible behaviour. I am glad that the 
emerging possibility for expanding civil nuclear cooperation between India and the international 
community would supplement and complement our domestic efforts to meet the developmental 
aspirations of our people through additional nuclear energy inputs. We look forward to 
cooperating with international partners in realizing this possibility. 

ÂWhile nuclear power is of crucial importance for sustainable development, of equal 
significance are other peaceful applications of atomic energy. The AgencyÂs Programme of 
Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT) is one such important effort which I am happy to learn is 
being given special emphasis. India, having developed significant experience in affordable 
cancer-related programmes, has been supporting this activity actively and would be pleased to 
offer a recently developed cobalt-60 teletherapy machine (Bhabhatron) as a contribution to the 
AgencyÂs PACT. 

ÂIt is my hope that the fiftieth session of the General Conference would be an important 
milestone in the ongoing and future work of the Agency. I wish you all productive deliberations 
and progress in your important tasks. My greetings and good wishes to all.Â 

34. As well as being the 50th anniversary of the Agency, the current year was also the 50th year of 
the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, the premier nuclear research centre in India, and 
Dr. Homi Bhabha, the founder of the Indian atomic energy programme, had been the President of the 
first Geneva conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy held in 1955. 
35. The Government of India had recently approved a pre-project activity for eight reactor units at 
four different sites with a total power generation capacity of 6800 MW(e). With the completion of 
those units, along with other units already under construction, the total nuclear power generation 
capacity in India would reach around 14 000 MW(e). 
36. India considered a closed nuclear fuel cycle crucial to the implementation of its three-stage 
nuclear power programme with its long-term objective of tapping the vast energy available in the 
countryÂs thorium resources. The Indian Government was therefore committed to the development and 
deployment of technologies related to all aspects of a closed nuclear fuel cycle. 
37. India had made two major achievements in the current year in the field of high-level radioactive 
waste management technology: the hot commissioning of the advanced vitrification system which 
employed a Joule-heated ceramic melter; and the demonstration of cold crucible vitrification 
technology. 
38. Construction of the 500 MW(e) prototype fast breeder reactor was on schedule and it was 
expected to be commissioned by 2010. In keeping with IndiaÂs philosophy of using fuel efficiently by 
closing the fuel cycle, design and construction work had begun on a fuel cycle facility to cater for that 
reactor which would be commissioned by 2012. Many R&D programmes were being pursued in 
associated areas, such as advanced materials, structural mechanics, heat transport, in-service 
inspection systems, physics, chemistry and safety, in order to provide inputs for the further 
advancement of fast breeder reactor technology. That provided a strong foundation for IndiaÂs fast 
reactor programme. The country was also prepared to contribute to international efforts in that field as 
an equal partner with other countries with advanced technological capabilities.

39. Thorium utilization was the long-term core objective of the Indian nuclear programme to 
achieve energy independence on a sustainable basis. The third stage of the programme was thus based 
on the thoriumÂuranium-233 cycle. India was actively engaged in developing a 300 MW(e) advanced 
heavy water reactor whose design incorporated several features to meet the objectives for future 
advanced nuclear energy systems. A critical facility to validate that reactorÂs physics design would 
become functional in 2006. 
40. Indian scientists were also working on establishing an India-based neutrino observatory for 
comprehensive research in neutrino physics, an area in which Indian research groups had a sustained 
interest and to which they had made significant contributions. India would welcome the participation 
of international scientific groups in that effort. The Indus-2 2.5 GeV synchrotron radiation source 
which was being set up at the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology in Indore was now 
functioning. Utilization of the storage ring for condensed matter studies had also begun. 
41. The excellent safety record of Indian reactors and other facilities had been achieved through 
sustained R&D programmes. As part of the safety studies on nuclear containment structures, 
construction of a 1:4 scale containment model had begun at Tarapur. The ultimate load capacity of the 
containment would be studied using the test model and the experimental results would be made 
available to the participants in a round robin exercise. His country would welcome the participation of 
interested research groups in that exercise. 
42. A special event on assurances of supply and non-proliferation was being held during the current 
session of the General Conference. Less than half of the worldÂs 443 nuclear power reactors were 
under Agency safeguards. Even so, and with the very slow growth in nuclear power over the preceding 
two decades, the human and financial resources required for the implementation of safeguards had 
taken up a large proportion of the resources available to the Agency. With the anticipated rapid growth 
in demand for nuclear power, mainly in developing countries, cost-effective safeguards were essential 
so that the safeguards system could provide the necessary assurances without hindering the 
development of nuclear power. His country therefore felt it was necessary to look for institutional as 
well as technological solutions which enhanced proliferation resistance while guaranteeing an assured 
fuel supply, without adversely affecting the long-term sustainability of nuclear fuel resources. 
Thorium offered an important and attractive solution and he urged the Agency and its members to give 
the thorium route serious consideration. India had developed advanced capabilities in the utilization of 
thorium in a closed fuel cycle. It was convinced that that strategy for the countryÂs global long-term 
energy security was viable and sustainable. In a scenario where nuclear power provided a significant 
proportion of the energy supply in a world where everyone was assured of a minimum of 5000 kW.h 
of energy annually, the worldÂs uranium resources would only last a few decades if used in 
once-through mode. Even if a proliferation-resistant nuclear energy system that could address the need 
for the incineration of surplus plutonium became available in the shorter term, the use of thorium in 
reactors using proven technologies was vastly superior to other options based on fast reactors. In his 
presentation at the special event, he would be urging the Agency to boost activities that could lead to 
an early expansion of nuclear energy using, inter alia, a thorium-based fuel cycle. 
43. The Agency needed to maintain a balance between its promotional and safeguards-related 
activities. The problems caused by global climate change and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels were 
real and substantial and India believed that a future increase in the share of nuclear energy, as a clean 
energy source, was possible in a manner that satisfied the imperatives of nuclear safety and security. It 
therefore advocated the pooling of scientific and technological capabilities to find holistic solutions so 
that the next 50 years might come to be seen as a golden age of nuclear energy development, an 
endeavour in which his country was prepared to play its part. 
Mr. 
Soltanieh 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
took 
the 
Chair.

44. Mr. PETRIC (Slovenia) said that the AgencyÂs 50th anniversary provided an excellent 
opportunity to review its achievements and its efficiency and effectiveness in responding to the 
challenges of nuclear energy in the modern world. The professionalism of the Director General and the 
Secretariat and their impartiality had been justly rewarded with the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. 
45. Slovenia supported the work of the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within 
the Framework of the IAEA Statute. The Committee would have to deal with many complex technical, 
legal and political issues as it considered different options for strengthening the safeguards system and 
advised the Board thereon. The adoption of a sound work programme would pave the way for the 
CommitteeÂs success. Nuclear energy had potential for growth and some countries already had plans 
to introduce and expand nuclear power. Under the circumstances, the safeguards system provided the 
best possible assurances against misuse. 
46. Comprehensive safeguards agreements together with additional protocols were the current 
Agency verification standard. Without additional protocols, verification was limited and detection of 
undeclared nuclear activities and related material not easily possible. Over 100 NPT States Party still 
did not have an additional protocol in force and universal application of additional protocols should be 
a common goal. 
47. In playing its role in reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism, the Agency was making good 
efforts to establish resources and knowledge for the prevention and detection of and prompt response 
to malicious acts involving nuclear and radioactive material. Those activities were mainly financed 
from the extrabudgetary Nuclear Security Fund to which Slovenia had contributed Â23 000 in 2005. It 
had also hosted two regional training courses. His country had been among the first signatories of the 
International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, which was a welcome 
addition to the 12 existing counter-terrorism treaties because it recognized that nowhere was entirely 
safe from terrorists. It was important that the Convention receive widespread support and he urged 
those Member States which had not yet done so to sign and ratify it as soon as possible. 
48. A robust international legal framework was one of the prerequisites for using nuclear material, 
other radioactive substances and related facilities safely and securely. The amended CPPNM was one 
of the most important legal instruments in the field of nuclear security. As a party to that Convention, 
Slovenia had participated actively in the revision process. As it attached great importance to the 
enhanced international security regime in general and to physical protection in particular, it had 
prioritized the ratification of the amendments which was expected to be complete by mid-autumn 
2006. Universal adherence to relevant international instruments, the harmonization of national legal 
and regulatory frameworks and the effective application of relevant measures could make a decisive 
contribution to the prevention and detection of theft, sabotage, unauthorized access and other 
malicious acts involving nuclear material. He called on those Member States which had not already 
done so to adhere to the amended Convention. 
49. Slovenia attached great importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities, one 
important aspect of which was to provide developing Member States with the knowledge and 
resources they needed to establish independent and sustainable national nuclear programmes and 
institutions. Contributing to those goals should be seen as the main success criterion for a project. 
Project evaluation should try to identify successful projects that might benefit other countries or 
regions. As funding was limited and had to be used effectively, relaunching of successful projects in 
other countries should be encouraged, as only minimal changes to the project design would be 
required, the risk of failure would be reduced and the benefits maximized.

50. Slovenia had pledged its full share of the TCF for 2007 and was grateful to the co-chairmen of 
the working group, the Ambassadors of Sri Lanka and Norway, for having brought the difficult 
negotiations on the TCF target to a successful conclusion. 
51. As in preceding years, the Secretariat had submitted an updated report on progress with the 
ratification of the amendments to the AgencyÂs Statute agreed on in 1999 regarding the composition of 
the Board and biennial budgeting. Slovenia was among those States which had deposited instruments 
of acceptance at a very early stage and it endorsed the view that the entry into force of both 
amendments would greatly help enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Agency. He urged 
those Member States which had not yet done so to finalize their acceptance of the amendments. 
52. Slovenia recognized the SecretariatÂs efforts to establish a unified and coordinated incident and 
emergency response system which would constitute a focal point for Member States to report events 
and exchange information. The AgencyÂs Incident and Emergency Centre was only one component of 
the communication network, which also comprised contact points in Member States. The Secretariat 
had replaced the Emergency Response Network, ERNET, with the more service-oriented Response 
Assistance Network, RANET, which was in line with the International Action Plan for Strengthening 
the International Preparedness and Response System for Nuclear and Radiological Emergencies 
adopted by the Board in 2004. That action plan established guidelines for harmonizing response 
arrangements in the areas of notification, communication, dissemination of information, assistance and 
sustainability of the system. It was quite demanding, had been foreseen to last until 2009 and required 
some extrabudgetary funding. It had reached approximately the half-way point and its achievements 
should be assessed soon. 
53. His country frequently used OSART missions. In November 2005, a mission following up on 
that of 2003 Â the third since the KrÂko nuclear power plant had begun commercial operation in 
1983 Â had found that over two thirds of the recommendations had been fully implemented and 
significant progress had been made on the rest. The team had also noted that the plantÂs management 
was committed to nuclear safety and had been working to improve reliability of operation. 
54. Slovenia had participated actively in the second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste 
Management. Its practices described in its national report, such as involvement of the public in the 
siting process for low-and intermediate-level radioactive waste storage facilities, and a levy paid into 
the decommissioning fund based on the electrical power produced, had been well received. The review 
meeting had decided not to change the review process but had requested that national reports be more 
focused at the next meeting. All aspects of the review process would have to be analysed in the future. 
The Convention still had only a limited number of Contracting Parties and only 41 had participated in 
the review meeting, despite the fact that almost all States possessed radioactive waste. Slovenia 
strongly supported the SecretariatÂs efforts to encourage more States to adhere to the Convention by 
organizing regional workshops. 
55. With regard to the control of disused radioactive sources, his country had noticed a steady 
increase in the number of such sources in imported scrap metal shipments. It was therefore preparing a 
regulation requiring that all such shipments be subjected to radiological monitoring before entering the 
country. They would be returned if radioactivity was detected. 
56. SloveniaÂs initiative on regional repositories for high-level radioactive waste had been well 
received at the first review meeting under the Joint Convention but little progress had been made since 
then. The issue was a complex one, but there was increasing awareness of the need to resolve the 
problem of spent fuel.

57. His country was in the final stages of selecting a site for low-and intermediate-level radioactive 
waste disposal and expected to take a decision by the end of 2006, or in 2007 at the latest. Studies of 
site characteristics had been concluded and the public had been informed. 
58. Finally, nuclear energy might play an important role in SloveniaÂs plans to ensure a stable 
energy supply. 
59. Mr. OTHMAN (Syrian Arab Republic) said that the number of developing countries joining the 
Agency attested to the importance those countries attached to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in 
support of development. 
60. Congratulating the Agency and the Director General on being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, 
he said that the peoples of the Middle East aspired more than ever before to peace and security and 
would work hard to achieve a secure and peaceful future for their children. The items on application of 
IAEA safeguards in the Middle East and Israeli nuclear capabilities and threat had been on the General 
ConferenceÂs agenda for more than a decade. However, the Director General had been unable to 
discharge the mandate assigned to him by General Conference resolutions calling for the early 
application of comprehensive Agency safeguards to all countries in the region because one State had 
resisted the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East until such time as its so-called 
security conditions had been fulfilled. 
61. In July and August 2006, the world had witnessed one of the most brutal and savage wars in 
human history during which children, women and old people had been killed, LebanonÂs infrastructure 
had been destroyed, homes had been levelled with the occupants inside, and hundreds of thousands of 
people had been displaced, all on the pretext of maintaining IsraeliÂs security. In the light of IsraelÂs 
aggressive conduct in Lebanon and Palestine, the General Conference should discuss the two agenda 
items with the requisite gravity. Israel, which considered itself above international law, was quite 
prepared to resort to the most barbarous means to achieve its expansionist aims. Its possession of 
nuclear weapons without any international monitoring, and its refusal to accede to the NPT and to 
apply comprehensive Agency safeguards, undermined security and peace in the region and could 
trigger an arms race. He called on the major powers to compel Israel to comply with international law, 
using the kind of pressure that they brought to bear on other countries in the region. 
62. Article IV of the NPT recognized the sovereign and inalienable right of countries that 
voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. In return, the 
nuclear-weapon States had undertaken on a number of occasions to assist those countries in 
developing their peaceful nuclear capabilities. Their failure to act on that commitment raised questions 
as to its seriousness and credibility. The Syrian Government supported IranÂs sovereign right to 
possess nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and the right of countries in the region to be given 
assurances in that regard. The need to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East was 
more pressing than ever before. His Government urged the international community to stop applying 
double standards and to address the issue of IsraelÂs nuclear weapons. 
63. Participants in the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework 
of the IAEA Statute should show flexibility, transparency and objectivity in adopting 
recommendations and should avoid interfering with the aspirations of developing countries, in 
particular to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. As the Committee was advisory, its 
recommendations should be adopted by consensus. Developing countries were being denied access to 
nuclear technology on the pretext of non-proliferation. While his country strongly supported the 
non-proliferation regime, some countries could not be allowed to monopolize nuclear knowledge and 
technology at the expense of others.

64. Syria supported all initiatives aimed at preventing criminal and terrorist acts, particularly 
nuclear terrorism, which posed a major threat to the environment, health and property. It had recently 
acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and the 
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. 
65. His country also supported the conversion of civilian research reactors from HEU to LEU fuel, 
especially in the light of the growing threat of nuclear terrorism. However, countries should not have 
to bear the costs of such conversion since they had acquired the reactors at a time when the use of 
HEU fuel was the norm. 
66. Syria had fully complied with all its international obligations in respect of nuclear and radiation 
safety, the safe transport of radioactive material and the disposal of radioactive waste. It had signed the 
Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency, the 
Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and the Convention on Nuclear Safety. It also 
complied with the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources and had 
promulgated a national decree on the safety and security of such sources in 2005. 
67. He thanked the Agency for the guidance it had provided on the design of technical cooperation 
projects in accordance with the new PCMF and requested it to organize a workshop for users. 
68. Two years previously, the principle of national cost-sharing had been adopted as part of a 
package deal that would increase the resources available for both technical cooperation and 
safeguards. He called for a review of the arrangements for payment of NPCs before the projects 
approved for the new cycle were implemented. The Agency froze all components of projects until 
2.5% of total national core funding for the first year had been paid, a process that took more than three 
months in some countries. As an alternative, account could be taken of a countryÂs past financial 
relationship with the Agency. The application of the cost-sharing principle to regional and 
interregional projects should also be reviewed. 
69. During the preceding year, Syria had hosted 18 trainees specializing in various fields and had 
held 4 training courses. In 2006, it had hosted 6 regional courses under regional and ARASIA projects. 
Seven researchers from the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission had made available their expertise in 
radiation technology, the safety of radioactive sources and environmental radiation monitoring. In 
2005, Syria had allocated more than US $50 000 for the translation into Arabic of teaching and 
training materials, and books and brochures on nuclear technology. It had also contributed $300 000 to 
the national project on the production of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals using a 
cyclotron. 
70. The member States of ARASIA had submitted four regional cooperation projects for the next 
cycle and had implemented three projects that had proved to be of great benefit to the participants. The 
Syrian Atomic Energy Commission was still providing the secretariat for ARASIA, easing the 
financial burden on the Agency. 
71. The AgencyÂs PACT programme was one of its most important programmes in the area of 
human health. Syria strongly supported the decision to establish a cancer control alliance with a 
number of leading international and national organizations, in keeping with the principle of 
partnership for development. He urged donor countries to make financial contributions and 
contributions in kind to ensure the successful implementation of the programme and thanked the 
Agency for donating its share of the Nobel Peace Prize to the IAEA Nobel Cancer and Nutrition Fund. 
However, the Agency should review the funding procedures for programmes of that kind, since 
over-dependence on donations could have an adverse impact on implementation.

72. Finally, the Arabic-language masterÂs degree course on radiation protection and safety of 
radioactive sources, run jointly by the Agency, the Syrian Atomic Energy Commission and Damascus 
University, was beginning its seventh academic year that week. More than 150 students had graduated 
during the preceding six years. 
73. Mr. SMITH (Australia) said that, as one of the small number of States which had gathered 
together over 50 years previously to draft the Statute, his country had had a long and fruitful 
involvement with the Agency and was proud to have contributed to its mission since its inauguration. 
74. Australia was a major contributor to the advancement of peaceful nuclear applications and had a 
significant nuclear science and technology base, including that associated with the state-of-the-art 
open pool Australian light water (OPAL) research reactor which was currently undergoing hot 
commissioning in Sydney by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). 
OPAL would shortly be providing neutrons to a world-class neutron scattering and diffraction facility, 
and for the production of medical isotopes. Australia saw it as a regional facility for nuclear 
applications in health, biology, engineering and nutrition. Thus, it had encouraged other countries in 
the region to invest jointly in neutron beam instruments and looked forward to developing 
collaborative programmes in areas of importance to its partners. 
75. His country made a substantial contribution to the TCF and supported the ongoing reform of the 
technical cooperation programme to strengthen its effectiveness. It also provided significant 
extrabudgetary funding to the RCA and was engaged in a range of bilateral nuclear cooperation 
activities. 
76. The AgencyÂs safeguards system, developed to provide assurances of the exclusively peaceful 
nature of nuclear programmes, had been remarkably successful but had faced serious challenges. 
Australia would continue to work to ensure that Agency safeguards kept pace with nuclear 
proliferation challenges and responded to current concerns. It supported strongly the Advisory 
Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework of the IAEA Statute which should, 
together with the Board, grasp the opportunity to ensure that the Agency had access to the full range of 
measures it needed to fulfil its verification mandate. Weaknesses in the safeguards system were being 
remedied by the application of strengthened safeguards, in particular the additional protocol which 
improved the AgencyÂs capacity to detect undeclared nuclear material and activities. States with 
significant nuclear activities still outside the strengthened safeguards system were out of step with the 
overwhelming majority. Adherence to the additional protocol was the best way to ensure the long-term 
effectiveness of Agency safeguards and Australia was working with the organization and other 
countries to provide assistance to other States in the Asia-Pacific region with application of the 
additional protocol. 
77. His country was also involved in developing closer regional collaboration to improve the 
effectiveness of nuclear safeguards and physical protection. Such important work would become even 
more significant as other countries in the region explored the nuclear power option. Australia had 
worked with the Agency for two decades to host regional training courses on the effective operation of 
SSACs, including a special SSAC course in 2006 for Iraqi Government officials held at the request of 
the AgencyÂs Department of Safeguards. Also in 2006, in collaboration with the Agency and the 
United States Department of Energy, his country had hosted a second regional course on the physical 
protection of nuclear material and facilities. It had worked with the Agency and the Japanese and 
United States Governments to hold a regional seminar on multilateral verification which had attracted 
65 participants from 26 countries, and it would continue to provide practical support to the Agency 
through those and other means.

78. A key factor in the successful development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes was 
commitment and adherence to international standards for nuclear safety and security, including those 
set out in the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, the Code of Conduct on the Safety 
and Security of Radioactive Sources and the Code of Conduct on the Safety of Research Reactors. His 
country was pleased to support the adoption of the AgencyÂs Safety Fundamentals, which were an 
important step in demonstrating the unity of radiation protection and nuclear safety. 
79. Australia had welcomed the conclusion of the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism in 2005 and had been among the first group of States to sign it. Its 
contributions to the Nuclear Security Fund and the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of 
Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction illustrated the importance that it attached to ensuring that 
the threat of nuclear terrorism never became a reality. Australia was also a partner in the Global 
Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, which aimed to improve nuclear accounting, control and 
protection and ensure the effective prosecution of nuclear terrorists, inter alia. 
80. His country took seriously the potential threat posed by high-activity radioactive sources, 
including during their legitimate shipment as part of international trade. It was pleasing to see 
increasing international support for the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive 
Sources and its supplementary Guidance on the Import and Export of Radioactive Sources. States that 
had not yet adhered to those standards should do so. His country was working to implement the 
Guidance nationally and strongly supported the establishment of a mechanism to enable States to share 
their experiences in implementing the Code. Australia had participated in regional initiatives to reduce 
the risks posed by vulnerable radioactive sources and acknowledged the benefits of cooperation with 
the Agency and the United States National Nuclear Security Administration in that regard. 
81. Around the world, public concerns about the safety of radioactive waste management continued 
to hamper the development of the nuclear industry. Australia had been pleased to participate in the 
second review meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel 
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management in May 2006 and had been 
particularly heartened by the steps taken by a number of important nuclear States to join that 
Convention. Almost all States, regardless of whether they had a nuclear power programme, had some 
form of radioactive waste to manage and those that had not yet done so should adhere to the 
Convention. The continued safety of nuclear installations in all regions of the world was of 
fundamental importance. Regional cooperation and information exchange were an important part of 
that process and Australia was pleased to support the goals of the Asian Nuclear Safety Network, the 
Steering Committee of which it currently chaired. 
82. Developments in the global energy market had renewed interest in nuclear power generation as 
a technology that could help meet growing electricity needs without price fluctuations, supply 
uncertainties or the environmental costs associated with fossil fuels. Nuclear power had a role to play 
in delivering significant baseload power with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Australia had helped 
develop the groundbreaking Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, bringing 
together for the first time key industries of developed and developing countries to promote practical 
efforts. Nuclear energy had been identified in the PartnershipÂs vision statement as an area for possible 
future collaboration. 
83. The provision of uranium for peaceful purposes was one of the main ways in which Australia 
gave effect to its Article IV commitment under the NPT to facilitate peaceful applications of nuclear 
energy. It was a major supplier to the global nuclear power industry and held approximately 40% of 
the worldÂs known low-cost uranium reserves. In 2005, it had exported over 12 000 tonnes of uranium 
ore concentrate and accounted for 23% of world primary uranium production. However, Australian

uranium producers had encountered difficulties in securing reliable commercial shipping, even though 
it was very much in the interest of uranium consumers to help ensure the availability of such services. 

84. AustraliaÂs uranium export policy recognized the strategic significance that distinguished 
uranium from other energy commodities. The country exported uranium only to States party to the 
NPT that had signed bilateral safeguards agreements setting conditions for the use of Australian 
material. In 2005, it had announced its intention to make the additional protocol a condition for its 
supply of uranium to non-nuclear-weapon States. Its most recent bilateral safeguards treaty was with 
China. AustraliaÂs safeguards agreements formed part of the global system of interlocking and 
mutually reinforcing mechanisms that comprised the nuclear non-proliferation regime. Australian 
policies had ensured that a very significant proportion of nuclear material in international use was 
covered by the strictest non-proliferation conditions. 
85. The Australian Government had established a task force to review uranium mining and 
processing and the potential contribution of nuclear energy in Australia. The review would cover a 
wide range of issues, including the countryÂs capacity to increase uranium mining and exports, the 
potential for establishing other steps in the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia, the extent to which nuclear 
energy could contribute to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, the potential of next-generation 
nuclear energy technologies, and security issues relating to nuclear energy. The task force was 
expected to report by the end of 2006. 
86. A consistent concern in framing AustraliaÂs domestic nuclear policy had been to maintain and 
strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime. Australia had been one of the strongest 
supporters of the NPT as the centrepiece of that regime, which was reinforced by the CTBT. 
AustraliaÂs Foreign Minister was currently jointly chairing a ministerial meeting on the CTBT to 
encourage support for its entry into force. His country was pleased that there was almost universal 
commitment to the CTBT as an effective measure for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. The 
Treaty had been signed by 176 countries, 135 of which had ratified it. Australia was also encouraged 
by the work of the CTBTO Preparatory Commission to establish its verification regime and 
recognized the potential of the International Monitoring System to contribute to disaster alert efforts. 
87. A fissile material cut-off treaty would impose a quantitative limit on the amount of fissile 
material available for weapons use. His country was working to overcome entrenched differences in 
the Conferences on Disarmament which were blocking a start to negotiations on such a treaty. It had 
been a long-standing supporter of nuclear-weapon-free zones as a means of enhancing regional 
security and reinforcing global nuclear non-proliferation. 
88. Ensuring an effective non-proliferation regime required effective control over the spread of 
proliferation-sensitive technologies. That was being pursued institutionally through development of an 
appropriate international framework, and technically through the development of 
proliferation-resistant technologies. Ideas in that regard included multilateral fuel supply assurances, 
spent fuel take-back, international fuel cycle centres and criteria for assessing the international 
acceptability of national projects. The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership drew a number of those 
ideas together and provided an opportunity for further discussion. 
89. Australia had a long record of demonstrating strong support for the rights of NPT Parties to 
benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. However, those rights were not unqualified and did 
not automatically extend to proliferation-sensitive technologies. The peaceful uses of nuclear energy 
had to be in conformity with non-proliferation and verification requirements under Articles I, II and 
III of the NPT. The question as to whether development of uranium enrichment and processing was 
consistent with the TreatyÂs non-proliferation objectives depended on many factors, including 
non-proliferation credentials and clear economic or nuclear fuel cycle justification. Australia was an 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20

15 


active participant in the international dialogue on sensitive nuclear technology issues and would 
continue to follow those issues closely, not only from the non-proliferation perspective but also in 
view of its role as a major uranium supplier. 

90. The international security environment had changed markedly, with proliferators resorting to 
ever more sophisticated methods. Vigilance was required against those who sought to undermine 
efforts in good faith to bring the benefits of peaceful nuclear applications to the world. The AgencyÂs 
investigative work had an important role to play in stamping out the pernicious nuclear black market 
and addressing the changing and developing proliferation threats. Deliberate violations had to be dealt 
with firmly. It should be recognized that States which wilfully violated safeguards obligations cut 
themselves off by their own actions from the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation. 
91. The DPRKÂs claim that it had nuclear weapons was a grave challenge to international security. 
Australia was seriously concerned by that countryÂs ongoing refusal to re-engage in the six-party talks, 
which remained the most appropriate mechanism for finding a peaceful and lasting solution to the 
DPRK nuclear issue. That countryÂs provocative action in conducting ballistic missile tests in July 
2006 had served to increase concerns, but the subsequent united and strong resolve shown by the 
international community in the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 1695 (2006), 
had sent a clear message to it. Only by making the strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons and 
reaffirm its moratorium on ballistic missile tests could the DPRK begin the process of repairing the 
harm it had done to its own interests and those of its long-suffering people. Australia urged the DPRK 
to take that step. 
92. Iran was still pursuing a full nuclear fuel cycle without convincing justification. Following 
18 years of clandestine nuclear activity and more than 3 years of Agency investigations, key questions 
remained about the nature and intentions of IranÂs nuclear programme. The international community 
had hoped that the matter would be resolved through the adoption of Security Council 
resolution 1696 (2006). By persisting with its enrichment programme in the face of that resolution, 
Iran had breached an obligation with the binding force of international law. It should suspend all 
enrichment-related and reprocessing activities without delay, thus upholding the authority of the 
Security Council and the Agency. It was not too late to find a diplomatic solution, but Iran should not 
lose sight of the seriousness of the choices it had to make. It should act in accordance with the 
provisions of the additional protocol and implement immediately all the transparency measures 
requested by the Agency in support of its ongoing investigations. The right choices would set Iran on 
the path to a future as a respected member of the international community, reaping the benefits of 
constructive international relationships. 
93. Mr. LAMAMRA (Algeria) said that the Director GeneralÂs commitment to the cause of Atoms 
for Peace and sustainable development, and the efforts of the AgencyÂs Secretariat and its Member 
States, had been justly recognized by the award of the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize. The AgencyÂs 50th 
anniversary provided an opportunity to assess how well it had met its objectives and the challenges it 
had yet to overcome. Algeria had consistently supported the Agency in its work and would continue to 
do so. 
94. International cooperation in the nuclear field was very important for developing countries which 
faced many problems, particularly in the fields of human health, food security, water resources and 
energy. The Agency had a unique mandate for knowledge dissemination and technology transfer to 
promote socio-economic development and his country supported its activities under all three pillars of 
its Statute. 
95. Algeria supported the AgencyÂs unique verification role. The international priority accorded to 
non-proliferation should not, however, overshadow the need to work towards disarmament as 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20 
September 
2006, 
Page 
16 


stipulated in Article VI of the NPT. Little progress had been made with respect to the commitment 
entered into by the nuclear-weapon States at the 2000 NPT Review Conference to eliminate their 
nuclear arsenals. The failure of the 2005 NPT Review Conference, the lack of any reference to 
disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation in the final document of the United Nations World 
Summit, the continual stalling of the deliberations in the Conference on Disarmament and the slow 
progress towards the ratification of the CTBT all sent out negative messages regarding respect for the 
fundamental principles determining the future of global security. As a strong supporter of the 
promotion of nuclear energy for peace and development, Algeria was convinced that strengthening of 
the non-proliferation regime should go hand in hand with measures to speed up nuclear disarmament. 
It urged all States to redouble their efforts to reverse the current negative trends and to create 
favourable conditions for the effective implementation of international commitments. It welcomed 
AfricaÂs contribution to the universalization of the NPT and to the strengthening of the disarmament 
and non-proliferation regime through the significant increase in the number of States which had 
ratified the Pelindaba Treaty establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Africa. 

96. The war of aggression waged by Israel against Lebanon in 2006 highlighted the need for the 
international community to strive for peace and move away from power politics which led to the 
denial of the self-determination of the Palestinian people, the occupation of territories, abuse of force 
and the promotion of doctrines of Âmass dissuasionÂ against States in the Middle East, which did not 
rule out recourse to nuclear weapons. That need was underlined in the resolutions of the General 
Conference and Board of Governors urging all States in the region without exception to submit all 
nuclear activities to the AgencyÂs verification system and to consider seriously taking all the practical 
measures required to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. 
97. Algeria supported efforts to combat all forms of terrorism, including malicious acts involving 
nuclear facilities and material. It shared the concern that nuclear weapons might fall into the hands of 
non-State actors and saw that as another reason to work resolutely towards nuclear disarmament. In 
that connection, his country took note of the Nuclear Security Plan for 2006Â2009, adopted by the 
Board of Governors in September 2005, and the AgencyÂs Medium Term Strategy for 2006Â2011. The 
guidance and recommendations issued on the safety and security of nuclear material and sources were 
useful for Member States, which held the primary responsibility in that area. Algeria had indicated its 
willingness to follow the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources. It had 
also signed the amendments to the CPPNM and the International Convention for the Suppression of 
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. 
98. His country attached importance to the universality of the multilateral nuclear non-proliferation 
and disarmament regime. Following the decision by the Board of Governor to authorize the Director 
General to conclude an additional protocol with Algeria, a programme of activities had been agreed 
upon with the Agency to strengthen national technical capacity, including the organization of a 
national seminar on the additional protocol so that Algeria could meet its new verification 
commitments. His country was grateful for the trust that had been placed in it by inviting its Resident 
Representative to chair the Advisory Committee on Safeguards and Verification within the Framework 
of the IAEA Statute. It was anxious to preserve the inalienable right of States to the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy granted by Article IV of the NPT and would follow with interest the special event on 
assurances of supply. 
99. All international peace and security issues should be resolved through dialogue and cooperation. 
As the only organization with the mandate to verify Member StatesÂ compliance with 
non-proliferation commitments, the Agency was the appropriate framework in which to address the 
implementation of safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran. He praised the professional work of the 
Agency and its Director General on that issue and urged all the parties concerned to negotiate in

earnest on the offer of the five permanent United Nations Security Council members and Germany in 
the interests of peace. 

100. It was some years since the amendments to Article VI of the AgencyÂs Statute expanding the 
composition of the Board had been adopted and Agency membership had increased further over that 
time. He urged all Member States which had not already done so to ratify the amendments in order to 
ensure that the Board reflected the number and diversity of the AgencyÂs members. 
101. Algeria attached particular importance to the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities which 
fulfilled one of the statutory objectives of the organization, namely to promote the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy in line with Article IV of the NPT. AlgeriaÂs programme of cooperation with the 
Agency reflected the priorities of its GovernmentÂs five-year plan for 2005Â2009, which aimed at 
economic revival and conservation of natural resources. The objective was to meet the growing needs 
of industry, agriculture and stockbreeding, and society as a whole, which placed great demands on the 
energy sector. The implementation rate had been approximately 80% in 2005. Algeria would be 
making a voluntary contribution to the TCF for 2007. 
102. His country supported the AgencyÂs work in such areas as human health, use of isotope 
hydrology for water resources management, energy development and seawater desalination, human 
resources development, and nuclear knowledge preservation. Courses on positron emission 
tomography had been held in Algiers with the participation of Agency experts. AlgeriaÂs secondary 
standards dosimetry laboratory had been approved as a designated regional centre for francophone 
Africa in July 2006. He also thanked the Agency for the training fellowships and scientific visits 
awarded to Algerian scientists and experts. 
103. The Secretariat was to be commended on the introduction of the new technical cooperation 
programming framework and the restructuring of the Department of Technical Cooperation. The rate 
of implementation for programmes in Africa had been over 77% in 2005, which demonstrated the 
increasing interest of African countries in the AgencyÂs technical cooperation activities and the 
commitment of recipient institutions to them. Algeria was committed to strengthening TCDC and 
supported AFRA. It was also grateful to the Agency for its contribution to and support for NEPAD 
activities. 
104. A regional seminar on the use of nuclear techniques to combat locusts had been held in Algiers 
in July 2006. Algeria was grateful to the Agency and FAO for their involvement in that event and 
urged them to make the necessary arrangements to implement the action plan adopted. Her country 
was home to the African Energy Commission and urged the Agency to work on consolidating the 
progress made under the project on sustainable energy development in Africa, applying the energy 
planning models developed by the Agency; and to work on establishing preferential cooperation with 
the Commission. It welcomed the AgencyÂs efforts to help African countries, through AFRA, to 
develop a regional programme on national strategies for optimizing human resources based on the 
recommendations of a high-level technical meeting in Algiers. An African Union summit on science 
and technology for development would be held in January 2007 and the Agency had been asked to 
help organize a regional conference in Algiers in mid-January 2007 on the contribution of nuclear 
energy to peace and sustainable development. 
105. Mr. MÃRQUEZ MARÃN (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) said that the Agency had earned a 
good reputation over the preceding 50 years and faced new challenges after having received deserved 
recognition in the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005. His country supported the AgencyÂs 
activities and believed that its role in the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons should be strengthened. Fifty years ago, the benefits of nuclear 
technology had been overshadowed by its destructive power, as demonstrated in the bombs that 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20

2006,

18 


destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Following the destruction wrought by wars in the preceding 
century, the world wished to live in peace, free of the threat posed by the arsenals of the select club of 
nuclear powers. Developing countries had gained some benefits from the peaceful uses of nuclear 
energy through the AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme, though more still needed to be done in 
that area. As the verification authority for the NPT, the Agency had made an important contribution 
and its credibility had been strengthened by its declaration that there was no evidence of nuclear 
weapons in Iraq, despite the pressure exerted by the United States of America. Thus, the Agency had 
proved a genuinely multilateral organization and his country would continue to support it. 

106. While the NPT had dissuaded some States from nuclear weapons proliferation, it had not had 
the desired effect with respect to nuclear disarmament owing to the TreatyÂs limited scope. The CTBT 
also aimed at ensuring the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. However, 10 years after its opening 
for signature it had still not entered into force, essentially because the United States refused to ratify it. 
107. The inalienable right of States to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology, including 
the entire fuel cycle, was enshrined in the NPT. However, some States with nuclear knowledge and 
technology were claiming the right to absolute control over the production, processing and supply of 
nuclear fuel. They applied double standards, granting some countries the right to such technologies 
where it suited their interests and denying it to others on the grounds that there was a danger of 
diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful uses. Among the latter were States which complied with 
their NPT obligations such as the Islamic Republic of Iran. At its 14th Summit in Havana, Cuba, in 
September 2006, the NAM had reaffirmed the basic and inalienable right of all States to develop 
research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It had denounced the monopoly 
on nuclear technology, the double standards applied, and attempts by States which possessed and 
developed nuclear weapons to prevent others from using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The 
Agency was the only competent authority to verify compliance with safeguards commitments and 
should not be subjected to pressure which would jeopardize its efficiency and credibility. Therefore 
negotiations should be held between the EU and Iran on terms which were fair and acceptable to all 
parties. Venezuela welcomed IranÂs statement confirming its commitment to the exclusively peaceful 
use of nuclear energy, to finding a negotiated solution and to cooperating with the Agency on 
outstanding issues. It rejected the proposal of some United Nations Security Council members to apply 
sanctions before the Agency had made a definitive statement regarding possible diversion. His country 
also urged Israel to begin negotiations on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the 
Middle East, especially in the wake of the recent Lebanon conflict. 
108. Non-proliferation and disarmament were inseparable and equally important for world peace and 
stability. The NPT should therefore be strengthened to make disarmament a reality. 
109. Venezuela had met its financial obligations to the Agency despite the sacrifice that entailed for a 
developing country. It participated in ARCAL and hoped to see an increase in the number of projects 
in the region to strengthen South-South cooperation within the framework of the Agency. Venezuela 
currently held the Vice-Presidency of ARCAL and had offered to host the next regional event in the 
first half of 2007. 
110. Cancer claimed many victims who could have benefited from early treatment, particularly in 
developing countries. The PACT programme could make a significant contribution in that area and his 
country therefore supported the proposal to waive the relevant financial regulation so that those 
countries wishing to do so could contribute their share of the 2004 cash surplus to that programme. 
111. Ms. DRÃBOVÃ (Czech Republic) said that anniversaries provided an opportunity for 
considering original intentions and motivations in the light of current needs and trends. The main 
reason for founding the Agency had been to ensure the peaceful use of nuclear material and

technology. President Eisenhower had envisaged an international agency which could supply fissile 
material and peaceful technology, ensure their safety and security and perform overall accounting. 
Then the time had not been ripe for such an approach. Now the issue of supply of fissile material was 
being addressed again in the context of multilateral approaches to the fuel cycle. 

112. It had taken half a decade to establish the Agency, another 5 years to build a minimal safeguards 
system replacing bilateral agreements, and over two decades to put in place a comprehensive system 
taking into account the whole fuel cycle. Comprehensive accounting and control of fissile material 
based on the additional protocol was now the minimum requirement. 
113. In the face of the threat of nuclear terrorism, it was a safer option to convert potentially 
dangerous material into a form for peaceful use. Her country had been among the first to adopt 
practical measures to return high-enriched fuel to its country of origin. It had replaced the 
high-enriched fuel in its training reactor with low-enriched fuel under a trilateral initiative run by the 
United States, the Russian Federation and the Agency. The next step was to return high-enriched spent 
fuel from research reactors designed and manufactured by the former Soviet Union to its country of 
origin. 
114. It had been envisaged that the Agency would supply Member States with reactors or even power 
plants, but very few such projects had been implemented both for political reasons and because of the 
commercialization of the nuclear industry. Efforts were currently focused on smaller projects under 
the technical cooperation programme which was a powerful tool for transferring modern technologies. 
115. The AgencyÂs numerous databases, nuclear safety standards, training services and reporting 
mechanisms under safety-related conventions contributed to nuclear knowledge exchange. The Czech 
Republic appreciated the technical support the Agency provided to Member States to help them 
implement their obligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety and Joint Convention on the 
Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. 
116. Research had initially been a less important Agency activity. Basic nuclear research currently 
focused on high-energy particle physics. Applied research could be divided, on the one hand, into 
secret military research and, on the other, the development of new civil technologies in commercial 
establishments either in the field of nuclear power or medical and industrial applications of isotopes. 
Knowledge exchange was generally restricted by commercial interests. 
117. Her country valued the AgencyÂs indispensable verification role. The safeguards system 
provided assurances of the peaceful nature of nuclear activities and considerably reduced illegal 
transfers of nuclear material and equipment. It could be improved by making Annex II of the 
additional protocol even stricter to reflect changes in nuclear proliferation, science and technology, 
and by integrating international safeguards with nuclear export controls. The Czech Republic 
supported all efforts to modernize the safeguards system. 
118. The former Czechoslovakia had been a founder member of the Agency and had played an 
important role thanks to its industrial and scientific capacity and significant uranium resources. She 
paid tribute to Dr. Winkler, the first Chairman of the Board of Governors, for his negotiating skills and 
his contribution to the formulation of the Statute. Many other Czechs and Slovaks had contributed 
their expertise to the AgencyÂs work. 
119. Global support for the development of nuclear power was currently increasing owing to the 
vulnerability of fossil fuel supplies. The AgencyÂs focus on power plants in the early years had yielded 
to a focus on nuclear safety and security, especially after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl 
accidents. The Agency had played a leading role in establishing globally applicable safety standards.

The latest step in that process had been the approval in September 2006 of a consolidated set of 
Fundamental Safety Principles. 

120. Non-power applications were also important and the Czech Republic was ready to offer 
cooperation and assistance in the establishment of the necessary legal and regulatory framework and in 
the utilization of health applications. Although its main interest was in Europe, the Czech Republic 
also sponsored four national and regional technical cooperation projects in different parts of the world 
through voluntary extrabudgetary contributions. It was currently working with the Secretariat on a 
specific project for Montenegro under the PACT programme as one way of repaying the assistance it 
had received while building its first PET centre almost ten years previously. 
121. Looking to the future, her country was ready to cooperate in the further strengthening of 
non-proliferation and verification. In the nuclear safety field, it was very active in European 
harmonization and standardization activities. However, a comprehensive set of nuclear safety 
standards based on worldwide expertise could only be developed within the Agency. Finally, the 
Czech Republic believed that the AgencyÂs future lay not in the coordination of large research projects 
but in the day-to-day support of young people who did not have adequate incentives to study science. 
Interest could be stimulated by enhancing background knowledge through international educational 
activities or through the provision of advanced equipment for laboratories. 
122. Ms. LACANLALE (Philippines) said that 2007 would mark the 50th anniversary of the 
PhilippinesÂ membership of the Agency. Although the country had a modest nuclear energy 
programme, it had gained much from its relationship with the organization, especially through 
technical cooperation. The Agency had become an important partner for the Philippines in achieving 
the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Its technical cooperation programme had helped 
the country, in particular, to increase agricultural and industrial productivity and to gain access to 
clean drinking water. She thanked the Department of Technical Cooperation for its valuable support. 
123. In the area of the environment, the Philippines was participating in the AgencyÂs collaborating 
centre scheme. In 2005, the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute had been designated a collaborating 
centre for marine toxicity studies. It was undertaking pioneering research using nuclear techniques on 
saxitoxin, the red tide toxin, a marine organism of economic importance to the countryÂs fishermen. 
The expertise developed by the Institute in marine environmental studies had led to its active 
involvement in the formulation of a regional collaborative project run by the RCA Regional Office 
and the UNDP on the mitigation of the coastal impact of natural disasters like tsunamis using nuclear 
and isotope-based techniques. The Philippines was serving as the coordinator for that project. Soil 
studies were also being carried out under technical cooperation programmes at both regional and 
national level to measure erosion rates. 
124. The Philippines was the worldÂs second largest geothermal energy producer, thanks in part to 
nuclear and stable isotope-based techniques that had contributed significantly to a better understanding 
of the countryÂs geothermal resources. The Philippine National Oil Company served as a regional 
resource unit for the RCA in that field. 
125. Through the Agency-funded project on air quality control management, the Philippine Nuclear 
Research Institute was able to contribute actively to national air quality status reports and serve a 
growing number of clients requiring assistance with air pollution-related concerns. The Institute had 
recently performed an analysis of air filters for the Office of Atoms for Peace in Thailand. The 
anticipated acquisition of an OC/EC analyser would bring an increased understanding of pollutants, 
which would in turn help decision-makers develop appropriate national policies. The Institute might 
even strive to provide analytical services as a regional resource unit.

126. In the area of agriculture, the Philippines took pride in being able to cultivate expertise in the 
SIT through national, regional, and coordinated research projects. That expertise covered a range of 
areas from basic research to technology transfer. Her country had demonstrated the effectiveness of 
the SIT in lowering the population of fruit flies in a mango-growing island in the central Philippines, 
which had improved the competitiveness of the countryÂs mangoes on the international market. The 
capability developed locally also allowed the country to receive fellows and scientific visitors from 
other Member States and had enabled it to send two missions to South Africa to assist in the latterÂs 
project on expanding use of the SIT against fruit pests in the Western and Northern Cape. 
127. In the field of water resources management and protection, the Agency-funded project on 
isotope applications was gaining recognition from local water districts in the Philippines, particularly 
in the critical urbanized areas. 
128. As a founding member of the RCA, the Philippines continued to participate actively in the RCA 
programme, contributing expertise in the areas of health, agriculture and the environment while 
enhancing its capabilities through training and scientific exchange in the industry and energy field. 
129. Radiotherapy and nuclear medicine centres had been developed in the Philippines through the 
AgencyÂs technical cooperation programme and the RCA programme. The country could now host 
training courses and send experts to and receive fellows from RCA member States and from other 
regions. In 2006, a second distance learning programme had been launched for 30 local nuclear 
medicine technologists, making use of the training materials developed under the RCA. 
130. In early 2006, the Philippines had hosted a training course on cancer management which had 
brought together 67 radiation oncologists and 30 medical physicists who were actively involved in the 
management of common cancers in the region. 
131. In view of the several radiotherapy facilities the country had with 3D conformal/IMRT 
capability, the Philippines was very interested in joining the study on 3D conformal radiotherapy and 
IMRT to be conducted by the Agency and the RCA. 
132. The forty-ninth session of the General Conference had agreed that PACT was a priority activity 
in view of the alarming rise in the incidence of cancer worldwide, particularly in developing countries. 
The Philippines welcomed the decision of the Board of Governors to contribute part of the Nobel 
Peace Prize to that programme and thanked all donor States for their contributions. However, PACT 
still required more funds to make it operational. It was hoped that a compromise solution could be 
reached to allow Member States wishing to contribute to the programme to do so. 
133. The Philippines endorsed the Director GeneralÂs view that the Agency should focus more 
explicitly on energy for development. Like many countries that depended on fossil fuel for their 
development requirements, the Philippines knew full well the social and economic consequences of 
rising oil prices and energy shortages. That was why it was seeking to develop alternative sources of 
energy and had taken a keen interest in cooperation on energy security. It did not discount nuclear 
power as an energy option for the future, but that option depended upon adequate solutions to several 
concerns, including cost, nuclear waste disposal, security and, above all, safety. The word ÂnuclearÂ 
still elicited fear in the minds of many Filipinos, especially in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. 
It was therefore important that the Agency sustain its activities to improve public awareness of the 
safety and the developmental benefits and advantages of nuclear energy, especially among decisionmakers 
and advocacy groups. 
134. With regard to nuclear safety and security, the Philippines was fully committed to implementing 
the AgencyÂs Safety Fundamentals, safety standards, safety requirements and safety guides. The 
country was seriously contemplating a TranSAS mission in order to receive an expert assessment of 

GC(50)/OR.5 
20

22 


and advice on the Philippine transport regulatory infrastructure and implementation of the AgencyÂs 
transport regulations. 

135. The PhilippinesÂ research reactor was being prepared for decommissioning and was being used 
as a demonstration site and host facility to allow technicians and experts from Member States to learn 
various techniques used in the decommissioning process. The country looked forward to the 
completion of the project. 
136. Her country adhered to the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, 
and to its supplementary Guidance on the Import and Expert of Radioactive Sources. It had 
participated in the conference to consider and adopt amendments to the CPPNM and was working 
towards the ratification of those amendments. It was vital to prevent belligerent non-State actors such 
as terrorists from acquiring the means and materials to use nuclear and radioactive material for 
non-peaceful purposes. 
137. The Philippines was keen to maintain high standards of safety in nuclear facilities. The 
ratification of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of 
Radioactive Waste Management would remain a priority for the Philippine Government, especially 
given the increasing number of nuclear power plants in the Asia-Pacific region. 
138. In the area of safeguards and verification, the Philippines looked forward to considering 
recommendations to improve further the efficiency and enhance the effectiveness of the safeguards 
system. That would enable the Agency to fulfil its mandate of implementing comprehensive 
safeguards agreements and additional protocols. The Agency played an indispensable role in ensuring 
that no diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful uses occurred. The countryÂs own additional 
protocol was already on the agenda of the Philippine Senate. 
139. Her country had been consistent in its call for the DPRK to return to the NPT and dismantle its 
nuclear programme. It lent its unequivocal support to United Nations Security Council 
resolution 1695 (2006) calling for the resumption of the six-party talks. The ASEAN Regional Forum 
could also play a positive role in promoting a peaceful resolution of the issue. At the 39th ASEAN 
Ministerial Meeting in Kuala Lumpur on 25 July 2006, Foreign Ministers had called for the 
resumption of the six-party talks. They had emphasized that the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula was essential to maintain peace and stability in the region and had stressed the importance 
of dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the issue. They had also reaffirmed ASEANÂs support for the 
principles of the joint statement of September 2005 on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. 
As the Chair of ASEAN, the Philippines hoped to help move the process forward by continuing to 
engage the DPRK in the Forum. 
140. She welcomed the start of initial discussions between Iran and the EU in Vienna a few days 
previously. The Iranian nuclear issue could only be solved diplomatically through dialogue and open 
communication and the Agency remained the appropriate forum for resolving it. 
141. Fifty years previously, the founding fathers of the Agency had seen a vision of a world without 
nuclear weapons where the atom would be used only for peaceful purposes. Though much progress 
had been made in the use of nuclear technologies to improve lives, the same could not be said of 
non-proliferation which remained a vision. The international non-proliferation regime continued to 
face new challenges and efforts had to be redoubled to strengthen the institutional framework of the 
NPT. While it regretted the collapse of the NPT Review Conference in 2005, the Philippines remained 
hopeful about the Preparatory Committee for the 2010 NPT Review Conference.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(continued) 
GC(50)4 
1. 
Mr. 
ZILMER-JOHNS 
(Denmark) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
Over 
the 
previous 
fifty 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
proven 
itself 
a 
competent 
and 
devoted 
player 
in 
the 
common 
efforts 
to 
pursue 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
Without 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
the 
world 
would 
be 
far 
less 
secure. 
2. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
with 
respect 
to 
safeguards, 
security 
and 
safety 
had 
become 
even 
more 
crucial. 
If 
insufficiently 
protected, 
high-risk 
nuclear 
and 
other 
radioactive 
materials 
could 
pose 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
international 
community, 
not 
least 
considering 
the 
risk 
of 
such 
materials 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorists. 
Denmark 
was 
pleased 
that 
the 
EU, 
as 
the 
largest 
donor 
to 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
year 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
verification, 
had 
recently 
approved 
a 
new 
Joint 
Action 
(2006/418/CFSP) 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts. 
3. 
Denmark 
took 
the 
position 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
not 
a 
sustainable 
form 
of 
energy 
and 
should 
not 
be 
included 
in 
national 
energy 
planning. 
While 
respecting 
the 
opinion 
and 
choice 
of 
others 
and 
acknowledging 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
as 
stipulated 
in 
the 
Statute, 
his 
country 
was 
not 
in 
favour 
of 
a 
promotional 
role 
for 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
field. 
4. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Although 
Denmark 
had 
been 
disappointed 
at 
the 
lack 
of 
agreement 
on 
a 
consensus 
document 
at 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
it 
was 
committed 
to 
contributing 
to 
a 
positive 
outcome 
in 
the 
forthcoming 
review 
cycle. 
It 
was 
vital 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
component 
of 
the 
NPT 
regime; 
to 
that 
end 
prompt 
and 
appropriate 
action 
must 
be 
taken 
if 
States 
were 
found 
to 
be 
in 
breach 
of 
the 
NPT 
or 
of 
their 
safeguards 
commitments, 
or 
were 
seeking 
to 
break 
out 
of 
the 
regime. 
The 
Security 
Council 
had 
a 
key 
responsibility 
in 
that 
regard 
and 
Denmark 
fully 
supported 
the 
adoption 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006) 
concerning 
the 
DPRK. 
5. 
His 
country 
strongly 
encouraged 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
to 
comply 
with 
the 
relevant 
Agency 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolutions, 
ensuring 
full 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
suspension 
of 
all 
enrichment 
related 
activities. 
He 
hoped 
that 
Iran 
would 
create 
the 
conditions 
for 
a 
resumption 
of 
negotiations 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
generous 
package 
proposal 
it 
had 
received 
in 
June. 
It 
was 
a 
cause 
for 
concern 
that 
after 
more 
than 
three 
years 
of 
examination, 
the 
Agency 
remained 
unable 
to 
make 
further 
progress 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
verify 
the 
correctness 
and 
completeness 
of 
IranÂs 
declarations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
confirming 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
was 
also 
alarming 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
found 
a 
document 
in 
Iran 
on 
the 
production 
of 
uranium 
metal 
hemispheres, 
a 
process 
related 
to 
the 
fabrication 
of 
nuclear 
weapon 
components. 
6. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
regime 
remained 
the 
fundamental 
instrument 
for 
ensuring 
non-proliferation. 
Comprehensive 
safeguards 
and 
effective 
verification 
were 
prerequisites 
for 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Accordingly, 
Denmark 
encouraged 
all 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
conclude 
and 
implement 
an 
additional 
protocol 
without 
delay. 
7. 
Denmark 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
address 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
the 
subject 
of 
the 
Special 
Event 
at 
the 
Conference. 
From 
a 
non-proliferation 
perspective, 
Denmark 
would 
consider 
supporting 
reliable, 
last-resort 
access 
to 
enriched 
uranium, 
which 
could 
significantly 
lower 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
by 
reducing 
the 
number 
of 
countries 
striving 
to

master 
sensitive 
elements 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
Also, 
Denmark 
supported 
the 
Norwegian 
initiative 
seeking 
to 
minimize 
the 
use 
of 
HEU 
and 
facilitate 
conversion 
to 
LEU. 
Denmark, 
for 
its 
part, 
had 
converted 
the 
fuel 
elements 
in 
its 
former 
research 
reactors 
to 
LEU 
in 
1990. 


8. 
Mr. 
ALI 
(Bangladesh) 
said 
that 
the 
world 
was 
now 
witnessing 
a 
dramatic 
change. 
Many 
countries 
had 
major 
economic 
development 
programmes 
and 
they 
would 
need 
increasing 
supplies 
of 
energy 
to 
fuel 
high 
rates 
of 
growth. 
The 
growing 
scarcity 
of 
energy 
sources 
and 
price 
fluctuations 
had 
wreaked 
havoc 
with 
the 
development 
programmes 
of 
the 
poorest 
nations. 
Countries 
which 
used 
fossil 
fuels 
excessively 
should 
give 
greater 
attention 
to 
conservation 
and 
sustainability. 
The 
populations 
in 
the 
developing 
world 
should 
be 
given 
the 
opportunity 
to 
reap 
the 
benefits 
of 
science 
and 
technology; 
developing 
countries 
had 
just 
as 
much 
right 
to 
nuclear 
power 
as 
others. 
9. 
Bangladesh 
had 
signed 
the 
NPT, 
an 
Agency 
safeguards 
agreement, 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
also 
the 
CTBT, 
and 
had 
voluntarily 
forsworn 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
option. 
Nuclear-weapon 
States 
should 
show 
an 
equal 
commitment 
to 
the 
elimination 
of 
their 
arsenals. 
Bangladesh 
had 
expected 
that 
countries 
which 
had 
renounced 
the 
nuclear 
weapons 
option 
would 
be 
given 
negative 
security 
assurances. 
The 
failure 
to 
arrive 
at 
a 
successful 
outcome 
of 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
in 
2005 
had 
been 
a 
great 
disappointment. 
Lack 
of 
progress 
on 
fissile 
material 
control 
also 
gave 
cause 
for 
concern. 
Many 
now 
questioned 
whether 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
really 
intended 
to 
help 
rid 
the 
world 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
10. 
Notwithstanding 
limited 
resources, 
Bangladesh 
continued 
to 
support 
a 
nuclear 
programme 
that 
spanned 
many 
sectors: 
health-care 
services, 
elemental 
analysis, 
in-house 
maintenance 
of 
electronic 
equipment, 
environmental 
monitoring 
and 
health 
physics 
services, 
the 
application 
of 
non-destructive 
testing 
techniques 
in 
industry, 
food 
preservation 
and 
sterilization 
of 
medical 
supplies, 
environmental 
pollution, 
investigation 
of 
pesticide 
residues, 
processing 
of 
bio-materials 
for 
use 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
the 
application 
of 
the 
SIT 
for 
effective 
pest 
control. 
11. 
Bangladesh 
provided 
nuclear 
medicine 
services 
to 
more 
that 
170 
000 
patients 
annually 
at 
14 
nuclear 
medicine 
outlets 
around 
the 
country, 
and 
the 
demand 
was 
growing. 
It 
was 
also 
diversifying 
its 
health-care 
services 
based 
on 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
respond 
to 
increasing 
needs. 
With 
government 
funding, 
a 
project 
had 
been 
started 
to 
conduct 
investigations 
of 
congenital 
hypothyroidism 
and 
establish 
a 
PET-CT 
(positron 
emission 
and 
computer 
tomography) 
centre. 
The 
role 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
the 
health 
services 
had 
taken 
firm 
root 
and 
enjoyed 
wide 
public 
acceptance. 
12. 
Bangladesh 
produced 
radioisotopes 
such 
as 
iodine-131 
and 
technetium-99m 
for 
use 
in 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
hoped 
to 
attain 
self-sufficiency 
in 
that 
area 
soon. 
Efforts 
were 
under 
way 
to 
make 
greater 
use 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
research 
reactor 
by 
diversifying 
applications 
of 
neutron 
beams. 
Experts 
had 
recently 
begun 
to 
employ 
neutron 
activation 
analysis 
techniques 
to 
evaluate 
samples 
of 
solid, 
liquid 
and 
bio-matrix 
forms. 
That 
had 
been 
particularly 
valuable 
for 
accurately 
quantifying 
arsenic 
in 
hair 
and 
nails, 
providing 
more 
deterministic 
information 
on 
arsenic 
contamination. 
13. 
Bangladesh 
expected 
to 
start 
construction 
of 
a 
nuclear 
training 
institute 
in 
2006. 
At 
the 
appropriate 
time, 
it 
would 
request 
the 
Agency's 
assistance 
in 
developing 
its 
facilities. 
The 
countryÂs 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
facility 
had 
been 
set 
up 
with 
Agency 
support, 
and 
his 
delegation 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
continuation 
of 
Agency 
assistance 
to 
enhance 
its 
effectiveness. 
14. 
Bangladesh 
was 
facing 
acute 
problems 
caused 
by 
contamination 
of 
groundwater 
with 
arsenic. 
As 
a 
result, 
it 
was 
finding 
it 
difficult 
to 
ensure 
access 
to 
clean 
drinking 
water 
for 
all. 
Isotope 
hydrology 
techniques 
were 
being 
used 
to 
assess 
underground 
aquifers 
so 
as 
to 
identify 
which 
ones 
were 
safe. 
A 
combination 
of 
conventional 
and 
nuclear 
techniques 
was 
employed 
to 
investigate 
groundwater 
resources.

15. 
Ensuring 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
radiation 
control 
was 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Reasonably 
good 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
meeting 
the 
Agency's 
milestones. 
An 
intensive 
training 
programme 
took 
into 
account 
the 
needs 
of 
users 
and 
regulators. 
To 
make 
the 
regulatory 
functions 
more 
effective, 
it 
was 
hoped 
that 
a 
separate 
regulatory 
authority 
could 
be 
set 
up 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
16. 
Bangladesh 
was 
actively 
involved 
in 
RCA 
projects, 
including 
collaborative 
research 
programmes, 
and 
felt 
that 
RCA 
activities 
should 
be 
strengthened. 
Programmes 
involving 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
industrial, 
medical, 
agricultural 
and 
other 
sectors 
of 
the 
economy 
were 
expected 
to 
enhance 
the 
capabilities 
of 
the 
RCA 
countries. 
The 
scope 
of 
the 
project 
on 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
power 
should 
be 
broadened 
to 
enable 
the 
RCA 
countries 
to 
meet 
the 
challenges 
of 
their 
energy 
development 
programmes. 
17. 
Funding 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
important 
safeguards 
programme 
should 
not 
be 
detrimental 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
principal 
objective 
of 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
A 
rationalization 
of 
fund 
allocation 
would 
encourage 
many 
countries 
to 
pursue 
the 
path 
of 
non-proliferation. 
There 
must 
be 
a 
proper 
balance 
among 
Agency 
programmes. 
18. 
In 
conclusion, 
his 
delegation 
stressed 
the 
Agency's 
role 
in 
the 
area 
of 
climate 
change, 
in 
particular 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
Clean 
Development 
Mechanism. 
19. 
Mr. 
FRANK 
(Israel) 
said 
that 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005 
was 
a 
timely 
recognition 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission 
and 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
in 
promoting 
global 
nuclear 
cooperation, 
stability 
and 
non-proliferation. 
The 
Âincalculable 
importanceÂ 
of 
the 
Agency's 
role, 
as 
noted 
by 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
Committee, 
was 
further 
underscored 
by 
current 
world 
challenges. 
Nuclear 
power 
must 
be 
made 
safe, 
reliable 
and 
proliferation-resistant 
in 
order 
to 
meet 
the 
global 
demand 
for 
a 
non-polluting 
energy 
source. 
20. 
The 
accomplishments 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
its 
fifty 
years 
of 
existence 
were 
substantial. 
Among 
its 
many 
achievements 
was 
its 
emergence 
as 
the 
focal 
point 
for 
international 
cooperation 
in 
nuclear 
energy. 
However, 
the 
current 
challenges 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
were 
as 
grave 
as 
ever 
and 
promised 
to 
make 
the 
task 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
coming 
decades 
no 
less 
challenging 
and 
its 
success 
in 
meeting 
them 
just 
as 
critical. 
The 
Agency, 
as 
the 
sole 
legitimate 
international 
nuclear 
fact-finder, 
had 
a 
unique 
role 
in 
encouraging 
compliance 
with 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
obligations. 
That 
was 
aided 
by 
its 
capacity 
to 
deter 
violations 
based 
on 
its 
capabilities 
to 
detect 
non-compliance, 
to 
report 
any 
non-compliance 
in 
a 
full 
and 
timely 
manner 
and 
to 
facilitate 
efforts 
to 
resolve 
such 
concerns. 
Unfortunately, 
certain 
States, 
some 
of 
them 
in 
the 
Middle 
East, 
had 
abused 
their 
international 
treaty 
obligations, 
and 
some 
instances 
of 
non-compliance 
had 
not 
yet 
been 
confronted 
with 
the 
proper 
enforcement 
of 
corrective 
measures. 
The 
Agency 
could 
not 
do 
more 
than 
the 
collective 
resolve 
of 
its 
Member 
States 
to 
take 
non-proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
security 
seriously. 
The 
possession 
of 
advanced 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
increasingly 
being 
recognized 
as 
bringing 
with 
it 
a 
heavy 
burden 
of 
responsibility 
as 
well 
as 
accountability 
to 
international 
norms. 
Israel 
had 
a 
special 
responsibility 
to 
tread 
in 
that 
domain 
with 
caution, 
exercising 
maximum 
self-restraint 
even 
in 
the 
face 
of 
grave 
challenges. 
Unfortunately, 
highly 
destructive 
forces 
which 
engaged 
in 
terror 
and 
nuclear 
proliferation 
had 
emerged 
in 
the 
already 
troubled 
Middle 
East 
and 
threatened 
to 
spread 
instability 
even 
further. 
Regrettably, 
region-wide 
progress 
towards 
reconciliation 
and 
disarmament 
remained 
slow. 
21. 
His 
country 
had 
tried 
to 
improve 
national 
and 
regional 
security 
through 
a 
combination 
of 
unilateral 
measures 
aimed 
at 
diminishing 
friction 
with 
its 
neighbours 
and 
a 
concerted 
effort 
to 
bring 
itself 
closer, 
wherever 
possible, 
to 
international 
norms 
on 
nuclear 
safety, 
security 
and 
non-proliferation. 
Also, 
it 
had 
stepped 
up 
its 
efforts 
to 
help 
shape 
and 
promote 
new 
norms 
in 
those 
domains, 
hoping 
that 
those 
would, 
in 
turn, 
favourably 
impact 
upon 
the 
region. 
An 
intense 
effort 
over 

GC(50)/OR.6

several 
years 
had 
brought 
Israel 
into 
both 
formal 
and 
practical 
compliance 
with 
the 
NSG 
Guidelines, 
in 
addition 
to 
its 
pre-existing 
adherence 
to 
the 
Australia 
Group 
and 
MTCR 
(Missile 
Technology 
Control 
Regime) 
Guidelines. 
That 
effort 
had 
been 
recognized 
by 
NSG 
members 
at 
their 
recent 
plenary 
meeting 
in 
Brasilia. 
Israel 
continued 
to 
work 
towards 
expanding 
its 
export 
control 
system 
to 
include 
the 
Wassenaar 
Arrangement. 
It 
had 
complemented 
that 
effort 
with 
active 
participation 
in 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative 
and 
had 
also 
submitted 
a 
report 
on 
its 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004). 
It 
had 
begun 
ratification 
of 
the 
amended 
CPPNM 
as 
well 
as 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism. 
It 
was 
implementing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy, 
it 
was 
stepping 
up 
security 
on 
its 
international 
borders 
to 
combat 
the 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
materials. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
NUSSC, 
Israel 
was 
working 
on 
the 
further 
development 
of 
national 
and 
global 
standards 
for 
stringent 
nuclear 
security 
measures. 
One 
high 
priority 
area 
was 
the 
transport, 
storage 
and 
waste 
management 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
Israel 
actively 
supported 
and 
participated 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
CTBTO 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
He 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
some 
non-proliferation 
and 
other 
benefits 
would 
be 
derived 
from 
its 
existence 
in 
the 
current 
transient 
state 
and 
urged 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
CTBT 
not 
to 
conduct 
nuclear 
test 
explosions 
in 
the 
meantime. 


22. 
While 
Israel 
was 
doing 
its 
best 
to 
develop 
and 
implement 
nuclear 
security 
and 
non-proliferation 
measures 
wherever 
possible, 
it 
was 
aware 
that 
in 
reality 
such 
measures 
did 
not 
address 
all 
the 
acute 
non-proliferation 
challenges 
currently 
faced 
by 
the 
international 
community. 
Notwithstanding 
its 
limited 
size 
and 
resources, 
IsraelÂs 
vested 
interest 
in 
the 
success 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
led 
it 
to 
search 
for 
ways 
to 
support 
the 
development 
by 
others 
of 
safe, 
reliable, 
proliferation-resistant 
nuclear 
power 
technology, 
to 
enhance 
the 
efficiency 
of 
safeguards 
measures 
and 
technology, 
and 
to 
promote 
new 
international 
norms 
for 
fuel 
cycle 
facilities. 
The 
Special 
Event 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
focused 
attention 
on 
the 
need 
to 
devise 
and 
win 
support 
for 
new 
norms 
that 
assured 
access 
to 
a 
market-
based, 
reliable, 
safe 
and 
secure 
energy 
supply 
without 
causing 
new 
proliferation 
concerns. 
Nuclear 
fuel 
lease 
and 
take-back 
arrangements 
together 
with 
international 
spent 
fuel 
storage 
options 
should 
be 
studied 
with 
the 
highest 
priority. 
23. 
Against 
that 
background, 
Israel 
viewed 
with 
concern 
the 
alarming 
nuclear 
and 
missile 
proliferation 
developments 
in 
and 
around 
the 
Middle 
East. 
If 
those 
ominous 
trends 
were 
allowed 
to 
develop 
further, 
they 
could 
gravely 
undermine 
regional 
and 
eventually 
global 
stability 
and 
pose 
an 
existential 
challenge 
to 
Israel. 
All 
the 
more 
so, 
because 
they 
were 
accompanied 
by 
sustained 
efforts 
by 
certain 
leaders 
in 
the 
region 
to 
deny 
the 
legitimacy 
of 
IsraelÂs 
sovereign 
existence 
and 
to 
call 
for 
its 
destruction. 
Israel 
could 
not 
remain 
indifferent 
to 
such 
developments 
and 
hoped 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
address 
them. 
It 
hoped 
that 
all 
concerned 
parties 
would 
work 
together 
with 
the 
Agency, 
under 
the 
appropriate 
guidance 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
to 
diffuse 
those 
threats. 
24. 
He 
noted 
that 
the 
Conference 
once 
again 
had 
before 
it 
an 
item 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
and 
threat, 
which 
it 
asked 
Member 
States 
to 
reject 
as 
extraneous 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
and 
mission. 
25. 
Israel 
supported 
the 
principle 
of 
making 
the 
Middle 
East 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
chemical, 
biological 
and 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
ballistic 
missiles. 
However, 
such 
a 
zone 
could 
only 
emerge 
once 
the 
political 
and 
security 
conditions 
necessary 
for 
its 
negotiation 
had 
ripened. 
As 
in 
preceding 
years, 
Israel 
would 
only 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
support 
the 
resolution 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safeguards 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
under 
agenda 
item 
20 
if 
its 
contents 
were 
mutually 
agreed 
upon 
and 
the 
resolution 
on 
Israeli 
nuclear 
capabilities 
was 
not 
acted 
upon. 
It 
was 
willing 
to 
do 
so, 
despite 
its 
grave 
reservations 
about 
the 
modalities 
of 
the 
resolutions, 
because 
establishing 
a 
NWFZ 
was 
consistent 
with 
its 
vision.

26. 
Israel 
appreciated 
the 
invaluable 
assistance 
the 
Agency 
provided 
to 
Member 
States 
through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
In 
recent 
years, 
his 
country 
had 
cooperated 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
extend 
the 
benefits 
of 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
agriculture, 
environment 
and 
industry, 
both 
to 
new 
constituencies 
among 
its 
own 
citizens 
and 
to 
its 
neighbours, 
including 
the 
Palestinians. 
Israel 
reiterated 
its 
offer 
to 
share 
those 
benefits 
with 
other 
States 
and 
peoples 
within 
and 
outside 
its 
region. 
One 
promising 
project 
was 
the 
construction 
in 
Jordan 
of 
the 
SESAME 
synchrotron 
for 
regional 
use. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
that 
initiative, 
Israel 
reiterated 
its 
support 
for 
the 
expected 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
between 
SESAME 
and 
the 
Agency. 
Israel 
had 
signed 
a 
CPF 
with 
the 
Agency, 
a 
milestone 
agreement 
reflecting 
nationwide 
developments 
pertaining 
to 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
domains 
in 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Also, 
it 
confirmed 
that 
the 
Israel 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
remained 
committed 
to 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency. 
27. 
Finally, 
Israel 
looked 
forward 
to 
measures 
to 
strengthen 
the 
Agency 
and 
help 
it 
to 
fulfil 
its 
missions 
and 
face 
the 
tremendous 
challenges 
ahead. 
28. 
Mr. 
DAINIUS 
(Lithuania) 
said 
that 
fifty 
years 
after 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency, 
its 
objectives 
remained 
vitally 
important 
for 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
endeavours 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
under 
the 
three 
Statutory 
pillars 
of 
verification, 
safety 
and 
technology 
were 
widely 
recognized, 
as 
the 
awarding 
of 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
testified. 
29. 
The 
Agency 
and 
its 
safeguards 
system 
played 
a 
central 
role 
in 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
most 
important 
current 
challenge 
to 
that 
regime 
was 
the 
non-compliance 
of 
certain 
States 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
Lithuania 
strongly 
supported 
strengthening 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
and 
considered 
that 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
should 
be 
accepted 
as 
the 
global 
standard 
for 
verifying 
compliance 
with 
nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
30. 
Lithuania 
had 
been 
implementing 
its 
additional 
protocol 
since 
July 
2000. 
The 
SIR 
for 
2005 
had 
confirmed 
once 
again 
the 
absence 
of 
diversion 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activities 
in 
Lithuania. 
Work 
was 
now 
under 
way 
to 
implement 
the 
integrated 
safeguards 
approach 
in 
Lithuania. 
31. 
A 
month 
previously, 
Lithuania 
had 
hosted 
a 
regional 
technical 
meeting 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
for 
EU 
Member 
States. 
The 
meeting 
had 
not 
only 
provided 
a 
good 
opportunity 
to 
discuss 
safeguards 
implementation 
in 
the 
EU, 
but 
had 
also 
enabled 
better 
understanding 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
policies 
and 
practices 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols. 
Lithuania 
had 
appreciated 
the 
opportunity 
to 
host 
that 
meeting. 
32. 
Lithuania 
was 
strongly 
committed 
to 
the 
requirements 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
and 
welcomed 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
1540 
CommitteeÂs 
mandate 
by 
two 
years. 
It 
invited 
other 
countries 
to 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
to 
prevent 
non-State 
actors 
from 
acquiring 
or 
developing 
nuclear, 
chemical 
or 
biological 
weapons, 
and 
to 
stop 
the 
proliferation 
of 
those 
weapons. 
Lithuania 
noted 
the 
significant 
progress 
that 
had 
been 
made 
by 
the 
international 
community 
and 
individual 
States 
in 
the 
worldwide 
fight 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
It 
supported 
all 
measures 
aimed 
at 
preventing 
terrorists 
from 
acquiring 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
their 
means 
of 
delivery, 
and 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative. 
In 
2005, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
also 
taken 
a 
huge 
step 
forward 
in 
strengthening 
global 
security 
by 
amending 
the 
CPPNM. 
Lithuania 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying 
the 
amendments, 
a 
process 
which 
it 
hoped 
to 
complete 
by 
the 
end 
of 
2006. 
Lithuania 
was 
implementing 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
Although 
they 
were 
not 
legally 
binding, 
Lithuania 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
them 
and 
to 
notify 
the 
Director 
General 
of 
their 
intention 
to 
do 
so. 
The 
early 
entry 
into

utmost 
importance 
to 
non-proliferation 
and 
disarmament, 
and 
Lithuania 
urged 
all 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
that 
Treaty 
without 
delay 
and 
without 
conditions. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
new 
developments 
as 
regards 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty 
and 
urged 
the 
pursuit 
of 
early 
negotiations 
in 
that 
connection. 


33. 
With 
oil 
and 
natural 
gas 
prices 
rising, 
increasing 
dependency 
on 
the 
import 
of 
primary 
energy 
resources, 
the 
growing 
threat 
of 
climate 
change 
and 
expanding 
energy 
demand, 
there 
was 
a 
need 
for 
reliable, 
affordable 
and 
sustainable 
energy. 
To 
that 
end, 
the 
EU 
had 
assigned 
priority 
to 
establishing 
a 
single 
energy 
market. 
Regional 
cooperation 
among 
the 
three 
Baltic 
States 
with 
that 
goal 
in 
mind 
had 
been 
accelerated 
by 
their 
common 
dependence 
on 
a 
single 
primary 
energy 
supplier, 
their 
need 
to 
integrate 
the 
Baltic 
electricity 
market 
into 
the 
markets 
of 
Western 
Europe 
and 
Scandinavia, 
their 
common 
need 
for 
electricity 
generation 
capacities 
following 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Lithuania 
and 
some 
older 
units 
in 
Estonia, 
and 
implementation 
of 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Kyoto 
Protocol. 
34. 
The 
study 
on 
energy 
supply 
options 
and 
security 
in 
the 
Baltic 
region 
that 
had 
been 
prepared 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
NATO 
and 
the 
three 
Baltic 
States 
had 
indicated 
that 
new 
nuclear 
capacities 
seemed 
to 
be 
the 
most 
feasible 
option, 
but 
that 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
only 
made 
financial 
sense 
if 
it 
received 
multinational 
support. 
Estonia 
and 
Latvia 
supported 
the 
idea 
and 
the 
Nordic 
countries 
had 
given 
positive 
signals. 
In 
September 
2005, 
the 
Lithuanian 
parliament 
had 
asked 
the 
Government 
to 
consider 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
programme 
for 
developing 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
Lithuania. 
35. 
At 
the 
start 
of 
2006, 
the 
Prime 
Ministers 
of 
the 
three 
Baltic 
States 
had 
expressed 
their 
intention 
to 
investigate 
the 
possibility 
of 
building 
a 
new 
nuclear 
plant 
and 
creating 
a 
common 
Baltic 
electricity 
market. 
The 
Baltic 
energy 
companies 
had 
started 
to 
prepare 
a 
corresponding 
feasibility 
study, 
the 
results 
of 
which 
would 
be 
finalized 
by 
November 
2006. 
The 
Government 
of 
Lithuania 
had 
invited 
the 
Agency 
to 
participate 
in 
revising 
the 
draft 
document. 
The 
regional 
approach 
taken 
by 
the 
Baltic 
States 
followed 
EU 
energy 
policy 
and 
was 
fully 
in 
line 
with 
the 
innovative 
concepts 
already 
being 
explored 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Lithuania 
encouraged 
other 
countries 
to 
consider 
cross-border 
cooperation 
in 
meeting 
their 
energy 
demands 
and 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
assist 
countries 
in 
evaluating 
and 
meeting 
their 
energy 
needs 
in 
the 
most 
efficient 
way. 
36. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
the 
Agency 
played 
a 
crucial 
role 
in 
identifying 
operational 
strengths, 
weaknesses 
and 
good 
practices 
and 
in 
sharing 
those 
insights 
through 
regional 
and 
international 
cooperation. 
Since 
2003, 
Lithuania 
had 
been 
participating 
actively 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
safety 
activities 
and 
in 
2006 
would 
host 
various 
nuclear 
safety 
related 
international 
events 
under 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
projects. 
Also, 
in 
line 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
following 
Agency 
recommendations, 
Lithuania 
was 
strengthening 
the 
capabilities 
of 
its 
nuclear 
regulatory 
authority 
and 
improving 
the 
safety 
level 
of 
its 
nuclear 
installations. 
37. 
In 
compliance 
with 
international 
requirements, 
Unit 
1 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
shut 
down 
in 
December 
2004 
and 
Unit 
2 
was 
to 
be 
shut 
down 
in 
2009. 
Activities 
to 
prepare 
for 
decommissioning 
were 
under 
way. 
Efforts 
were 
focusing 
on 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
long-term 
spent 
fuel 
store 
and 
solid 
radioactive 
waste 
treatment 
facilities, 
and 
on 
the 
engineering 
of 
dismantling 
operations 
for 
different 
parts 
of 
the 
plant. 
Actual 
dismantling 
of 
Unit 
1 
was 
expected 
to 
begin 
in 
2008. 
Lithuania 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
full-scope 
OSART 
mission 
to 
the 
Ignalina 
plant 
in 
June 
2006, 
which 
had 
identified 
several 
examples 
of 
good 
practice 
and 
provided 
valuable 
suggestions 
and 
recommendations. 
Progress 
in 
implementing 
the 
recommendations 
would 
be 
demonstrated 
during 
the 
follow-up 
mission 
in 
late 
2007. 
Additional 
measures 
to 
ensure 
and 
enhance 
safety 
levels 
were 
anticipated 
until 
Unit 
2 
ceased 
operation.

38. 
On 
other 
safety 
related 
issues, 
Lithuania 
supported 
further 
development 
of 
the 
Incident 
Reporting 
System. 
With 
regard 
to 
the 
establishment 
and 
strengthening 
of 
LithuaniaÂs 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
for 
the 
control 
of 
radiation 
sources, 
recently 
repatriated 
orphan 
sources, 
exposure 
to 
ionizing 
radiation, 
radiation 
emergencies 
and 
preparedness 
for 
acts 
of 
terrorism 
involving 
radioactive 
material, 
he 
noted 
that 
contributions 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
international 
community 
were 
essential. 
39. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
initiators, 
Lithuania 
welcomed 
the 
new 
regional 
project 
on 
the 
practical 
implementation 
of 
the 
principle 
of 
optimization 
of 
radiation 
protection 
through 
regional 
networking. 
Significant 
progress 
has 
been 
achieved 
in 
implementing 
quality 
systems 
in 
hospitals 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
X-ray 
diagnostics 
and 
computed 
tomography, 
and 
upgrading 
of 
quality 
systems 
in 
the 
field 
of 
mammography 
screening 
was 
anticipated 
soon. 
Lithuania 
was 
actively 
involved 
in 
the 
experience-sharing 
process 
and 
acted 
as 
a 
channel 
for 
countries 
developing 
a 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure. 
In 
2005, 
its 
Radiation 
Protection 
Centre 
had 
hosted 
training 
courses 
for 
representatives 
from 
over 
10 
countries. 
Lithuania 
was 
willing 
to 
participate 
in 
more 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
with 
the 
goal 
of 
creating 
a 
regional 
training 
centre. 
40. 
Concerning 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
Lithuania 
was 
taking 
steps 
to 
ensure 
the 
safe 
disposal 
of 
the 
waste 
arising 
mainly 
from 
the 
operation 
and 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
Ignalina 
nuclear 
power 
plant. 
It 
had 
requested 
the 
Agency 
to 
organize 
a 
peer 
review 
to 
assess 
the 
long-term 
safety 
aspects 
of 
a 
disposal 
facility 
for 
short-lived 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste. 
That 
review, 
undertaken 
in 
December 
2005, 
had 
evaluated 
three 
proposed 
sites 
near 
the 
Ignalina 
plant 
and 
had 
concluded 
that 
the 
work 
undertaken 
by 
the 
national 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Management 
Agency 
was 
in 
compliance 
with 
international 
standards 
and 
good 
international 
practice. 
Observers 
from 
Belarus 
and 
Latvia 
had 
been 
invited 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
assessment 
process. 
The 
Joint 
Convention 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
Lithuania 
on 
14 
June 
2004 
and 
his 
country 
had 
presented 
its 
first 
report 
during 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Convention. 
The 
conclusion 
had 
shown 
that 
Lithuania 
was 
fulfilling 
its 
obligations. 
41. 
Lithuania 
had 
been 
participating 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
since 
2003. 
Its 
national 
goals 
were 
to 
establish 
and 
constantly 
enhance 
nuclear 
infrastructure 
and 
capabilities, 
and 
to 
strengthen 
such 
areas 
as 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
radiation 
protection, 
decommissioning, 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine. 
Its 
future 
priorities 
focused 
on 
the 
acquisition 
of 
knowledge, 
skills 
and 
technology 
so 
as 
to 
be 
prepared 
for 
future 
challenges. 
Lithuania 
had 
six 
ongoing 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
and 
planned 
to 
sign 
an 
updated 
CPF 
with 
more 
emphasis 
on 
decommissioning 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Lithuania, 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
had 
contributed 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
on 
time 
and 
in 
full. 
42. 
Mr. 
RUSHITI 
(The 
Former 
Yugoslav 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia), 
having 
congratulated 
the 
Secretariat 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
receiving 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
said 
that 
his 
country 
fully 
subscribed 
to 
the 
need 
for 
a 
strong 
international 
safeguards 
system 
to 
promote 
collective 
security. 
Increasing 
global 
terrorism 
meant 
that 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
becoming 
even 
more 
important. 
Enhanced 
cooperation 
among 
Member 
States 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
the 
application 
of 
safety 
standards 
and 
of 
the 
measures 
foreseen 
under 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
was 
therefore 
essential. 
43. 
His 
country 
had 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
in 
force, 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol 
and 
had 
joined 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism, 
which 
were 
crucial 
instruments 
in 
international 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
done 
so 
to 
follow 
suit. 
44. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
indispensable 
assistance, 
his 
country 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
towards 
compliance 
with 
international 
radiation 
safety 
standards. 
Further 
assistance 
based 
on 
the 

GC(50)/OR.6 
20

recommendations 
of 
the 
RaSSIA 
mission 
would 
be 
required 
to 
make 
its 
Radiation 
Safety 
Directorate 
fully 
operational 
and 
to 
build 
the 
planned 
comprehensive 
radiation 
protection 
and 
national 
nuclear 
safety 
framework. 


45. 
His 
countryÂs 
most 
significant 
achievements 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
been: 
the 
development 
of 
legislation, 
including 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
independent 
regulatory 
authority; 
improved 
dosimetry 
services 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
national 
calibration 
laboratory; 
improved 
nuclear 
medicine 
diagnostic 
procedures 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
locally 
produced 
radiopharmaceuticals; 
upgrading 
of 
the 
radiotherapy 
services 
at 
the 
Institute 
of 
Radiotherapy 
and 
Oncology 
to 
the 
level 
of 
a 
centre 
of 
excellence; 
and, 
the 
establishment 
of 
food 
safety 
laboratories. 
During 
the 
coming 
project 
cycle, 
efforts 
would 
focus 
primarily 
on 
further 
strengthening 
of 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructure 
and 
the 
capabilities 
of 
the 
radiation 
protection 
services, 
and 
upgrading 
of 
diagnostic 
procedures 
in 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy. 
Particular 
attention 
would 
be 
given 
to 
completing 
the 
disposal 
facility 
for 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
radioactive 
waste. 
All 
projects 
had 
been 
defined 
jointly 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
compliance 
with 
the 
Republic 
of 
MacedoniaÂs 
CPF. 
The 
current 
implementation 
rate 
for 
national 
projects, 
92%, 
was 
encouragingly 
high. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia 
would 
continue 
to 
give 
its 
full 
support 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
for 
the 
enhancement 
of 
regional 
cooperation. 
As 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
and 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
regional 
programme, 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
offer 
to 
host 
training 
events. 
46. 
Aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
financial 
contributions 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
his 
country 
had 
paid 
its 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
in 
full 
and 
also 
its 
NPCs, 
despite 
national 
budgetary 
restrictions. 
Its 
commitment 
to 
the 
programme 
was 
evidenced 
by 
its 
providing 
cost-sharing 
for 
each 
project. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Macedonia 
was 
grateful 
for 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
pledged 
its 
continued 
support 
for 
all 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Mr. 
Berdennikov 
(Russian 
Federation), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


47. 
Mr. 
PERERA 
(Sri 
Lanka) 
said 
the 
Agency's 
50th 
anniversary 
was 
an 
appropriate 
occasion 
on 
which 
to 
take 
stock 
of 
its 
achievements 
and 
look 
towards 
the 
new 
directions 
to 
be 
taken 
in 
the 
future. 
As 
a 
developing 
Member 
State, 
Sri 
Lanka 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
ongoing 
work 
relating 
to 
the 
promotion 
of 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development. 
The 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
reflected 
the 
progress 
made 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
in 
agriculture, 
industry, 
health, 
water 
management, 
preservation 
of 
the 
environment 
and 
human 
resource 
development. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
specific 
challenges 
faced 
by 
Sri 
Lanka 
relating 
to 
human 
nutrition 
and 
cancer, 
his 
delegation 
welcomed 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund 
and 
PACT. 
48. 
Energy 
availability 
was 
central 
to 
improving 
the 
standards 
of 
living 
in 
developing 
countries 
and 
energy 
security 
was 
one 
of 
the 
important 
challenges 
to 
development. 
The 
Agency 
faced 
a 
number 
of 
critical 
issues 
related 
to 
rising 
nuclear 
energy 
expectations 
worldwide, 
both 
in 
developed 
and 
developing 
countries. 
In 
his 
introductory 
statement, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
outlined 
thought-
provoking 
ideas 
for 
the 
future 
in 
that 
connection. 
49. 
The 
Agency 
was 
continuing 
to 
carry 
out 
important 
work 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
In 
the 
present 
global 
context 
of 
protecting 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
transport 
from 
terrorist 
and 
other 
illegal 
activities, 
the 
Agency 
had 
an 
enhanced 
role 
to 
play. 
Sri 
Lanka 
remained 
concerned 
about 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
NSF, 
which 
required 
flexibility 
in 
the 
utilization 
of 
its 
resources. 
The 
newly 
established 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre 
was 
also 
a 
welcome 
measure, 
as 
it 
enhanced 
the 
capabilities 
of 
Member 
States 
and 
intergovernmental 
organizations 
to 
respond 
to 
nuclear 
or 
radiological 
incidents 
and 
emergencies 
by 
offering 
timely 
and 
efficient 
services.

Indicative 
Planning 
Figures, 
chaired 
jointly 
by 
the 
Ambassadors 
of 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
Norway, 
had 
arrived 
at 
a 
consensus 
outcome. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
statutory 
function 
of 
the 
Agency, 
fulfilling 
Article 
II 
of 
its 
Statute 
and 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT, 
and 
as 
such 
should 
receive 
the 
same 
budgetary 
resources 
as 
the 
other 
pillars 
of 
its 
mandate. 
Also, 
funding 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
should 
be 
sufficient, 
predictable 
and 
assured 
and 
reflect, 
in 
financial 
terms, 
the 
political 
consensus 
among 
Member 
States 
relating 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
51. 
The 
Sri 
Lankan 
Government 
had 
paid 
its 
NPCs 
the 
preceding 
year 
and 
was 
committed 
to 
paying 
its 
total 
NPCs 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
biennium. 
52. 
Like 
other 
developing 
Member 
States, 
Sri 
Lanka 
had 
benefited 
significantly 
from 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
by 
acquiring 
nuclear 
technology 
capabilities 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
industry. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
strategy, 
which 
was 
implemented 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
central 
criteria, 
had 
enabled 
nuclear 
technology 
to 
have 
a 
high 
impact 
on 
socio-
economic 
development 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
projects 
were 
helping 
to 
improve 
the 
radiotherapy 
services 
in 
cancer 
hospitals, 
diagnosis 
of 
major 
infectious 
diseases 
through 
the 
use 
of 
molecular 
diagnostic 
techniques, 
assessment 
of 
pesticide 
contamination 
of 
surface 
water 
and 
groundwater, 
livestock 
productivity, 
the 
safety 
of 
livestock 
products, 
and 
the 
safety 
and 
sustainability 
of 
dams. 
53. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
health, 
an 
imPACT 
mission 
had 
visited 
Sri 
Lanka 
earlier 
in 
the 
year, 
and 
the 
country 
was 
pleased 
to 
be 
able 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Agency's 
collaborative 
efforts 
to 
develop 
model 
demonstration 
sites 
for 
cancer 
control. 
He 
hoped 
that 
PACTÂs 
commendable 
objectives 
would 
generate 
adequate 
resources 
for 
that 
programme. 
At 
the 
national 
level, 
his 
Government 
had 
taken 
positive 
steps 
to 
curb 
the 
incidence 
of 
cancer 
through 
legislation 
and 
related 
measures 
to 
discourage 
smoking 
and 
mitigate 
the 
effects 
of 
other 
causative 
factors. 
54. 
Sri 
Lanka 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
initiative 
to 
implement 
the 
new 
web-based 
Programme 
Cycle 
Management 
Framework. 
It 
had 
received 
wide 
acceptance 
among 
the 
prospective 
project 
counterparts 
and 
project 
management 
staff 
in 
Sri 
Lanka 
and 
could 
only 
enhance 
the 
provision 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
Member 
States. 
55. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
self-reliance 
and 
sustainability 
of 
national 
nuclear 
institutes 
through 
regional 
technical 
cooperation 
were 
in 
full 
accordance 
with 
the 
policies 
of 
Sri 
LankaÂs 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority, 
which 
acted 
as 
the 
focal 
point 
for 
Agency 
programmes. 
The 
Authority 
had 
been 
able 
to 
generate 
two-thirds 
of 
its 
operational 
expenses 
during 
2005 
through 
the 
provision 
of 
analytical 
and 
radiation 
protection 
services, 
training 
and 
other 
activities. 
56. 
Sri 
Lanka 
noted 
with 
appreciation 
the 
efforts 
being 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
field 
of 
knowledge 
management 
and 
preservation 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge. 
The 
increasing 
availability 
of 
information 
and 
communication 
technology 
provided 
an 
ideal 
platform 
for 
launching 
knowledge 
management 
and 
preservation 
projects. 
57. 
Sri 
Lanka, 
which 
had 
become 
party 
to 
the 
RCA 
in 
1976, 
had 
been 
an 
active 
participant 
in 
its 
programmes. 
The 
Agency 
had 
provided 
crucial 
technical 
support 
to 
initiate 
the 
programmes, 
and 
his 
Government 
had 
provided 
collateral 
support 
to 
make 
them 
sustainable. 
Sri 
Lanka 
strongly 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
approach 
of 
fostering 
regional 
cooperation 
and 
subscribed 
to 
the 
view 
that 
regional 
cooperative 
agreements 
were 
effective 
mechanisms 
through 
which 
to 
address 
a 
range 
of 
transboundary 
issues, 
including 
those 
related 
to 
safety 
and 
security. 
The 
Sri 
Lankan 
Government 
had 
started 
to 
address 
some 
of 
those 
issues, 
in 
particular 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
through 
bilateral 
approaches.

58. 
On 
the 
initiative 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
Science 
and 
Technology, 
his 
Government 
had 
allocated 
funds 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
first 
government-owned, 
multi-purpose 
gamma 
irradiation 
facility. 
The 
Agency 
had 
contributed 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
project 
through 
assistance 
in 
the 
form 
of 
expert 
services 
during 
the 
planning 
stages 
and 
further 
collaboration 
was 
anticipated 
in 
the 
development 
of 
manpower 
and 
technology 
transfer. 
59. 
Mr. 
RÃNAKY 
(Hungary) 
said 
that 
the 
50th 
General 
Conference 
provided 
a 
good 
opportunity 
to 
review 
the 
past 
and 
plan 
for 
the 
future. 
The 
Agency, 
known 
for 
its 
unbiased 
analysis 
on 
nuclear 
matters 
and 
its 
important 
contribution 
to 
socio-economic 
development 
worldwide, 
had 
received 
well 
deserved 
recognition 
of 
its 
achievements 
by 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Price 
for 
2005. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
official 
visit 
to 
Hungary 
in 
October 
2005 
had 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
for 
his 
country 
to 
demonstrate 
both 
its 
strong 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
values 
and 
its 
commitment 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
60. 
The 
increasing 
threat 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
including 
the 
risk 
of 
their 
falling 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
terrorists, 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
great 
concern. 
Hungary 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
effective 
measures 
in 
cases 
of 
non-compliance 
and 
strongly 
supported 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
and 
urged 
Member 
States 
to 
adopt 
practical 
verification 
measures 
with 
a 
view 
to 
making 
the 
safeguards 
mechanism 
more 
credible 
and 
effective. 
Hungary 
had 
contributed 
to 
efforts 
in 
that 
direction 
through 
early 
ratification 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
had 
been 
among 
the 
first 
States 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
industries 
to 
introduce 
integrated 
safeguards 
in 
2004. 
As 
a 
voluntary 
contribution, 
the 
Hungarian 
Support 
Programme 
continued 
to 
facilitate 
the 
implementation 
of 
Agency 
safeguards 
projects 
by 
providing 
expertise 
and 
training 
courses, 
practical 
training 
for 
Agency 
inspectors 
and 
for 
Member 
States 
requiring 
further 
education. 
61. 
Hungary 
had 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
taking 
tangible 
measures 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
in 
enhancing 
nuclear 
security 
by 
making 
a 
voluntary 
contribution 
of 
US 
$70 
000. 
It 
commended 
the 
Agency 
for 
supporting 
Member 
States 
in 
reducing 
the 
risk 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
proliferation 
through 
the 
conversion 
of 
research 
reactors 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU, 
and 
the 
return 
of 
the 
HEU 
to 
the 
country 
of 
origin. 
Such 
projects 
were 
being 
implemented 
in 
Hungary 
and 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
Furthermore, 
Hungary 
was 
ready 
to 
contribute 
to 
regional 
security 
by 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
regional 
partners 
and 
by 
considering 
appropriate 
in-kind 
contributions. 
62. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
efforts 
to 
address 
the 
proliferation-sensitive 
elements 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
and 
similarly 
the 
Special 
Event 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
at 
the 
current 
General 
Conference. 
Hungary 
was 
interested 
in 
participating 
in 
the 
discussions 
on 
the 
various 
initiatives, 
including 
the 
concept 
for 
a 
multilateral 
mechanism 
for 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
proposed 
at 
the 
June 
2006 
Board 
meeting. 
Hungary 
encouraged 
all 
parties 
to 
contribute 
actively 
to 
achieving 
further 
progress 
on 
that 
pivotal 
issue. 
63. 
To 
keep 
pace 
with 
technological 
progress, 
the 
output 
of 
the 
Paks 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
in 
Hungary 
would 
be 
upgraded 
to 
over 
2000 
MW 
by 
2009. 
There 
was 
broad 
consensus 
in 
his 
country 
that 
the 
security 
of 
its 
energy 
supply 
could 
not 
be 
maintained 
without 
nuclear 
energy. 
That 
had 
been 
reflected 
by 
a 
parliamentary 
decision 
in 
November 
2005 
to 
provide 
political 
support 
for 
the 
lifetime 
extension 
of 
the 
Paks 
plant. 
The 
Hungarian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority 
and 
the 
plantÂs 
operator 
had 
reached 
an 
agreement 
on 
the 
schedule 
for 
that 
extension. 
With 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency, 
Hungary 
would 
implement 
projects 
to 
support 
that 
process 
and 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
appropriate 
measures 
and 
decisions 
were 
duly 
taken. 
An 
important 
stage 
had 
been 
reached 
in 
preparations 
to 
eliminate 
the 
consequences 
of 
the 
serious 
incident 
at 
the 
plant 
in 
2003. 
All 
the 
necessary 
licences 
had 
been 
obtained 
and 
the 
conditions 
met 
to 
start 
removal 
of 
the 
damaged 
fuel, 
which 
would 
begin 
in 
the 
last 
quarter

of 
2006. 
In 
that 
regard, 
both 
the 
plant 
operator 
and 
the 
Hungarian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Authority 
had 
benefited 
from 
expert 
missions 
and 
scientific 
visits 
facilitated 
by 
the 
Agency. 


64. 
His 
Parliament 
had, 
in 
November 
2005, 
approved 
in 
principle 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
repository 
for 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste 
from 
the 
Paks 
plant. 
Its 
approval 
had 
been 
based 
on 
internationally 
recognized 
research 
proving 
the 
geological 
suitability 
of 
the 
selected 
area, 
favourable 
evaluation 
of 
the 
competent 
geological 
institutions 
and, 
last 
but 
not 
least, 
the 
support 
of 
the 
local 
population. 
Work 
on 
establishing 
the 
necessary 
infrastructure 
and 
developing 
the 
plans 
required 
to 
start 
construction 
was 
under 
way. 
65. 
The 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
had 
demonstrated 
the 
significant 
progress 
made 
since 
the 
first 
review 
meeting. 
Contracting 
Parties 
were 
committed 
to 
improving 
their 
policies 
and 
practices 
and 
the 
objectives 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
were 
well 
served 
by 
the 
maturing 
review 
process. 
Although 
membership 
had 
increased 
significantly, 
even 
further 
efforts 
in 
that 
direction 
could 
be 
made. 
66. 
Non-power 
applications, 
including 
health, 
were 
key 
components 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities. 
Hungary 
welcomed 
the 
launch 
of 
PACT 
as 
a 
positive 
example 
of 
how 
the 
Agency 
should 
respond 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
Member 
States. 
His 
Government 
had 
made 
a 
voluntary 
contribution 
of 
Â40 
000 
in 
November 
2005 
and 
had 
proposed 
that 
the 
Hungarian 
National 
Oncology 
Institute 
participate 
in 
the 
programme. 
He 
expressed 
satisfaction 
that 
the 
recent 
QUATRO 
(Quality 
Assurance 
Team 
for 
Radiation 
Oncology) 
audit 
had 
concluded 
that 
the 
processes 
and 
techniques 
at 
the 
Institute 
were 
state 
of 
the 
art. 
67. 
His 
country 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Hungary 
had 
been 
among 
those 
Member 
States 
requesting 
changes 
in 
its 
operation, 
an 
opinion 
that 
had 
been 
echoed 
by 
the 
External 
Auditor 
in 
2005. 
A 
shift 
of 
emphasis 
from 
national 
to 
regional 
programmes 
in 
Europe 
would 
be 
beneficial. 
The 
loss 
of 
focus 
his 
delegation 
perceived 
in 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
was 
attributable 
to 
the 
long 
duration 
of 
the 
reorganization 
process. 
Improved 
performance 
and 
efficiency 
in 
technical 
cooperation, 
one 
of 
the 
cornerstones 
of 
the 
success 
of 
the 
Agency, 
were 
important. 
Hungary 
welcomed 
the 
agreement 
reached 
on 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
biennium 
and 
had 
pledged 
its 
voluntary 
contribution. 
It 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
pay 
their 
TCF 
and 
Regular 
Budget 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
68. 
Mr. 
ALOBIDI 
(Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya) 
said 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
of 
great 
importance 
because 
of 
its 
direct 
contribution 
to 
economic 
and 
social 
development. 
The 
Libyan 
Arab 
Jamahiriya 
was 
very 
grateful 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
in 
recent 
years, 
especially 
in 
the 
priority 
areas 
of 
health 
and 
water 
resource 
management. 
For 
its 
part, 
Libya 
had 
hosted 
a 
number 
of 
activities 
under 
national 
and 
regional 
projects, 
including 
a 
national 
workshop 
on 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
in 
March 
2006 
attended 
by 
48 
participants; 
a 
coordination 
meeting 
in 
July 
2006 
attended 
by 
representatives 
of 
UNDP, 
UNEP 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
a 
unified 
management 
programme 
for 
the 
Nubian 
sandstone 
aquifer 
system 
shared 
by 
Libya, 
Egypt, 
Sudan 
and 
Chad; 
a 
workshop 
in 
July 
2006 
on 
a 
national 
multi-function 
simulation 
project 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Renewable 
Energy 
and 
Water 
Desalination 
Centre 
in 
Tajoura; 
and 
a 
workshop 
in 
July 
and 
August 
2006 
under 
its 
project 
on 
sustainable 
energy 
and 
power 
planning 
study. 
69. 
Libya 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
transport 
safety 
and 
waste 
disposal. 
It 
had 
reorganized 
its 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Monitoring 
Bureau, 
which 
was 
now 
a 
General 
Environment 
Authority 
responsible 
for 
radiation 
monitoring, 
while 
the 
National 
Research 
and 
Development 
Bureau 
was 
now 
responsible 
for 
nuclear 
safety.

70. 
Libya 
participated 
in 
all 
Agency 
training 
courses, 
workshops 
and 
meetings 
on 
nuclear 
security 
and 
was 
a 
party 
to 
the 
CPPNM. 
It 
would 
host 
a 
workshop 
for 
Arab 
countries 
in 
November/December 
2006 
sponsored 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Renewable 
Energy 
and 
Water 
Desalination 
Centre 
on 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
research 
reactors. 
71. 
His 
country 
had 
made 
its 
position 
on 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
clear 
on 
many 
occasions 
at 
meetings 
of 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Disarmament 
Committee. 
It 
was 
also 
a 
party 
to 
many 
instruments 
aimed 
at 
freeing 
the 
world 
of 
such 
weapons. 
In 
keeping 
with 
the 
goals 
of 
the 
NPT, 
LibyaÂs 
Great 
Green 
Document 
on 
Human 
Rights 
in 
the 
Age 
of 
the 
Masses 
promulgated 
in 
1989 
prohibited 
the 
production 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
called 
on 
all 
countries 
to 
eliminate 
them, 
while 
retaining 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
to 
engage 
in 
research. 
Libya 
condemned 
unilateral 
measures 
aimed 
at 
restricting 
that 
right. 
72. 
The 
Jamahiriya 
was 
currently 
implementing 
the 
following 
projects: 
prospecting 
for 
radioactive 
material, 
mapping 
the 
whole 
country 
and 
deriving 
economic 
benefits 
from 
the 
results; 
building 
plants 
for 
the 
treatment, 
purification, 
concentration 
and 
mining 
of 
ore; 
using 
the 
Tajoura 
reactor 
to 
produce 
radioactive 
isotopes 
for 
use 
in 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
industry; 
and 
contracting 
for 
the 
building 
of 
a 
nuclear 
reactor 
for 
desalination 
and 
power 
generation. 
73. 
Libya 
was 
concerned 
that 
countries 
outside 
the 
NPT 
regime 
continued 
to 
develop 
military 
nuclear 
capabilities 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
major 
powers 
and 
had 
built 
up 
an 
arsenal 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
There 
was 
a 
dangerous 
security 
imbalance 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
that 
threatened 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
because 
one 
country 
possessed 
nuclear 
weapons. 
His 
country 
called 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
all 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
from 
the 
region 
and 
for 
Israel 
to 
place 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
international 
safeguards 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
NPT. 
The 
concern 
of 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region 
was 
reflected 
in 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
dating 
back 
to 
1974 
and 
in 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487 
(1981), 
which 
urged 
the 
countries 
of 
the 
Middle 
East 
to 
consider 
taking 
practical 
steps 
to 
establish 
a 
NWFZ, 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
place 
their 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
activities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
74. 
Libya 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
increase 
the 
representation 
of 
developing 
countries 
on 
its 
staff 
but 
noted 
that 
little 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
to 
date 
despite 
the 
considerable 
expertise 
that 
was 
now 
available 
in 
those 
countries. 
In 
particular, 
he 
called 
for 
better 
representation 
of 
developing 
countries, 
including 
his 
own, 
in 
high-level 
posts. 
75. 
Threats 
and 
intimidation 
were 
of 
no 
help 
in 
reaching 
a 
settlement 
to 
the 
issue 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
that 
satisfied 
all 
parties. 
Moreover, 
sanctions 
did 
not 
succeed 
in 
compelling 
countries 
to 
renounce 
their 
sovereignty 
and 
hurt 
ordinary 
people 
more 
than 
decision-makers. 
The 
use 
of 
force 
in 
relations 
between 
peoples 
was 
destructive 
and 
assisted 
extremists 
in 
recruiting 
supporters 
for 
their 
cause, 
as 
evidenced 
in 
Iraq 
and 
Afghanistan. 
Libya 
reaffirmed 
IranÂs 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
urged 
it 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
respond 
to 
all 
its 
demands 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
dispel 
any 
doubts 
about 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
Negotiations 
were 
the 
only 
appropriate 
way 
of 
dealing 
with 
the 
issue. 
76. 
It 
was 
now 
more 
urgent 
than 
ever 
to 
promote 
universal 
ratification 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
safeguards 
regime, 
including 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
Libya 
had 
ratified 
its 
own 
additional 
protocol 
on 
11 
July 
2006. 
Libya 
called 
on 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
draw 
up 
a 
programme 
for 
the 
elimination 
of 
their 
arsenals 
and 
to 
halt 
all 
activities 
involving 
such 
weapons. 
Otherwise 
the 
NPT 
would 
be 
meaningless. 
Libya 
had 
decided 
to 
suspend 
its 
programmes 
and 
destroy 
all 
materials 
that 
could 
be 
used 
to 
produce 
internationally 
prohibited 
weapons 
on 
19 
December 
2003. 
He 
urged 
Member 
States, 
especially 
the 
G8, 
to 
reward 
Libya 
by 
providing 
it 
with 
direct 
assistance 
so 
that 
it

became 
a 
model 
of 
what 
could 
be 
achieved 
through 
the 
voluntary 
abandonment 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 


77. 
Mr. 
ENKHTUVSHIN 
(Mongolia) 
expressed 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
goals, 
principles 
and 
programmes, 
including 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
had 
ratified 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
in 
July 
2006. 
78. 
Consolidation 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
vital 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
signing 
of 
the 
Treaty 
on 
a 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zone 
in 
Central 
Asia 
was 
an 
important 
step 
in 
that 
direction. 
That 
Treaty, 
together 
with 
MongoliaÂs 
nuclear-weapon-
free 
status, 
would 
contribute 
to 
strengthening 
trust 
and 
stability 
in 
Central 
Asia 
and 
beyond. 
Mongolia 
was 
pursuing 
its 
efforts 
to 
institutionalize 
its 
nuclear-weapon-free 
status 
at 
international 
level. 
The 
growing 
international 
recognition 
and 
support 
for 
that 
status 
had 
been 
expressed 
in 
both 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
international 
instruments, 
such 
as 
the 
joint 
statement 
between 
Mongolia 
and 
the 
PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
China 
of 
29 
November 
2005, 
the 
joint 
statement 
between 
Mongolia 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
on 
9 
May 
2006 
and 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
recent 
14th 
Summit 
of 
the 
NAM. 
A 
progress 
report 
by 
a 
recently 
established 
interministerial 
working 
group 
on 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Mongolian 
law 
on 
its 
nuclear-weapon-free 
status 
had 
found 
that 
the 
article 
prohibiting 
the 
transportation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
parts 
or 
components 
thereof 
or 
any 
other 
nuclear 
material 
designed 
or 
produced 
for 
weapons 
purposes 
through 
the 
territory 
of 
Mongolia 
had 
been 
difficult 
to 
implement 
owing 
to 
a 
shortage 
of 
trained 
personnel 
and 
relevant 
equipment. 
The 
report 
had 
made 
concrete 
recommendations 
on 
cooperation 
to 
be 
pursued 
with 
the 
international 
community 
in 
order 
to 
overcome 
those 
difficulties. 
Mongolia 
hoped 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
to 
enhance 
its 
capacity 
to 
control 
and 
account 
for 
nuclear 
material, 
physically 
protect 
nuclear 
material 
and 
nuclear 
facilities, 
and 
to 
prevent, 
detect 
and 
interdict 
the 
theft, 
illicit 
possession 
of 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material. 
79. 
Since 
1975, 
Mongolia 
had 
been 
a 
recipient 
of 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
assistance 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
agriculture, 
health 
care, 
geology, 
mining, 
energy, 
the 
environment, 
education 
and 
science 
applications, 
and 
the 
strengthening 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
In 
addition, 
many 
Mongolian 
specialists 
had 
participated 
in 
Agency-sponsored 
fellowship 
programmes, 
and 
several 
laboratories 
had 
been 
established 
to 
serve 
the 
needs 
of 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
government 
authorities, 
scientific 
institutes 
and 
universities. 
Projects 
being 
implemented 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
for 
2005Â2006 
included 
one 
to 
install 
a 
cobalt 
teletherapy 
machine 
at 
the 
State 
Oncology 
Research 
Centre, 
which 
had 
a 
great 
impact 
on 
the 
countryÂs 
health-care 
system. 
Under 
another 
project 
on 
integrated 
energy 
demand 
and 
supply 
planning 
through 
2025, 
Mongolian 
experts 
were 
acquiring 
the 
capacity 
for 
energy 
planning 
and 
could 
now 
assess 
energy 
demand 
and 
supply 
in 
greater 
detail. 
Mongolia 
had 
improved 
its 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructure 
thanks 
to 
assistance 
it 
had 
received 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Model 
Project 
on 
that 
topic. 
To 
determine 
the 
objectives 
and 
scope 
of 
its 
future 
cooperation, 
Mongolia 
was 
interested 
in 
discussing 
and 
modifying 
its 
CPF. 
80. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
expressed 
the 
hope 
that 
cooperation 
between 
Mongolia 
and 
the 
Agency 
would 
expand 
to 
encompass 
other 
areas 
of 
mutual 
interest. 
81. 
Mr. 
DUCA 
(Republic 
of 
Moldova) 
said 
that 
humanity 
was 
facing 
an 
era 
of 
rapid 
scientific 
and 
technological 
development 
and 
the 
need 
for 
energy 
sustainability 
and 
new 
technologies 
was 
becoming 
increasingly 
pressing. 
More 
and 
more 
countries 
had 
begun 
to 
review 
the 
role 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
in 
their 
economic 
development, 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
the 
important 
task 
of 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
such 
technologies.

82. 
Moldova 
was 
making 
an 
effort 
to 
develop 
its 
legislative 
framework 
to 
bring 
it 
in 
line 
with 
EU 
standards. 
Its 
commitment 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
was 
shown 
by 
the 
new 
national 
law 
concerning 
the 
safe 
implementation 
of 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
those 
involving 
ionizing 
radiation 
sources. 
83. 
All 
countries 
going 
through 
the 
transition 
to 
a 
market 
economy, 
including 
Moldova, 
were 
coping 
with 
economic 
decline 
or 
stagnation. 
Moldova 
had 
scarce 
energy 
resources 
and 
imported 
nearly 
all 
its 
energy 
from 
Ukraine 
and 
Russia. 
Prices 
were 
constantly 
rising 
and 
that 
further 
weakened 
its 
economy. 
The 
Moldovan 
Government 
was 
considering 
renewable 
and 
nuclear 
power 
as 
alternative 
energy 
sources 
and 
hoped 
for 
Agency 
technical 
assistance 
in 
that 
regard. 
84. 
Another 
source 
of 
concern 
in 
Moldova 
was 
possible 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
through 
the 
territory 
of 
Transnistria, 
which 
was 
not 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Government. 
85. 
During 
the 
49th 
General 
Conference, 
Moldova 
had 
signed 
a 
new 
CPF, 
identifying 
its 
priority 
areas 
for 
cooperation 
as 
nuclear 
equipment 
in 
human 
health, 
radiation 
processing, 
radiation 
safety, 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Under 
Agency 
cooperation 
projects, 
his 
country 
had 
received 
approximately 
$3 
million 
in 
assistance. 
Moldova 
had 
submitted 
three 
national 
projects 
for 
the 
next 
biennium 
on 
the 
use 
of 
linear 
accelerator 
technology 
in 
cancer 
treatment, 
the 
establishment 
of 
new 
industrial 
sectors 
based 
on 
radiation 
processing 
technology, 
and 
upgrading 
radiation 
monitoring 
capabilities. 
86. 
Moldova 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
for 
their 
support 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
safety 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
The 
countryÂs 
storage 
of 
sources 
now 
met 
international 
standards. 
Additional 
assistance 
from 
donor 
countries 
for 
the 
national 
project 
on 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
industrial 
radiation 
processing 
centre 
would 
be 
most 
appreciated 
as 
that 
project 
would 
have 
a 
considerable 
impact 
on 
such 
branches 
of 
the 
economy 
as 
pharmaceuticals, 
medicine, 
food 
and 
science. 
87. 
Aware 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
nuclear 
security, 
Moldova 
would 
pursue 
further 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Safeguards 
in 
order 
to 
comply 
with 
international 
norms 
and 
practices. 
In 
that 
context, 
his 
Government 
had 
officially 
expressed 
to 
the 
Agency 
its 
preparedness 
to 
sign 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
88. 
In 
its 
fifty 
years 
of 
existence, 
the 
Agency 
had 
played 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
most 
dynamic 
international 
organizations. 
He 
reiterated 
his 
GovernmentÂs 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
future 
activities. 
89. 
Mr. 
MACGREGOR 
(United 
Kingdom) 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
task 
of 
preventing 
proliferation 
and 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
SIR 
for 
2005 
recorded 
another 
year 
of 
valuable 
work 
in 
the 
crucial 
area 
of 
verification. 
The 
steady 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
States 
with 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
in 
force 
was 
encouraging. 
Also 
gratifying 
was 
the 
number 
of 
States 
for 
which 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
been 
able 
to 
conclude 
that 
all 
nuclear 
material 
was 
being 
used 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
That 
should 
become 
the 
norm 
for 
the 
international 
safeguards 
regime 
and 
he 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
not 
already 
done 
so 
rapidly 
to 
agree 
and 
bring 
into 
force 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
90. 
His 
country 
wished 
to 
see 
the 
safeguards 
system 
strengthened 
and 
was 
actively 
participating 
in 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
to 
that 
end. 
91. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
their 
continuing 
efforts 
to 
seek 
clarifications 
from 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran 
and 
to 
verify 
the 
status 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
was 
seriously 
concerned 
by 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
assessment 
that, 
after 
nearly 
four 

GC(50)/OR.6

15 


years 
of 
intense 
inspections, 
the 
Agency 
remained 
unable 
to 
make 
further 
progress 
in 
its 
efforts 
to 
verify 
the 
correctness 
and 
completeness 
of 
IranÂs 
declarations 
with 
a 
view 
to 
confirming 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
that 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 


92. 
His 
country 
fully 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006) 
which, 
inter 
alia, 
made 
it 
mandatory 
for 
Iran 
to 
suspend 
all 
enrichment 
related 
and 
reprocessing 
activities, 
including 
research 
and 
development. 
It 
also 
expressed 
the 
intention 
to 
adopt 
appropriate 
measures 
under 
Article 
41 
of 
Chapter 
VII 
of 
the 
United 
Nations 
Charter 
if 
Iran 
did 
not 
comply, 
and 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
to 
implement 
all 
transparency 
measures 
the 
Agency 
might 
request 
in 
support 
of 
its 
ongoing 
investigations. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
remained 
concerned 
by 
IranÂs 
continued 
failure 
to 
meet 
the 
frequently-stated 
requests 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
the 
Security 
Council. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
meetings 
between 
EU 
High 
Representative, 
Javier 
Solana, 
and 
the 
Iranian 
chief 
nuclear 
negotiator, 
Ali 
Larijani, 
but 
regretted 
that 
Iran 
had 
not 
yet 
taken 
the 
steps 
that 
would 
allow 
negotiations 
to 
resume 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
proposals 
made 
by 
six 
Member 
States. 
93. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
remained 
deeply 
concerned 
that 
the 
nuclear 
activities 
of 
the 
DPRK 
had 
been 
outside 
Agency 
verification 
since 
December 
2002. 
It 
continued 
to 
urge 
the 
DPRK 
to 
comply 
with 
all 
its 
international 
commitments 
fully, 
unconditionally 
and 
without 
delay, 
particularly 
with 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
under 
the 
NPT. 
He 
reiterated 
his 
countryÂs 
strong 
call 
urging 
the 
DPRK 
to 
abandon 
and 
completely 
dismantle 
any 
nuclear 
weapons 
related 
programme 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent, 
verifiable 
and 
irreversible 
manner. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006), 
which 
strongly 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
immediately 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
preconditions 
and 
implement 
the 
joint 
statement 
concluded 
in 
September 
2005. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
sought 
a 
peaceful 
and 
negotiated 
settlement 
to 
the 
North 
Korean 
nuclear 
issue. 
94. 
His 
country 
continued 
to 
support 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
work 
to 
combat 
potential 
threats 
from 
international 
nuclear 
terrorists. 
Much 
had 
already 
been 
achieved 
under 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
of 
Activities 
and 
the 
comprehensive 
plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
to 
increase 
awareness 
and 
assist 
States 
in 
improving 
their 
arrangements 
for 
preventing, 
detecting 
and 
responding 
to 
terrorist 
and 
other 
malicious 
acts. 
In 
the 
preceding 
year, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
donated 
approximately 
$900 
000 
to 
the 
NSF, 
bringing 
its 
total 
contribution 
to 
around 
$3.6 
million. 
He 
urged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
also. 
95. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
introduced 
national 
legislation 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
which 
would 
come 
into 
force 
from 
2 
October 
2006. 
96. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
the 
valuable 
IRRS 
mission 
to 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
in 
March 
2006. 
Its 
report 
should 
enhance 
public 
confidence 
in 
the 
United 
KingdomÂs 
nuclear 
regulatory 
system 
and 
in 
its 
health 
and 
safety 
effectiveness. 
The 
mission 
had 
shown 
that 
the 
IRRS 
could 
be 
deployed 
in 
countries 
with 
major 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
confirmed 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
modular 
approach 
in 
reviewing 
practices 
in 
such 
countries. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
would 
welcome 
further 
missions 
over 
the 
coming 
years 
to 
complete 
a 
more 
comprehensive 
review 
of 
its 
system 
for 
regulating 
nuclear, 
radiation 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
safety. 
97. 
As 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
the 
TCF, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
believed 
that 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
were 
a 
crucial 
element 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
increasing 
the 
AgencyÂs 
profile 
around 
the 
world 
and 
in 
furthering 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
The 
negotiations 
on 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
2007Â2008 
and 
an 
indicative 
planning 
figure 
for 
2009-2011 
had 
concluded 
successfully. 
However, 
the 
agreed 
increase 
in 
the 
TCF 
was 
higher 
than 
it 
should 
be 
to 
compensate 
for 
the 
fact 
that 
a 
large 
number 
of 
Member 
States 
were 
not 
meeting 
their 
obligations 
in 
full, 
which 
was 
not 
a 
responsible 
basis 
for 
budgetary 
planning.

98. 
On 
11 
July 
2006, 
his 
Government 
had 
published 
the 
conclusions 
of 
its 
energy 
review. 
It 
recognized 
that 
nuclear 
power 
might 
have 
a 
role 
to 
play 
in 
the 
countryÂs 
future 
energy 
mix, 
both 
as 
a 
source 
of 
low 
carbon 
generation 
and 
in 
diversifying 
energy 
supplies, 
and 
it 
also 
recognized 
that 
any 
new 
nuclear 
power 
stations 
would 
need 
to 
be 
proposed, 
developed, 
constructed 
and 
operated 
by 
the 
private 
sector, 
which 
would 
also 
meet 
their 
full 
decommissioning 
and 
long-term 
waste 
management 
costs. 
The 
Government 
proposed 
to 
examine 
ways 
to 
improve 
the 
processes 
for 
the 
licensing 
and 
planning 
of 
new 
reactors, 
and 
to 
clarify 
how 
the 
costs 
of 
decommissioning 
and 
waste 
management 
would 
be 
met. 
Its 
proposals 
were 
expected 
to 
appear 
early 
in 
2007. 
99. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
fully 
supported 
the 
proposition 
that 
a 
reliable 
nuclear 
fuel 
supply 
mechanism 
would 
foster 
international 
cooperation 
in 
promoting 
the 
safe 
and 
reliable 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
while 
contributing 
to 
non-proliferation. 
States 
had 
to 
decide 
whether 
or 
not 
to 
participate, 
balancing 
the 
value 
of 
the 
assurance 
against 
the 
huge 
cost 
and 
technological 
challenge 
of 
developing 
their 
own 
enrichment 
capabilities. 
The 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
been 
pleased 
to 
co-sponsor 
the 
concept 
for 
a 
multilateral 
mechanism 
for 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
at 
the 
June 
2006 
Board 
of 
Governors. 
Since 
then, 
it 
had 
been 
considering 
how 
that 
assurance 
could 
work 
in 
practice 
and 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
Special 
Event 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
lively 
and 
open 
debate 
it 
was 
generating. 
It 
was 
open 
to 
working 
with 
interested 
States 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
develop 
further 
the 
necessary 
commercial, 
non-proliferation, 
export 
and 
legal 
conditions 
to 
ensure 
the 
initiativeÂs 
success. 
100. 
It 
was 
vital 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
efficient, 
well-managed 
and 
forward-looking. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
few 
years, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
had 
actively 
supported 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
work 
to 
identify 
internal 
efficiencies 
and 
to 
manage 
change. 
It 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
progress 
to 
date 
and 
had 
donated 
a 
further 
$85 
000 
in 
2006 
to 
fund 
a 
management 
training 
programme 
for 
the 
Agency. 
101. 
Ms. 
MACMILLAN 
(New 
Zealand) 
said 
that 
nuclear 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
were 
key 
elements 
of 
her 
countryÂs 
foreign 
policy. 
Preventing 
the 
spread 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
under 
the 
NPT 
was 
a 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
and 
New 
Zealand 
offered 
its 
continued 
support 
in 
achieving 
that 
objective. 
It 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
constructively 
with 
all 
Member 
States 
in 
the 
next 
review 
cycle 
of 
the 
NPT 
for 
the 
strongest 
possible 
outcome 
on 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
102. 
One 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
key 
roles 
was 
to 
verify 
and 
assure 
Member 
States 
that 
nuclear 
material 
was 
not 
being 
diverted 
from 
peaceful 
uses. 
In 
order 
to 
fulfil 
that 
mandate, 
the 
Director 
General 
required 
the 
correct 
tools, 
including 
the 
additional 
protocol. 
New 
Zealand 
believed 
that 
the 
additional 
protocol 
was 
the 
contemporary 
verification 
standard 
and 
should 
be 
a 
condition 
of 
nuclear 
supply. 
It 
urged 
States 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so, 
to 
conclude 
additional 
protocols 
with 
the 
Agency 
without 
delay. 
103. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
supportive 
of 
the 
decision 
to 
modify 
the 
SQP 
in 
order 
to 
address 
weaknesses 
in 
the 
current 
safeguards 
system 
and 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
offer 
to 
assist 
small 
States 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
that 
decision. 
104. 
The 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
other 
malicious 
acts 
involving 
nuclear 
material 
remained 
real, 
transnational 
and 
multifaceted. 
New 
Zealand 
welcomed 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
and 
assured 
the 
Agency 
of 
its 
continued 
support 
for 
the 
NSF. 
105. 
As 
regards 
nuclear 
safety, 
New 
Zealand 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
principles 
and 
objectives 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
106. 
New 
Zealand 
continued 
to 
be 
concerned 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
inability 
reach 
a 
conclusion 
regarding 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities 
following 
its 
withdrawal 
from 
the 
NPT 
in 
2003. 
That 
countryÂs 
decision 
to 
pursue 
nuclear 
weapons 
posed 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the

stability 
and 
security 
of 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
region. 
The 
DPRKÂs 
missile 
tests 
in 
July 
2006 
had 
further 
jeopardized 
the 
security 
situation 
in 
the 
region, 
and 
New 
Zealand 
supported 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
condemning 
that 
action. 
At 
its 
meeting 
the 
previous 
week, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
had 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
continued 
dialogue 
to 
achieve 
a 
peaceful 
and 
comprehensive 
resolution 
to 
the 
issue. 
New 
Zealand 
fully 
supported 
the 
BoardÂs 
view 
that 
a 
successfully 
negotiated 
settlement 
of 
such 
a 
longstanding 
issue 
would 
be 
a 
significant 
accomplishment 
for 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
It 
therefore 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks. 


107. 
A 
further 
concern 
was 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
suspend 
its 
enrichment 
related 
activities 
and 
adhere 
to 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
in 
contravention 
of 
Board 
resolutions 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696. 
It 
therefore 
supported 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
report 
to 
the 
Board 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696, 
calling 
for 
Iran 
to 
suspend 
its 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
programme. 
New 
Zealand 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
verify 
the 
nature 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
called 
on 
Iran 
to 
provide 
the 
Agency 
with 
all 
the 
access 
and 
information 
it 
needed 
to 
undertake 
its 
task. 
Refraining 
from 
further 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
activities 
would 
represent 
a 
serious 
step 
forward 
in 
building 
international 
confidence 
and 
would 
meet 
a 
key 
requirement 
of 
resolution 
1696. 
New 
Zealand 
urged 
Iran 
to 
suspend 
its 
programme, 
and 
also 
any 
related 
R&D, 
and 
take 
the 
opportunity 
offered 
by 
the 
permanent 
members 
of 
the 
Security 
Council 
plus 
Germany 
to 
negotiate 
a 
solution. 
108. 
The 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
continued 
to 
be 
of 
considerable 
significance 
to 
New 
Zealand 
since 
such 
shipments 
occasionally 
passed 
its 
shores. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
highest 
possible 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
were 
adhered 
to, 
that 
appropriate 
information 
was 
sent 
in 
advance 
of 
any 
transports 
that 
might 
take 
place 
through 
the 
Pacific, 
that 
proper 
emergency 
response 
systems 
were 
in 
operation 
and 
that 
an 
effective 
liability 
and 
compensation 
mechanism 
was 
in 
place. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
progress 
being 
made 
in 
many 
of 
those 
areas 
and 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
continue 
to 
strive 
for 
improvements 
where 
possible. 
109. 
New 
Zealand 
appreciated 
the 
valuable 
role 
that 
INLEX 
had 
played 
in 
examining 
the 
application 
and 
scope 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
liability 
regime. 
It 
also 
welcomed 
the 
explanatory 
commentary 
developed 
to 
clarify 
the 
scope 
and 
content 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
latest 
nuclear 
liability 
instruments 
and 
the 
outreach 
workshops 
being 
held 
to 
explain 
the 
nature 
and 
content 
of 
the 
international 
regime. 
New 
Zealand 
continued 
to 
attach 
importance 
to 
INLEXÂs 
consideration 
of 
possible 
gaps 
in 
the 
regime 
and 
ways 
in 
which 
to 
address 
any 
such 
gaps. 
110. 
Her 
country 
welcomed 
the 
report 
on 
the 
TranSAS 
mission 
to 
Japan. 
Given 
that 
shipments 
passing 
New 
Zealand 
were 
generally 
travelling 
between 
Japan 
and 
Europe, 
JapanÂs 
willingness 
to 
accept 
such 
a 
mission 
was 
especially 
appreciated. 
New 
Zealand 
welcomed 
the 
continued 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
towards 
an 
understanding 
of 
further 
practice 
which 
met 
the 
concerns 
of 
both 
sides. 
111. 
As 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
the 
NPT, 
New 
Zealand 
upheld 
the 
principle 
of 
access 
to 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
uses, 
in 
particular 
to 
the 
many 
civilian 
applications 
which 
were 
not 
related 
to 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
and 
which 
could 
enhance 
the 
lives 
of 
millions 
of 
people 
worldwide. 
New 
Zealand 
had 
rejected 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
for 
itself, 
not 
believing 
it 
to 
be 
compatible 
with 
the 
concept 
of 
sustainable 
development, 
given 
the 
long-term 
financial 
and 
ecological 
costs 
associated 
with 
the 
disposal 
of 
nuclear 
waste. 
New 
Zealand 
was 
also 
concerned 
about 
any 
associated 
nuclear 
weapon 
proliferation 
risks. 
112. 
The 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
currently 
facing 
an 
increased 
challenge. 
It 
was 
imperative 
that 
the 
international 
community 
work 
together 
to 
agree 
and 
coordinate 
effective 
responses 
to 
meet 
that 
challenge. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
that 
collective 
response, 
working 
with 
Member 
States 
to 
safeguard 
and 
secure 
nuclear 
materials 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes.

113. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada) 
said 
her 
country 
continued 
in 
its 
five-decade 
tradition 
of 
being 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission. 
With 
its 
highly 
advanced 
nuclear 
sector 
and 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
broader 
safeguards 
conclusion, 
Canada 
stood 
ready 
to 
expand 
the 
use 
of 
radioisotopes 
for 
nuclear 
medicine, 
to 
provide 
uranium 
as 
a 
reliable 
source 
of 
clean 
energy 
and 
to 
advance 
peaceful 
nuclear 
power 
applications 
throughout 
the 
world. 
114. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
verifying 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
legally-binding 
commitments 
under 
that 
Treaty 
was 
unique 
and 
essential. 
Recent 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
had 
enabled 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
draw 
broader 
safeguards 
conclusions 
which, 
in 
turn, 
increased 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
a 
StateÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Canada 
called 
on 
all 
States 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accept 
that 
enhanced 
verification 
standard 
by 
entering 
into 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol. 
Also, 
it 
reiterated 
its 
call 
to 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so, 
to 
join 
the 
NPT 
as 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
and 
to 
place 
the 
full 
scope 
of 
their 
nuclear 
activities 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Canada 
welcomed 
IndiaÂs 
expression 
of 
support 
for 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
goals 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
learning 
more 
about 
the 
implementation 
of 
IndiaÂs 
national 
measures 
to 
meet 
such 
goals, 
including 
how 
a 
robust 
safeguards 
regime 
might 
be 
implemented. 
115. 
Drawing 
conclusions 
on 
the 
correctness 
and 
completeness 
of 
a 
Member 
StateÂs 
declarations 
was 
a 
difficult 
task 
under 
the 
best 
of 
circumstances, 
but 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Iran 
the 
challenge 
was 
much 
greater. 
Canada 
commended 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
resolve 
questions 
relating 
to 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
already 
noted 
that 
Iran 
had 
maintained 
a 
policy 
of 
concealment 
for 
nearly 
two 
decades. 
The 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
the 
Security 
Council 
had 
requested 
additional 
access 
and 
transparency 
measures 
beyond 
those 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
that 
Iran 
had 
signed, 
but 
had 
yet 
to 
ratify. 
Canada 
called 
upon 
Iran 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
calls 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
the 
requirements 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696. 
Only 
then 
could 
it 
bridge 
the 
confidence 
gap 
created 
by 
its 
past 
non-compliance 
and 
policy 
of 
concealment 
and 
re-emerge 
as 
a 
State 
fully 
prepared 
to 
exercise 
its 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
116. 
CanadaÂs 
concerns 
about 
the 
significant 
quantities 
of 
unsafeguarded 
nuclear 
material 
in 
the 
DPRK 
had 
been 
compounded 
in 
February 
2005 
when 
the 
DPRK 
had 
declared 
that 
it 
was 
in 
the 
possession 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
Â 
a 
statement 
that 
stood 
in 
stark 
contrast 
to 
other 
statements 
and 
commitments 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
made 
in 
support 
of 
a 
Korean 
Peninsula 
free 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
That 
statement 
also 
called 
into 
question 
the 
purpose 
of 
its 
ballistic 
missile 
programme, 
which 
was 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
deep 
concern 
expressed 
in 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695. 
Canada 
called 
on 
all 
parties, 
especially 
the 
DPRK, 
to 
return 
immediately 
and 
without 
precondition 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
Canada 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would 
fulfil 
its 
commitment 
to 
abandon 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes 
in 
a 
transparent 
and 
verifiable 
manner. 
117. 
Her 
country 
attached 
considerable 
importance 
to 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
safeguards 
system 
that 
was 
responsive 
to 
new 
verification 
challenges 
and 
continued 
to 
provide 
the 
basis 
for 
credible 
safeguards 
conclusions. 
It 
supported 
a 
system 
that 
utilized 
a 
State-level 
perspective 
and 
was 
both 
transparent 
in 
its 
processes 
and 
non-discriminatory 
in 
its 
implementation. 
Canada 
looked 
forward 
to 
continuing 
to 
work 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
the 
safeguards 
system 
in 
general, 
and 
to 
implement 
an 
effective 
and 
efficient 
State-level 
integrated 
safeguards 
approach 
in 
Canada. 
118. 
As 
regards 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
Canada 
was 
very 
pleased 
to 
announce 
an 
additional 
contribution 
of 
four 
million 
Canadian 
dollars 
to 
the 
NSF, 
bringing 
its 
total 
contribution 
to 
over 
eight 
million 
Canadian 
dollars. 
That 
was 
part 
of 
the 
countryÂs 
continued 
participation 
in 
the 
G8 
Global 
Partnership 
Against 
the 
Spread 
of 
Weapons 
and 
Materials 
of 
Mass 
Destruction. 
Canada 
was 
proud 
once 
again 
to 
be 
the 
second 
largest 
donor 
to 
the 
NSF.

119. 
Her 
country 
hoped 
to 
continue 
working 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
Russia 
and 
countries 
of 
the 
former 
Soviet 
Union 
to 
implement 
Canadian-funded 
activities 
aimed, 
in 
particular, 
at 
physical 
protection 
upgrades 
and 
training, 
as 
well 
as 
projects 
to 
enhance 
capabilities 
to 
prevent 
the 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
substances 
and 
projects 
to 
recover 
and 
secure 
such 
substances. 
Such 
a 
large 
voluntary 
commitment 
was 
a 
concrete 
demonstration 
of 
CanadaÂs 
view 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
nuclear 
security 
activities 
were 
an 
integral 
part 
of 
global 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
security 
in 
order 
to 
prevent, 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
acts 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
Her 
delegation 
encouraged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
contributions 
also. 
Canada 
would 
like 
to 
see 
more 
nuclear 
security 
activities 
financed 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
to 
ensure 
predictable 
and 
assured 
funding 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
PlanÂs 
critical 
activities. 
120. 
CanadaÂs 
participation 
in 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
affirmed 
the 
importance 
it 
attached 
to 
safe 
and 
secure 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
Its 
national 
report 
had 
described 
how 
CanadaÂs 
Nuclear 
Waste 
Management 
Organization 
was 
implementing 
its 
long-term 
plan 
for 
waste 
management. 
The 
Organization 
had 
published 
its 
final 
study 
report 
in 
November 
2005 
after 
extensive 
public 
consultations. 
121. 
International 
standards, 
in 
particular 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safety 
standards, 
should 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
ensuring 
consistent 
approaches 
and 
common 
objectives 
as 
regards 
nuclear 
safety. 
The 
Canadian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Commission 
(CNSC), 
for 
its 
part, 
continued 
to 
apply 
international 
standards 
in 
regulating 
domestic 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
encouraged 
other 
regulatory 
bodies 
to 
do 
the 
same. 
To 
improve 
further 
its 
regulatory 
mechanisms, 
the 
Nuclear 
Waste 
Management 
Organization 
was 
using 
the 
AgencyÂs 
IRRS. 
122. 
Canada 
had 
undertaken 
to 
strengthen 
its 
regulatory 
regime 
in 
anticipation 
of 
the 
application 
of 
the 
provisions 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
Canada 
had 
a 
sealed 
source 
tracking 
system 
and 
a 
national 
register 
of 
such 
sources, 
which 
allowed 
stricter 
control 
over 
their 
use 
and 
movement. 
Strengthened 
controls 
on 
the 
import 
and 
export 
of 
high-risk 
radioactive 
sources 
would 
be 
fully 
implemented 
early 
in 
2007. 
She 
called 
on 
Member 
States 
to 
continue 
to 
work 
together 
to 
ensure 
the 
consistent 
and 
harmonized 
implementation 
of 
such 
important 
standards. 
123. 
Adoption 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
of 
Research 
Reactors 
had 
highlighted 
the 
importance 
of 
research 
reactor 
safety 
and 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
improvement 
and 
harmonization 
of 
other 
international 
practices 
in 
that 
area. 
Canada, 
with 
its 
considerable 
experience 
in 
the 
regulation 
of 
research 
reactors, 
looked 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
the 
international 
community 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
to 
improve 
the 
safety 
of 
research 
reactors 
worldwide. 
124. 
The 
very 
rapid 
growth 
in 
energy 
demand 
expected 
in 
the 
twenty-first 
century 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
foresee 
a 
viable 
and 
environmentally-sound 
strategy 
that 
did 
not 
include 
nuclear 
energy. 
In 
the 
short 
term, 
Canada 
was 
refurbishing 
three 
CANDU 
reactors, 
with 
a 
decision 
pending 
on 
a 
fourth 
and, 
in 
August 
2006, 
the 
CNSC 
had 
received 
a 
request 
for 
siting 
licence 
for 
nuclear 
reactors. 
125. 
With 
over 
fifty 
years 
of 
experience 
in 
nuclear 
technology 
innovations, 
Canada 
was 
a 
world 
leader 
in 
promoting 
nuclear 
energy 
as 
a 
low-level 
emissions 
solution 
and 
in 
adapting 
that 
resource 
to 
meet 
future 
energy 
needs. 
Her 
Government, 
in 
association 
with 
Atomic 
Energy 
of 
Canada 
Limited, 
was 
developing 
on 
advanced 
CANDU 
reactor 
with 
enhanced 
features 
in 
terms 
of 
safety, 
profitability 
and 
non-proliferation. 
126. 
Canada 
remained 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
ranging 
from 
insect 
sterilization 
to 
cancer 
treatment 
and 
was 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
the 
TCF. 
Her 
delegation 
urged 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
to 
continue 
its 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
better 
prioritization 
and 
more 
efficient 
and 
effective 
management. 
The 
excellent 
Technical 
Cooperation 
Report 
for 
2005 
had 

GC(50)/OR.6 
20 
September 
2006,

demonstrated 
the 
value 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Canada 
called 
on 
all 
States 
to 
make 
their 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
it 
on 
time 
and, 
where 
possible, 
in 
full. 


127. 
Mr. 
PANUPONG 
(Thailand) 
said 
that 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
provided 
an 
opportunity 
to 
reflect 
on 
past 
achievements. 
The 
credibility 
of 
the 
Agency 
in 
fulfilling 
its 
mandates 
had 
stood 
the 
test 
of 
time 
and 
its 
high 
standard 
of 
professionalism, 
integrity 
and 
impartiality 
had 
been 
justly 
rewarded 
with 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005. 
He 
reaffirmed 
ThailandÂs 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities. 
128. 
As 
a 
medium-sized 
developing 
country, 
Thailand 
pursued 
people-centred 
development 
and 
the 
attainment 
of 
the 
United 
nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Agency, 
that 
translated 
into 
a 
commitment 
to 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
many 
areas 
of 
socio-economic 
development. 
The 
sharp 
increase 
in 
world 
oil 
prices 
and 
growing 
concerns 
over 
future 
energy 
demands 
and 
climate 
change 
had 
led 
to 
renewed 
interest 
in 
nuclear 
power 
in 
many 
countries, 
including 
Thailand. 
It 
was 
therefore 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
organizing 
the 
International 
Seminar 
on 
Facts 
of 
Nuclear 
Power 
for 
Electricity 
Generation, 
in 
Bangkok, 
from 
19 
to 
22 
July 
2006, 
which 
had 
helped 
to 
raise 
public 
awareness 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Thailand 
hoped 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
any 
follow-up 
to 
that 
Seminar. 
His 
delegation 
also 
welcomed 
the 
General 
Conference 
Special 
Event 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation. 
129. 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation 
had 
benefited 
Thailand 
in 
terms 
of 
human 
resource 
development, 
mostly 
in 
the 
form 
of 
expert 
services, 
fellowships, 
training 
courses 
and 
scientific 
visits, 
and 
also 
the 
procurement 
of 
equipment. 
The 
main 
areas 
of 
technical 
cooperation 
were 
the 
application 
of 
isotopes 
and 
radiation 
in 
agriculture, 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety, 
nuclear 
security, 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
nuclear 
engineering 
and 
technology. 
130. 
Besides 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
target, 
which 
it 
had 
pledged 
in 
full, 
and 
payment 
of 
its 
NPCs, 
Thailand 
also 
supported 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
kind. 
At 
the 
regional 
level 
and 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
TCDC, 
Thailand 
had 
hosted 
many 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visitors 
from 
other 
Member 
States 
and 
had 
also 
provided 
expert 
services 
to 
other 
Member 
States. 
131. 
One 
area 
of 
tangible 
progress 
through 
cooperation 
was 
food 
irradiation, 
which 
was 
gaining 
acceptance 
among 
Thai 
consumers. 
Six 
types 
of 
irradiated 
fresh 
fruit 
would 
soon 
be 
ready 
for 
export. 
Other 
applications 
included 
the 
increasing 
use 
of 
the 
SIT 
to 
control 
insect 
pests 
on 
plantations 
and, 
in 
human 
health, 
of 
PET 
and 
cyclotrons, 
which 
were 
already 
in 
use 
at 
three 
main 
hospitals 
in 
Bangkok. 
Based 
on 
the 
success 
of 
those 
projects, 
Thailand 
hoped 
to 
intensify 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
coming 
five 
years 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
new 
nuclear 
research 
centre, 
the 
application 
of 
isotope 
techniques 
for 
analysis, 
the 
use 
of 
isotope 
hydrology 
in 
water 
resource 
management, 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nutrition 
and 
nuclear 
medicine, 
and 
for 
an 
economic 
study 
on 
nuclear 
power 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
132. 
ThailandÂs 
nuclear 
infrastructure 
had 
been 
reorganized. 
The 
Office 
of 
Atoms 
for 
Peace 
(OAP), 
the 
national 
nuclear 
competent 
authority, 
had 
been 
restructured 
into 
two 
entities: 
the 
Thailand 
Institute 
of 
Nuclear 
Technology, 
taking 
responsibility 
for 
research 
and 
development; 
and 
the 
existing 
OAP 
retaining 
its 
regulatory 
and 
policy-making 
functions. 
Revision 
of 
the 
1961 
Atomic 
Energy 
for 
Peace 
Act 
was 
planned 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
more 
effective 
and 
consistent 
with 
international 
instruments. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
had 
been 
helpful 
for 
those 
initiatives. 
The 
Center 
for 
the 
Non-Proliferation 
Treaty 
had 
been 
established 
within 
the 
OAP 
to 
enhance 
its 
regulatory 
role 
in 
safeguarding 
nuclear 
materials 
in 
Thailand 
and 
to 
ensure 
compliance 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement, 
and 
an 
SSAC 
was 
also 
being 
developed. 
The 
Bureau 
of 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Regulation 
at 
the 
OAP 
was 
responsible 
for 
regulating 
all 
nuclear 
safety 
activities 
in 
Thailand 
and 
the 
regulatory 
requirements 
for 
nuclear 
reactor 
licensees, 
and 
a 
number 
of 
standards, 
procedures, 
guides 
and 
codes 
of 
conduct, 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 

GC(50)/OR.6 
20

21 


safety 
series 
documents, 
were 
being 
developed 
and 
promulgated. 
Nuclear 
safety 
in 
Thailand 
had 
been 
strengthened 
in 
several 
areas 
thanks 
to 
Agency 
assistance. 
Under 
the 
Model 
Project, 
Thailand 
had 
been 
upgrading 
its 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
so 
as 
to 
be 
consistent 
with 
the 
BSS 
and, 
under 
a 
regional 
project, 
it 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
towards 
enhancing 
the 
authorization 
process, 
although 
further 
development 
was 
required. 


133. 
As 
a 
non-nuclear-weapon 
State, 
Thailand 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
sanctity 
of 
the 
NPT 
as 
the 
global 
instrument 
that 
governed 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
It 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
not 
developing, 
possessing, 
acquiring, 
using 
or 
transferring 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
related 
materials. 
Despite 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
strenuous 
efforts 
to 
strengthen 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
verification, 
the 
events 
of 
2005, 
including 
the 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
had 
shown 
that 
more 
needed 
to 
be 
done. 
134. 
The 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime 
was 
also 
strengthened 
by 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
1540 
(2004) 
and 
1673 
(2006) 
on 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Notwithstanding 
its 
positive 
contribution 
to 
worldwide 
security 
and 
stability, 
non-proliferation 
should 
not 
be 
considered 
a 
one-way 
street 
and 
more 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
towards 
universal 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Thailand 
associated 
itself 
with 
the 
long-standing 
position 
of 
the 
NAM 
which 
called 
for 
all 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
continue 
to 
work 
towards 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
135. 
Thailand 
had 
followed 
the 
recent 
developments 
in 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
with 
great 
concern, 
particularly 
the 
test-firing 
of 
missiles 
by 
the 
DPRK 
on 
5 
July 
2006, 
which 
had 
had 
adverse 
repercussions 
on 
the 
peace 
and 
stability 
of 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
region. 
Although 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006) 
had 
been 
rejected 
by 
the 
DPRK, 
Thailand 
hoped 
that 
the 
DPRK 
would 
consider 
a 
moratorium 
on 
missile 
testing. 
His 
delegation 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
implement 
the 
joint 
statement 
on 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
to 
resume 
the 
six-party 
talks 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
in 
order 
to 
resolve 
the 
situation 
peacefully. 
Thailand 
was 
ready 
to 
play 
a 
constructive 
role 
in 
that 
regard. 
136. 
Another 
pressing 
proliferation 
challenge 
was 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
uranium 
enrichment 
capabilities. 
Thailand 
believed 
in 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
all 
NPT 
States 
Party 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
but 
in 
a 
transparent 
manner, 
especially 
in 
the 
context 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol. 
Thailand 
supported 
the 
proposal 
of 
a 
long-term 
comprehensive 
agreement, 
offered 
to 
Iran 
by 
the 
six 
countries 
on 
1 
June 
2006, 
as 
a 
constructive 
way 
of 
resolving 
the 
situation 
through 
dialogue 
and 
diplomacy. 
Adoption 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
on 
31 
July 
2006 
did 
not 
mean 
that 
the 
window 
of 
opportunity 
for 
negotiations 
was 
no 
longer 
open. 
Thailand 
urged 
Iran 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
providing 
information 
on 
its 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
urged 
all 
parties 
to 
exercise 
the 
utmost 
restraint 
and 
to 
avoid 
confrontation. 
137. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
expressed 
support 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
party 
to 
the 
Bangkok 
Treaty, 
Thailand 
was 
keen 
to 
share 
its 
experiences 
in 
that 
regard. 
138. 
Mr. 
ZSOMBORI 
(Romania) 
said 
that 
his 
Government 
was 
more 
interested 
than 
ever 
in 
nuclear 
power 
as 
a 
reliable 
source 
of 
energy. 
In 
recent 
years, 
Romania 
had 
achieved 
sustained 
economic 
growth 
and, 
consequently, 
the 
demand 
for 
electricity 
was 
expected 
to 
increase 
steadily 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
decade. 
Based 
on 
that 
positive 
trend, 
which 
had 
been 
confirmed 
by 
several 
national 
and 
international 
studies, 
and 
on 
the 
high 
standards 
of 
national 
nuclear 
safety, 
the 
Romanian 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
complete 
work 
on 
Unit 
2 
of 
the 
Cernavoda 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
and 
restart 
work 
on 
Units 
3 
and 
4. 
139. 
In 
May 
2006, 
RomaniaÂs 
footnote-a/ 
project, 
ROM/4/024, 
to 
convert 
the 
TRIGA 
research 
reactor 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU, 
had 
reached 
successful 
completion. 
Its 
implementation 
had 
been 
possible

thanks 
to 
a 
voluntary 
contribution 
of 
$4 
million 
from 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy. 
The 
Romanian 
Government 
had 
contributed 
$500 
000 
and 
the 
TCF 
had 
allocated 
approximately 
$400 
000 
to 
the 
project. 
The 
agreement 
signed 
between 
the 
United 
States, 
Romania 
and 
the 
Agency, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Agency 
regulations, 
had 
provided 
a 
legal 
basis 
for 
the 
transfer 
of 
the 
LEU 
fresh 
fuel 
and 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
commercial 
contract. 
The 
project 
had 
been 
very 
important 
for 
Romania 
as 
the 
TRIGA 
reactor 
was 
a 
major 
part 
of 
its 
nuclear 
sector. 
The 
successful 
completion 
of 
the 
project 
confirmed 
RomaniaÂs 
commitment 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
readiness 
to 
cooperate 
with 
all 
interested 
parties 
in 
that 
regard. 
The 
project 
also 
reconfirmed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capacity 
to 
fulfil 
its 
mandate 
of 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power 
in 
the 
world. 
Romania 
was 
grateful 
to 
all 
at 
the 
Agency 
who 
had 
contributed 
to 
implementation 
of 
the 
project. 
The 
project 
proved 
that 
States 
could 
make 
considerable 
progress 
in 
enhancing 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
if 
they 
had 
the 
political 
will 
and 
a 
clear 
strategy, 
and 
worked 
in 
a 
spirit 
of 
cooperation 
and 
understanding. 
The 
conversion 
of 
the 
TRIGA 
reactor 
was 
the 
first 
project 
of 
its 
kind 
completed 
since 
the 
launch 
of 
the 
Global 
Threat 
Reduction 
Initiative 
in 
May 
2004. 
In 
RomaniaÂs 
view, 
that 
initiative 
was 
viable, 
responded 
to 
the 
needs 
of 
all 
interested 
parties 
and 
offered 
new 
cooperation 
opportunities. 
Cooperation 
in 
implementing 
such 
projects 
was 
complex, 
involving 
technical, 
commercial, 
legal, 
safeguards 
and 
safety 
issues. 
Romania 
thanked 
the 
United 
States 
and 
French 
authorities 
for 
their 
assistance 
in 
the 
smooth 
and 
timely 
implementation 
of 
the 
project, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
French 
company 
CERCA, 
which 
was 
the 
supplier 
of 
the 
LEU 
fuel. 
The 
participation 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
all 
interested 
States 
operating 
HEU 
research 
reactors 
was 
crucial 
to 
the 
success 
of 
the 
initiative. 


140. 
Another 
high-priority 
Agency 
project 
in 
Romania 
was 
the 
decommissioning 
of 
the 
VVR-S 
research 
reactor. 
Despite 
a 
slow 
start 
three 
years 
previously, 
the 
project 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
the 
preceding 
year. 
Romania 
was 
working 
together 
with 
the 
Russian 
authorities 
to 
seek 
a 
solution 
to 
returning 
the 
S36-type 
spent 
fuel 
to 
Russia. 
The 
remaining 
EK10-type 
spent 
fuel 
was 
the 
subject 
of 
a 
tripartite 
agreement 
among 
Romania, 
Ukraine 
and 
Russia, 
which 
Romania 
hoped 
to 
conclude 
as 
promptly 
as 
possible 
order 
to 
return 
the 
spent 
fuel 
to 
Russia 
before 
the 
start 
of 
the 
decommissioning 
process. 
It 
was 
also 
the 
subject 
of 
an 
agreement 
between 
Romania 
and 
Russia, 
which 
was 
at 
an 
advanced 
stage 
of 
negotiation. 
Romania 
welcomed 
the 
organization 
of 
the 
workshop 
on 
transit 
arrangements 
for 
research 
reactor 
irradiated 
fuel 
shipments 
to 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
held 
in 
Vienna 
in 
July 
2006 
under 
the 
RER/4/028 
project. 
Romania 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
take 
the 
lead 
in 
preparing 
and 
proposing 
framework 
agreements 
regarding 
the 
transit 
and 
repatriation 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel 
to 
its 
country 
of 
origin. 
141. 
His 
Government 
was 
ready 
to 
lend 
its 
active 
support 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
use 
RomaniaÂs 
nuclear 
facilities 
in 
the 
implementation 
of 
some 
projects. 
An 
example 
of 
the 
good 
cooperation 
between 
Romania 
and 
the 
Agency 
was 
the 
visit 
made 
to 
the 
country 
by 
the 
Deputy 
Director 
General 
for 
Technical 
Cooperation 
in 
August 
2006. 
Once 
Romania 
became 
a 
member 
of 
the 
EU, 
its 
funding 
from 
the 
Agency 
for 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
would 
decrease 
and 
gradually 
it 
would 
be 
able 
to 
make 
increasingly 
significant 
contributions 
as 
a 
donor. 
142. 
In 
accordance 
with 
its 
national 
nuclear 
strategy, 
Romania 
paid 
special 
attention 
to 
the 
development 
and 
adoption 
of 
a 
proper 
legislative 
framework, 
harmonized 
with 
the 
European 
CommissionÂs 
recommendations. 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
nuclear 
sector, 
Romania 
had 
fulfilled 
all 
of 
its 
requirements 
for 
integration 
into 
the 
EU 
on 
1 
January 
2007. 
143. 
The 
SIR 
for 
2005, 
reconfirming 
the 
SIR 
for 
2004, 
listed 
Romania 
as 
one 
of 
the 
24 
States 
for 
which 
the 
Secretariat 
had 
drawn 
the 
conclusion 
that 
there 
was 
no 
indication 
of 
the 
diversion 
of 
declared 
nuclear 
material 
from 
peaceful 
nuclear 
activities 
and 
no 
indication 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material 
or 
activities. 
That 
conclusion 
was 
based 
on 
a 
comprehensive 
assessment 
made 
by 
the 
Agency, 
including 
under 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol.

Romania, 
which 
supported 
efforts 
to 
combat 
international 
terrorism 
and 
to 
implement 
the 
AgencyÂs 
action 
plan 
against 
nuclear 
terrorism 
adopted 
in 
2002, 
was 
a 
contributor 
to 
the 
NSF. 
In 
2003 
and 
2004, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security, 
it 
had 
organized 
regional 
pilot 
courses 
on 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
the 
illicit 
trafficking 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
As 
confirmation 
of 
its 
interest 
in 
further 
strengthening 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
that 
area, 
Romania 
had 
made 
another 
voluntary 
contribution 
of 
Â27 
800 
in 
May 
2006. 
145. 
The 
final 
report 
of 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention, 
held 
in 
Vienna 
earlier 
in 
the 
year, 
recognized 
RomaniaÂs 
commitment 
to 
improvement 
of 
the 
situation 
through 
international 
cooperation 
and 
assistance. 
Also, 
it 
had 
drawn 
attention 
to 
the 
quality 
and 
comprehensiveness 
of 
RomaniaÂs 
national 
report 
and 
its 
replies 
to 
written 
and 
oral 
questions. 
146. 
Romania 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
It 
was 
complying 
with 
the 
objectives 
and 
principles 
of 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
by 
developing, 
harmonizing 
and 
implementing 
specific 
policies, 
laws 
and 
regulations 
and 
by 
encouraging 
international 
cooperation. 
147. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
underlined 
RomaniaÂs 
support 
for 
the 
Agency, 
inter 
alia, 
by 
its 
consistent 
and 
full 
payment 
of 
its 
assessed 
contributions 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
its 
pledges 
to 
the 
TCF. 
148. 
Mr. 
BEKOE 
(Ghana) 
passed 
on 
his 
countryÂs 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
winning 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
Ghana 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
decision 
to 
use 
its 
share 
of 
the 
prize 
to 
create 
a 
special 
fund 
to 
support 
fellowships 
and 
training 
to 
improve 
cancer 
control 
and 
the 
use 
of 
stable 
isotope 
techniques 
in 
childhood 
nutritional 
studies 
in 
developing 
countries. 
149. 
Ghana 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
to 
preserve 
and 
promote 
peace 
and 
security 
through 
prevention 
of 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
other 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Ghana 
urged 
all 
African 
States 
to 
sign 
and 
ratify 
the 
Pelindaba 
Treaty 
and 
abide 
by 
its 
terms, 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
a 
NWFZ 
in 
Africa. 
150. 
Ghana 
supported 
the 
United 
States-initiated 
Reduced 
Enrichment 
for 
Research 
and 
Test 
Reactors 
Programme 
and 
had 
decided 
to 
convert 
its 
own 
low-power 
research 
reactor 
from 
HEU 
to 
LEU, 
provided 
that 
only 
minimal 
changes 
to 
the 
fuel 
and 
core 
geometry 
were 
required 
and 
that 
the 
reactorÂs 
safety 
and 
performance 
would 
not 
be 
seriously 
compromised. 
151. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
efforts 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
Ghana 
was 
developing 
its 
capacity 
to 
prevent, 
detect 
and 
respond 
to 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
The 
staff 
of 
the 
national 
regulatory 
authority, 
operators 
of 
nuclear 
installations 
and 
stakeholders 
in 
law 
enforcement 
organizations 
were 
receiving 
appropriate 
training 
in 
that 
regard. 
Ghana 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
organizing 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
in 
Accra 
on 
combating 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
and 
for 
the 
recent 
INSServ 
mission. 
The 
results 
and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
mission 
would 
be 
carefully 
evaluated 
and 
implemented 
to 
strengthen 
nuclear 
security 
in 
Ghana. 
Measures 
would 
be 
put 
in 
place 
to 
ensure 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
facilities 
and 
radioactive 
sources, 
to 
streamline 
the 
legal 
system 
and 
to 
respond 
effectively 
to 
any 
emergency. 
152. 
Ghana 
recognized 
and 
appreciated 
the 
positive 
use 
of 
both 
human 
and 
natural 
resources 
and 
the 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
addressing 
socio-economic 
problems. 
The 
countryÂs 
research 
and 
commercial 
activities 
focused 
on 
human 
and 
animal 
health, 
nutrition, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
the 
environment. 
Mutation 
breeding 
and 
biotechnology 
research 
projects 
were 
planned 
with 
a 
view 
to

attaining 
higher 
agricultural 
productivity 
and 
developing 
animal 
and 
crop 
variants 
tolerant 
to 
stress 
and 
disease. 
Studies 
had 
already 
been 
initiated 
to 
obtain 
vital 
information 
on 
air 
quality 
through 
biomonitoring 
so 
as 
to 
influence 
policies 
for 
the 
development 
of

and 
nuclear 
medicine 
in 
Ghana 
had 
increased 
the 
capacity 
for 
the 
diagnosis 
and 
treatment 
of 
cancer 
patients 
both 
in 
Ghana 
and 
the 
surrounding 
countries. 
Also 
on 
the 
health 
front, 
he 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
initiating 
PACT 
in 
Ghana. 
The 
proposal 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
helped 
to 
prepare 
to 
secure 
funding 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
GhanaÂs 
development 
partners. 
PACT 
would 
certainly 
help 
to 
promote, 
strengthen 
and 
extend 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
existing 
and 
planned 
cancer 
centres. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
it 
was 
planned 
to 
establish 
a 
regional 
cancer 
training 
institute 
in 
Ghana 
for 
the 
training 
of 
radiation 
oncologists, 
medical 
physicists 
and 
associated 
technologists. 
154. 
Increasing 
energy 
demand 
to 
support 
GhanaÂs 
industrial 
development 
and 
growing 
concern 
over 
the 
greenhouse 
effect 
meant 
that 
nuclear 
power 
was 
likely 
to 
be 
introduced 
into 
the 
countryÂs 
energy 
mix 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
While 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
developing 
a 
long-term 
national 
strategic 
plan 
for 
energy 
was 
appreciated, 
the 
slow 
progress 
towards 
acquiring 
nuclear 
power 
facilities 
was 
causing 
impatience. 
Energy 
demand 
was 
outstripping 
the 
current 
supply 
and 
increasing 
petroleum 
prices 
were 
an 
aggravating 
factor. 
155. 
In 
response 
to 
previous 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
emphasizing 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
preservation 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
information 
management, 
Ghana 
had 
established 
a 
postgraduate 
school 
of 
nuclear 
and 
allied 
sciences 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Ghana. 
The 
school 
had 
just 
opened 
and 
was 
running 
eight 
accredited 
MPhil 
and 
PhD 
programmes 
in 
medical 
physics, 
radiation 
protection, 
environmental 
protection, 
nuclear 
and 
radiochemistry, 
nuclear 
engineering, 
nuclear 
agriculture 
and 
radiation 
processing. 
The 
Government 
of 
Ghana 
appreciated 
the 
effective 
collaboration 
and 
cooperation 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
in 
establishing 
the 
school. 
For 
its 
survival 
and 
growth, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
continued 
support 
was 
required 
to 
develop 
institutional 
capacity 
and 
promote 
networking 
with 
regional 
and 
other 
nuclear 
educational 
institutions 
in 
Member 
States. 
156. 
Ghana 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
supporting 
AFRA 
projects 
on 
sustainable 
energy 
development, 
combating 
desertification 
in 
the 
Sahel 
region, 
use 
of 
the 
SIT, 
and 
other 
projects 
related 
to 
agriculture, 
health, 
industry 
and 
the 
environment. 
The 
Agency 
was 
recognized 
increasingly 
as 
a 
partner 
in 
development 
and 
was 
already 
a 
major 
contributor 
to 
attaining 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
The 
Agency 
should 
continue 
to 
seek 
partnerships 
with 
organizations 
sharing 
common 
objectives 
in 
order 
to 
assist 
sustainable 
development 
in 
Member 
States. 
157. 
Mr. 
BALZAN 
(Malta) 
said 
that 
the 
skilful 
leadership 
of 
the 
Director 
General, 
together 
with 
the 
professionalism 
and 
dedication 
of 
his 
staff, 
would 
ensure 
that 
the 
Agency 
continued 
to 
pursue 
its 
goals 
with 
positive 
and 
effective 
results. 
The 
awarding 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
was 
the 
ultimate 
recognition 
of 
the 
excellent 
work 
the 
Agency 
carried 
out 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
mankind 
and 
was 
an 
acknowledgement 
of 
its 
many 
achievements. 
158. 
The 
best 
way 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
succeed 
in 
its 
quest 
for 
peace 
and 
security 
was 
through 
an 
effective 
multilateral 
system. 
Malta 
viewed 
the 
NPT 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
called 
upon 
States 
not 
yet 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
join 
the 
Treaty 
as 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States 
as 
promptly 
as 
possible. 
It 
was 
regrettable 
that 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
produce 
a 
consensus 
document 
and 
Malta 
hoped 
that 
the 
first 
session 
of 
the 
Preparatory 
Committee 
for 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
scheduled 
for 
May 
2007, 
would 
take 
matters 
forward. 
159. 
Malta 
recognized 
the 
pivotal 
role 
that 
the 
Agency 
played 
within 
the 
international 
multilateral 
system. 
It 
was 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and, 
through 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 

GC(50)/OR.6 
20 
September 
2006, 
Page 
25 


safeguards, 
played 
an 
indispensable 
role 
in 
maintaining 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
Malta 
welcomed 
the 
recent 
initiatives 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
regard, 
for 
example 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
and 
the 
modification 
of 
the 
SQP. 


160. 
Since 
the 
Agency 
was 
essentially 
a 
technical 
means 
towards 
a 
political 
end, 
it 
was 
vital 
that 
it 
remain 
neutral 
on 
the 
more 
sensitive 
issues 
before 
it. 
In 
that 
context, 
Malta 
commended 
the 
manner 
in 
which 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
his 
team 
had 
responded 
to 
some 
of 
the 
recent 
challenges 
facing 
the 
international 
community. 
161. 
The 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
combined 
with 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
which 
had 
improved 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capability 
to 
detect 
undeclared 
nuclear 
material, 
constituted 
the 
AgencyÂs 
current 
verification 
standard. 
All 
States 
that 
had 
no 
yet 
done 
so 
should 
bring 
into 
force 
an 
additional 
protocol 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity. 
162. 
Another 
important 
dimension 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
was 
its 
efforts 
to 
create 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
promoting 
nuclear 
safety 
assumed 
greater 
significance 
as 
the 
international 
community 
faced 
increased 
security 
threats. 
Malta 
supported 
fully 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
saw 
the 
consolidation 
of 
safety 
principles 
into 
a 
single 
document 
as 
a 
positive 
development. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support, 
his 
Government 
had 
enacted 
the 
necessary 
legislation 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
and 
had 
established 
a 
national 
regulatory 
authority, 
the 
Radiation 
Protection 
Board. 
163. 
The 
undiminished 
threat 
of 
terrorism 
was 
real, 
multifaceted 
and 
recognized 
no 
borders, 
and 
Malta 
was 
committed 
to 
fighting 
it 
in 
all 
its 
forms. 
The 
illicit 
trade 
in 
nuclear 
equipment 
and 
technology 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
increasing 
concern. 
Malta 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
actions 
aimed 
at 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism, 
particularly 
through 
its 
nuclear 
security 
plan. 
The 
full 
implementation 
of 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
was 
essential 
to 
prevent 
terrorist 
groups 
or 
individuals 
from 
acquiring 
nuclear 
material 
and 
technology. 
164. 
As 
a 
non-nuclear 
State 
which 
benefited 
from 
Agency 
cooperation 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
human 
health, 
Malta 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
As 
a 
small 
island 
with 
very 
limited 
natural 
resources, 
Malta 
depended 
on 
continued 
investment 
in 
its 
human 
resources 
to 
enable 
its 
people 
to 
achieve 
a 
decent 
standard 
of 
living. 
Agency 
assistance 
in 
the 
medical 
uses 
of 
radiation, 
protection 
of 
the 
environment, 
radioactive 
waste 
storage, 
strengthening 
of 
regulatory 
capabilities, 
preservation 
of 
cultural 
heritage 
and 
national 
preparedness 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
radiological 
accident 
was 
a 
most 
welcome 
addition 
to 
such 
investment. 
165. 
Malta 
participated 
in 
a 
number 
of 
national 
and 
regional 
projects 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Those 
activities 
provided 
excellent 
opportunities 
for 
a 
number 
of 
dedicated 
personnel 
to 
participate 
in 
training 
courses 
and 
international 
conferences 
related 
to 
their 
professional 
work. 
His 
delegation 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
improve 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
the 
programme 
through 
increased 
dialogue 
with 
Member 
States 
and 
higher 
quality 
projects. 
Malta 
applauded 
the 
efforts 
being 
made 
to 
improve 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
human 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
the 
environment, 
and 
welcomed 
PACT. 
Such 
initiatives 
enabled 
not 
only 
governments 
but 
also 
citizens 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
tangible 
results 
of 
Agency 
programmes. 
Malta 
urged 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
increase 
cooperation 
with 
other 
institutions 
in 
order 
to 
make 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
even 
more 
effective. 
166. 
Mr. 
NEZAM 
(Afghanistan) 
said 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary 
was 
an 
occasion 
to 
recall 
the 
dual 
nature 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
which, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
possessed 
the 
power 
to 
destruct 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
played 
a 
major 
role 
in 
development.

167. 
Among 
the 
challenges 
facing 
the 
General 
Conference, 
nuclear 
proliferation 
posed 
a 
real 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
was 
therefore 
a 
source 
of 
deep 
concern 
for 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
Government 
of 
Afghanistan, 
which 
condemned 
any 
attempt 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
non-peaceful 
or 
terrorist 
purposes, 
welcomed 
the 
efforts 
being 
made 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
combat 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
That 
threat 
required 
an 
appropriate 
response 
from 
the 
international 
community. 
Afghanistan 
welcomed 
the 
unanimous 
adoption 
of 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly 
and 
was 
taking 
the 
necessary 
steps 
to 
ratify 
the 
Convention. 
168. 
Afghanistan 
underlined 
the 
importance 
of 
universal 
adherence 
to 
all 
international 
non-
proliferation 
instruments, 
including 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
For 
its 
own 
part, 
it 
had 
already 
ratified 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
its 
additional 
protocol 
had 
entered 
into 
force 
in 
July 
2005. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
reaffirm 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes, 
as 
laid 
down 
in 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Respecting 
that 
inalienable 
right 
would 
further 
strengthen 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
Nuclear 
technology 
could 
make 
a 
key 
contribution 
to 
development. 
169. 
Afghanistan 
welcomed 
the 
active 
role 
played 
by 
the 
Agency 
in 
promoting 
and 
developing 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy 
in 
various 
fields. 
More 
attention 
should 
be 
given 
to 
the 
LDCs 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
make 
up 
ground 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
170. 
As 
regards 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
technology, 
Afghanistan 
had 
assigned 
priority 
to 
the 
areas 
of 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resources. 
Aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
an 
adequate 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructure, 
Afghanistan 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
preparing, 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
help, 
its 
radiation 
protection 
legislation 
with 
a 
view 
to 
having 
effective 
regulations 
and 
promoting 
nuclear 
technology. 
In 
2005, 
the 
Government 
of 
Afghanistan 
had 
invited 
Agency 
experts 
to 
the 
country 
to 
help 
the 
authorities 
to 
identify 
and 
formulate 
the 
countryÂs 
urgent 
needs 
for 
its 
CPF. 
In 
April 
2006, 
the 
Agency 
had 
sent 
a 
mission 
to 
Afghanistan 
to 
facilitate 
elaboration 
of 
the 
programme 
for 
the 
2007Â 
2008 
cycle. 
The 
programme 
developed 
covered 
areas 
such 
as 
health, 
agriculture, 
water, 
science 
and 
the 
environment. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
had 
recently 
organized 
a 
workshop 
in 
Vienna, 
inviting 
a 
number 
of 
senior 
officials 
from 
Afghanistan. 
Excellent 
work 
had 
been 
accomplished 
and 
a 
programme 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle 
had 
been 
finalized 
by 
Agency 
experts 
and 
their 
Afghan 
counterparts. 
He 
expressed 
AfghanistanÂs 
gratitude 
for 
the 
organization 
of 
that 
workshop. 
171. 
Solid 
bases 
had 
been 
established 
to 
allow 
the 
medium-term 
implementation 
of 
a 
peaceful 
nuclear 
energy 
programme 
in 
Afghanistan. 
Despite 
the 
difficult 
situation 
in 
the 
country, 
his 
delegation 
hoped 
that 
the 
programme 
would 
commence 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity, 
since 
AfghanistanÂs 
nuclear 
technology 
needs, 
particularly 
in 
the 
field 
of 
health, 
were 
urgent. 
Although 
AfghanistanÂs 
population 
numbered 
about 
30 
million, 
it 
did 
not 
have 
a 
radiotherapy 
service. 
The 
number 
of 
cancer 
patients 
was 
growing 
constantly 
and 
those 
patients 
had 
to 
go 
to 
neighbouring 
countries 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
treatment. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Afghanistan 
was 
a 
keen 
supporter 
of 
PACT. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
the 
health 
sector, 
particularly 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine, 
was 
a 
very 
important 
part 
of 
PACT, 
which 
included 
plans 
to 
create 
a 
radiotherapy 
and 
diagnosis 
centre. 
172. 
Under 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle, 
priority 
was 
attached 
to 
setting 
up 
a 
competent 
national 
regulatory 
structure 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
under 
the 
National 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency 
and 
establishing 
a 
national 
office 
for 
radiation 
protection 
and 
monitoring 
under 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health. 
The 
programme 
also 
included 
projects 
on 
soil 
fertility 
and 
increasing 
agricultural 
production, 
human 
resource 
training 
and 
management, 
and 
water 
resources 
management.

173. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
include 
Afghanistan 
in 
regional 
training 
programmes 
were 
welcome. 
They 
enhanced 
the 
countryÂs 
capabilities 
to 
use 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
its 
development 
strategy. 
174. 
Despite 
financial 
difficulties, 
Afghanistan 
had 
undertaken 
to 
honour 
its 
obligations 
vis-Ã -vis 
the 
Agency 
under 
the 
agreed 
payment 
schedule. 
175. 
Ms. 
VENSON-MOITOI 
(Botswana) 
conveyed 
her 
countryÂs 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
for 
winning 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
She 
noted 
with 
concern 
and 
sadness 
the 
fragility 
of 
peace 
in 
many 
parts 
of 
the 
world, 
the 
consequential 
loss 
of 
life 
and 
destruction 
to 
property, 
and 
prayed 
that 
future 
differences 
would 
be 
solved 
around 
the 
negotiating 
table, 
not 
on 
the 
battlefield. 
176. 
Botswana 
believed 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
all 
mankind 
and 
upheld 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
NPT. 
Any 
attempt 
to 
divert 
atomic 
energy 
to 
military 
uses, 
whether 
directly 
or 
indirectly, 
had 
to 
be 
discouraged 
at 
all 
costs. 
177. 
Developments 
in 
Botswana 
in 
the 
preceding 
year 
included 
elaboration 
of 
a 
radiation 
protection 
bill 
and 
its 
approval 
by 
parliament, 
submission 
of 
the 
radiation 
protection 
regulations 
to 
the 
Attorney 
General 
for 
finalization, 
and 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
radiation 
protection 
inspectorate. 
Botswana 
had 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency, 
and 
had 
just 
signed 
a 
revised 
supplementary 
agreement 
concerning 
the 
provision 
of 
Agency 
technical 
assistance. 
Botswana 
intended 
to 
comply 
with 
its 
obligations 
under 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol, 
and 
to 
cooperate 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
related 
issues. 
It 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
invaluable 
assistance 
in 
the 
form 
of 
expert 
advice, 
monitoring, 
equipment 
and 
staff 
training. 
With 
such 
unwavering 
support, 
Botswana 
was 
confident 
that 
it 
would 
achieve 
the 
five 
milestones 
set 
out 
by 
the 
Agency. 
Also 
in 
2005, 
Botswana 
had 
acceded 
to 
AFRA, 
which 
had 
the 
potential 
to 
assist 
in 
solving 
common 
regional 
problems 
and 
to 
promote 
the 
sharing 
of 
knowledge 
and 
expertise 
essential 
to 
sustainable 
development. 
178. 
BotswanaÂs 
agricultural 
sector 
was 
crucial 
to 
its 
food 
security, 
so 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
in 
that 
area 
were 
invaluable. 
The 
ongoing 
project 
BOT/5/002 
in 
support 
of 
tsetse 
eradication 
from 
Ngamiland 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
important 
undertakings 
in 
the 
country. 
It 
aimed 
to 
prevent 
outbreaks 
of 
sleeping 
sickness, 
improve 
crop 
and 
livestock 
production 
and 
protect 
the 
national 
tourism 
industry. 
Through 
the 
CPF, 
proposals 
had 
been 
made 
to 
collaborate 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
soil 
and 
water 
management 
practices, 
crop 
nutrition, 
plant 
and 
animal 
breeding 
and 
diagnosis 
of 
livestock 
diseases 
using 
nuclear 
and 
related 
techniques. 
179. 
In 
the 
area 
of 
human 
resource 
development, 
there 
was 
potential 
to 
establish 
cooperation 
with 
the 
University 
of 
Botswana 
to 
introduce 
formal 
training 
in 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
safety. 
Studies 
could 
be 
initiated 
to 
determine 
radon 
concentrations 
in 
work 
and 
residential 
areas 
and 
on 
the 
impact 
of 
naturally 
occurring 
radioactive 
material, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
maintaining 
a 
safe 
and 
healthy 
environment. 
180. 
Water 
was 
a 
scarce 
commodity 
in 
Botswana, 
especially 
in 
rural 
villages. 
Isotopic 
data 
could 
be 
used 
to 
estimate 
aquifer 
recharge, 
which 
could 
in 
turn 
determine 
the 
long-term 
sustainable 
yields. 
Sources 
of 
leakage 
from 
existing 
dams 
could 
also 
be 
investigated 
and 
solutions 
suggested. 
In 
that 
way, 
Botswana 
could 
attain 
its 
objective 
of 
a 
national 
water 
development 
and 
distribution 
strategy 
that 
would 
make 
water 
affordable 
and 
accessible 
to 
all 
its 
citizens. 
181. 
BotswanaÂs 
mineral 
industry 
utilized 
nuclear 
technology 
extensively 
in 
process 
automation 
and 
control, 
diamond 
recovery, 
non-destructive 
testing 
and 
security. 
Nucleonic 
devices 
were 
also 
used 
widely 
in 
wireline 
geophysics 
to 
determine 
rock 
mass 
density 
and 
porosity. 
Baggage 
screening 
and 
non-destructive 
testing 
ensured 
reliable 
security 
and 
quality 
control 
procedures.

Visits 
by 
Agency 
experts 
in 
2006 
had 
helped 
Botswana 
to 
evaluate 
its 
needs 
in 
the 
health 
sector 
and 
to 
make 
informed 
decisions 
on 
ways 
to 
improve 
its 
health-care 
facilities. 
Efforts 
were 
under 
way 
to 
set 
up 
a 
radiotherapy 
service 
and 
to 
establish 
a 
high 
dose 
rate 
brachytherapy 
unit 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
cervical 
cancer. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
that 
area 
would 
help 
Botswana 
to 
meet 
its 
objective 
of 
providing 
affordable 
health 
care 
to 
all 
citizens. 
183. 
The 
HIV/AIDS 
pandemic 
continued 
to 
challenge 
the 
countryÂs 
health-care 
system 
and 
cancer 
statistics 
were 
rising. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
had 
provided 
impetus 
to 
find 
a 
sustainable 
solution 
using 
nuclear 
technology. 
Management 
of 
the 
HIV/AIDS 
scourge 
could 
also 
be 
supported 
through 
food 
and 
nutrition 
intervention 
techniques 
using 
stable 
isotopes. 
184. 
In 
conclusion, 
she 
assured 
the 
Agency 
of 
BotswanaÂs 
continuing 
readiness 
to 
support 
it 
in 
every 
possible 
way. 
185. 
Mr. 
CORDEN 
(Preparatory 
Commission 
for 
the 
Comprehensive 
Nuclear-Test-Ban 
Treaty 
Organization) 
said 
that 
the 
CommissionÂs 
activities 
were 
aimed 
at 
establishing 
a 
global 
verification 
regime 
to 
monitor 
compliance 
with 
the 
comprehensive 
ban 
on 
all 
nuclear 
test 
explosions, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
promotion 
of 
signatures 
and 
ratifications 
for 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT. 
186. 
Since 
its 
adoption 
ten 
years 
previously, 
the 
Treaty 
had 
become 
increasingly 
universal 
in 
its 
status, 
having 
been 
signed 
by 
176 
States 
and 
ratified 
by 
135. 
The 
ratifying 
States 
included 
34 
of 
the 
44 
States 
whose 
ratification 
was 
required 
for 
the 
Treaty 
to 
enter 
into 
force. 
In 
order 
to 
promote 
signature 
and 
ratification 
and 
to 
assist 
developing 
countries 
in 
strengthening 
their 
national 
capabilities 
to 
implement 
the 
CTBT, 
the 
Commission 
served 
as 
a 
focal 
point 
for 
activities, 
underwritten 
by 
voluntary 
contributions. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Australia, 
Austria, 
Canada, 
the 
Czech 
Republic, 
France, 
Finland, 
Hungary, 
Japan, 
the 
Netherlands, 
Norway, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
the 
EU 
had 
offered 
voluntary 
contributions. 
187. 
The 
CTBT 
provided 
for 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
unique 
global 
verification 
regime, 
consisting 
of 
the 
International 
Monitoring 
System 
(IMS), 
a 
consultation 
and 
clarification 
process, 
on-site 
inspections, 
and 
confidence-building 
measures. 
Data 
from 
IMS 
stations 
around 
the 
globe 
were 
processed 
and 
analysed 
by 
the 
International 
Data 
Centre 
(IDC) 
in 
Vienna, 
and 
all 
IMS 
data 
and 
IDC 
products 
were 
made 
available 
to 
signatory 
States, 
which 
provided 
valuable 
national 
and 
international 
security 
benefits, 
and 
had 
civil 
and 
scientific 
applications. 
188. 
The 
Commission 
and 
its 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
had 
made 
significant 
progress 
in 
preparing 
for 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
particularly 
in 
the 
transition 
from 
build-up 
to 
provisional 
operation. 
The 
building 
of 
IMS 
stations 
and 
other 
elements 
of 
the 
verification 
system 
had 
continued 
and 
coordination 
of 
the 
provisional 
operation 
and 
maintenance 
of 
the 
complete 
system 
had 
been 
developed 
further. 
The 
operations 
centre 
established 
in 
2005 
now 
functioned 
as 
a 
single 
point 
of 
contact 
for 
all 
network 
operations, 
providing 
centralized 
information 
on 
network 
status, 
centralized 
network 
supervision 
functions 
and 
support 
of 
incident 
management 
functions. 
189. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
August 
2006, 
171 
IMS 
stations 
and 
7 
radionuclide 
laboratories 
had 
been 
certified, 
which 
represented 
over 
52% 
of 
the 
total 
IMS 
facilities 
provided 
for 
in 
the 
Treaty. 
Also, 
72% 
of 
the 
IMS 
seismic, 
hydroacoustic, 
radionuclide 
and 
infrasound 
stations 
had 
been 
installed, 
nearly 
60% 
of 
which 
were 
now 
included 
in 
IDC 
operations 
with 
their 
data 
being 
processed 
routinely, 
thereby 
contributing 
to 
the 
CentreÂs 
products. 
190. 
IMS 
data 
and 
IDC 
products 
were 
not 
only 
useful 
for 
national 
and 
international 
nuclear 
security, 
but 
they 
also 
had 
potential 
civil 
and 
scientific 
purposes, 
such 
as 
rapid 
notification 
of 
the 
location 
and 
size 
of 
earthquakes, 
scientific 
studies 
of 
the 
Earth 
Â 
including 
its 
oceans 
and 
atmosphere, 
early 
detection 
of 
volcanic 
eruptions 
and 
warnings 
to 
aviation 
of 
volcanic 
ash 
in 
the 
atmosphere. 
Several

international 
and 
national 
tsunami 
warning 
institutions 
receiving 
continuous 
IMS 
data 
had 
confirmed 
that 
it 
increased 
their 
ability 
to 
identify 
potentially 
tsunamigenic 
earthquakes 
and 
to 
issue 
warnings 
more 
rapidly. 
The 
Global 
Communications 
Infrastructure 
(GCI) 
transmitted 
IMS 
data 
to 
the 
IDC 
and 
disseminated 
it, 
along 
with 
IDC 
products, 
to 
signatory 
States. 
The 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
operated 
the 
GCI 
as 
a 
worldwide, 
closed 
and 
secure 
communications 
network, 
largely 
using 
satellite 
communication. 
Once 
fully 
operational, 
the 
GCI 
network 
was 
expected 
to 
carry 
11 
gigabytes 
of 
data 
daily. 
The 
installation 
of 
very 
small 
aperture 
terminals 
at 
remote 
locations 
had 
continued, 
with 
over 
200 
installed 
in 
80 
signatory 
States. 


191. 
By 
establishing 
a 
secure 
signatory 
account, 
signatory 
States 
could 
receive 
IMS 
data 
and 
IDC 
products 
on 
a 
provisional 
basis 
at 
their 
national 
data 
centres. 
In 
addition, 
the 
Commission 
provided 
training 
opportunities 
to 
signatory 
States, 
and 
offered 
them 
advanced 
monitoring 
software 
and 
a 
limited 
quantity 
of 
surplus 
hardware 
for 
their 
national 
data 
centres. 
By 
the 
end 
of 
August 
2006, 
around 
100 
secure 
signatory 
accounts 
had 
been 
established, 
with 
a 
total 
of 
about 
780 
users 
authorized 
to 
access 
IMS 
data 
and 
IDC 
products 
and 
to 
receive 
technical 
support 
from 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat. 
A 
national 
data 
centre 
evaluation 
workshop 
was 
planned 
to 
be 
held 
in 
Kiev, 
Ukraine, 
in 
October 
2006. 
192. 
Regarding 
the 
on-site 
inspection 
programme, 
guidelines 
were 
being 
implemented 
for 
the 
planning, 
preparation, 
conduct 
and 
evaluation 
of 
an 
integrated 
field 
exercise 
to 
be 
conducted 
in 
2008 
as 
part 
of 
the 
programme 
for 
developing 
on-site 
inspection 
capabilities. 
The 
field 
exercise 
would 
represent 
an 
important 
step 
towards 
operational 
readiness 
for 
the 
inspections 
and 
the 
capability 
to 
carry 
them 
out 
after 
the 
Treaty 
had 
entered 
into 
force. 
193. 
Providing 
and 
facilitating 
training 
courses 
for 
signatory 
States, 
particularly 
developing 
countries, 
was 
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
CommissionÂs 
work. 
It 
also 
promoted 
cooperation 
among 
signatory 
States 
to 
facilitate 
exchanges 
related 
to 
technologies 
used 
in 
the 
CTBT, 
as 
well 
as 
to 
support 
strengthened 
national 
capabilities 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Treaty. 
In 
that 
regard, 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
regularly 
organized 
international 
cooperation 
workshops 
among 
States 
at 
the 
regional 
and 
subregional 
level, 
and 
additional 
training 
courses 
were 
organized 
by 
donor 
States 
for 
experts 
from 
developing 
countries. 
To 
launch 
a 
new 
component 
of 
its 
training 
programmes, 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
had 
developed 
a 
concept 
for 
building 
capacity 
through 
e-training. 
It 
would 
allow 
for 
more 
training 
of 
participants 
through 
web-conferencing, 
and 
provide 
continuously 
available 
and 
updated 
training 
modules 
through 
computer-based 
training. 
194. 
Several 
workshops 
and 
training 
courses 
were 
to 
be 
conducted 
by 
signatory 
States 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat. 
The 
United 
States 
of 
America 
was 
hosting 
an 
infrasound 
technology 
workshop 
on 
25Â28 
September 
2006, 
Croatia 
would 
host 
an 
IDC 
regional 
training 
course 
on 
25Â29 
September 
2006, 
and 
Chile 
planned 
to 
lead 
a 
hydroacoustics 
workshop 
in 
May 
2007. 
The 
Government 
of 
Kenya 
had 
offered 
to 
host 
a 
national 
data 
centre 
evaluation 
workshop 
in 
2007, 
contributing 
to 
capacity-building 
for 
national 
data 
centres, 
particularly 
those 
in 
developing 
countries. 
195. 
To 
celebrate 
the 
tenth 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
a 
scientific 
symposium 
entitled 
ÂCTBT: 
Synergies 
with 
Science, 
1996Â2006 
and 
BeyondÂ 
had 
been 
held 
in 
Vienna 
on 
31 
August 
and 
1 
September 
2006. 
The 
participants 
had 
considered 
it 
to 
be 
both 
timely 
and 
successful, 
and 
noted 
that 
it 
had 
stimulated 
a 
number 
of 
ideas 
on 
how 
to 
increase 
contacts 
between 
the 
Commission 
and 
the 
scientific 
community. 
The 
Commission 
thanked 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
giving 
a 
keynote 
address 
to 
the 
symposium. 
In 
addition, 
Hungary 
had 
hosted 
an 
expert 
meeting 
on 
the 
civil 
and 
scientific 
applications 
of 
CTBT 
verification 
technologies 
in 
Budapest 
on 
2Â3 
September 
2006, 
with 
the 
Government 
of 
Hungary 
providing 
financial 
and 
logistical 
support.

The 
Provisional 
Technical 
Secretariat 
now 
had 
around 
270 
staff 
members 
from 
70 
countries, 
175 
of 
whom 
were 
in 
the 
Professional 
category. 
The 
Secretariat 
was 
committed 
to 
its 
policy 
of 
equal 
employment 
opportunities 
and 
over 
26% 
of 
Professional 
positions 
were 
held 
by 
women. 
Efforts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
promote 
further 
the 
employment 
of 
staff 
from 
developing 
countries 
and 
the 
number 
of 
women 
in 
the 
Secretariat.

8. 
General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(continued) 
(GC(50)/4) 
1. 
Mr. 
TAGIZADE 
(Azerbaijan), 
having 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
all 
Agency 
staff 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mission 
in 
the 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
international 
forum 
capable 
of 
counteracting 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism 
and 
Azerbaijan 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
strengthening 
its 
activities 
in 
that 
area. 
His 
country 
was 
actively 
working 
with 
the 
international 
community 
to 
strengthen 
the 
nuclear 
security 
and 
safeguards 
regime 
and, 
as 
an 
advocate 
of 
universal 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
relevant 
international 
conventions 
and 
treaties. 
2. 
Azerbaijan 
was 
complying 
with 
the 
obligations 
issuing 
from 
its 
agreements 
and 
was 
taking 
the 
necessary 
measures 
to 
ensure 
the 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
to 
prevent 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
materials. 
To 
ensure 
that 
it 
had 
an 
effective 
State 
system 
for 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
materials, 
Azerbaijan 
had 
created 
a 
Ministry 
of 
Emergency 
Situations 
and 
designated 
it 
the 
only 
State 
body 
for 
the 
regulation 
of 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
materials. 
One 
of 
its 
main 
tasks 
was 
the 
development 
of 
a 
national 
plan 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
consequences 
of 
a 
radiation 
accident. 
3. 
Azerbaijan 
was 
planning 
to 
upgrade 
its 
centralized 
database 
system, 
containing 
information 
on 
the 
export, 
import, 
transport, 
transit 
and 
storage 
locations 
of 
sources 
of 
ionizing 
radiation 
and 
radioactive 
waste. 
Also, 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
it 
was 
taking 
measures 
to 
develop 
its 
legislation 
with 
a 
view 
to 
improving 
the 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
regulatory 
system. 
As 
part 
of 
its 
efforts 
to 
improve 
bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
cooperation 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiation 
safety 
with 
Member 
States, 
it 
had 
already 
signed 
an 
agreement 
with 
Ukraine. 
4. 
He 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
it 
had 
provided 
to 
his 
country 
in 
2005-2006, 
particularly 
in 
determining 
the 
level 
of 
radionuclide 
contamination 
in 
the 
Araz 
and 
Kura 
Rivers 
and 
AzerbaijanÂs 
Caspian 
Sea 
coast. 
5. 
Another 
key 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
aimed 
to 
upgrade 
radiation 
oncology 
through 
the 
application 
of 
modern 
radiotherapy 
techniques 
at 
the 
National 
Oncology 
Centre. 
Doctors 
and 
health 
physicists 
had 
participated 
in 
special 
training 
to 
prepare 
them 
for 
work 
on 
the 
new 
Teragam 
and 
brachytherapy 
equipment 
installed 
in 
2005. 
A 
CT 
scanner, 
simulator 
and 
X-ray 
therapy 
machine 
would 
be 
installed 
in 
2006, 
and 
a 
linear 
accelerator 
was 
planned 
for 
2007Â2008. 
6. 
A 
further 
main 
area 
of 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
was 
in 
controlling 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material. 
Under 
the 
corresponding 
national 
projects 
two 
stationary 
detection 
systems 
had 
been 
installed. 
More 
stationary 
facilities 
were 
needed 
to 
detect 
nuclear 
and 
radioactive 
material 
and 
it 
was 
important 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
effectiveness 
to 
ensure 
that 
a 
unified 
system 
was 
in 
place. 
7. 
Finding 
and 
rendering 
harmless 
lost 
and 
orphan 
radioactive 
sources 
in 
Azerbaijan 
was 
an 
important 
nuclear 
security 
issue. 
With 
that 
in 
mind, 
a 
project 
had 
been 
started 
in 
January 
2005 
to 
train 
national 
specialists. 
8. 
Recognizing 
the 
dangers 
posed 
by 
environmental 
pollution 
and 
radioactive 
contamination, 
Azerbaijan 
had 
set 
out 
to 
determine 
the 
origin 
of 
such 
problems, 
particularly 
on 
the 
Abseron 
Peninsula. 
In 
2005, 
a 
regional 
seminar, 
attended 
by 
representatives 
from 
more 
than 
18 
countries, 
had 

GC(50)/OR.7 
21 
September 
2006, 
Page 
2 


been 
held 
in 
Baku 
on 
the 
organizational 
and 
technical 
requirements 
for 
ensuring 
quality 
assurance 
in 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 


9. 
The 
11th 
regional 
course 
on 
on-site 
inspections 
was 
due 
to 
take 
place 
in 
Baku 
from 
22 
to 
29 
October 
2006, 
with 
representatives 
from 
approximately 
45 
countries 
participating. 
10. 
Azerbaijan 
supported 
the 
creation 
of 
a 
nuclear-free 
zone 
in 
the 
South 
Caucasus. 
However, 
no 
progress 
was 
currently 
being 
made 
on 
that 
initiative 
because 
of 
the 
unconstructive 
and 
self-isolating 
policy 
of 
Armenia, 
which 
had 
carried 
out 
an 
armed 
attack 
against 
Azerbaijan 
and 
occupied 
20% 
of 
its 
territory. 
The 
continuing 
occupation 
had 
led 
to 
the 
creation 
of 
areas 
which 
were 
not 
under 
the 
control 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Azerbaijan 
and 
were 
to 
all 
intents 
and 
purposes 
outside 
the 
sphere 
of 
influence 
of 
international 
verification 
mechanisms. 
That 
increased 
the 
risk 
of 
illicit 
transfers 
of 
radioactive 
and 
nuclear 
material 
through 
the 
occupied 
territory. 
11. 
Another 
cause 
for 
concern 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Armenian 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
was 
located 
in 
a 
seismically 
active 
zone, 
which 
could 
lead 
to 
a 
regional 
disaster 
in 
the 
event 
of 
an 
earthquake. 
12. 
Having 
noted 
that 
Azerbaijan 
was 
meeting 
its 
financial 
commitments 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget 
and 
that 
provision 
had 
been 
made 
for 
its 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF, 
he 
said 
that 
it 
would 
continue 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
Agency 
activities. 
He 
expressed 
appreciation 
of 
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
atomic 
energy. 
13. 
Mr. 
MOHAMAD 
(Malaysia) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
receiving 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005 
and 
said 
he 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
encourage 
them 
to 
strive 
for 
greater 
achievements. 
14. 
In 
his 
introductory 
statement 
to 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
identified 
three 
phases 
in 
the 
development 
of 
a 
new 
approach 
to 
the 
fuel 
cycle: 
the 
establishment 
of 
mechanisms 
for 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants; 
the 
development 
of 
assurances 
regarding 
the 
acquisition 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactors; 
and 
the 
conversion 
of 
existing 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
facilities 
from 
national 
to 
multilateral 
operations. 
Malaysia 
supported 
the 
move 
towards 
improving 
assurances 
of 
supply 
in 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
technology, 
as 
well 
as 
reducing 
the 
risks 
of 
further 
proliferation 
of 
sensitive 
technologies 
that 
could 
be 
used 
in 
the 
development 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
A 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
should 
provide 
a 
more 
economically 
attractive 
option 
for 
developing 
countries 
embarking 
upon 
a 
nuclear 
power 
generation 
programme, 
particularly 
those 
countries 
with 
a 
small 
nuclear 
power 
programme. 
However, 
progress 
in 
that 
direction 
should 
not 
lead 
to 
the 
unilateral 
adoption 
of 
any 
standard 
that 
would 
affect 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
the 
Parties 
to 
the 
NPT 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
without 
discrimination. 
Furthermore, 
attention 
should 
not 
be 
drawn 
away 
from 
the 
obligations 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
undertake 
to 
pursue 
negotiations 
in 
good 
faith 
on 
effective 
measures 
relating 
to 
cessation 
of 
the 
nuclear 
arms 
race 
at 
an 
early 
date 
and 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Despite 
the 
overwhelming 
attention 
being 
given 
to 
nuclear 
non-proliferation, 
Malaysia 
believed 
the 
most 
effective 
way 
to 
remove 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
proliferation 
was 
the 
pursuit 
of 
a 
general, 
complete 
and 
irreversible 
nuclear 
disarmament 
under 
strict 
and 
effective 
international 
control. 
15. 
Malaysia 
shared 
the 
view 
that 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
optimize 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
In 
that 
regard, 
Malaysia 
had 
begun 
to 
develop 
a 
capability 
to 
evaluate 
objectively 
the 
socio-economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
nuclear 
technology 
it 
used. 
That 
would 
improve 
the 
planning 
and 
selection 
of 
its 
nuclear 
technology 
applications 
by 
ensuring 
that 
the 
programmes 
capable 
of 
giving 
the 
most 
added 
value 
to 
the 
targeted 
economic 
sectors 
were 
identified. 
Also, 
it 
would 
ensure 
that 
other 
areas 
where 
intangible 
benefits 
were 
more 
justifiable, 
such 
as 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
human 
resources 
development, 
were 
not 
neglected.

16. 
Malaysia 
had 
actively 
supported 
Agency 
programmes 
on 
non-power 
nuclear 
technologies 
by 
hosting 
regional 
and 
interregional 
training 
courses, 
workshops, 
seminars 
and 
meetings, 
by 
training 
Agency 
fellows, 
by 
providing 
Malaysian 
experts 
and 
by 
providing 
financial 
support 
for 
selected 
Agency 
programmes, 
such 
as 
PACT. 
17. 
He 
commended 
the 
PACT 
Programme 
Office 
for 
engaging 
the 
support 
of 
other 
international 
organizations 
in 
line 
with 
resolution 
GC(49)/RES/12, 
which 
had 
requested 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
continue 
to 
advocate, 
build 
support, 
and 
allocate 
and 
mobilize 
resources 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
PACT 
as 
one 
of 
the 
priorities 
of 
the 
Agency. 
Malaysia 
appreciated 
the 
joint 
efforts 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
those 
organizations 
in 
conducting 
integrated 
missions 
of 
PACT 
to 
assist 
countries 
in 
developing 
national 
cancer 
strategies 
and 
plans. 
In 
view 
of 
the 
current 
critical 
funding 
situation 
of 
PACT, 
Malaysia 
was 
prepared 
to 
contribute 
its 
share 
of 
the 
2004 
Agency 
Regular 
Budget 
cash 
surplus 
and 
urged 
other 
Member 
States 
to 
do 
the 
same. 
18. 
Malaysia 
hosted 
an 
Agency 
postgraduate 
education 
course 
in 
radiation 
protection. 
In 
that 
regard, 
his 
delegation 
reiterated 
its 
call 
for 
a 
long-term 
agreement 
to 
be 
concluded 
with 
the 
host 
university 
in 
line 
with 
the 
Agency's 
long-term 
strategy 
on 
the 
sustainability 
of 
training 
and 
education 
in 
all 
Member 
States. 
Malaysia 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
upgrade 
that 
postgraduate 
course 
from 
diploma 
level 
to 
that 
of 
a 
Master 
of 
Science 
and 
to 
expand 
its 
scope 
to 
include 
other 
relevant 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
19. 
While 
welcoming 
the 
higher 
priority 
accorded 
to 
nuclear 
security 
by 
the 
international 
community 
in 
view 
of 
the 
serious 
threats 
of 
mass 
transnational 
terrorism, 
his 
delegation 
noted 
that 
that 
had 
led 
to 
the 
development 
of 
overlapping 
initiatives 
by 
a 
number 
of 
international 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Agency. 
That 
imposed 
a 
heavy 
burden 
on 
the 
work 
of 
the 
relevant 
government 
agencies 
and 
posed 
new 
challenges 
for 
inter-agency 
coordination 
in 
Member 
States. 
To 
optimize 
resources, 
Malaysia 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
coordinate 
the 
implementation 
of 
its 
nuclear 
security 
initiatives 
with 
that 
of 
other 
relevant 
multilateral 
organizations, 
in 
particular 
within 
the 
United 
Nations 
framework, 
for 
example, 
with 
the 
Security 
CouncilÂs 
Counter-Terrorism 
Committee. 
20. 
He 
reiterated 
MalaysiaÂs 
commitment 
to 
meeting 
its 
safeguards 
obligations. 
He 
reassured 
the 
international 
community 
that 
any 
apparent 
delay 
in 
meeting 
those 
obligations, 
notably 
ratification 
of 
MalaysiaÂs 
additional 
protocol 
signed 
on 
22 
November 
2005, 
was 
largely 
owing 
to 
the 
need 
for 
due 
legal 
process. 
Also, 
Malaysia 
was 
actively 
studying 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision 
for 
States 
to 
modify 
the 
text 
of 
the 
small 
quantities 
protocol. 
21. 
On 
broader 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
issues, 
Malaysia 
welcomed 
the 
signing 
of 
the 
Treaty 
on 
a 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zone 
in 
Central 
Asia 
by 
Kazakhstan, 
Kyrgyzstan, 
Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan 
and 
Uzbekistan 
in 
September 
2006. 
The 
establishment 
of 
that 
latest 
NWFZ 
helped 
to 
strengthen 
regional 
and 
global 
peace 
and 
security. 
He 
urged 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
provide 
unconditional 
assurances 
against 
the 
use, 
or 
threat 
of 
use, 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
on 
all 
the 
States 
in 
that 
zone. 
In 
that 
connection, 
he 
reiterated 
MalaysiaÂs 
call 
for 
the 
prompt 
establishment 
of 
a 
similar 
NWFZ 
in 
the 
more 
volatile 
region 
of 
the 
Middle 
East, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
487 
of 
1981 
and 
687 
of 
1991, 
and 
other 
General 
Assembly 
resolutions 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
Also, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
487, 
Malaysia 
called 
upon 
Israel 
promptly 
to 
place 
all 
its 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
Agency 
full-scope 
safeguards. 
In 
the 
same 
context, 
his 
delegation 
remained 
concerned 
about 
the 
unwillingness 
of 
a 
majority 
of 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
sign 
the 
Protocol 
to 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
South-
East 
Asia 
Nuclear 
Weapon-Free 
Zone, 
which 
had 
been 
signed 
by 
all 
ten 
States 
in 
the 
region 
in 
1995. 
22. 
Malaysia 
recognized 
the 
Agency 
as 
the 
sole 
competent 
authority 
for 
the 
verification 
of 
safeguards 
obligations 
in 
the 
Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran. 
It 
stressed 
that 
there 
should 
be 
no 
undue 
pressure 
or 
interference 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
regard, 
which 
could 
jeopardize 
its 
efficiency

and 
credibility. 
The 
Malaysian 
delegation, 
while 
taking 
note 
of 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
assessment 
that 
all 
the 
nuclear 
material 
declared 
by 
Iran 
had 
been 
accounted 
for, 
encouraged 
Iran 
to 
continue 
to 
cooperate 
actively 
and 
fully 
with 
the 
Agency 
with 
a 
view 
to 
resolving 
the 
outstanding 
issues 
so 
as 
to 
build 
confidence 
and 
move 
towards 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue. 


23. 
Finally, 
turning 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue, 
he 
expressed 
his 
countryÂs 
support 
for 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
19 
September 
2005 
and 
called 
for 
its 
expeditious 
and 
faithful 
implementation. 
Malaysia 
supported 
resumption 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
time 
and 
stressed 
their 
vital 
role 
in 
achieving 
a 
peaceful 
negotiated 
resolution 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
24. 
Mr. 
MSOLLA 
(United 
Republic 
of 
Tanzania), 
having 
commended 
the 
Director 
General 
for 
his 
comprehensive 
introductory 
statement, 
underscored 
the 
great 
value 
placed 
by 
his 
country 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
under 
which 
it 
had 
recently 
adopted 
a 
CPF. 
Tanzania 
was 
indebted 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
good 
progress 
it 
was 
making 
in 
radiotherapy 
and 
nuclear 
medicine 
applications, 
the 
management 
of 
water 
resources, 
the 
control 
and 
eradication 
of 
the 
tsetse 
fly, 
the 
strengthening 
of 
non-destructive 
testing 
capabilities 
and 
the 
development 
of 
human 
resources. 
Also, 
its 
capacity 
for 
regulating 
and 
enforcing 
radiological 
safety 
and 
security 
standards 
in 
most 
radiation 
practices 
had 
been 
greatly 
enhanced. 
25. 
The 
global 
desire 
to 
eradicate 
poverty 
in 
Africa 
had 
intensified, 
and 
his 
country 
appealed 
for 
the 
continuation 
and 
strengthening 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
The 
Agency 
should 
find 
more 
reliable 
sources 
of 
funding 
to 
increase 
the 
TCF. 
Tanzania, 
for 
its 
part, 
was 
doing 
everything 
possible 
to 
fulfil 
all 
of 
its 
obligations, 
particularly 
those 
relating 
to 
the 
TCF. 
26. 
Tanzania 
appreciated 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
increased 
commitment 
to 
combating 
cancer. 
His 
delegationÂs 
appeal 
at 
the 
49th 
General 
Conference 
had 
not 
gone 
unheard 
and 
Tanzania 
had 
been 
selected 
to 
be 
a 
beneficiary 
of 
the 
first 
phase 
of 
PACT. 
As 
requested, 
the 
Agency 
had 
implemented 
a 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiotherapy 
project 
at 
the 
Bugando 
medical 
centre, 
which 
now 
served 
over 
a 
third 
of 
the 
population. 
It 
had 
been 
agreed 
to 
improve 
radiotherapy 
services 
on 
a 
cost-sharing 
basis, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
which 
Tanzania 
had 
already 
deposited 
$600 
000 
with 
the 
Agency. 
He 
appealed 
for 
more 
support 
for 
PACT 
so 
that 
the 
population 
of 
Tanzania 
could 
have 
better 
access 
to 
nuclear 
medicine. 
27. 
Like 
many 
developing 
countries, 
Tanzania 
was 
caught 
in 
a 
vicious 
circle 
with 
regard 
to 
energy 
constraints. 
The 
country 
relied 
mainly 
on 
carbon-based 
energy, 
and 
while 
there 
was 
sufficient 
coal 
to 
meet 
demand, 
its 
use 
contributed 
to 
global 
warming 
by 
releasing 
greenhouse 
gases 
into 
the 
atmosphere. 
Over 
the 
past 
year, 
Tanzania 
had 
suffered 
a 
serious 
energy 
crisis 
caused 
by 
persistent 
drought 
and 
soaring 
world 
oil 
prices. 
Consequently, 
Tanzania 
was 
seriously 
considering 
other 
sources 
of 
sustainable 
energy 
in 
its 
national 
energy 
mix. 
In 
its 
CPF, 
it 
had 
prioritized 
capacity-building 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
infrastructure 
in 
order 
to 
facilitate 
research 
on 
comparative 
energy 
sources. 
That 
was 
an 
area 
in 
which 
Africa, 
and 
particularly 
the 
LDCs, 
required 
Agency 
assistance. 
28. 
Valuable 
support 
had 
been 
given 
to 
African 
Member 
States 
through 
PATTEC 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
problem 
in 
Africa. 
Tsetse-transmitted 
trypanosomosis 
placed 
major 
constraints 
on 
agricultural 
production 
and 
posed 
a 
serious 
threat 
to 
public 
health, 
particularly 
in 
Tanzania. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
application 
of 
the 
SIT, 
eradication 
of 
tsetse 
fly 
species 
in 
various 
parts 
of 
Africa 
was 
progressing 
well. 
29. 
In 
Tanzania, 
the 
tsetse 
and 
trypanosomosis 
institute 
based 
in 
Tanga 
was 
being 
used 
to 
support 
national 
and 
regional 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
eradication 
of 
the 
tsetse 
fly 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
PATTEC 
and 
was 
also 
acting 
as 
a 
regional 
centre 
for 
expertise 
in 
tsetse 
rearing. 
Fellows 
from 
countries 
implementing 
tsetse 
control 
and 
eradication 
programmes 
were 
being 
trained 
at 
the 
institute. 
The

improved 
tsetse 
fly 
facility 
at 
Tanga 
was 
being 
used 
to 
rear 
tsetse 
seed 
colonies 
of 
Glossina 
pallidipes 
for 
Ethiopia 
and 
Glossina 
morsitans 
centralis 
for 
Botswana. 
In 
addition, 
the 
institute 
was 
actively 
participating 
in 
a 
study 
to 
examine 
the 
feasibility 
of 
SIT 
to 
create 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
Glossina 
swynnertoni 
in 
northern 
Tanzania. 


30. 
The 
collection 
of 
stratified 
baseline 
data 
according 
to 
a 
standardized, 
grid-based 
sampling 
frame 
was 
progressing 
well. 
Plans 
were 
under 
way 
to 
establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
seed 
colony 
of 
Glossina 
swynnertoni 
and 
further 
Agency 
support 
for 
the 
purchase 
of 
fly-rearing 
equipment 
and 
consumables 
and 
for 
the 
development 
of 
stratified 
baseline 
data 
was 
required. 
31. 
The 
Tanzanian 
Government 
remained 
committed 
to 
fulfilling 
its 
obligations 
and 
supporting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
towards 
the 
realization 
of 
its 
statutory 
objectives. 
His 
country 
was 
pleased 
to 
pledge 
the 
full 
share 
of 
its 
voluntary 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF. 
32. 
Mr. 
TRUONG 
GIANG 
(Vietnam) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Director 
General 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
and 
expressed 
appreciation 
for 
their 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
peaceful 
and 
safe 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
33. 
In 
January 
2006, 
Vietnam 
had 
approved 
a 
strategy 
for 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
atomic 
energy 
up 
to 
2020, 
reaffirming 
that 
it 
would 
utilize 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
only 
and 
develop 
both 
non-power 
and 
power 
applications 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
socio-economic 
development 
in 
a 
safe, 
secure 
and 
cost-effective 
manner. 
To 
implement 
that 
strategy, 
preparations 
were 
under 
way 
to 
formulate 
a 
national 
programme 
of 
action 
for 
the 
development 
of 
human 
resources 
and 
technical 
infrastructure 
and 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear 
regulatory 
framework. 
In 
addition, 
the 
pre-feasibility 
study 
for 
the 
construction 
of 
VietnamÂs 
first 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
submitted 
to 
the 
Government. 
34. 
Vietnam 
had 
ratified 
the 
CTBT 
in 
February 
2006 
and 
was 
studying 
other 
international 
nuclear-
related 
instruments 
with 
a 
view 
to 
participation. 
It 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
and 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
developing 
the 
necessary 
regulations 
for 
implementation 
of 
the 
Code. 
35. 
The 
management 
of 
radiation 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
in 
Vietnam, 
through 
its 
Agency 
for 
Radiation 
and 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
Control, 
had 
been 
substantially 
enhanced 
over 
the 
previous 
year 
by 
increasing 
the 
relevant 
professional 
staff 
and 
funding. 
In 
addition, 
drafting 
of 
VietnamÂs 
atomic 
law 
was 
in 
progress 
and 
the 
final 
draft 
was 
expected 
to 
be 
completed 
and 
submitted 
for 
approval 
in 
late 
2007 
or 
early 
2008. 
36. 
Vietnam 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
effective 
and 
efficient 
implementation 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
Its 
CPF, 
finalized 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
September 
2003, 
had 
identified 
priority 
areas 
for 
national 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
development, 
which 
were 
being 
addressed 
by 
14 
ongoing 
projects 
in 
the 
2005Â2006 
cycle 
and 
6 
new 
and 
extended 
project 
proposals 
for 
the 
next 
cycle. 
Cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
yielded 
productive 
results 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
development 
of 
human 
resources, 
the 
improvement 
of 
the 
national 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
infrastructure, 
and 
the 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
to 
areas 
including 
the 
creation 
of 
new 
rice 
varieties, 
food 
preservation, 
radiotherapy, 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
groundwater 
management. 
37. 
Vietnam 
had 
fulfilled 
its 
obligations 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
full, 
including 
providing 
the 
necessary 
resources 
for 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
payment 
of 
its 
NPCs 
for 
the 
2005Â2006 
cycle, 
Regular 
Budget 
contributions 
and 
its 
pledged 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006. 
Vietnam 
had 
also 
hosted 
6 
Agency/RCA 
events 
in 
the 
current 
year. 
38. 
Vietnam 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
close 
cooperation 
and 
valuable 
assistance 
over 
the 
years 
and 
was 
keen 
to 
continue 
effective 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
other 
international

organizations 
and 
Member 
States, 
particularly 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
power 
development. 
It 
remained 
a 
staunch 
supporter 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
to 
enhance 
and 
promote 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
applications 
in 
the 
interests 
of 
peace, 
stability, 
cooperation 
and 
development. 


39. 
Mr. 
SERRANO 
CADENA 
(Colombia) 
recalled, 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
the 
50th 
session 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
that 
the 
establishment 
of 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
inspired 
by 
the 
desire 
for 
Âatoms 
for 
peaceÂ. 
That 
vision 
had 
paved 
the 
way 
for 
the 
subsequent 
adoption 
of 
the 
NPT 
which, 
together 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
enshrined 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
the 
promotion 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation. 
They 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
commitment 
to 
build 
a 
peaceful, 
safe 
and 
prosperous 
world 
to 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
human 
beings. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
remember 
and 
renew 
the 
spirit 
underlying 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
40. 
It 
was 
no 
coincidence 
that 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
had 
been 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
in 
recognition 
of 
the 
organizationÂs 
contribution 
to 
global 
peace 
and 
security, 
its 
efforts 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation, 
and 
its 
role 
in 
achieving 
sustainable 
development. 
41. 
The 
commitment 
to 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
informed 
ColombiaÂs 
foreign 
policy-making. 
It 
participated 
actively 
in 
all 
initiatives 
that 
promoted 
that 
dual 
goal. 
Addressing 
those 
issues 
multilaterally, 
with 
full 
respect 
for 
the 
rights 
and 
obligations 
of 
States 
and 
with 
the 
participation 
of 
the 
international 
community, 
was 
crucial 
to 
global 
peace 
and 
security. 
42. 
Colombia 
had 
always 
supported 
international 
legal 
instruments 
and 
organizations. 
It 
was 
firmly 
committed 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
the 
Tlatelolco 
Treaty, 
a 
pioneering 
instrument 
establishing 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
NWFZ. 
Colombia 
observed 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
had 
signed 
the 
additional 
protocol 
thereto 
in 
May 
2005, 
which 
it 
was 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ratifying. 
It 
supported 
multilateral 
initiatives 
to 
counter 
the 
threat 
posed 
by 
nuclear 
proliferation, 
including 
by 
terrorists, 
and 
aimed 
at 
disarmament. 
43. 
The 
global 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
system 
was 
facing 
serious 
challenges. 
The 
NPTÂs 
main 
objective, 
namely 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
could 
only 
be 
achieved 
by 
implementing 
all 
three 
of 
its 
pillars: 
disarmament, 
non-proliferation 
and 
the 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
As 
a 
State 
Party 
to 
the 
Treaty, 
Colombia 
believed 
that 
the 
membership 
of 
the 
Ânuclear 
clubÂ 
must 
not 
increase 
and 
that 
efforts 
must 
be 
made 
to 
prevent 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
proliferation. 
In 
that 
regard, 
the 
failure 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
was 
regrettable. 
It 
was 
vital 
that 
the 
process 
be 
resumed 
in 
a 
constructive 
spirit 
in 
order 
to 
make 
progress. 
Also, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
and 
universalization 
of 
the 
system, 
the 
establishment 
of 
more 
NWFZs 
should 
be 
given 
the 
highest 
priority. 
44. 
One 
of 
the 
fundamental 
pillars 
of 
the 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
system 
was 
cooperation, 
enabling 
the 
Agency 
to 
fulfil 
its 
objective 
to 
Âaccelerate 
and 
enlarge 
the 
contribution 
of 
atomic 
energy 
to 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity 
throughout 
the 
worldÂ. 
It 
was 
paradoxical 
that 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
lacked 
assured, 
predictable 
and 
sufficient 
resources. 
45. 
Nuclear 
technology 
development 
over 
the 
past 
fifty 
years 
had 
shown 
the 
great 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
for 
sustainable 
development. 
Since 
the 
Agency 
played 
a 
key 
role 
in 
the 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge 
and 
technologies 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
efforts 
should 
be 
made 
to 
mobilize 
resources 
to 
enable 
it 
to 
strengthen 
that 
function. 
46. 
In 
Colombia, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
helped 
build 
capacities 
in 
areas 
that 
were 
crucial 
to 
socio-economic 
development, 
especially 
energy 
planning. 
Energy 
security 
was 
vital 
to 
economic 
development, 
and 
thus 
poverty 
eradication. 
Colombia 
was 
both 
a 
beneficiary 
and 
a 
contributor 
to 
that 
programme. 
It 
contributed 
to 
the 
TCF 
and 
paid 
its 
NPCs 
on 
time. 
In 
addition,

Colombia 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
ARCAL, 
which 
helped 
promote 
peace 
and 
cooperation 
between 
developing 
countries. 
A 
programme 
of 
particular 
importance, 
as 
underlined 
by 
the 
General 
Conference, 
was 
PACT 
and 
he 
commended 
the 
SecretariatÂs 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard. 


47. 
Ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
was 
fundamental. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
was 
important 
to 
strengthen 
national 
legislation 
and 
international 
cooperation 
so 
as 
to 
minimize 
the 
potential 
risks 
arising 
from 
their 
use. 
The 
Agency 
played 
an 
important 
role 
by 
helping 
Member 
States 
strengthen 
relevant 
national 
infrastructures 
and 
regulations. 
In 
2005, 
Colombia 
had 
adopted 
legislation 
on 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
in 
accordance 
with 
Agency 
guidelines, 
and 
in 
early 
2006 
its 
infrastructure 
had 
been 
appraised 
by 
a 
RaSSIA 
mission. 
His 
Government 
had 
decided 
to 
apply 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
hoped 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
support 
in 
implementing 
the 
recommendations 
contained 
in 
those 
instruments. 
48. 
As 
a 
coastal 
State, 
Colombia 
attached 
special 
importance 
to 
the 
safe 
maritime 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
including 
radioactive 
waste, 
and 
to 
strengthening 
the 
relevant 
legislative 
framework. 
Given 
the 
AgencyÂs 
competence 
in 
transport 
safety, 
it 
should 
continue 
promoting 
dialogue 
and 
consultation 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States. 
In 
that 
context, 
Colombia 
welcomed 
the 
continuing 
work 
of 
INLEX. 
It 
would 
be 
useful 
to 
have 
in 
place 
a 
legal 
instrument 
covering 
liability, 
ratified 
by 
the 
largest 
possible 
number 
of 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States. 
With 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
development 
of 
safety 
legislation. 
It 
was 
vital 
to 
extend 
that 
to 
transport 
safety. 
49. 
Colombia 
remained 
concerned 
about 
the 
existence 
of 
an 
illicit 
trafficking 
network 
in 
radioactive 
material 
and 
equipment, 
and 
the 
associated 
risks. 
The 
Agency 
should 
continue 
its 
efforts, 
together 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
Member 
States, 
to 
disclose 
its 
structure 
and 
membership. 
The 
threat 
of 
proliferation, 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
required 
a 
joint 
effort 
at 
all 
levels. 
The 
collective 
security 
system 
must 
be 
based 
on 
full 
respect 
for 
StatesÂ 
rights 
and 
the 
fulfilment 
of 
their 
obligations 
and 
should 
take 
account 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
developing 
countries. 
A 
firm 
commitment 
to 
disarmament, 
non-
proliferation 
and 
the 
promotion 
and 
transfer 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
would 
enable 
the 
international 
community 
to 
rise 
to 
the 
current 
threats 
and 
challenges. 
It 
was 
the 
only 
way 
to 
build 
a 
future 
devoid 
of 
nuclear 
threat, 
where 
atomic 
energy 
was 
used 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
the 
only 
way 
to 
realize 
the 
dream 
of 
Âatoms 
for 
peaceÂ 
and 
sustainable 
development. 
50. 
Mr. 
ROSELLÃ 
(Spain), 
having 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
receiving 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005, 
said 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary 
represented 
a 
historic 
landmark. 
Over 
the 
years, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
three 
pillars 
of 
its 
Statute 
had 
been 
demonstrated 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
impartiality 
and 
professionalism 
had 
been 
widely 
recognized. 
51. 
With 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
concerns 
becoming 
more 
prevalent 
in 
recent 
years, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system 
had 
moved 
into 
the 
international 
spotlight. 
The 
most 
effective 
way 
of 
responding 
to 
the 
threat 
posed 
to 
international 
security 
by 
nuclear 
proliferation 
was 
to 
ensure 
the 
prompt 
and 
universal 
implementation 
of 
additional 
protocols. 
While 
Spain 
was 
pleased 
to 
see 
that 
an 
increasing 
number 
of 
States 
had 
signed 
an 
additional 
protocol, 
it 
was 
worrying 
that 
106 
States 
had 
still 
not 
brought 
their 
respective 
additional 
protocols 
into 
force 
and 
a 
large 
number 
with 
significant 
nuclear 
activities 
had 
yet 
to 
sign 
one. 
Since 
the 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
additional 
protocol 
in 
the 
EU 
in 
2004, 
Spain 
had 
been 
providing 
the 
Agency 
with 
all 
the 
relevant 
information 
on 
time 
and 
had 
facilitated 
all 
the 
complementary 
access 
requested. 
The 
Secretariat 
knew 
that 
it 
could 
rely 
on 
the 
full 
cooperation 
of 
the 
competent 
authorities 
in 
Spain 
in 
that 
regard. 
Cooperation 
and 
coordination 
between 
Euratom 
and 
the 
Agency 
should 
be 
strengthened 
at 
all 
levels 
to 
enhance 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
system 
and 
thereby 
facilitate 
the 
transition 
to 
the 
application 
of 
integrated 
safeguards 
within 
the 
EU 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
Spain 
commended 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
efforts 
in 
that 
field. 
His 
delegation 
had 
participated 
actively 

GC(50)/OR.7

in 
the 
Special 
Event 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
coinciding 
with 
the 
General 
Conference, 
which 
would 
help 
to 
clarify 
the 
possible 
multilateral 
approaches 
to 
the 
front 
and 
back 
ends 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
while 
taking 
account 
of 
the 
various 
strategic 
implications 
for 
countries. 


52. 
Safeguards 
activities 
were 
complemented 
by 
those 
being 
implemented 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
States 
to 
improve 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities, 
as 
well 
as 
high-activity 
radiation 
sources. 
It 
was 
to 
be 
hoped 
that 
the 
consensus 
achieved 
for 
the 
amendment 
of 
the 
CPPNM 
at 
the 
diplomatic 
conference 
in 
2005 
would 
be 
translated 
into 
its 
timely 
entry 
into 
force. 
Spain 
had 
already 
begun 
its 
ratification 
process. 
53. 
In 
the 
field 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
radiation 
protection, 
Spain 
was 
pleased 
with 
the 
steps 
taken 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
strengthen 
international 
cooperation. 
Spain 
reiterated 
its 
support 
for 
all 
the 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
services 
provided 
by 
the 
Agency, 
especially 
those 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
national 
regulatory 
bodies. 
The 
SecretariatÂs 
decision 
to 
combine 
its 
services 
in 
that 
area 
to 
give 
more 
scope 
and 
flexibility 
was 
very 
positive. 
54. 
The 
new 
IRRS 
missions 
were 
the 
best 
tool 
available 
to 
the 
international 
community 
for 
the 
review, 
verification 
and 
improvement 
of 
national 
regulatory 
capacities. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
increase 
its 
efforts 
in 
that 
regard, 
facilitating 
coordination 
with 
activities 
related 
to 
the 
international 
conventions 
on 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
Currently, 
Spain 
was 
working 
with 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
prepare 
for 
its 
forthcoming 
IRRS 
mission. 
55. 
One 
of 
the 
most 
important 
international 
milestones 
recently 
in 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
had 
been 
the 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
in 
May 
2006. 
His 
delegation 
congratulated 
the 
Secretariat 
on 
its 
contribution 
to 
the 
success 
of 
that 
meeting 
and 
urged 
it 
to 
apply 
the 
lessons 
learnt 
in 
future. 
56. 
The 
Spanish 
authorities 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
safety 
in 
nuclear 
facilities 
because 
incidents 
were 
frequently 
attributable 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
safety 
culture 
in 
facility 
operation 
and 
maintenance. 
The 
Secretariat 
should 
consider 
increasing 
resources 
allocated 
for 
that 
purpose 
and 
strengthen 
activities 
aimed 
at, 
on 
the 
one 
hand, 
understanding 
and 
dealing 
with 
the 
problems 
arising 
from 
a 
lack 
of 
safety 
culture 
and, 
on 
the 
other, 
facilitating 
the 
development 
of 
methods 
for 
its 
appropriate 
consideration 
by 
nuclear 
facility 
management. 
57. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
year, 
Spain 
had 
strengthened 
its 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
field 
of 
security. 
It 
was 
prepared 
to 
offer 
its 
support 
to 
the 
Agency 
in 
strengthening 
the 
regulatory 
infrastructures 
of 
countries 
with 
emerging 
nuclear 
programmes. 
58. 
Spain, 
recognizing 
the 
important 
role 
played 
by 
education 
and 
training 
in 
the 
global 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety 
regime, 
asked 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
make 
a 
special 
effort 
and 
consider 
allocating 
more 
resources 
in 
that 
area. 
That 
activity 
should 
go 
further 
than 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
and 
involve 
all 
Member 
States. 
59. 
Spain 
anticipated 
improvement 
in 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
implementation 
rate 
of 
68.6% 
for 
2005 
once 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
had 
been 
restructured. 
In 
2005, 
pledges 
and 
payments 
to 
the 
TCF 
had 
amounted 
to 
89.5% 
of 
the 
target. 
Spain 
had 
paid 
its 
share 
of 
the 
target 
in 
full 
and 
was 
among 
the 
top 
eight 
contributors. 
Spain 
welcomed 
improved 
management 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
optimize 
the 
use 
of 
the 
limited 
resources 
available 
and 
also 
restructuring 
of 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation 
into 
four 
new 
geographical 
areas. 
However, 
resources 
should 
be 
shared 
out 
equally 
among 
those 
areas. 
The 
Latin 
American 
region, 
having 
received 
only 
17% 
in 
2005, 
should 
receive 
a 
greater 
percentage. 
60. 
In 
2005, 
Member 
States 
had 
contributed 
approximately 
$15 
000 
000 
extrabudgetary 
resources 
for 
footnote-a/ 
projects 
and 
Spain 
also 
planned 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
funding 
that 
type 
of 
project,

principally 
in 
the 
Latin 
American 
region. 
In 
the 
year 
under 
review, 
Spain 
had 
made 
an 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
of 
Â300 
000 
to 
help 
finance 
a 
project 
initiated 
by 
the 
Ibero-American 
Forum 
of 
Nuclear 
Regulators 
aimed 
at 
developing 
nuclear 
and 
radiation 
safety. 
Experts 
from 
various 
countries, 
in 
collaboration 
with 
the 
Secretariat, 
had 
developed 
an 
Ibero-American 
network 
for 
knowledge 
management 
of 
radiation 
safety 
in 
the 
region. 
Spain 
intended 
to 
maintain 
the 
same 
level 
of 
funding 
in 
the 
coming 
years. 
Aside 
from 
SpainÂs 
contribution 
to 
the 
TCF, 
its 
national 
institutions, 
in 
particular 
the 
Research 
Centre 
for 
Energy, 
Environment 
and 
Technology 
(CIEMAT), 
had 
provided 
experts 
for 
missions, 
conducted 
training 
courses, 
subsidized 
fellowships 
and 
received 
fellows 
and 
scientific 
visits. 
Spain 
also 
collaborated 
with 
ARCAL 
by 
means 
of 
active 
participation 
through 
CIEMAT, 
contributing 
approximately 
Â150 
000 
to 
various 
of 
its 
projects. 
CIEMAT 
also 
intended 
to 
establish 
cooperation 
with 
countries 
in 
the 
Mediterranean 
region. 


61. 
Under 
the 
memorandum 
of 
understanding 
that 
ENRESA 
(National 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Company) 
had 
signed 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
2005 
for 
joint 
technical 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
decommissioning, 
a 
workshop 
had 
been 
held 
in 
Spain 
on 
support 
in 
dismantling 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
as 
part 
of 
a 
European 
regional 
project. 
ENRESA 
also 
continued 
to 
participate 
actively 
in 
the 
planning 
and 
possible 
launch 
of 
projects 
related 
to 
waste 
management. 
62. 
Spain 
supported 
PACT, 
which 
was 
a 
clear 
example 
of 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes; 
it 
had 
made 
an 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
of 
Â20 
000 
to 
it 
in 
2005, 
and 
would 
do 
so 
again 
in 
2006. 
63. 
In 
2005, 
nuclear 
power 
had 
continued 
to 
play 
an 
important 
role 
in 
Spain. 
The 
9 
units 
in 
operation 
had 
produced 
57 
550 
GWÂ·h, 
which 
was 
19.7% 
of 
the 
total 
national 
electricity 
generation. 
The 
160 
MW 
JosÃ© 
Cabrera 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
had 
been 
shut 
down 
on 
30 
April 
2006. 
Commissioned 
in 
1968, 
it 
had 
been 
the 
least 
powerful 
and 
oldest 
plant 
in 
operation. 
The 
anticipated 
growth 
in 
international 
demand 
for 
energy 
resources 
and 
the 
need 
for 
assured 
energy 
supply 
in 
the 
long 
term 
posed 
challenges 
to 
governments 
and 
the 
specialized 
international 
organizations 
alike. 
Nuclear 
energy 
was 
one 
Â 
not 
uncontroversial 
Â 
option. 
To 
exchange 
views 
on 
the 
many 
issues 
surrounding 
nuclear 
energy, 
taking 
into 
account 
technical, 
economic, 
environmental 
and 
also 
socio-political 
factors, 
a 
debate 
forum 
had 
been 
held 
from 
November 
2005 
to 
May 
2006 
in 
Spain, 
attended 
by 
representatives 
from 
all 
spheres. 
Convened 
in 
response 
to 
a 
commitment 
made 
by 
the 
Spanish 
President 
in 
Parliament, 
it 
had 
produced 
a 
number 
of 
conclusions. 
Relating 
firstly 
to 
basic 
guidelines 
and 
requiring 
action 
in 
the 
near 
term, 
they 
dealt 
with 
such 
matters 
as 
the 
strategy 
for 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
public 
information, 
public 
participation 
in 
the 
decision-making 
mechanisms, 
and 
the 
nuclear 
regulatory 
regime. 
Secondly, 
the 
conclusions 
related 
to 
less 
pressing 
issues 
of 
meeting 
future 
energy 
demand 
in 
Spain. 
Given 
the 
importance 
and 
complexity 
of 
the 
problems 
to 
be 
overcome 
in 
meeting 
future 
energy 
needs 
in 
an 
environmentally 
sustainable 
way, 
they 
required 
a 
global 
approach 
and 
continued 
analysis 
of 
the 
possible 
strategies 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
balanced 
and 
effective 
energy 
policy 
solutions. 
64. 
As 
regards 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
the 
Spanish 
Government 
had 
approved 
the 
revised 
General 
Radioactive 
Waste 
Plan 
in 
June 
2006. 
It 
contained 
the 
strategies 
and 
actions 
to 
be 
undertaken 
in 
Spain 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
and 
facility 
decommissioning, 
along 
with 
the 
corresponding 
economic 
and 
financial 
study. 
The 
revised 
plan 
took 
into 
account 
the 
experience 
of 
Spain 
and 
other 
countries 
in 
managing 
spent 
fuel 
and 
high-level 
radioactive 
waste 
and 
attached 
priority 
to 
the 
construction 
of 
a 
centralized 
temporary 
store, 
thereby 
postponing 
decisions 
related 
to 
final 
radioactive 
waste 
disposal. 
65. 
Mr. 
WIN 
(Myanmar) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005. 
He 
reaffirmed 
MyanmarÂs 
support 
of 
the 
Agency's 
vital 
work 
in 
promoting 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
welcomed 
its 
efforts 
to 
enhance 
nuclear 
safety

and 
security 
and 
to 
strengthen 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
the 
non-
proliferation 
regime. 


66. 
Myanmar 
had 
signed 
the 
CTBT 
in 
1996 
and 
also, 
in 
1995, 
the 
Treaty 
on 
the 
Southeast 
Asia 
Nuclear-Weapon-Free 
Zone 
(SEANWFZ), 
which 
had 
come 
into 
force 
in 
1997. 
In 
his 
country's 
view, 
NWFZs 
helped 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
contributed 
to 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
67. 
Myanmar, 
which 
had 
embarked 
upon 
a 
programme 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
applications, 
was 
aware 
of 
the 
need 
for 
an 
adequate 
radiation 
protection 
and 
waste 
safety 
infrastructure. 
In 
that 
connection, 
his 
delegation 
expressed 
appreciation 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
assisting 
Myanmar 
through 
the 
interregional 
Model 
Project 
and 
the 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
project 
on 
strengthening 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure. 
68. 
The 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
was 
an 
effective 
way 
of 
promoting 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peace, 
health 
and 
prosperity 
throughout 
the 
world 
with 
the 
help 
of 
technology 
transfer. 
His 
Government 
thanked 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
assistance 
in 
making 
nuclear 
techniques 
used 
in 
medical 
research 
and 
in 
industry 
available 
in 
Myanmar. 
The 
nuclear 
technologies 
provided 
under 
the 
Agency's 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
also 
contributed 
to 
the 
countryÂs 
development 
efforts 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
livestock 
and 
breeding, 
food, 
agriculture 
and 
health 
care. 
The 
relevant 
facilities 
were 
sustained 
by 
the 
AgencyÂs 
contribution 
in 
terms 
of 
equipment, 
expertise 
and 
training. 
Technical 
cooperation 
projects 
were 
also 
assisting 
in 
the 
area 
of 
human 
resources 
development. 
69. 
His 
delegation 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
role 
in 
promoting 
regional 
cooperation 
on 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
through 
the 
RCA, 
AFRA 
and 
ARCAL 
programmes. 
Myanmar 
benefited 
from 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
RCA, 
and 
it 
was 
active 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
energy, 
the 
environment, 
industry, 
health 
care, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
management 
of 
TCDC 
efforts. 
70. 
Mr. 
DE 
VISSER 
(Netherlands) 
said 
it 
was 
paradoxical 
that 
the 
years 
since 
the 
end 
of 
the 
cold 
war 
had 
seen 
more 
setbacks 
than 
successes 
for 
the 
global 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
The 
NPT 
remained 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
that 
regime 
and 
the 
essential 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
Too 
many 
opportunities 
had 
been 
missed 
to 
create 
a 
more 
positive 
climate 
for 
bringing 
armaments 
under 
control. 
Further 
steps 
could 
have 
been 
taken 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty, 
the 
CTBT, 
the 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
the 
additional 
protocol 
thereto. 
The 
international 
community 
needed 
to 
overcome 
the 
obstacles 
to 
success 
and 
breathe 
new 
life 
into 
the 
non-proliferation 
and 
arms 
control 
agenda. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
system, 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-
proliferation 
regime, 
should 
be 
further 
strengthened 
and 
universalized. 
The 
Netherlands 
called 
on 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
conclude 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols. 
71. 
His 
country 
was 
committed 
to 
the 
early 
entry 
into 
force 
of 
the 
CTBT, 
which 
was 
in 
its 
tenth 
anniversary 
year. 
At 
a 
recent 
ÂFriends 
of 
the 
CTBTÂ 
meeting 
in 
New 
York, 
the 
Minister 
of 
Foreign 
Affairs 
of 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
underlined 
the 
political 
and 
practical 
relevance 
of 
an 
operational 
and 
verifiable 
CTBT. 
Realistically, 
great 
efforts 
would 
have 
to 
be 
made 
to 
keep 
the 
CTBTO 
alive. 
72. 
His 
country 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
need 
to 
bring 
the 
most 
sensitive 
nuclear 
activities, 
notably 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing, 
under 
better 
multilateral 
control. 
It 
had 
taken 
an 
active 
stance 
on 
the 
topic 
of 
the 
Special 
Event 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
namely 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
supply 
and 
non-
proliferation. 
As 
a 
country 
with 
a 
large 
enrichment 
industry 
and 
a 
strong 
supporter 
of 
a 
strengthened 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
participated 
in 
the 
independent 
expert 
group 
set 
up 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
two 
years 
previously 
to 
consider 
multilateral 
nuclear 
approaches, 
which 
had 
made 
a 
number 
of 
recommendations 
worthy 
of 
further 
consideration. 
In 
the 
same 
spirit, 
it 
had 
cooperated 
with 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America, 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
Germany 
and 
France 
to 
produce 
the 
concept 
for 
a 
multicultural 
mechanism 
for 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel. 
His 
delegation 
hoped 
that 
the 
Special 
Event 
would 
give 
rise 
to 
more 
contributions, 
fruitful 
discussions 

GC(50)/OR.7

and 
useful 
recommendations 
on 
the 
matter. 
He 
also 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
play 
a 
significant 
role 
not 
only 
in 
exploring 
the 
feasibility 
of 
ideas 
on 
fuel 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
but 
also 
in 
the 
management 
of 
a 
future 
system. 
He 
stressed 
that 
broad 
acceptance 
of 
any 
future 
mechanism 
was 
crucial. 


73. 
The 
Netherlands, 
which 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities, 
had 
already 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
target 
for 
2007. 
Adequate 
and 
predictable 
resources 
were 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
those 
activities. 
He 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
TCF 
in 
full 
and 
on 
time. 
His 
delegation 
welcomed 
progress 
in 
streamlining 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
and 
hoped 
that 
it 
would 
result 
in 
a 
considerably 
higher 
rate 
of 
implementation 
of 
the 
TCF 
in 
2006. 
74. 
The 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
was 
a 
very 
useful 
instrument 
through 
which 
nuclear 
safety 
could 
be 
improved 
worldwide. 
His 
country, 
while 
in 
favour 
of 
a 
mechanism 
whereby 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
activities 
were 
financed 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget, 
accepted 
that 
voluntary 
extrabudgetary 
contributions 
remained 
necessary 
for 
the 
time 
being. 
He 
called 
upon 
all 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
that 
Fund 
generously 
and 
unconditionally 
as 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
done. 
75. 
The 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
held 
in 
Vienna 
in 
May 
had 
been 
a 
success. 
There 
had 
been 
a 
welcome 
increase 
in 
the 
number 
of 
State 
party 
to 
that 
Convention 
Â 
from 
33 
to 
42 
Â 
since 
the 
preceding 
review 
meeting, 
enabling 
much 
to 
be 
learnt 
from 
the 
collective 
knowledge 
and 
insight 
of 
many 
national 
experts. 
He 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
which 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention. 
76. 
The 
Netherlands 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
OSART 
mission 
to 
the 
Borssele 
nuclear 
power 
plant, 
its 
only 
operational 
power 
reactor 
unit, 
in 
November 
2005. 
He 
invited 
all 
Member 
States 
to 
consult 
the 
mission 
report 
on 
the 
Agency's 
website. 
The 
staff 
and 
management 
of 
the 
plant 
were 
implementing 
the 
reportÂs 
recommendations 
in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Dutch 
regulatory 
authorities 
and 
were 
looking 
forward 
to 
the 
follow-up 
mission 
scheduled 
for 
June 
2007. 
77. 
Following 
the 
OSART 
mission, 
the 
Netherlands 
had 
invited 
physical 
protection 
experts 
from 
the 
Agency 
for 
an 
IPPAS 
mission, 
which 
had 
been 
combined 
with 
a 
national 
review. 
The 
findings 
had 
been 
very 
positive 
and 
the 
few 
recommendations 
the 
mission 
had 
made 
were 
currently 
being 
implemented. 
78. 
The 
Netherlands 
had 
hosted 
two 
Agency 
events 
in 
2006: 
one 
on 
design 
basis 
threat 
and 
another 
on 
the 
security 
of 
research 
reactors. 
Yet 
another 
event 
on 
the 
refurbishment 
of 
research 
reactors 
was 
planned 
for 
October 
2006 
and 
the 
Netherlands 
remained 
committed 
to 
hosting 
such 
events 
in 
the 
future. 
79. 
A 
decision 
had 
recently 
been 
taken 
to 
extend 
the 
operating 
life 
of 
the 
Borssele 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
Â 
which 
had 
been 
commissioned 
in 
1973 
and 
which 
had 
originally 
been 
scheduled 
for 
closure 
in 
2013 
Â 
by 
20 
years. 
That 
reflected 
his 
countryÂs 
renewed 
commitment 
to 
nuclear 
energy. 
One 
condition 
for 
that 
extension 
was 
that 
the 
plant 
invest 
250 
million 
euros 
in 
sustainable 
energy, 
the 
main 
focus 
being 
on 
energy 
saving, 
clean 
fossil 
fuels, 
including 
carbon 
sequestration, 
and 
renewable 
energy, 
such 
as 
biomass. 
His 
Government 
had 
already 
committed 
itself 
to 
investing 
an 
equal 
amount 
in 
sustainable 
energy 
and 
the 
total 
investment 
of 
500 
million 
euros 
would 
bring 
about 
a 
reduction 
of 
1.4 
million 
tonnes 
of 
CO2 
in 
the 
Netherlands 
per 
year. 
80. 
The 
High 
Flux 
Reactor 
in 
Petten, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
powerful 
multi-purpose 
research 
and 
test 
reactors 
in 
the 
world, 
had 
now 
been 
converted 
to 
LEU, 
thereby 
making 
a 
positive 
contribution 
to 
limiting 
the 
use 
of 
proliferation-sensitive 
material.

81. 
In 
conclusion, 
he 
said 
the 
Netherlands 
attached 
the 
utmost 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
role 
in 
strengthening 
disarmament 
and 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
and 
advancing 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all. 
It 
would 
continue 
to 
support 
the 
Agency 
wherever 
possible 
in 
carrying 
out 
that 
vital 
mandate. 
82. 
Mr. 
NIEWENHUYS 
(Belgium) 
said 
that 
as 
a 
founder 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
his 
country 
had 
shown 
an 
early 
interest 
in 
the 
civil 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Its 
first 
research 
reactor 
was 
50 
years 
old 
and 
nuclear 
power 
now 
accounted 
for 
almost 
60% 
of 
BelgiumÂs 
electricity 
generation. 
Belgium 
shared 
the 
interest 
shown 
by 
many 
others 
in 
developing 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
83. 
Security 
was 
a 
vital 
adjunct 
to 
development 
of 
the 
civil 
nuclear 
sector 
but 
required 
a 
high 
level 
of 
national 
responsibility 
and 
organization 
as 
well 
as 
international 
cooperation. 
The 
competence, 
professionalism 
and 
impartiality 
of 
the 
Agency 
Â 
the 
appropriate 
forum 
for 
such 
cooperation 
Â 
had 
been 
justly 
rewarded 
with 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005. 
Mutual 
support 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States 
was 
essential 
to 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
its 
work. 
84. 
Events 
had 
unfortunately 
demonstrated 
that 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
alone 
could 
not 
provide 
conclusive 
proof 
of 
the 
absence 
of 
undeclared 
nuclear 
activities. 
The 
additional 
protocol, 
which 
should 
be 
concluded 
by 
all 
States, 
enabled 
the 
Secretariat 
to 
verify 
State 
declarations 
fully. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
any 
serious 
doubt 
about 
whether 
a 
State 
was 
meeting 
its 
commitments, 
that 
State 
should 
automatically 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
cooperate 
transparently 
with 
the 
Agency 
to 
resolve 
the 
matter 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible. 
85. 
There 
were 
legitimate 
doubts 
about 
the 
peaceful 
intentions 
of 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
Recalling 
relevant 
decisions 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696, 
he 
said 
that 
every 
effort 
should 
be 
made 
to 
resolve 
that 
complex 
problem 
with 
full 
regard 
for 
the 
United 
Nations 
Charter 
and 
the 
NPT. 
Belgium 
appealed 
to 
the 
Iranian 
authorities 
to 
respond 
positively 
to 
offers 
to 
negotiate. 
86. 
In 
the 
same 
vein, 
Belgium 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
resume 
the 
path 
of 
dialogue 
with 
a 
view 
to 
allaying 
the 
international 
community's 
legitimate 
concerns 
about 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
87. 
Belgium 
applauded 
Libya's 
renunciation 
of 
its 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
and, 
in 
the 
same 
context, 
noted 
Iraq's 
recent 
declaration 
that 
it 
would 
not 
continue 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
preceding 
regime. 
88. 
The 
second 
review 
meeting 
of 
the 
Contracting 
Parties 
to 
the 
Joint 
Convention 
had 
proved 
a 
positive 
exercise 
in 
fostering 
enhanced 
safety 
practices, 
which 
would 
be 
underpinned 
by 
the 
recent 
consolidation 
by 
the 
Secretariat 
of

Belgium 
would 
receive 
its 
first 
OSART 
mission 
in 
May 
2007, 
which 
would 
be 
extensive. 
It 
wanted 
the 
safety 
of 
the 
nuclear 
power 
plant 
concerned 
to 
be 
studied 
in 
depth 
in 
order 
to 
learn 
as 
much 
as 
possible. 
90. 
The 
procedure 
leading 
to 
parliamentary 
approval 
of 
the 
CPPNM 
amendment 
was 
under 
way. 
BelgiumÂs 
national 
system 
for 
the 
physical 
protection 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
nuclear 
facilities 
was 
largely 
based 
on 
the 
Agency 
recommendations 
in 
document 
INFCIRC/225/Rev.4. 
The 
European 
Directive 
on 
the 
control 
of 
high-activity 
sealed 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
orphan 
sources 
had 
been 
transcribed 
into 
national 
law, 
and 
future 
regulations 
would 
be 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
91. 
His 
Government 
had 
recently 
decided 
on 
the 
site 
for 
a 
final 
disposal 
facility 
for 
low 
and 
intermediate 
level 
waste 
with 
a 
short 
half-life, 
following 
close 
consultation 
with 
local 
communities.

92. 
Belgium 
had 
followed 
with 
interest 
the 
work 
of 
the 
Oslo 
symposium 
on 
the 
minimization 
of 
HEU 
in 
civilian 
nuclear 
applications 
and 
would 
be 
in 
a 
position 
to 
convert 
its 
BR-2 
research 
reactor 
to 
LEU 
when 
certain 
economic 
and 
technical 
conditions 
had 
been 
met. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
following 
the 
preliminary 
discussions 
at 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
Special 
Event 
on 
multilateral 
assurances 
of 
nuclear 
supply 
with 
great 
interest. 
93. 
Finally, 
he 
said 
that 
Belgium 
had 
a 
long 
history 
of 
extensive 
involvement 
in 
technical 
cooperation 
with 
developing 
countries, 
particularly 
training 
students 
and 
fellows 
at 
its 
universities 
and 
research 
centres. 
The 
Belgian 
Nuclear 
Research 
Centre 
at 
Mol 
had 
recently 
concluded 
cooperation 
agreements 
with 
various 
countries. 
Belgium's 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
TCF 
were 
increasing 
but 
depended 
on 
budgetary 
availability 
and 
competition 
with 
contributions 
to 
other 
international 
organizations. 
Belgium 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
provide 
its 
contribution 
for 
2007. 
Mr. 
Minty 
(South 
Africa) 
took 
the 
chair. 


94. 
Mr. 
BELEVAN-MCBRIDE 
(Peru) 
said 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
the 
Agency 
was 
a 
symbolic 
moment. 
Fifty 
years 
since 
its 
creation, 
the 
Âatoms 
for 
peaceÂ 
Agency 
had 
become 
the 
global 
focal 
point 
for 
peaceful 
nuclear 
cooperation. 
It 
was 
an 
essential 
international 
instrument 
for 
the 
prevention 
of 
nuclear 
proliferation 
and 
for 
combating 
nuclear 
terrorism. 
The 
time 
was 
right 
to 
reflect 
on 
how 
far 
the 
Agency 
had 
come 
in 
implementation 
of 
its 
central 
pillars: 
non-proliferation, 
verification, 
safety 
and 
technology. 
Much 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
the 
Agency's 
first 
half-century, 
but 
the 
way 
ahead 
was 
arduous 
and 
much 
remained 
to 
be 
done. 
In 
Peru, 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
complete 
verification 
of 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
the 
security 
demanded 
by 
the 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
non-nuclear-weapon 
States, 
elimination 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
and 
technical 
cooperation 
to 
benefit 
from 
nuclear 
energy 
continued 
to 
be 
fundamental 
aims 
of 
foreign 
policy, 
as 
the 
newly 
elected 
Government 
had 
just 
reiterated. 
95. 
His 
delegation 
was 
discouraged 
by 
the 
lack 
of 
progress 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
making 
towards 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
strengthen 
the 
AgencyÂs 
capabilities 
as 
regards 
verification, 
control 
and 
other 
of 
its 
responsibilities. 
In 
taking 
stock 
of 
the 
status 
quo, 
it 
was 
ironic 
to 
note 
that, 
since 
the 
atom 
had 
been 
harnessed, 
more 
people 
had 
died 
in 
the 
world 
than 
during 
any 
other 
period 
in 
human 
history. 
It 
was 
scandalous 
that 
the 
huge 
potential 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
had 
not 
yet 
led 
to 
any 
real 
improvement 
in 
life 
on 
earth. 
Although 
some 
progress 
had 
been 
made, 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
disasters 
facing 
humanity 
were 
a 
constant 
reminder 
of 
man's 
incapability 
to 
ensure 
equitable 
development 
for 
all. 
The 
gap 
between 
rich 
and 
poor 
was 
widening. 
Nuclear 
energy 
should 
have 
allowed 
that 
gap 
to 
be 
narrowed, 
but 
that 
had 
not 
been 
the 
case. 
The 
attainment 
of 
a 
just 
and 
rational 
world 
order 
was 
still 
only 
being 
talked 
about 
and 
not 
being 
put 
into 
practice. 
On 
receiving 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
underlined 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
world 
was 
still 
far 
from 
achieving 
the 
new 
order 
many 
had 
dreamed 
about 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
cold 
war, 
with 
the 
progressive 
but 
definitive 
destruction 
of 
nuclear 
arsenals 
and 
determined 
progress 
towards 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
The 
walls 
between 
East 
and 
West 
had 
been 
torn 
down, 
but 
bridges 
had 
yet 
to 
be 
built 
between 
North 
and 
South 
Â 
the 
rich 
and 
the 
poor. 
It 
should 
come 
as 
no 
surprise 
that 
poverty 
continued 
to 
breed 
conflict. 
96. 
Through 
its 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
the 
Agency 
was 
making 
a 
direct 
and 
positive 
contribution 
to 
overcoming 
poverty 
and 
conflict 
by 
gradually 
improving 
living 
conditions 
through 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Peru 
was 
grateful 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
continued 
to 
receive 
in 
that 
connection. 
97. 
Peru 
had 
declared 
its 
reservations 
regarding 
those 
parts 
of 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
14th 
NAM 
summit 
held 
recently 
in 
Havana, 
Cuba, 
that 
did 
not 
correspond 
with 
its 
foreign 
policy. 
They 
related

particular 
to 
non-proliferation, 
disarmament 
and 
international 
security. 
Peru 
had 
also 
expressed 
its 
reservation 
regarding 
the 
statement 
on 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue. 


98. 
Pursuant 
to 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
on 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
and 
in 
fulfilment 
of 
its 
responsibilities 
as 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Security 
Council, 
Peru 
was 
organizing 
a 
regional 
seminar 
for 
countries 
from 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
to 
be 
held 
in 
Lima 
in 
November 
2006. 
Peru 
had 
also 
invited 
representatives 
from 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
CTBTO 
to 
participate. 
99. 
Peru 
supported 
the 
work 
of 
INLEX, 
whose 
function 
was 
to 
develop 
for 
the 
Agency 
an 
effective, 
just 
and 
universal 
system 
for 
compensation 
in 
the 
event 
of 
a 
nuclear 
incident. 
In 
that 
context, 
Peru 
was 
hosting 
a 
regional 
workshop 
on 
nuclear 
liability 
in 
December 
2006, 
in 
line 
with 
resolution 
GC(49)/RES/9.B 
on 
transport 
safety. 
100. 
Finally, 
he 
reiterated 
PeruÂs 
commitment 
to 
ARCAL 
and 
his 
countryÂs 
unswerving 
support 
for 
the 
AgencyÂs 
guiding 
principles 
aimed 
at 
the 
exclusively 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy.

Requests 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
voting 
rights 
(GC(50)/INF/7 
and 
11) 


101. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
had 
before 
it 
requests 
from 
Georgia 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Moldova 
for 
the 
restoration 
of 
their 
voting 
rights. 
The 
General 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
that 
GeorgiaÂs 
right 
to 
vote 
not 
be 
restored. 
It 
had 
also 
recommended 
that 
the 
Republic 
of 
MoldovaÂs 
right 
to 
vote 
not 
be 
restored. 
102. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
accepted 
the 
recommendations 
of 
the 
General 
Committee. 
103. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
24. 
Examination 
of 
delegatesÂ 
credentials 
(GC(50)/27) 


104. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
the 
General 
Committee 
had 
met 
earlier 
in 
the 
day 
to 
examine 
the 
credentials 
of 
all 
delegates, 
as 
provided 
for 
in 
Rule 
28 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure. 
The 
report 
of 
the 
Committee 
was 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/27. 
After 
discussion, 
the 
Committee 
had 
recommended 
the 
adoption 
by 
the 
Conference 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
7 
of 
its 
report, 
with 
the 
reservations 
and 
positions 
expressed 
in 
the 
report. 
105. 
Mr. 
AGHAZADEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
continued 
not 
to 
recognize 
Israel 
as 
a 
State. 
Accordingly, 
his 
delegation 
wished 
to 
express 
its 
strong 
reservations 
regarding 
the 
credentials 
of 
the 
delegation 
of 
Israel. 
106. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
was 
prepared 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
paragraph 
7 
of 
document 
GC(50)/27. 
107. 
It 
was 
so 
decided.

Election 
of 
members 
to 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
(GC(50)/5 
and 
24) 
108. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
recalled 
that 
in 
1989 
the 
General 
Conference 
had 
approved 
a 
procedure 


whereby, 
when 
there 
was 
agreement 
regarding 
the 
candidate 
or 
candidates 
from 
a 
particular 
area, 
no 
secret 
ballot 
would 
be 
held; 
balloting 
would 
take 
place 
only 
for 
those 
areas 
where 
no 
candidate 
had 
been 
agreed 
upon. 
That 
procedure 
considerably 
facilitated 
the 
rational 
use 
of 
the 
General 
ConferenceÂs 
time. 
Accordingly, 
he 
proposed 
that 
Rule 
79 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure 
of 
the 
General 
Conference, 
which 
provided 
that 
elections 
to 
the 
Board 
should 
be 
by 
secret 
ballot, 
be 
suspended 
in 
respect 
of 
those 
areas 
for 
which 
there 
was 
agreement. 


109. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
110. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
he 
was 
happy 
to 
report 
that 
agreement 
had 
been 
reached 
in 
all 
area 
groups 
on 
their 
candidates 
for 
the 
vacancies 
to 
be 
filled. 
He 
expressed 
his 
sincere 
appreciation 
to 
all 
groups 
for 
their 
efforts 
to 
reach 
agreement, 
which 
had 
expedited 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
work. 
111. 
Drawing 
attention 
to 
document 
GC(50)/5, 
containing 
a 
list 
of 
the 
Agency 
Member 
States 
designated 
to 
serve 
on 
the 
Board 
from 
the 
end 
of 
the 
ConferenceÂs 
current 
session 
until 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fifty-first 
(2007) 
regular 
session, 
he 
recalled 
that, 
under 
Rule 
83 
of 
the 
Rules 
of 
Procedure, 
he 
had 
to 
inform 
the 
General 
Conference 
of 
the 
elective 
places 
on 
the 
Board 
that 
had 
to 
be 
filled. 
To 
that 
end, 
document 
GC(50)/24 
had 
been 
prepared; 
it 
indicated 
that 
the 
Conference 
had 
to 
elect 
eleven 
members 
of 
the 
Board 
from 
the 
seven 
categories 
listed. 
112. 
He 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
elect 
Bolivia, 
Brazil 
and 
Chile 
to 
the 
three 
vacant 
seats 
for 
Latin 
America. 
113. 
Bolivia, 
Brazil 
and 
Chile 
were 
duly 
elected. 
114. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
elect 
Austria 
and 
Finland 
to 
the

Croatia 
was 
duly 
elected. 
118. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
wished 
to 
elect 
Ethiopia 
and 
Nigeria 
to 
the 
two 
vacant

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(resumed) 
(GC(50)/4) 
126. 
Mr. 
SOTIROPOULOS 
(Greece) 
said 
that 
in 
the 
fifty 
years 
since 
its 
foundation, 
the 
Agency 
had 
dealt 
with 
increasingly 
important 
issues 
in 
connection 
with 
its 
statutory 
activities, 
and 
its 
efforts 
had 
been 
justly 
rewarded 
with 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005. 
127. 
The 
Agency 
had 
developed 
many 
nuclear 
research 
programmes 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
health, 
nutrition, 
agriculture, 
industry 
and 
education, 
thereby 
enabling 
many 
developing 
countries 
to 
combat 
infant 
malnutrition, 
to 
produce 
better 
crops 
and 
to 
manage 
water 
resources. 
An 
important 
development 
in 
that 
area 
was 
PACT, 
which 
aimed 
to 
build 
partnerships 
and 
acquire 
funds 
from 
traditional 
and 
non-
traditional 
donors. 
Greece 
fully 
supported 
resolution 
GC(49)/RES/12 
calling 
for 
the 
allocation 
and 
mobilization 
of 
resources 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
PACT 
as 
one 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
priorities. 
128. 
Greece 
had 
always 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
all 
aspects 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
having 
joined 
the 
Incident 
Reporting 
System 
for 
Research 
Reactors 
and 
having 
ratified 
the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety. 
It 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
establish 
and 
maintain 
a 
global 
safety 
regime 
through 
the 
adoption 
of 
action 
plans 
as 
a 
first 
step. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
high 
priority 
accorded 
to 
the 
operational 
safety 
performance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
plants 
and 
related 
nuclear 
facilities 
worldwide, 
which 
should 
be 
backed 
up 
by 
legal 
instruments 
on 
international 
safety. 
Specifically, 
it 
had 
appreciated 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
International 
Action 
Plan 
on 
the 
Decommissioning 
of 
Nuclear 
Facilities 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
related 
safety 
documents. 
His 
Government 
would 
be 
hosting 
the 
International 
Conference 
on 
Lessons 
Learned 
from 
Decommissioning 
of 
Nuclear 
Facilities 
and 
the 
Safe 
Termination 
of 
Nuclear 
Activities 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Agency, 
the 
OECD/NEA 
and 
the 
European 
Commission 
in 
Athens 
in 
December 
2006. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
conclusions 
of 
that 
conference 
would 
contribute 
to 
the 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
culture 
and 
he 
encouraged 
the 
Director 
General 
to 
step 
up 
efforts 
to 
ensure 
the 
implementation 
of 
Agency 
safety 
standards 
by 
all 
States. 
129. 
Within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
EU, 
Greece 
had 
unequivocally 
backed 
and 
actively 
participated 
in 
all 
international 
and 
regional 
endeavours 
to 
counter 
terrorism 
and 
to 
prevent 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
Greece 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
Agency's 
nuclear 
security 
programme 
and 
had 
made 
both 
financial 
and 
in-kind 
contributions 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
Several 
seminars 
on 
security 
issues 
under 
the 
EU 
Joint 
Action 
with 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
or 
would 
be 
held 
in 
Athens 
in 
conjunction 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission. 
Greece 
endorsed 
the 
EU 
Council 
Joint 
Action 
2006/418/CFSP 
of 
12 
June 
2006 
on 
support 
for 
Agency 
activities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
verification 
and 
in 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
EU 
Strategy 
against 
the 
Proliferation 
of 
Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction. 
130. 
His 
country 
was 
a 
member 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
illicit 
trafficking 
information 
system, 
which 
played 
an 
active 
role 
in 
the 
United 
Nations 
committees 
established 
by 
Security 
Council 
resolutions 
1373 
(2001) 
and 
1540 
(2004), 
and 
was 
participating 
in 
the 
Proliferation 
Security 
Initiative. 
It 
had 
signed 
the 
amendment 
to 
the 
CPPNM 
and 
had 
signed, 
ratified 
and 
actively 
participated 
in 
the 
review 
meetings 
of 

GC(50)/OR.7

the 
Convention 
on 
Nuclear 
Safety 
and 
the 
Joint 
Convention. 
It 
had 
also 
signed 
the 
International 
Convention 
for 
the 
Suppression 
of 
Acts 
of 
Nuclear 
Terrorism 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Assembly, 
which 
represented 
vital 
progress 
in 
multilateral 
efforts 
to 
prevent 
nuclear 
terrorism. 


131. 
Nuclear 
security 
infrastructure 
and 
know-how 
in 
Greece 
had 
significantly 
improved 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Energy 
for 
the 
Olympic 
Games 
in 
2004. 
Since 
then, 
Greece 
had 
been 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
equipment 
installed 
and 
had 
shared 
its 
experience 
with 
other 
countries 
by 
providing 
training 
and 
seminars. 
For 
example, 
a 
Chinese 
delegation 
had 
met 
with 
Greek 
scientists 
and 
officials 
with 
a 
view 
to 
ensuring 
a 
high 
level 
of 
nuclear 
security 
and 
emergency 
preparedness 
during 
the 
2008 
Olympic 
Games 
in 
Beijing. 
132. 
Greece 
was 
adhering 
to 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
now 
being 
incorporated 
into 
national 
legislation, 
and 
it 
was 
implementing 
the 
complementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
133. 
Unfortunately 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
had 
recently 
come 
under 
pressure 
for 
a 
number 
of 
reasons, 
including 
the 
lack 
of 
substantive 
progress 
on 
disarmament, 
the 
threat 
of 
nuclear 
terrorism 
and 
regional 
instability. 
Greece 
supported 
the 
strengthening 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
role 
and 
of 
its 
safeguards 
system. 
The 
universal 
application 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
would 
provide 
the 
required 
assurances. 
National 
and 
multilateral 
export 
controls 
relied 
on 
Agency 
safeguards 
to 
ensure 
that 
items 
were 
not 
diverted 
and 
the 
efficiency 
and 
effectiveness 
of 
safeguards 
also 
helped 
to 
create 
confidence 
and 
promote 
international 
trade 
and 
cooperation. 
134. 
Greece 
had 
benefited 
from 
Agency 
support 
in 
converting 
its 
GRR-1 
research 
reactor 
to 
LEU 
fuel. 
All 
the 
HEU 
spent 
fuel 
had 
been 
shipped 
back 
to 
the 
United 
States. 
Greece 
had 
welcomed 
the 
international 
symposium 
on 
minimization 
of 
HEU 
in 
the 
civilian 
nuclear 
sector, 
held 
in 
Oslo 
in 
June 
2006, 
and 
endorsed 
the 
ChairÂs 
summary 
contained 
in 
document 
INFCIRC/677. 
135. 
Greece 
reiterated 
its 
support 
for 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
initiative 
to 
establish 
an 
expert 
group 
to 
study 
ways 
and 
means 
of 
achieving 
multilateral 
control 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology. 
The 
Special 
Event 
at 
the 
General 
Conference 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
and 
non-proliferation 
would 
provide 
an 
opportunity 
for 
constructive 
discussion 
on 
that 
matter. 
However, 
while 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute 
authorized 
the 
Agency 
to 
take 
almost 
any 
conceivable 
action 
and 
to 
launch 
almost 
any 
undertaking 
to 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
attainment 
of 
that 
goal 
depended 
mainly 
on 
politics 
and 
nuclear 
commerce, 
over 
which 
the 
Agency 
had 
little 
or 
no 
control. 
136. 
Greece 
supported 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
within 
the 
Framework 
of 
the 
IAEA 
Statute, 
as 
approved 
in 
June 
2005 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
with 
the 
aim 
of 
strengthening 
the 
Agency's 
safeguards 
systems 
and 
was 
looking 
forward 
to 
participating 
in 
it. 
137. 
Greece, 
which 
contributed 
its 
full 
share 
to 
the 
TCF, 
fully 
appreciated 
the 
contribution 
of 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
to 
the 
worldwide 
promotion 
of 
scientific, 
technological 
and 
regulatory 
capabilities 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
participating 
Member 
States 
through 
technology 
transfer 
and 
capacity-building. 
Technical 
cooperation 
was 
a 
fundamental 
pillar 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities. 
Greece 
supported 
every 
measure 
to 
ensure 
that 
its 
projects 
achieved 
meaningful 
and 
sustained 
benefits 
to 
Member 
States. 
Although 
programme 
planning 
was 
the 
prerogative 
of 
individual 
Member 
States, 
the 
Agency 
should 
assist 
them 
in 
preparing 
their 
programmes 
and 
help 
ensure 
that 
they 
enjoyed 
strong 
government 
support. 
Technical 
cooperation 
projects 
needed 
to 
be 
implemented 
in 
the 
context 
of 
a 
network 
of 
partnerships, 
primarily 
between 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Member 
States, 
but 
also 
including 
partners 
from 
other 
national 
institutions, 
relevant 
United 
Nations 
agencies, 
NGOs 
and 
private-sector 
donors. 
Cooperation 
among 
the 
Agency 
Departments 
involved 
in 
the 
programmes 
was 
also 
vital.

138. 
As 
a 
recipient 
country 
of 
Agency 
technical 
cooperation, 
Greece 
had 
established 
specialized 
laboratories 
and 
its 
scientists 
had 
been 
trained 
in 
other 
countries. 
Currently, 
as 
a 
donor, 
Greece 
participated 
in 
regional 
projects, 
organized 
training 
courses, 
provided 
expertise 
and 
hosted 
scientists 
from 
various 
regions. 
It 
was 
ready 
to 
contribute 
in 
kind 
by 
training 
scientists 
free 
of 
charge 
and, 
in 
2006, 
had 
trained 
10 
Agency 
fellows 
in 
specialized 
laboratories 
for 
23 
months. 
It 
wished 
to 
maintain 
regional 
scientific 
contacts 
and 
cooperation 
in 
areas 
of 
common 
interest 
such 
as 
radiation 
protection, 
environmental 
radioactivity 
control, 
illicit 
trafficking 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
139. 
Greece 
had 
two 
national 
programmes 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
one 
on 
the 
development 
of 
a 
regional 
neutron 
scattering 
centre 
and 
the 
other 
on 
the 
measurement 
of 
the 
radionuclide 
intakes 
of 
workers. 
It 
also 
participated 
in 
regional 
programmes 
on 
environmental 
monitoring, 
marine 
monitoring, 
nuclear 
techniques 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
cultural 
heritage 
artefacts 
and 
on 
the 
strengthening 
of 
national 
capabilities 
in 
radiation, 
waste 
and 
transport 
safety. 
During 
the 
next 
technical 
cooperation 
cycle 
it 
wished 
to 
continue 
participating 
in 
existing 
programmes 
and 
to 
introduce 
new 
projects 
on 
education 
and 
training 
to 
support 
the 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
and 
capacity-building 
for 
upgrading 
the 
nuclear 
security 
infrastructure. 
140. 
The 
Greek 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
was 
a 
recognized 
regional 
training 
centre 
and 
annually 
organized 
and 
hosted 
a 
regional 
postgraduate 
course 
attended 
by 
around 
20 
scientists 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
the 
safety 
of 
radiation 
sources. 
A 
long-term 
agreement 
between 
it 
and 
the 
Agency 
could 
ensure 
the 
sustainability 
of 
that 
course 
and 
the 
operation 
of 
regional 
centres. 
The 
Commission 
also 
hosted 
several 
shorter 
seminars 
annually 
in 
the 
fields 
of 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
applications 
and 
medicine. 
They 
included 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
on 
SPECT 
in 
cardiology 
and 
oncology 
and 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
for 
the 
first 
responders 
to 
radiological 
emergencies, 
both 
being 
held 
in 
September 
2006, 
and 
a 
regional 
training 
course 
on 
gamma 
spectrometry 
for 
monitoring 
radionuclides 
in 
air, 
which 
had 
been 
held 
in 
May 
2006. 
In 
cooperation 
with 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Office 
of 
Nuclear 
Security, 
the 
Commission 
had 
also 
organized 
and 
hosted 
7 
regional 
training 
courses 
on 
nuclear 
security 
advanced 
detection 
equipment 
for 
front 
line 
officers 
and 
mobile 
expert 
support 
teams 
in 
the 
year 
under 
review. 
141. 
Mr. 
AMADOU 
(Niger) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
having 
been 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
142. 
Niger 
was 
fully 
committed 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives 
and 
would 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
help 
promote 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
techniques 
and 
strengthen 
the 
international 
legal 
framework. 
To 
that 
end, 
his 
Government 
had 
embarked 
on 
a 
general 
review 
of 
its 
legislative 
and 
regulatory 
texts 
with 
a 
view 
to 
strengthening 
the 
national 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security. 
Furthermore, 
Niger 
had 
recently 
organized 
a 
national 
seminar 
on 
nuclear 
safety, 
and 
one 
on 
radiation 
protection 
and 
quality 
assurance 
in 
radiodiagnostics. 
It 
had 
also 
given 
its 
political 
support 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources 
and 
the 
Supplementary 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
In 
addition, 
his 
country 
had 
joined 
the 
AgencyÂs 
illicit 
trafficking 
database 
(ITDB). 
143. 
Niger, 
which 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
health, 
agriculture, 
stockbreeding, 
water 
resources 
management 
and 
the 
environment, 
welcomed 
the 
results 
obtained 
through 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme. 
144. 
With 
the 
incidence 
of 
cancer 
in 
Niger 
rapidly 
increasing, 
his 
Government 
had 
made 
plans 
to 
establish 
a 
national 
radiotherapy 
cancer 
treatment 
centre. 
He 
hoped 
that 
the 
Agency 
would 
continue 
to 
provide 
technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
second 
phase 
of 
the 
relevant 
national 
project 
by 
promoting 
human 
resources 
development 
through 
training, 
and 
by 
providing 
international 
experts 
and 
equipment.

145. 
With 
80% 
of 
its 
active 
population 
engaged 
in 
agriculture, 
Niger 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
projects 
seeking 
to 
increase 
agricultural 
and 
animal 
production. 
The 
use 
of 
nuclear 
techniques, 
in 
particular 
for 
varietal 
improvement 
and 
animal 
nutrition, 
could 
make 
a 
major 
contribution 
in 
that 
regard. 
146. 
His 
Government, 
which 
was 
committed 
to 
improving 
human 
health 
and 
environmental 
aspects 
with 
respect 
to 
its 
mining 
sector, 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
radiation 
safety 
and 
the 
management 
of 
mining 
waste. 
As 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
uranium 
producers 
in 
the 
world, 
Niger 
particularly 
welcomed 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
concerning 
radiation 
protection 
of 
workers 
and 
the 
environment 
in 
connection 
with 
uranium 
mining. 
147. 
Niger 
had 
recently 
begun 
to 
evaluate 
its 
knowledge 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
techniques. 
The 
establishment, 
with 
the 
support 
of 
the 
Agency, 
of 
a 
national 
INIS 
centre 
would 
be 
particularly 
useful 
in 
that 
regard.

General 
debate 
and 
Annual 
Report 
for 
2005 
(continued) 
(GC(50)/4) 
1. 
Mr. 
MOREJÃN 
ALMEIDA 
(Ecuador) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
and 
Director 
General 
on 
receiving 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
for 
2005. 
2. 
His 
country 
had 
always 
been 
committed 
to 
non-proliferation, 
as 
evidenced 
by 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
worldÂs 
first 
densely 
populated 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone. 
It 
had 
condemned 
all 
non-peaceful 
nuclear 
programmes 
and 
had 
always 
actively 
promoted 
adherence 
to 
international 
non-proliferation 
agreements. 
It 
was 
a 
committed 
supporter 
of 
the 
Agency 
and 
insisted 
on 
the 
need 
to 
maintain 
a 
balance 
among 
the 
organizationÂs 
statutory 
activities. 
3. 
States 
had 
not 
only 
a 
national 
but 
also 
a 
collective 
responsibility 
to 
take 
measures 
to 
prevent 
accidents 
involving 
and 
malicious 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
technology. 
Ecuador 
had 
organized 
and 
hosted, 
with 
Agency 
support, 
a 
pan-American 
meeting 
on 
strengthening 
implementation 
of 
international 
instruments 
in 
the 
Americas 
for 
enhanced 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
security 
in 
Quito 
on 
3Â4 
April 
2006. 
The 
aim 
of 
the 
meeting 
had 
been 
to 
raise 
awareness 
of 
the 
need 
for 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
security 
and 
to 
promote 
regional 
cooperation. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
legal 
framework 
that 
had 
been 
established 
in 
that 
area 
through 
various 
international 
instruments 
and 
standards. 
It 
had 
informed 
the 
Agency 
of 
its 
decision 
to 
implement 
the 
Guidance 
on 
the 
Import 
and 
Export 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources, 
as 
advocated 
in 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(48)/RES/10 
D. 
4. 
Ecuador 
was 
also 
in 
favour 
of 
an 
international 
regime 
for 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material 
covering 
liability 
for 
damage 
to 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment, 
and 
economic 
loss. 
Transparent 
communication 
between 
States 
was 
also 
important 
prior 
to 
the 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
material, 
particularly 
by 
sea, 
and 
steps 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
promote 
mutually 
beneficial 
dialogue 
mechanisms 
between 
shipping 
and 
coastal 
states. 
5. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
competent 
authority 
to 
verify 
Member 
StatesÂ 
compliance 
with 
their 
NPT 
safeguards 
obligations. 
Ecuador 
attached 
importance 
to 
the 
universal 
application 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system 
and 
considered 
verification 
of 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
the 
nuclear 
programmes 
of 
all 
States 
to 
be 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance. 
It 
therefore 
advocated 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
nuclear-weapon-free 
zone 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
and 
urged 
all 
countries 
to 
take 
the 
measures 
required 
to 
promote 
the 
forum 
recommended 
in 
2000 
in 
General 
Conference 
decision 
GC(44)/DEC/12. 
6. 
As 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
Ecuador 
had 
worked 
actively 
and 
constructively 
on 
various 
aspects 
of 
strengthening 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
had 
shown 
its 
commitment 
to 
combating 
new 
global 
threats 
by 
supporting 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
that 
the 
SQP 
was 
a 
weakness 
in 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
It 
had 
also 
been 
the 
first 
country 
in 
its 
region 
to 
modify 
the 
standard 
text. 
It 
had 
hosted 
a 
regional 
seminar 
on 
strengthened 
safeguards, 
SQPs 
and 
additional 
protocols 
on 
5Â6 
April 
2006. 
7. 
His 
country 
upheld 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
NPT 
States 
Party 
to 
develop 
research, 
production 
and 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
and 
without 
discrimination, 
provided 
they 
complied 
fully 
with 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
Treaty 
with 
complete 
transparency 
and 
without 
delay. 
8. 
Since 
it 
attached 
importance 
to 
diplomatic 
dialogue 
for 
resolving 
international 
conflict, 
Ecuador 
had 
worked 
within 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Board 
of 
Governors 
to 
bring 
about 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
to 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
issue. 
It 
had 
called 
repeatedly 
on 
Iran 
to 
demonstrate 
its 
commitment 
to 
peace 
and

dialogue, 
to 
comply 
with 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006) 
and 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
by 
implementing 
the 
measures 
requested 
by 
successive 
resolutions 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
thus 
creating 
an 
atmosphere 
of 
transparency 
and 
trust 
to 
allay 
the 
doubts 
about 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
had 
also 
encouraged 
those 
countries 
involved 
in 
the 
negotiations 
to 
continue 
to 
exercise 
patience 
and 
perseverance 
and 
to 
expand 
their 
diplomacy 
through 
open 
dialogue 
with 
a 
view 
to 
finding 
a 
comprehensive 
solution 
which 
both 
satisfied 
the 
Iranian 
people 
and 
provided 
the 
international 
community 
with 
adequate 
assurances. 


9. 
Ecuador 
also 
hoped 
for 
a 
definitive, 
comprehensive 
and 
peaceful 
outcome 
to 
the 
negotiations 
on 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
It 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks 
which 
aimed 
at 
encouraging 
the 
DPRK 
to 
abandon 
its 
military 
nuclear 
programme 
and 
return 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards. 
10. 
While 
the 
security 
of 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
material, 
and 
safeguards 
and 
verification 
were 
an 
important 
concern, 
meeting 
the 
basic 
needs 
of 
mankind 
was 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
security 
in 
the 
wider 
sense. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
statutory 
activities 
made 
a 
significant 
contribution 
to 
the 
fight 
against 
poverty 
and 
disease, 
and 
to 
health, 
agriculture, 
energy, 
nutrition, 
environmental 
protection 
and 
water 
resources 
management, 
but 
more 
efforts 
and 
resources 
were 
required. 
Under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme, 
Ecuador 
had 
hosted 
a 
workshop 
on 
the 
logical 
framework 
for 
the 
preparation 
of 
projects 
for 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle 
and 
a 
workshop 
on 
designing 
sustainable 
energy 
systems 
using 
the 
MESSAGE 
model. 
His 
country 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
assistance 
it 
had 
provided 
under 
projects 
which 
had 
contributed 
to 
its 
sustainable 
social 
development. 
It 
hoped 
to 
receive 
significantly 
more 
technical 
assistance 
in 
the 
coming 
biennium 
in 
priority 
areas. 
11. 
His 
country 
had 
been 
making 
great 
efforts 
for 
many 
years 
to 
settle 
all 
its 
arrears 
both 
to 
the 
technical 
assistance 
programme 
and 
to 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
It 
also 
continued 
to 
strengthen 
the 
activities 
of 
the 
Ecuadorian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
which, 
under 
the 
presidency 
of 
the 
National 
Security 
Council, 
was 
working 
to 
harmonize 
the 
law 
on 
management 
of 
radioactive 
material 
and 
ionizing 
radiation 
generators 
with 
Agency 
standards, 
and 
to 
strengthen 
its 
regulatory 
capacity 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
radiation 
protection, 
security, 
safe 
transport 
of 
material 
and 
sources 
and 
radioactive 
waste 
management. 
All 
of 
those 
actions 
bore 
testimony 
to 
EcuadorÂs 
support 
for 
and 
commitment 
to 
all 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities. 
12. 
Ms. 
DREIHANN 
HOLENIA 
(Haiti) 
said 
that, 
over 
the 
preceding 
50 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
successfully 
carried 
out 
the 
tasks 
entrusted 
to 
it 
not 
only 
in 
the 
field 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
but 
also 
in 
the 
area 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
The 
Agency 
was 
the 
only 
international 
organization 
with 
the 
capacity 
to 
intervene 
effectively 
in 
the 
five 
priority 
areas 
identified 
by 
the 
World 
Summit 
on 
Sustainable 
Development 
held 
in 
Johannesburg, 
namely 
water, 
energy, 
health, 
agriculture 
and 
biodiversity. 
The 
Agency 
had 
a 
fundamental 
role 
to 
play 
not 
only 
in 
those 
areas, 
but 
also 
in 
taking 
steps 
to 
achieve 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals 
by 
2015. 
13. 
Nuclear 
applications 
had 
a 
crucial 
role 
to 
play 
in 
tackling 
development 
problems. 
It 
was 
important 
to 
keep 
the 
international 
community 
better 
informed 
of 
the 
immense 
possibilities 
offered 
by 
nuclear 
technology 
in 
the 
field 
of 
sustainable 
development. 
The 
benefits 
of 
using 
isotopic 
and 
nuclear 
techniques 
in 
fields 
as 
diverse 
as 
environmental 
protection, 
aquifer 
management 
and 
improvement 
of 
soil 
fertility 
were 
little 
known. 
To 
correct 
that 
situation, 
the 
Agency 
should 
develop 
an 
information 
policy 
aimed 
not 
only 
at 
the 
general 
public 
but 
also 
at 
other 
international 
organizations, 
highlighting 
the 
strategic 
importance 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
dispelling 
the 
prejudices 
surrounding 
nuclear 
technology. 
14. 
Her 
Government 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
in 
Haiti. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
four 
years, 
cooperation 
between 
Haiti 
and 
the 
Agency 
had 
expanded 
in 
such 
fields 
as 
radiation 
protection, 
training 
of 
radiotherapy 
technicians, 
improvement 
of 
soil 
fertility 
and

energy 
planning. 
In 
the 
space 
of 
three 
years, 
firm 
bases 
had 
been 
laid 
to 
allow 
for 
the 
short-and 
medium-term 
implementation 
of 
an 
extensive 
and 
solid 
programme 
on 
the 
use 
of 
isotopic 
and 
nuclear 
techniques 
to 
promote 
sustainable 
development 
in 
Haiti. 
Special 
attention 
would 
be 
given 
to 
human 
resources 
training 
and 
management 
in 
the 
field 
of 
radiotherapy, 
which 
would 
allow 
the 
Government 
to 
define 
and 
apply 
a 
nuclear 
knowledge 
management 
policy 
that 
could 
contribute 
effectively 
to 
development. 
In 
that 
connection, 
the 
Government, 
through 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health 
and 
the 
Dosimetry 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Unit, 
was 
putting 
in 
place 
the 
required 
radiation 
protection 
and 
nuclear 
safety 
infrastructure. 
It 
also 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
project 
on 
radiotherapy 
for 
the 
treatment 
of 
cancer, 
which 
was 
undoubtedly 
a 
public 
health 
priority. 
She 
appealed 
to 
interested 
States 
and 
organizations 
to 
help 
Haiti 
implement 
the 
project, 
as 
it 
would 
impact 
positively 
on 
the 
anti-cancer 
programme 
planned 
by 
the 
Ministry 
of 
Public 
Health. 


15. 
Technical 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries 
was 
assuming 
increasing 
importance, 
particularly 
South-South 
cooperation. 
It 
complemented 
admirably 
the 
traditional 
relations 
between 
the 
developed 
North 
and 
the 
developing 
South, 
giving 
developing 
countries 
the 
opportunity 
to 
benefit 
mutually 
through 
shared 
experience. 
In 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean, 
one 
of 
the 
most 
enriching 
experiences 
as 
regards 
technical 
cooperation 
was 
ARCAL 
which 
had 
been 
in 
existence 
for 
22 
years. 
Haiti 
had 
adhered 
to 
that 
agreement 
three 
years 
previously 
and, 
recognizing 
its 
immense 
value 
and 
exemplary 
character, 
hoped 
that 
the 
nations 
of 
Latin 
America 
and 
the 
Caribbean 
could 
continue 
to 
use 
it 
to 
increase 
technical 
cooperation 
among 
developing 
countries. 
Her 
country 
urged 
the 
Agency 
to 
continue 
to 
lend 
its 
support 
to 
that 
regional 
instrument 
in 
order 
to 
allow 
the 
least 
developed 
countries 
of 
Latin 
America 
to 
benefit 
from 
the 
experience 
acquired 
by 
other 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
16. 
Haiti 
had 
been 
stressing 
for 
some 
time 
the 
need 
for 
the 
Agency 
Secretariat 
to 
pay 
greater 
attention 
to 
least 
developed 
countries 
in 
order 
to 
allow 
them 
to 
make 
up 
ground 
in 
terms 
of 
nuclear 
knowledge, 
and 
benefit 
from 
the 
peaceful 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Haiti 
understood 
the 
AgencyÂs 
position, 
which 
was 
based 
on 
budgetary 
considerations, 
that 
the 
number 
of 
projects 
per 
cycle 
should 
be 
limited 
to 
five 
per 
country, 
however 
it 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
that 
rule 
should 
apply 
to 
least 
developed 
countries. 
In 
the 
future, 
the 
Secretariat 
could 
consider 
creating 
a 
special 
unit 
to 
deal 
with 
the 
specific 
problems 
of 
those 
countries. 
17. 
Her 
country 
condemned 
any 
attempt 
to 
use 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
non-peaceful 
or 
terrorist 
purposes. 
In 
the 
light 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004), 
it 
supported 
the 
steps 
taken 
by 
the 
Agency 
to 
prevent 
and 
combat 
nuclear 
and 
radiological 
terrorism 
and 
illicit 
trafficking 
in 
nuclear 
material, 
which 
threatened 
the 
public 
and 
the 
planetÂs 
ecosystem. 
To 
contribute 
to 
those 
efforts, 
Haiti 
had 
already 
ratified 
its 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
additional 
protocol 
and 
was 
about 
to 
ratify 
the 
CPPNM. 
18. 
In 
his 
opening 
statement, 
the 
Director 
General 
had 
said 
that 
anniversaries 
were 
a 
time 
for 
reflection 
and 
renewal. 
Without 
the 
Agency, 
the 
world 
would 
not 
be 
what 
it 
was 
today. 
The 
Agency 
offered 
nations 
with 
different 
civilizations 
and 
ideologies 
somewhere 
to 
discuss 
not 
only 
matters 
related 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons, 
but 
also 
sustainable 
development. 
In 
the 
preceding 
year, 
the 
international 
community 
had 
recognized 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
by 
awarding 
it 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize. 
The 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
task 
was 
immense 
and 
the 
renewal 
that 
he 
was 
hoping 
for 
could 
only 
take 
place 
if 
all 
parties 
recognized 
the 
opportunities 
offered 
by 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
contributions 
to 
sustainable 
development 
and 
protection 
of 
the 
environment. 
19. 
Mr. 
CHONG 
(Singapore) 
said 
that, 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
50th 
anniversary, 
there 
was 
every 
reason 
to 
be 
proud 
of 
its 
achievements. 
Its 
tireless 
efforts 
in 
contributing 
to 
international 
peace, 
security 
and 
prosperity 
through 
the 
peaceful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technologies 
had 
been 
recognized 
by 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General.

20. 
Over 
the 
years, 
the 
Agency 
had 
had 
to 
evolve 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
changing 
trends 
in 
nuclear 
power, 
expanding 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
emerging 
proliferation 
concerns 
in 
the 
nuclear 
field. 
The 
challenges 
had 
become 
even 
more 
daunting 
as 
nuclear 
power 
had 
taken 
on 
a 
greater 
role 
in 
meeting 
the 
worldÂs 
growing 
energy 
needs, 
with 
the 
largest 
growth 
in 
the 
number 
of 
nuclear 
power 
facilities 
expected 
to 
be 
in 
Asia. 
Efforts 
had 
to 
be 
made 
to 
ensure 
that 
nuclear 
facilities 
met 
the 
highest 
operational 
safety 
requirements, 
that 
nuclear 
security 
was 
assured 
and 
proliferation 
concerns 
fully 
addressed. 
Looking 
ahead, 
the 
Agency 
needed 
to 
adapt 
constantly 
while 
remaining 
focused 
on 
strengthening 
the 
three 
main 
pillars 
of 
its 
activities: 
nuclear 
safety, 
nuclear 
technology 
and 
nuclear 
verification. 
21. 
Singapore 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
all 
aspects 
of 
nuclear 
safety. 
Setting 
the 
highest 
standards 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
remained 
a 
fundamental 
precondition 
as 
the 
demand 
for 
nuclear 
energy 
grew. 
The 
various 
international 
legal 
instruments, 
conventions, 
codes 
of 
conduct, 
safety 
guides 
and 
standards 
served 
as 
building 
blocks 
for 
a 
global 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
His 
country 
recognized 
and 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
efforts 
to 
provide 
the 
relevant 
benchmarks 
in 
nuclear 
safety 
through 
various 
instruments, 
peer 
reviews, 
and 
assistance 
and 
review 
missions. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
provided 
the 
framework 
and 
impetus 
for 
States 
to 
cooperate 
in 
promoting 
a 
strong 
nuclear 
safety 
regime. 
His 
country 
was 
in 
favour 
of 
greater 
regional 
cooperation 
in 
the 
area 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security, 
which 
would 
serve 
to 
complement 
and 
strengthen 
the 
various 
international 
and 
national 
efforts 
undertaken. 
That 
in 
turn 
would 
contribute 
to 
building 
confidence 
among 
States 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
22. 
In 
the 
context 
of 
the 
safety 
of 
nuclear 
facilities, 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
transboundary 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
capabilities 
of 
States 
could 
not 
be 
overemphasized. 
Singapore 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
establishment 
of 
such 
capabilities 
and 
commended 
the 
Agency 
on 
establishing 
the 
Incident 
and 
Emergency 
Centre 
in 
2005. 
The 
Centre 
served 
as 
a 
global 
focal 
point, 
but 
bilateral 
and 
regional 
networks 
should 
also 
be 
developed 
through 
which 
Member 
States 
could 
share 
their 
emergency 
response 
plans. 
Where 
possible, 
a 
regional 
approach 
integrating 
Member 
StatesÂ 
capabilities 
could 
also 
be 
explored. 
He 
noted 
with 
satisfaction 
that 
the 
Asian 
Nuclear 
Safety 
Network 
had 
included 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response 
in 
its 
discussions 
for 
2006. 
23. 
As 
medical 
techniques 
using 
radiation 
advanced 
and 
their 
scope 
of 
use 
increased, 
attention 
to 
the 
safety 
of 
such 
applications 
should 
also 
progress. 
With 
regard 
to 
radiation 
protection, 
Singapore 
continued 
to 
host 
scientific 
visits 
and 
provide 
fellowship 
opportunities 
and 
training 
courses 
on 
nuclear 
medicine 
and 
radiation 
protection. 
24. 
The 
promotion 
of 
nuclear 
safety 
had 
to 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with 
ensuring 
nuclear 
security, 
as 
challenges 
to 
global 
security 
continued 
to 
dominate 
the 
international 
agenda. 
Some 
terrorists 
would 
not 
hesitate 
to 
use 
nuclear 
devices 
and 
material 
to 
carry 
out 
their 
attacks, 
so 
States 
needed 
to 
be 
vigilant 
in 
protecting 
nuclear 
material 
and 
facilities 
and 
combat 
threats 
through 
joint 
action. 
His 
country 
supported 
efforts 
to 
combat 
terrorism 
in 
all 
forms 
and 
at 
all 
levels. 
It 
welcomed 
the 
development 
of 
the 
Safety 
Fundamentals 
series, 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009, 
and 
greater 
use 
of 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund 
to 
expand 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
in 
that 
area. 
It 
also 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
various 
measures 
to 
enhance 
StatesÂ 
ability 
to 
detect 
the 
sources 
of 
radiological 
threats 
and 
take 
the 
necessary 
countermeasures. 
25. 
Singapore 
supported 
the 
full 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1540 
(2004) 
and 
the 
stepping 
up 
of 
domestic 
controls 
and 
international 
cooperation 
against 
the 
proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
had 
decided 
to 
expand 
its 
strategic 
goods 
control 
list 
to 
include 
the 
full 
lists 
of 
controlled 
items 
established 
by 
the 
four 
multilateral 
export 
control 
regimes: 
the 
Nuclear 
Suppliers 
Group, 
the 
Wassenaar 
Arrangement, 
the 
Australia 
Group, 
and 
the 
Missile 
Technology 
Control 
Regime. 
The 
expanded 
list 
would 
take 
effect 
from 
January 
2008.

26. 
In 
defending 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
the 
Agency 
also 
had 
to 
ensure 
that 
that 
right 
was 
exercised 
in 
compliance 
with 
StatesÂ 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
Articles 
I, 
II 
and 
III 
of 
the 
NPT 
and 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
with 
the 
utmost 
transparency. 
The 
safeguards 
system 
had 
to 
remain 
able 
to 
respond 
to 
new 
challenges 
in 
a 
credible 
and 
effective 
manner 
and 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
regime 
should 
continue 
to 
play 
a 
central 
role 
in 
providing 
the 
necessary 
safeguards 
assurances. 
Singapore 
was 
working 
to 
put 
in 
place 
the 
instruments 
required 
to 
ratify 
the 
additional 
protocol, 
which 
it 
had 
signed 
in 
September 
2005, 
and 
to 
modify 
its 
SQP 
in 
the 
near 
future. 
It 
advocated 
the 
universalization 
of 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements 
and 
additional 
protocols 
and 
urged 
Member 
States 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
undertake 
such 
commitments 
to 
do 
so 
at 
the 
earliest 
opportunity. 
27. 
The 
DPRK 
continued 
to 
pose 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
His 
country 
was 
deeply 
concerned 
that 
the 
DPRK 
had 
chosen 
to 
remain 
outside 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
system, 
thereby 
depriving 
the 
international 
community 
of 
any 
assurances 
regarding 
its 
nuclear 
material 
and 
activities. 
He 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
NPT, 
resume 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency, 
accept 
full 
Agency 
safeguards, 
and 
dismantle 
any 
nuclear 
weapons 
programme 
in 
a 
prompt, 
transparent 
and 
verifiable 
manner. 
28. 
The 
Board 
of 
Governors 
continued 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
implementation 
of 
NPT 
safeguards 
in 
Iran. 
Singapore 
urged 
Iran 
to 
extend 
its 
full 
cooperation 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
to 
resolve 
all 
outstanding 
issues 
by 
fully 
implementing 
the 
requirements 
of 
Board 
resolutions 
and 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006). 
IranÂs 
right 
to 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes 
was 
not 
inconsistent 
with 
its 
responsibility 
to 
restore 
international 
confidence 
in 
the 
peaceful 
nature 
of 
its 
nuclear 
programme. 
His 
country 
remained 
hopeful 
that 
the 
diplomatic 
efforts 
undertaken 
could 
lead 
to 
a 
peaceful 
and 
sustainable 
long-term 
solution 
to 
the 
issue. 
29. 
The 
proliferation 
risks 
of 
sensitive 
aspects 
of 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
had 
gained 
increased 
international 
attention, 
particularly 
with 
the 
expected 
expansion 
of 
nuclear 
power. 
Past 
efforts 
to 
address 
the 
issue 
had 
not 
produced 
concrete 
results 
owing 
to 
its 
complex 
and 
delicate 
nature. 
Nonetheless, 
it 
was 
imperative 
to 
find 
a 
balanced 
approach 
to 
curbing 
proliferation 
while 
upholding 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
pursue 
the 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 
Several 
proposals 
had 
been 
made 
in 
that 
regard, 
including 
a 
multilateral 
approach 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle. 
Assurance 
of 
supply 
and 
reliable 
access 
to 
nuclear 
fuel, 
including 
international 
supply 
guarantees 
with 
Agency 
participation, 
were 
important 
topics 
that 
warranted 
further 
consideration. 
Singapore 
welcomed 
the 
special 
event 
being 
held 
alongside 
the 
General 
Conference 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
further 
discussion 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
right 
to 
the 
peaceful 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
was 
complemented 
by 
appropriate 
measures 
to 
address 
proliferation 
concerns. 
The 
Secretariat 
could 
bring 
ideas 
from 
the 
discussions 
to 
the 
Board 
for 
further 
consideration. 
30. 
Singapore 
encouraged 
the 
Agency 
to 
enhance 
further 
its 
activities 
aimed 
at 
bringing 
socio-economic 
benefits 
to 
developing 
countries. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
work 
on 
facilitating 
international 
cooperation 
in 
the 
successful 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
could 
have 
a 
meaningful 
impact 
on 
the 
socio-economic 
growth 
of 
developing 
countries 
and 
contribute 
to 
achieving 
the 
United 
Nations 
Millennium 
Development 
Goals. 
The 
application 
of 
nuclear 
technology 
had 
already 
helped 
bring 
many 
socio-economic 
benefits 
to 
developing 
countries 
through 
a 
range 
of 
nuclear 
applications 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
human 
health, 
industrial 
applications, 
animal 
production 
and 
health, 
food 
quality 
and 
safety, 
and 
water 
resources 
management. 
His 
country 
remained 
fully 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
relating 
to 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology. 
31. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
had 
expanded 
considerably 
in 
recent 
years, 
both 
in 
terms 
of 
scope 
and 
the 
number 
of 
activities. 
The 
Agency 
was 
to 
be 
commended 
for 
establishing 
partnerships 
with 
international 
and 
regional 
development 
organizations 
to 
build 
greater 
synergies. 
Singapore 
remained 
firmly 
committed 
to 
supporting 
the 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 

GC(50)/OR.8

and 
looked 
forward 
to 
continued 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Department 
of 
Technical 
Cooperation, 
through 
its 
Memorandum 
of 
Understanding, 
in 
outreach 
efforts 
to 
other 
Member 
States. 
It 
also 
looked 
forward 
to 
bilateral 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
next 
cycle. 
It 
continued 
to 
support 
regional 
activities 
undertaken 
under 
the 
RCA. 


32. 
A 
comprehensive 
and 
effective 
technical 
cooperation 
programme 
clearly 
required 
adequate, 
reliable 
and 
sustainable 
funding. 
Singapore 
was 
committed 
to 
paying 
its 
TCF 
contributions 
in 
full 
and 
in 
a 
timely 
manner 
and 
would 
be 
pledging 
its 
cash 
surplus 
from 
the 
2004 
Regular 
Budget 
to 
fund 
the 
shortfall 
in 
PACT, 
a 
vital 
humanitarian 
outreach 
programme. 
It 
had 
also 
pledged 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
2006. 
33. 
Mr. 
COGAN 
(Ireland) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
which 
had 
been 
a 
due 
recognition 
of 
their 
vital 
role 
in 
safeguarding 
and 
promoting 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
34. 
A 
multilateral 
approach 
was 
the 
most 
effective 
way 
of 
ensuring 
international 
peace 
and 
security. 
The 
multilateral 
regime 
of 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
treaties 
and 
agreements 
was 
especially 
important 
for 
a 
small 
country 
like 
Ireland, 
as 
it 
formed 
the 
basis 
of 
a 
rules-based 
international 
order 
that 
underpinned 
and 
sustained 
collective 
efforts, 
providing 
the 
best 
guarantee 
for 
the 
future. 
Ireland 
remained 
committed 
to 
implementing 
and 
strengthening 
those 
international 
instruments, 
and 
to 
the 
universalization 
of 
the 
norms 
contained 
therein. 
However, 
the 
goal 
of 
universalization 
was 
in 
itself 
insufficient 
without 
support 
for 
effective 
compliance 
with 
those 
instruments 
and 
for 
the 
implementation 
of 
their 
provisions. 
Failure 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
obligations 
set 
out 
in 
multilateral 
instruments 
not 
only 
weakened 
and 
undermined 
them, 
it 
also 
posed 
a 
threat 
to 
the 
global 
system 
of 
peace 
and 
security 
as 
a 
whole. 
35. 
His 
country 
had 
long 
held 
the 
view 
that 
the 
NPT 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
global 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
the 
essential 
foundation 
for 
the 
pursuit 
of 
nuclear 
disarmament. 
It 
had 
a 
particular 
affinity 
with 
the 
Treaty, 
since 
it 
was 
an 
initiative 
taken 
in 
1958 
by 
the 
then 
Irish 
Foreign 
Minister, 
Mr. 
Frank 
Aiken, 
that 
had 
culminated 
in 
the 
negotiation 
of 
the 
NPT. 
36. 
Disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
were 
mutually 
reinforcing 
processes 
which 
required 
constant 
and 
irreversible 
progress 
on 
both 
fronts. 
Ireland 
attached 
particular 
importance 
to 
the 
conclusions 
contained 
in 
the 
final 
document 
of 
the 
2000 
NPT 
Review 
Conference 
which 
set 
out 
13 
practical 
steps 
for 
systematic 
and 
progressive 
efforts 
to 
implement 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
Treaty, 
including 
an 
unequivocal 
undertaking 
by 
the 
nuclear-weapon 
States 
to 
achieve 
the 
total 
elimination 
of 
their 
nuclear 
arsenals. 
A 
consensus 
agreement 
of 
that 
kind 
imposed 
particular 
responsibilities 
and 
retained 
a 
particular 
legitimacy. 
37. 
Ireland 
had 
been 
deeply 
disappointed 
at 
the 
outcome 
of 
the 
2005 
NPT 
Review 
Conference, 
which 
had 
been 
a 
missed 
opportunity 
for 
the 
international 
community 
to 
work 
together 
to 
tackle 
key 
threats 
to 
global 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
to 
agree 
on 
an 
effective, 
collective 
response. 
As 
preparation 
began 
for 
a 
new 
NPT 
review 
cycle, 
efforts 
should 
be 
redoubled 
to 
find 
common 
ground 
which 
would 
allow 
for 
an 
effective 
response 
to 
the 
challenges 
faced. 
Strengthening 
the 
NPT 
to 
ensure 
respect 
for 
all 
its 
provisions 
had 
long 
been 
his 
countryÂs 
priority 
in 
the 
field 
of 
disarmament 
and 
non-proliferation 
and 
it 
would 
spare 
no 
effort 
in 
working 
to 
ensure 
a 
successful 
outcome 
to 
the 
2010 
NPT 
Review 
Conference. 
38. 
The 
Agency 
played 
a 
vital 
role 
in 
ensuring 
that 
multilateral 
rules 
were 
enforced. 
The 
world 
had 
changed 
over 
the 
preceding 
50 
years 
and 
it 
faced 
additional 
challenges 
and 
new 
proliferation 
threats 
to 
which 
the 
Agency 
had 
to 
respond 
accordingly. 
The 
Model 
Additional 
Protocol 
reinforced 
the 
NPT 
and 
had 
become 
an 
essential 
part 
of 
an 
effective 
safeguards 
regime. 
Indeed, 
the 
additional 
protocol 
and 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
should 
be 
considered 
the 
verification 
standard.

39. 
The 
CTBT 
was 
another 
multilateral 
mechanism 
that 
would 
contribute 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
he 
called 
on 
those 
States 
that 
had 
yet 
to 
ratify 
it 
to 
do 
so, 
thus 
facilitating 
its 
early 
entry 
into 
force. 
The 
recent 
momentum 
in 
the 
Conference 
on 
Disarmament 
with 
regard 
to 
negotiations 
on 
a 
fissile 
material 
cut-off 
treaty 
were 
encouraging. 
40. 
Ireland 
was 
disappointed 
by 
IranÂs 
failure 
to 
act 
in 
accordance 
with 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1696 
(2006). 
It 
was 
also 
seriously 
concerned 
that 
the 
most 
recent 
report 
by 
the 
Director 
General 
found 
that 
Iran 
had 
failed 
to 
suspend 
its 
enrichment 
activities 
and 
indicated 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
still 
not 
in 
a 
position 
to 
verify 
that 
IranÂs 
nuclear 
programme 
was 
for 
exclusively 
peaceful 
purposes. 
He 
urged 
Iran 
to 
comply 
fully 
with 
its 
international 
non-proliferation 
obligations, 
to 
suspend 
its 
enrichment 
activities 
immediately 
and 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
an 
open 
and 
transparent 
manner. 
41. 
Likewise, 
he 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
full 
compliance 
with 
its 
international 
non-proliferation 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT, 
including 
its 
safeguards 
agreement 
with 
the 
Agency. 
Ireland 
fully 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks 
process 
and 
called 
on 
the 
DPRK 
to 
resume 
talks 
immediately, 
since 
they 
offered 
the 
best 
prospect 
for 
reaching 
a 
peaceful 
negotiated 
outcome. 
42. 
His 
countryÂs 
nuclear 
energy 
policy 
was 
clear 
and 
unambiguous: 
it 
had 
chosen 
not 
to 
exercise 
its 
right 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation. 
That 
policy 
was 
shaped 
by 
the 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
and 
its 
associated 
activities 
posed 
an 
unacceptable 
risk 
to 
human 
health 
and 
the 
environment. 
Ireland 
did 
not 
believe 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
constitute 
a 
sustainable 
or 
acceptable 
energy 
resource, 
since 
many 
serious 
problems 
remained 
unresolved, 
including 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
nuclear 
installations, 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
waste 
management, 
reprocessing 
of 
spent 
nuclear 
fuel, 
contamination 
of 
the 
marine 
and 
terrestrial 
environment 
and 
the 
risk 
of 
accidents 
or 
proliferation. 
The 
recent 
renaissance 
of 
nuclear 
power 
was 
based 
on 
the 
belief 
that 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
help 
solve 
the 
problem 
of 
global 
warming. 
His 
country 
did 
not 
share 
that 
belief 
and 
thought 
that 
the 
perceived 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
were 
outweighed 
by 
the 
serious 
risks 
it 
posed 
to 
human 
health, 
public 
safety 
and 
the 
environment. 
43. 
Although 
Ireland 
had 
chosen 
not 
to 
develop 
nuclear 
power, 
it 
derived 
considerable 
benefit 
from 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency. 
It 
valued 
the 
AgencyÂs 
pioneering 
work 
and 
high-quality 
research 
in 
such 
areas 
as 
agriculture, 
food 
and 
human 
health, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
opportunity 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
AgencyÂs 
work 
at 
the 
General 
Conference, 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
and 
other 
conferences 
and 
meetings. 
The 
Agency 
provided 
the 
necessary 
framework 
for 
cooperative 
efforts 
to 
build 
and 
strengthen 
the 
international 
nuclear 
safety 
and 
security 
regime. 
That 
framework 
included 
advisory 
international 
standards, 
codes 
and 
guides, 
binding 
international 
conventions, 
international 
peer 
reviews 
and 
an 
international 
system 
of 
emergency 
preparedness 
and 
response. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
vital 
role 
in 
implementing 
such 
measures 
was, 
in 
many 
cases, 
complemented 
by 
bilateral 
agreements 
between 
States. 
44. 
The 
aims 
of 
the 
Convention 
on 
Early 
Notification 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
and 
the 
Convention 
on 
Assistance 
in 
the 
Case 
of 
a 
Nuclear 
Accident 
or 
Radiological 
Emergency 
were 
to 
provide 
mechanisms 
for 
mitigating 
the 
consequences 
of 
an 
accident 
through 
exchange 
of 
information 
and 
provision 
of 
assistance 
among 
States 
Parties. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
role 
was 
to 
facilitate 
and 
support 
cooperation 
among 
States 
Parties. 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(46)/RES/9 
D 
encouraged 
Member 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
international 
efforts 
to 
develop 
a 
coherent 
and 
sustainable 
joint 
programme 
for 
more 
efficient 
international 
response 
to 
nuclear 
emergencies. 
45. 
In 
2003, 
at 
a 
meeting 
of 
competent 
authorities 
convened 
by 
the 
Secretariat, 
it 
had 
been 
agreed 
that 
a 
National 
Competent 
AuthoritiesÂ 
Co-ordinating 
Group 
would 
be 
established 
which 
would 
develop 
an 
International 
Action 
Plan 
for 
Strengthening 
the 
International 
Preparedness 
and 
Response

System 
for 
Nuclear 
and 
Radiological 
Emergencies. 
It 
was 
vital 
that 
work 
in 
that 
area 
be 
properly 
funded 
and, 
in 
that 
connection, 
Ireland 
was 
preparing 
to 
make 
an 
extrabudgetary 
contribution 
of 
US 
$30 
000 
to 
assist 
with 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
action 
plan. 


46. 
Ireland 
shared 
a 
common 
marine 
environment 
through 
which 
shipments 
of 
nuclear 
material 
were 
made. 
Given 
the 
risks 
involved 
and 
public 
concern, 
coastal 
States 
such 
as 
Ireland 
should 
be 
fully 
informed 
when 
such 
shipments 
passed 
near 
their 
coasts. 
Provision 
of 
full 
information 
was 
necessary 
to 
allow 
risk 
assessment 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
and 
appropriate 
emergency 
response 
measures 
to 
be 
put 
in 
place. 
With 
the 
AgencyÂs 
involvement, 
attempts 
were 
being 
made 
to 
strengthen 
and 
expand 
the 
ongoing 
dialogue 
between 
coastal 
and 
shipping 
States 
with 
a 
view 
to 
improving 
communication 
between 
governments 
on 
the 
marine 
transport 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
47. 
His 
country 
welcomed 
the 
special 
event 
on 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
which 
was 
being 
held 
alongside 
the 
General 
Conference 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
detailed 
discussions 
and 
exchanges 
of 
views. 
The 
event 
was 
particularly 
timely 
and 
a 
useful 
contribution 
to 
the 
consideration 
of 
issues 
relating 
to 
a 
potential 
new 
framework 
that 
would 
facilitate 
safety, 
security 
and 
proliferation 
resistance 
in 
the 
future 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
for 
those 
countries 
wishing 
to 
pursue 
that 
option. 
48. 
Although 
Ireland 
was 
not 
among 
those 
countries, 
it 
did 
have 
significant 
stakeholder 
interest 
in 
the 
matters 
under 
discussion. 
It 
considered 
nuclear 
reprocessing 
to 
be 
unsustainable. 
The 
cost 
of 
reprocessing 
spent 
fuel 
was 
significantly 
higher 
than 
the 
cost 
of 
direct 
disposal 
and 
was 
likely 
to 
remain 
so 
for 
decades, 
unless 
the 
price 
of 
natural 
uranium 
leapt 
to 
an 
extraordinary 
level. 
There 
were 
also 
substantial 
environmental 
concerns 
about 
reprocessing, 
since 
safety 
standards 
were 
not 
always 
met. 
It 
was 
neither 
acceptable 
nor 
sustainable 
to 
use 
a 
shared 
marine 
environment 
as 
a 
ready 
receptacle 
for 
radioactive 
discharges 
from 
reprocessing 
operations. 
While 
it 
was 
the 
sovereign 
right 
of 
individual 
States 
to 
choose 
the 
reprocessing 
option, 
such 
practical 
concerns 
had 
to 
be 
addressed 
as 
a 
necessary 
precondition 
for 
the 
operation 
of 
existing 
or 
future 
reprocessing 
facilities. 
Those 
concerns 
were 
not 
founded 
on 
an 
abstract 
ideological 
policy 
or 
political 
views, 
but 
were 
based 
on 
a 
negative 
perception 
of 
reprocessing 
experiences 
in 
neighbouring 
States. 
49. 
Ireland 
supported 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
for 
2006Â2009 
and 
called 
upon 
States 
to 
contribute 
to 
the 
Nuclear 
Security 
Fund. 
Since 
its 
inception, 
Ireland 
had 
made 
voluntary 
contributions 
to 
the 
Fund 
totalling 
approximately 
Â184 
000. 
It 
might 
be 
appropriate 
to 
consider 
how 
some 
Nuclear 
Security 
Plan 
activities 
could 
be 
funded 
from 
the 
Regular 
Budget. 
50. 
The 
TCF 
made 
a 
particularly 
important 
contribution 
to 
upgrading 
safety 
in 
beneficiary 
States. 
Although 
his 
country 
did 
not 
share 
the 
views 
of 
some 
States 
regarding 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation, 
it 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
technical 
cooperation 
activities 
in 
the 
broad 
area 
of 
non-power 
applications 
of 
nuclear 
technology. 
Ireland 
had 
paid 
its 
full 
share 
of 
the 
TCF 
for 
2005 
and 
2006 
and 
would 
continue 
to 
pay 
a 
similar 
share 
in 
the 
future. 
51. 
In 
celebrating 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
over 
the 
preceding 
50 
years, 
Ireland 
was 
confident 
that 
the 
high 
degree 
of 
professionalism 
and 
integrity 
that 
had 
characterized 
the 
organizationÂs 
work 
during 
that 
time 
would 
continue 
to 
help 
make 
the 
world 
a 
better 
and 
safer 
place 
in 
the 
years 
ahead. 
Mr. 
Kim 
Woo-Sik 
(Republic 
of 
Korea), 
Vice-President, 
took 
the 
Chair. 


52. 
Mr. 
MUSUMBA 
(Uganda) 
congratulated 
the 
Director 
General 
and 
the 
Agency 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize, 
which 
was 
a 
clear 
indication 
of 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
appreciation 
at 
a 
time 
when 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
was 
provoking 
much 
debate. 
He 
also 
thanked 
the 
Austrian 
Government 
for 
its 
kind 
hospitality 
in 
hosting 
the 
Agency 
over 
the 
50 
years 
of 
its 
existence. 
53. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
aims, 
as 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly, 
were 
to 
encourage 
and 
assist 
in 
the 
research 
and 
development 
and 
practical 
application 
of 
atomic 
energy 
for 
peaceful

purposes 
throughout 
the 
world. 
When 
President 
Eisenhower 
had 
first 
proposed 
an 
international 
atomic 
agency 
in 
1953, 
he 
had 
spoken 
of 
an 
ÂAtoms 
for 
PeaceÂ 
project 
that 
would 
help 
avert 
an 
atomic 
military 
build-up 
while 
ensuring 
that 
the 
greatest 
of 
destructive 
forces 
could 
be 
developed 
into 
a 
boon 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
all 
mankind. 
He 
had 
also 
noted 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
United 
States 
was 
to 
help 
mankind 
move 
out 
of 
the 
dark 
chamber 
of 
horrors 
into 
the 
light, 
to 
find 
a 
way 
by 
which 
the 
minds 
of 
men, 
the 
hopes 
of 
men 
and 
the 
souls 
of 
men 
everywhere 
could 
move 
forward 
towards 
peace, 
happiness 
and 
well-being. 
Over 
the 
preceding 
five 
decades, 
the 
Agency 
had 
withstood 
many 
storms 
but 
it 
still 
stood 
true 
to 
the 
aspirations 
the 
world 
had 
had 
for 
it 
when 
it 
was 
founded. 
As 
a 
result, 
atomic 
energy, 
that 
most 
destructive 
force, 
now 
provided 
electricity 
to 
a 
large 
proportion 
of 
mankind, 
prolonged 
human 
life 
through 
medical 
applications, 
and 
helped 
feed 
populations 
through 
technological 
advances 
in 
agriculture. 


54. 
As 
the 
Agency 
commemorated 
its 
50th 
anniversary, 
there 
was 
a 
need 
to 
reflect 
on 
the 
dichotomy 
that 
existed 
in 
the 
world 
regarding 
nuclear 
energy. 
Developed 
countries 
had 
taken 
substantial 
advantage 
of 
the 
benefits 
offered 
by 
nuclear 
energy, 
but 
developing 
countries 
could 
not 
benefit 
from 
those 
advantages 
owing 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
capacity. 
Indeed, 
in 
the 
nuclear 
arena, 
developing 
countries 
only 
seemed 
to 
feature 
when 
discussions 
turned 
to 
the 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
material 
and 
the 
strict 
enforcement 
of 
nuclear 
safeguards. 
As 
the 
Agency 
debated 
a 
new 
framework 
for 
the 
utilization 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
it 
should 
be 
remembered 
that 
a 
large 
part 
of 
the 
world 
did 
not 
have 
access 
to 
it. 
The 
Agency 
needed 
a 
more 
aggressive 
programme 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
to 
make 
use 
of 
that 
resource. 
Most 
developing 
countries 
were 
facing 
an 
acute 
shortage 
of 
energy 
and 
nuclear 
energy 
could 
provide 
the 
most 
sustainable 
source 
of 
energy 
for 
them. 
55. 
Uganda 
had 
been 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Agency 
for 
39 
years. 
It 
was 
also 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
the 
CTBT 
and 
had 
fulfilled 
all 
its 
obligations 
under 
international 
law 
with 
regard 
to 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
material. 
56. 
The 
Government 
of 
Uganda 
was 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
the 
technical 
assistance 
the 
country 
received 
with 
the 
application 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
in 
medicine, 
agriculture 
and 
water 
resources 
development. 
It 
hoped 
that 
that 
assistance 
would 
continue 
to 
grow 
to 
include 
training 
and 
capacity 
building 
in 
nuclear 
energy. 
Uganda 
was 
increasing 
the 
profile 
of 
nuclear 
science 
in 
its 
national 
educational 
system 
and 
was 
working 
intensively 
on 
its 
nuclear 
energy-related 
legal 
and 
regulatory 
frameworks 
in 
order 
to 
gain 
full 
benefit 
from 
its 
membership 
of 
the 
Agency. 
57. 
Fifty 
years 
was 
a 
long 
time 
in 
the 
life 
span 
of 
an 
international 
organization 
with 
a 
mandate 
to 
oversee 
an 
issue 
as 
critical 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
as 
nuclear 
energy. 
Uganda 
extended 
its 
hearty 
congratulations 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
Secretariat 
for 
a 
job 
well 
done 
and 
looked 
forward 
to 
fruitful 
years 
in 
the 
future 
when 
the 
benefits 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
would 
become 
more 
universal. 
58. 
Mr. 
KODAH 
(Jordan) 
congratulated 
the 
Agency 
on 
its 
golden 
jubilee 
and 
on 
being 
awarded 
the 
2005 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
together 
with 
its 
Director 
General. 
59. 
Jordan 
greatly 
appreciated 
the 
AgencyÂs 
achievements 
in 
promoting 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
science 
and 
technology 
in 
fields 
such 
as 
disease 
diagnosis 
and 
therapy, 
control 
of 
vector-borne 
diseases, 
pest 
control 
using 
the 
SIT, 
and 
research 
on 
water 
resources, 
the 
environment 
and 
industry; 
as 
well 
as 
its 
achievements 
in 
training 
human 
resources, 
developing 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure, 
ensuring 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
and 
undertaking 
verification 
activities 
in 
Member 
States. 
60. 
Most 
countries, 
especially 
those 
lacking 
oil 
and 
gas, 
were 
currently 
experiencing 
a 
crisis 
as 
they 
sought 
to 
secure 
a 
supply 
of 
energy 
to 
meet 
growing 
demand 
at 
a 
time 
of 
rising 
prices. 
The 
crisis 
was 
exacerbated 
by 
a 
shortage 
of 
water 
resources 
in 
countries 
located 
in 
arid 
or 
semi-arid 
regions, 
such 
as 
Jordan. 
He 
called 
on 
the 
Agency 
to 
redouble 
its 
efforts 
to 
assist 
Member 
States 
in 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
generation 
and 
seawater 
desalination. 
Jordan 
had 
requested 
help 
with 
implementing 
a

project 
involving 
a 
study 
of 
the 
economic 
and 
technical 
feasibility 
of 
using 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
electricity 
production 
and 
seawater 
desalination. 
It 
hoped 
for 
continued 
support 
on 
completion 
of 
the 
study 
to 
develop 
the 
requisite 
national 
capabilities. 


61. 
In 
addition 
to 
obtaining 
Agency 
support 
for 
national 
technical 
cooperation 
projects, 
Jordan 
had 
participated 
in 
regional 
and 
interregional 
projects, 
especially 
in 
the 
areas 
of 
agriculture, 
medicine, 
radiation 
protection 
and 
monitoring, 
and 
training 
of 
staff. 
It 
hoped 
for 
continued 
support 
for 
such 
important 
projects 
as 
the 
SESAME 
project, 
under 
which 
Jordan 
was 
currently 
training 
human 
resources 
in 
accelerator 
physics. 
His 
country 
was 
also 
cooperating 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
a 
project 
to 
establish 
a 
national 
radiation 
protection 
training 
centre 
and 
was 
willing 
to 
expand 
the 
centre 
in 
due 
course 
so 
that 
it 
served 
all 
countries 
in 
the 
region. 
62. 
Jordan 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
radiation 
monitoring, 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
and 
nuclear 
material, 
radioactive 
waste 
management 
and 
the 
safe 
transport 
of 
radioactive 
sources, 
and 
the 
use 
of 
radiation 
monitoring 
equipment 
in 
border 
areas 
in 
order 
to 
prevent 
any 
form 
of 
illicit 
trafficking. 
The 
Jordanian 
Atomic 
Energy 
Commission 
had 
drafted 
national 
legislation, 
regulations 
and 
instructions 
on 
the 
safety 
and 
security 
of 
radioactive 
sources 
based 
on 
the 
AgencyÂs 
recommendations 
and 
had 
compiled 
national 
records 
of 
radioactive 
sources. 
Jordan 
also 
supported 
the 
Code 
of 
Conduct 
on 
the 
Safety 
and 
Security 
of 
Radioactive 
Sources. 
63. 
The 
AgencyÂs 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
system 
was 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
which 
enjoyed 
the 
support 
of 
most 
countries 
in 
the 
world. 
Jordan 
had 
stated 
its 
position 
on 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction 
on 
many 
occasions, 
viewing 
them 
as 
a 
threat 
to 
international 
peace 
and 
security, 
and 
it 
had 
consistently 
supported 
the 
establishment 
of 
zones 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
had 
acceded 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
signed 
a 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreement 
and 
an 
additional 
protocol 
with 
the 
Agency, 
thereby 
fulfilling 
all 
its 
obligations. 
He 
commended 
countries 
that 
had 
signed 
additional 
protocols 
and 
urged 
countries 
that 
had 
not 
yet 
done 
so 
to 
take 
the 
necessary 
steps 
as 
soon 
as 
possible. 
In 
particular, 
his 
Government 
called 
on 
Israel 
to 
accede 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
to 
implement 
all 
its 
provisions. 
64. 
Mr. 
ELWAZER 
(Palestine) 
said 
that 
the 
award 
of 
the 
Nobel 
Peace 
Prize 
to 
the 
Agency 
and 
its 
Director 
General 
showed 
that 
the 
world 
fully 
appreciated 
their 
fine 
work 
in 
support 
of 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
the 
benefit 
of 
mankind, 
and 
against 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
He 
also 
welcomed 
the 
use 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
prize 
money 
to 
set 
up 
the 
IAEA 
Nobel 
Cancer 
and 
Nutrition 
Fund. 
65. 
Palestine 
supported 
the 
Arab 
StatesÂ 
categorical 
rejection 
of 
the 
presence 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
particularly 
nuclear 
weapons, 
in 
any 
State 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
region 
because 
of 
the 
threat 
they 
posed 
to 
regional 
and 
international 
peace 
and 
security 
and 
the 
environment. 
All 
the 
Arab 
States 
were 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
and 
complied 
with 
its 
provisions, 
placing 
their 
nuclear 
facilities 
under 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards. 
Palestine 
also 
supported 
the 
NPT 
as 
the 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime 
and 
stressed 
that 
there 
could 
be 
no 
security 
or 
stability 
in 
the 
region 
unless 
Israel 
acceded 
to 
the 
Treaty 
and 
placed 
all 
its 
nuclear 
installations 
under 
Agency 
safeguards. 
He 
urged 
the 
international 
community 
to 
take 
steps 
to 
make 
the 
NPT 
universal 
and 
to 
ensure 
the 
effective 
implementation 
of 
its 
three 
key 
components: 
nuclear 
disarmament, 
the 
right 
of 
States 
to 
acquire 
and 
develop 
nuclear 
technology 
for 
peaceful 
purposes, 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Palestine 
also 
supported 
the 
Arab 
position 
that 
the 
best 
way 
of 
preventing 
the 
proliferation 
of 
nuclear 
weapons 
in 
the 
Middle 
East 
was 
to 
establish 
a 
zone 
free 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction, 
especially 
nuclear 
weapons. 
Adopting 
a 
selective 
approach 
to 
the 
issue 
at 
the 
level 
of 
individual 
States 
was 
inconsistent 
with 
international 
non-proliferation 
policies. 
66. 
Palestine 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
cooperation 
with 
the 
Agency 
and 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority 
had 
discussed 
matters 
of 
common 
interest 
with 
the 
Director 
General,

particular 
strengthening 
of 
technical 
cooperation, 
during 
a 
visit 
to 
Austria 
in 
March 
2006. 
The 
Palestinian 
Authority 
had 
established 
a 
Nuclear 
Energy 
and 
Radiation 
Protection 
Department 
within 
its 
Energy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Authority 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency 
on 
setting 
up 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure, 
on 
medical 
and 
agricultural 
applications 
and 
on 
personal 
monitoring 
of 
staff 
exposed 
to 
radioactive 
material. 
Palestine 
had 
two 
radiotherapy 
centres, 
one 
in 
the 
West 
Bank 
and 
one 
in 
Gaza, 
at 
least 
200 
public-and 
private-sector 
radiodiagnostic 
centres 
and 
five 
centres 
for 
diagnostic 
nuclear 
medicine. 


67. 
The 
situation 
in 
Palestine 
made 
it 
difficult 
to 
implement 
projects 
supported 
by 
the 
Agency, 
particularly 
expert 
visits, 
delivery 
of 
materials 
and 
equipment, 
and 
travel 
to 
attend 
training 
courses, 
because 
of 
the 
restrictions 
imposed 
by 
the 
Israeli 
authorities 
which 
prevented 
people 
from 
obtaining 
visas 
to 
travel 
outside 
Palestine. 
Experts 
from 
the 
Energy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Authority 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
attend 
the 
General 
Conference 
because 
of 
the 
closure 
of 
the 
Rafah 
border 
crossing 
to 
Egypt. 
68. 
Notwithstanding 
those 
difficulties, 
progress 
had 
been 
made 
in 
implementing 
a 
number 
of 
projects. 
Technical 
assistance 
during 
the 
2005Â2006 
cycle 
had 
focused 
on 
the 
application 
of 
radioactive 
isotopes 
in 
agriculture 
through 
a 
fruit 
fly 
eradication 
programme 
using 
the 
SIT, 
development 
of 
radiation 
protection 
infrastructure, 
and 
enhancement 
of 
radiation 
technology 
skills. 
During 
the 
2007Â2008 
cycle, 
technical 
assistance 
was 
planned 
in 
the 
following 
areas: 
training 
of 
staff 
in 
environmental 
radiation 
monitoring, 
continued 
enhancement 
of 
radiation 
technology 
capabilities, 
and 
further 
enhancement 
of 
scientific 
and 
technological 
expertise. 
Unfortunately, 
Palestine 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
organize 
any 
workshops 
or 
other 
activities 
owing 
to 
a 
lack 
of 
equipment 
and 
materials 
and 
the 
difficulties 
faced 
by 
experts 
wishing 
to 
travel 
to 
Palestine 
because 
of 
the 
deteriorating 
security 
situation. 
69. 
Although 
Palestine 
was 
a 
non-nuclear-weapon 
State 
implementing 
a 
simple 
peaceful 
nuclear 
programme, 
it 
felt 
that 
it 
lay 
within 
a 
nuclear-weapon 
State 
because 
most 
of 
its 
territory 
was 
within 
a 
very 
short 
distance 
of 
IsraelÂs 
Dimona 
reactor. 
Any 
accident 
resulting 
in 
the 
leakage 
of 
radioactive 
material 
would 
threaten 
the 
entire 
region, 
polluting 
the 
environment, 
water 
resources 
and 
farms. 
Recently 
a 
number 
of 
Palestinian 
and 
Israeli 
environmental 
protection 
associations 
had 
alleged 
that 
Israel 
was 
burying 
radioactive 
waste 
in 
adjacent 
parts 
of 
the 
West 
Bank. 
It 
was 
essential 
to 
investigate 
such 
reports 
with 
the 
assistance 
of 
the 
Agency. 
The 
League 
of 
Arab 
States 
had 
already 
taken 
up 
the 
matter 
at 
ministerial 
level. 
Palestine 
hoped 
to 
protect 
itself 
from 
any 
accidents 
in 
Israel 
by 
building 
up 
an 
effective 
radiation 
emergency 
system. 
Israel 
had 
distributed 
a 
stable 
iodine 
compound 
to 
some 
Israeli 
communities 
but 
not 
others, 
since 
it 
was 
feared 
that 
radiation 
accidents 
might 
lead 
to 
release 
of 
radioactive 
iodine. 
The 
danger 
was 
now 
greater 
than 
ever 
before 
because 
of 
the 
continuous 
tremors 
in 
the 
region 
over 
the 
preceding 
year. 
A 
major 
earthquake 
could 
prove 
disastrous 
because 
the 
Israeli 
reactor 
was 
over 
50 
years 
old, 
and 
the 
impact 
of 
any 
accident 
might 
be 
felt 
not 
only 
in 
Palestine 
but 
also 
in 
neighbouring 
countries. 
70. 
His 
country 
was 
deeply 
grateful 
to 
the 
Agency 
for 
its 
support 
for 
Palestinian 
projects 
under 
difficult 
circumstances, 
and 
it 
hoped 
that 
that 
support 
would 
continue 
so 
that 
the 
Energy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Authority 
could 
obtain 
the 
materials 
it 
needed 
for 
its 
work 
and 
implement 
its 
programmes 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
blockade 
imposed 
by 
the 
Israeli 
authorities. 
71. 
The 
Palestinian 
people 
continued 
to 
dream 
of 
establishing 
their 
own 
independent 
State 
with 
its 
capital 
in 
Jerusalem, 
in 
spite 
of 
their 
sufferings. 
Thousands 
of 
Palestinians, 
particularly 
children, 
had 
been 
killed 
and 
wounded, 
homes 
and 
public 
facilities 
had 
been 
deliberately 
destroyed 
and 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
cut 
off 
from 
the 
outside 
world. 
Israel 
was 
dividing 
up 
and 
isolating 
Palestinian 
regions, 
towns 
and 
villages, 
preventing 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
workers 
from 
reaching 
their 
places 
of 
work 
in 
Israel 
or 
in 
Palestinian 
towns. 
Imports 
and 
exports 
were 
subject 
to 
stringent 
restrictions 
and 
Israel 
was 
withholding 
tax 
revenues 
from 
the 
Palestinian 
Authority. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
financial 

GC(50)/OR.8

2006, 
Page 
12 


sanctions 
imposed 
on 
the 
Government 
and 
people, 
65% 
of 
the 
population 
were 
now 
living 
below 
the 
poverty 
line. 
He 
therefore 
called 
on 
the 
international 
community 
to 
take 
steps 
to 
end 
the 
embargo 
on 
the 
Palestinian 
people 
and 
their 
democratically 
elected 
Government, 
especially 
in 
the 
light 
of 
current 
efforts 
to 
form 
a 
Government 
of 
national 
unity. 


72. 
Each 
year 
the 
Israeli 
forces 
used 
new 
kinds 
of 
internationally 
prohibited 
lethal 
weapons 
against 
the 
Palestinians. 
The 
Palestinian 
Minister 
of 
Health 
had 
recently 
reported 
that 
medical 
teams 
and 
the 
staff 
of 
hospitals 
and 
operating 
theatres 
had 
come 
across 
new 
types 
of 
injuries 
and 
that 
X-rays 
had 
revealed 
fragments 
of 
unknown 
explosive 
materials 
in 
the 
bodies 
of 
dead 
and 
wounded 
Palestinians. 
In 
some 
cases, 
the 
remains 
of 
victims 
were 
charred 
and 
lacerated 
beyond 
recognition. 
It 
was 
suspected 
that 
the 
Israeli 
occupying 
forces 
were 
using 
new 
kinds 
of 
radioactive 
weapons 
and 
he 
requested 
the 
AgencyÂs 
assistance 
in 
looking 
into 
the 
matter.

meeting

Examination 
of 
delegatesÂ 
credentials 
(resumed) 
(GC(50)/27) 
1. 
Mr. 
RAMZY 
(Egypt) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
believed 
that 
the 
credentials 
of 
the 
State 
of 
Israel 
were 
limited 
to 
the 
4 
June 
1967 
borders 
and 
did 
not 
apply 
to 
the 
occupied 
Arab 
territories. 
The 
fact 
that 
Egypt 
had 
accepted 
the 
report 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
(document 
GC(50)/27) 
adopted 
the 
preceding 
day 
did 
not 
imply 
recognition 
of 
the 
occupation 
by 
Israel 
of 
any 
of 
the 
occupied 
Arab 
territories, 
including 
Jerusalem, 
the 
Golan 
Heights 
and 
the 
Shebaa 
Farms. 
2. 
Mr. 
MADI 
(Jordan) 
said 
that, 
because 
it 
was 
convinced 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
achieving 
and 
ensuring 
peace 
for 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
Middle 
East, 
and 
of 
the 
need 
to 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
achieve 
that 
end, 
his 
country 
had 
agreed 
to 
accept 
the 
report 
of 
the 
General 
Committee 
and 
had 
not 
signed 
the 
declaration 
by 
Arab 
delegations 
expressing 
their 
reservations 
regarding 
IsraelÂs 
credentials 
at 
the 
current 
and 
previous 
sessions 
of 
the 
General 
Conference. 
Jordan 
was 
resolute 
in 
its 
belief 
in 
the 
illegality 
of 
the 
Israeli 
annexation 
of 
occupied 
Jerusalem, 
which 
was 
in 
breach 
of 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolutions. 
It 
believed 
that 
it 
was 
essential 
to 
abide 
by 
the 
provisions 
of 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly 
resolution 
35/169 
(1980) 
which 
determined 
that 
all 
legislative 
and 
administrative 
measures 
taken 
after 
the 
occupation 
of 
the 
city 
of 
Jerusalem 
were 
null 
and 
void, 
and 
which 
called 
upon 
all 
States, 
specialized 
agencies 
and 
international 
organizations 
to 
disregard 
any 
measure 
contravening 
the 
provisions 
of 
that 
resolution.

Implementation 
of

agreement 
between 
the

and 
the

PeopleÂs 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
(GC(50)/15,

and

3. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
noted 
that 
the 
item 
had 
been 
included 
in 
the 
agenda 
pursuant 
to 
General 
Conference 
resolution 
GC(49)/RES/14 
adopted 
the 
preceding 
year. 
The 
Director 
General 
had 
reported 
to 
the 
Board 
periodically 
on 
the 
issue 
during 
the 
intervening 
year 
and 
his 
report, 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/15, 
summarized 
developments 
over 
that 
period. 
A 
draft 
resolution 
on 
the 
agenda 
item 
had 
been 
submitted 
in 
document 
GC(50)/L.9 
and 
Add.1. 
4. 
Ms. 
GERVAIS-VIDRICAIRE 
(Canada), 
introducing 
the 
draft 
resolution, 
said 
that 
it 
acknowledged 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
the 
fourth 
round 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
in 
Beijing, 
expressed 
continued 
support 
for 
the 
six-party 
talks 
process, 
whose 
goal 
was 
the 
verifiable 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula, 
and 
expressed 
concern 
that 
there 
had 
been 
little 
progress 
towards 
that 
goal 
since 
September 
2005. 
It 
was 
important 
that 
the 
General 
Conference 
send 
a 
clear 
and 
firm 
message 
to 
the 
DPRK 
and 
she 
therefore 
hoped 
that 
the 
draft 
resolution 
would 
be 
adopted 
by 
consensus. 
It 
had 
been 
sponsored 
by 
55 
Member 
States 
and 
was 
a 
clear 
demonstration 
of 
the 
deep 
concern 
shared 
by 
all 
regarding 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
programme. 
5. 
Ms. 
LACANLALE 
(Philippines), 
speaking 
on 
behalf 
of 
ASEAN, 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
statement 
issued 
by 
the 
Foreign 
Ministers 
of 
ASEAN 
member 
countries 
on 
25 
July 
2006 
in 
which 
they 
had 
emphasized 
that 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
essential 
to 
the 
maintenance 
of 

GC(50)/OR.9

peace 
and 
stability 
in 
the 
Asia 
and 
Pacific 
region. 
They 
had 
reaffirmed 
the 
importance 
of 
dialogue 
among 
all 
parties 
for 
the 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue, 
their 
support 
for 
the 
principles 
of 
the 
joint 
statement 
issued 
on 
19 
September 
2005, 
and 
the 
importance 
of 
that 
statement 
being 
observed 
and 
implemented. 
Furthermore, 
they 
had 
called 
upon 
all 
the 
parties 
concerned 
to 
resume 
the 
six-party 
talks 
as 
a 
means 
of 
moving 
forward 
to 
achieve 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue. 


6. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
was 
ready 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC/(50)/L.9 
and 
Add.1 
without 
a 
vote. 
7. 
It 
was 
so 
decided. 
8. 
Mr. 
TANG 
Guoqiang 
(China) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
made 
strenuous 
efforts 
in 
hosting 
the 
six-party 
talks, 
which 
had 
provided 
an 
important 
platform 
for 
all 
interested 
parties 
to 
conduct 
dialogue 
and 
consultations. 
The 
talks 
undoubtedly 
constituted 
the 
most 
effective 
mechanism 
for 
seeking 
a 
peaceful 
solution 
to 
the 
nuclear 
issue 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
through 
diplomatic 
efforts. 
Regrettably, 
certain 
complex 
factors 
had 
emerged 
and 
the 
six-party 
talks 
were 
at 
a 
standstill. 
The 
mechanism 
faced 
new 
challenges. 
In 
the 
current 
circumstances, 
it 
was 
particularly 
necessary 
for 
the 
parties 
involved 
to 
hold 
firm 
to 
the 
path 
of 
seeking 
a 
peaceful 
solution 
while 
keeping 
calm 
and 
exercising 
restraint. 
The 
difficulties 
should 
be 
resolved 
through 
dialogue 
and 
consultation, 
and 
any 
action 
that 
might 
lead 
to 
tensions 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
should 
be 
avoided. 
China 
hoped 
that 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
would 
help 
stakeholders 
continue 
their 
diplomatic 
efforts 
to 
establish 
a 
nuclear-weapons-free 
zone 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
and 
would 
facilitate 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue. 
The 
maintenance 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
on 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
was 
in 
the 
common 
interest 
of 
the 
countries 
of 
north-east 
Asia 
and 
of 
the 
international 
community 
as 
a 
whole 
and 
China 
would 
unswervingly 
pursue 
its 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
that 
end. 
9. 
Mr. 
AMANO 
(Japan) 
said 
that 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
nuclear 
programmes 
were 
a 
direct 
threat 
to 
peace 
and 
stability 
in 
north-east 
Asia. 
They 
were 
also 
a 
serious 
challenge 
to 
the 
international 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
regime. 
In 
spite 
of 
a 
series 
of 
General 
Conference 
resolutions 
on 
the 
issue, 
the 
DPRK 
had 
not 
been 
implementing 
comprehensive 
Agency 
safeguards 
and 
had 
been 
refusing 
to 
cooperate 
with 
the 
Agency. 
10. 
The 
multiple 
launches 
of 
ballistic 
missiles 
by 
the 
DPRK 
on 
5 
July 
2006 
had 
further 
intensified 
concerns. 
That 
act 
directly 
affected 
the 
security 
of 
Japan 
and 
Asia 
and 
was 
deeply 
deplorable 
from 
the 
point 
of 
view 
of 
the 
peace 
and 
security 
of 
the 
international 
community 
and 
non-proliferation 
of 
weapons 
of 
mass 
destruction. 
It 
also 
undermined 
the 
efforts 
to 
achieve 
an 
early 
resumption 
of 
the 
six-
party 
talks. 
11. 
Japan 
had 
therefore 
sponsored 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
1695 
(2006) 
which 
sent 
a 
resolute 
message 
from 
the 
international 
community. 
However, 
the 
DPRK 
had 
immediately 
rejected 
the 
resolution, 
which 
his 
country 
deeply 
regretted. 
Japan 
strongly 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
implement 
the 
measures 
advocated 
in 
the 
resolution. 
Japan 
intended 
to 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
achieve 
steady 
implementation 
of 
the 
resolution 
in 
coordination 
with 
the 
international 
community. 
The 
DPRK 
should 
also 
show 
restraint 
and 
refrain 
from 
any 
action 
that 
might 
aggravate 
tension. 
12. 
It 
was 
essential 
that 
the 
six-party 
talks 
be 
resumed 
at 
the 
earliest 
possible 
date 
so 
that 
agreement 
could 
be 
reached 
on 
relevant 
issues, 
including 
details 
of 
verification 
measures 
and 
concrete 
procedures 
for 
the 
prompt 
realization 
of 
the 
verifiable 
dismantlement 
of 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
nuclear 
programmes 
by 
the 
DPRK. 
In 
that 
regard, 
he 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
verification 
role. 
Together 
with 
other 
partners, 
Japan 
would 
continue 
to 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
resolve 
the 
matter 
through 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
other 
diplomatic 
efforts.

13. 
Mr. 
KIM 
Sung-Hwan 
(Republic 
of 
Korea) 
said 
it 
was 
a 
matter 
of 
serious 
concern 
to 
the 
international 
community 
that 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities 
had 
not 
been 
subject 
to 
Agency 
verification 
since 
December 
2002 
and 
that 
the 
Agency 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
draw 
any 
conclusions 
regarding 
the 
DPRKÂs 
nuclear 
activities. 
14. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
delivered 
clear 
messages 
from 
the 
international 
community 
to 
the 
DPRK. 
It 
stressed 
the 
importance 
of 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
through 
dialogue, 
and 
urged 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
immediately 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks 
without 
precondition 
and 
to 
work 
towards 
expeditious 
implementation 
of 
the 
joint 
statement 
of 
19 
September 
2005. 
The 
resolution 
also 
supported 
the 
international 
communityÂs 
peaceful 
efforts 
in 
all 
available 
and 
appropriate 
fora 
to 
address 
the 
challenges 
posed 
by 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue. 
In 
particular, 
it 
supported 
the 
six-party 
talks 
and 
called 
for 
their 
early 
resumption, 
stressing 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
commitment 
of 
all 
participants 
to 
the 
full 
implementation 
of 
the 
joint 
statement. 
It 
was 
of 
the 
utmost 
importance 
that 
the 
DPRK 
abide 
by 
its 
commitment 
to 
abandon 
all 
nuclear 
weapons 
and 
existing 
nuclear 
programmes, 
and 
that 
the 
other 
partiesÂ 
commitment 
to 
corresponding 
measures 
be 
implemented 
in 
a 
timely 
and 
coordinated 
manner. 
The 
resolution 
also 
called 
upon 
the 
DPRK 
to 
cooperate 
promptly 
with 
the 
Agency 
in 
the 
full 
and 
effective 
implementation 
of 
safeguards 
and 
to 
comply 
fully 
with 
the 
NPT. 
15. 
His 
country 
had 
noted 
the 
Director 
GeneralÂs 
statement 
to 
the 
effect 
that 
the 
Agency 
was 
ready 
to 
work 
with 
the 
DPRK, 
and 
with 
all 
others, 
to 
find 
a 
solution 
that 
addressed 
the 
needs 
of 
the 
international 
community 
to 
ensure 
that 
all 
nuclear 
activities 
in 
the 
DPRK 
were 
exclusively 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
Given 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
and 
its 
significant 
impact 
on 
the 
future 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
regime, 
his 
country 
fully 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
critical 
role 
in 
upholding 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
16. 
The 
Government 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Korea 
would 
continue 
to 
make 
every 
effort 
to 
achieve 
a 
negotiated 
solution 
to 
the 
DPRK 
nuclear 
issue 
in 
close 
consultation 
with 
other 
relevant 
parties. 
To 
that 
end, 
it 
was 
working 
together 
with 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
other 
members 
of 
the 
six-party 
talks 
on 
developing 
a 
common 
and 
broad 
approach 
which 
would 
allow 
the 
talks 
to 
be 
resumed 
and 
expedited 
with 
a 
view 
to 
realizing 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula 
as 
envisaged 
in 
the 
joint 
statement. 
His 
country 
had 
no 
doubt 
that 
the 
international 
community 
would 
continue 
to 
render 
valuable 
support 
to 
facilitate 
a 
peaceful 
resolution 
of 
the 
issue. 
17. 
Mr. 
MÃRQUEZ 
MARÃN 
(Bolivarian 
Republic 
of 
Venezuela) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
believed 
that 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
was 
to 
intensify 
the 
efforts 
under 
way 
to 
achieve 
the 
denuclearization 
of 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula. 
However, 
operative 
paragraph 
2 
could 
be 
an 
obstacle 
to 
the 
resumption 
of 
the 
talks 
because 
flexibility 
and 
moderation 
were 
needed 
in 
order 
to 
open 
the 
way 
for 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
talks. 
18. 
Ms. 
GOICOCHEA 
ESTENOZ 
(Cuba) 
noted 
that 
the 
resolution 
just 
adopted 
was 
different 
from 
those 
adopted 
by 
the 
General 
Conference 
at 
previous 
sessions. 
Cuba 
had 
accepted 
its 
adoption 
without 
a 
vote 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
serious 
difficulties 
it 
had 
with 
regard 
to 
preambular 
paragraph 
(e), 
which 
referred 
to 
a 
subject 
that 
was 
outside 
the 
AgencyÂs 
mandate. 
Cuba 
also 
had 
difficulties 
with 
regard 
to 
operative 
paragraph 
2, 
which 
set 
conditions 
for 
the 
DPRK 
to 
return 
to 
the 
six-party 
talks. 
In 
the 
view 
of 
her 
country, 
that 
paragraph 
was 
discriminatory 
in 
nature 
and 
contrary 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
multilateralism. 
19. 
Mr. 
SOLTANIEH 
(Islamic 
Republic 
of 
Iran) 
said 
that 
his 
delegation 
had 
not 
blocked 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
resolution 
by 
consensus 
since 
there 
were 
calls 
in 
both 
its 
preambular 
and 
operative 
parts 
for 
negotiation 
of 
a 
solution. 
He 
recalled 
the 
position 
of 
his 
own 
country 
and 
other 
developing 
countries, 
particularly 
the 
members 
of 
NAM, 
with 
respect 
to 
recognition 
of 
the 
inalienable 
right 
of 
Member 
States 
to 
use 
nuclear 
energy 
for 
peaceful 
purposes. 
The 
language 
of 
threat, 
and 
harsh 
resolutions 
questioning 
a 
countryÂs 
sovereign 
rights 
or 
aiming 
to 
isolate 
it, 
were 
always

counterproductive 
to 
the 
cause 
of 
peace 
and 
stability 
and 
universality 
of 
the 
NPT. 
He 
therefore 
urged 
all 
Member 
States 
of 
the 
Agency, 
and 
the 
DPRK, 
to 
choose 
the 
right 
course 
of 
action, 
namely 
dialogue 
and 
negotiation 
on 
all 
issues 
of 
concern 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute, 
in 
order 
to 
achieve 
a 
long-term 
peaceful 
solution 
for 
the 
Korean 
Peninsula.

Ms. 
KAUPPI 
(Finland), 
speaking 
on

and 
the 
other 
co-sponsors 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/COM.5/L.1/Rev.2, 
said 
that, 
following 
extensive 
consultations, 
consensus 
had 
been 
reached 
on 
the 
draft 
resolution 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
3. 
47. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India), 
supported 
by 
Mr. 
MICHAELI 
(Israel) 
and 
Mr. 
SHAHBAZ 
(Pakistan) 
requested 
a 
separate 
vote 
on 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 
48. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
said 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
request 
for 
a 
separate 
vote 
on 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
and 
he 
put 
that 
paragraph 
to 
a 
vote 
by 
show 
of 
hands. 
49. 
There 
were 
77 
votes 
in 
favour 
of 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
and 
3 
against, 
with 
no 
abstentions. 
The 
paragraph 
was 
adopted. 
50. 
Mr. 
SHARMA 
(India) 
said 
that, 
as 
a 
founder 
member 
of 
the 
Agency, 
India 
had 
consistently 
supported 
the 
AgencyÂs 
activities 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
the 
Statute. 
It 
attached 
great 
importance 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
safeguards 
activities 
and 
had 
made 
constructive 
contributions 
to 
strengthening 
the 
effectiveness 
and 
improving 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
safeguards 
system. 
In 
the 
same 
spirit, 
India 
had 
joined 
the 
consensus 
on 
the 
BoardÂs 
decision 
to 
create 
an 
Advisory 
Committee 
on 
Safeguards 
and 
Verification 
and 
had 
been 
participating 
in 
its 
meetings. 
It 
believed 
that 
the 
value 
and 
success 
of 
the 
Agency 
were 
attributable 
to 
the 
meticulous 
way 
in 
which 
it 
had 
carried 
out 
its 
tasks 
in 
accordance 
with 
its 
mandate, 
without 
being 
influenced 
by 
extraneous 
issues. 
51. 
Until 
2000, 
the 
safeguards 
resolution 
had 
been 
a 
consensus 
resolution. 
However, 
in 
2001 
a 
new 
operative 
paragraph 
had 
been 
added 
whose 
language 
contradicted 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
chapeau 
of 
the 
operative 
part 
that 
had 
been 
worked 
out 
in 
difficult 
negotiations. 
Operative 
paragraph 
3, 
which 
had 
been 
retained 
in 
the 
current 
yearÂs 
resolution, 
urged 
all 
States 
to 
bring 
into 
force 
comprehensive 
safeguards 
agreements, 
ignoring 
the 
fact 
that 
such 
agreements 
related 
to 
StatesÂ 
obligations 
under 
the 
NPT. 
That 
paragraph 
thus 
appeared 
to 
impose 
upon 
States 
which 
were 
not 
party 
to 
the 
NPT 
the 
same 
obligations 
as 
applied 
to 
parties, 
and 
that 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
India. 
As 
his 
country 
had 
made 
clear 
at 
previous 
sessions 
of 
the 
Conference, 
the 
signing 
of 
treaties 
was 
a 
StateÂs 
sovereign 
decision.

membership 
of 
the 
Agency 
did 
not 
impose 
upon 
it 
any 
obligation 
which 
was 
not 
contained 
in 
the 
Statute. 
Any 
resolution 
which 
ran 
counter 
to 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
Statute 
was 
unacceptable 
to 
his 
country. 
Despite 
efforts 
to 
work 
out 
a 
compromise, 
the 
operative 
paragraph 
in 
question 
had 
continued 
to 
appear 
without 
change 
since 
2001. 
Accordingly 
his 
delegation 
had 
had 
no 
option 
but 
to 
vote 
against 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution. 


52. 
Mr. 
SHAHBAZ 
(Pakistan) 
said 
that 
his 
country 
had 
always 
supported 
efforts 
aimed 
at 
strengthening 
the 
role 
of 
the 
Agency 
within 
the 
framework 
of 
its 
Statute 
and 
its 
legal 
authority, 
and 
under 
international 
law. 
Its 
efforts 
and 
actions 
to 
enable 
the 
Agency 
to 
discharge 
its 
responsibilities 
in 
an 
efficient 
and 
credible 
manner 
were 
well 
known. 
53. 
PakistanÂs 
vote 
against 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
of 
the 
draft 
resolution 
was 
consistent 
with 
its 
principled 
stand 
on 
the 
issue. 
The 
language 
contained 
in 
that 
paragraph 
did 
not 
take 
into 
account 
the 
differentiated 
nature 
of 
the 
safeguards 
undertakings 
of 
Member 
States 
and, 
as 
such, 
negated 
their 
rights 
under 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Statute. 
Pakistan 
had 
always 
shown 
the 
utmost 
flexibility 
in 
the 
search 
for 
language 
for 
operative 
paragraph 
3 
which 
met 
the 
concerns 
of 
all 
and 
rectified 
the 
anomaly. 
However, 
that 
flexibility 
had 
not 
been 
reciprocated, 
forcing 
it 
to 
vote 
against 
the 
operative 
paragraph 
in 
question. 
54. 
Pakistan 
would 
continue 
to 
play 
an 
active 
role 
in 
furthering 
the 
AgencyÂs 
objectives 
in 
a 
positive 
and 
constructive 
manner 
within 
its 
legal 
parameters. 
55. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
took 
it 
that 
the 
Conference 
wished 
to 
adopt 
the 
draft 
resolution 
as 
a 
whole. 
56. 
The 
draft 
resolution 
contained 
in 
document 
GC(50)/COM.5/L.1/Rev.2 
was 
adopted. 
The 
meeting

REPORT 
OF 
THE 
CHAIRMAN 
OF 
THE 
SPECIAL 
EVENT, 
MR. 
CHARLES 
CURTIS 


Overview 


At 
the 
outset 
of 
the 
21st 
century, 
a 
discussion 
is 
taking 
place 
concerning 
the 
challenge 
of 
meeting 
increasing 
global 
energy 
demands 
through 
a 
possible 
expansion 
of 
the 
use 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
while 
at 
the 
same 
time 
minimizing 
the 
proliferation 
risks 
created 
by 
the 
further 
spread 
of 
sensitive 
nuclear 
technology 
such 
as 
uranium 
enrichment 
and 
spent 
fuel 
reprocessing. 
A 
number 
of 
useful 
suggestions 
have 
recently 
been 
put 
forward 
regarding 
new 
approaches 
to 
the 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle, 
which 
aim 
to 
establish 
an 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
as 
a 
back-up 
measure 
to 
the 
commercial 
market, 
in 
certain 
situations. 
In 
general, 
these 
proposals 
are 
seen 
to 
be 
mutually 
compatible 
with, 
and 
supportive 
of, 
each 
other. 


These 
recent 
proposals 
for 
assuring 
supplies 
of 
uranium-based 
nuclear 
fuel 
can 
be 
seen 
as 
one 
stage 
in 
a 
broader, 
longer-term 
development 
of 
a 
multilateral 
framework 
that 
could 
encompass 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanisms 
for 
both 
natural 
and 
low 
enriched 
uranium 
and 
nuclear 
fuel, 
as 
well 
as 
spent 
fuel 
management. 


Establishing 
a 
fully-developed, 
multilateral 
framework 
that 
is 
equitable 
and 
accessible 
to 
all 
users 
of 
nuclear 
energy, 
acting 
in 
accordance 
with 
agreed 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
norms, 
will 
be 
a 
complex 
endeavour 
that 
would 
likely 
require 
a 
progressively 
phased 
approach. 
In 
general, 
it 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Event 
Chairman 
that 
the 
following 
could 
be 
a 
possible 
way 
forward: 


1. 
a 
first 
Â 
near 
term 
Â 
phase 
focusing 
on 
establishing 
mechanisms 
for 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants. 
Included 
for 
examination 
in 
the 
near 
term 
phase 
would 
be 
the 
proposal 
for 
an 
IAEA-owned 
low 
enriched 
uranium 
(LEU) 
fuel 
bank 
advanced 
by 
the 
Nuclear 
Threat 
Initiative 
(NTI), 
the 
proposal 
of 
the 
six 
major 
nuclear 
fuel 
supplier 
States 
(France, 
Germany, 
the 
Netherlands, 
the 
Russian 
Federation, 
the 
United 
Kingdom 
and 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America) 
and 
the 
proposal 
of 
the 
Russian 
Federation 
for 
international 
nuclear 
fuel 
cycle 
centres. 
This 
near 
term 
phase 
examination 
should 
also 
include 
the 
proposals 
of 
Japan 
and 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
described 
as 
ÂcomplementaryÂ 
to 
the 
six 
major 
fuel-supplier 
State 
initiative, 
and 
the 
proposal 
of 
the 
German 
Foreign 
Minister 
(still 
under 
development), 
as 
well 
as 
any 
other 
such 
proposals 
that 
might 
be 
elaborated 
in 
the 
near 
term. 
2. 
a 
second 
Â 
mid 
and 
long 
term 
Â 
phase, 
focusing 
on 
the 
possibilities 
of 
evolving 
a 
truly 
comprehensive 
multilateral 
system, 
integrated 
with 
commercial 
market 
mechanisms 
and 
designed 
to 
assure 
supply 
adequacy

Included 
for

The 
evolution 
of 
a 
fuel 
assurance 
framework, 
in 
the 
first 
phase, 
would 
likely 
entail 
a 
step-by-step 
approach, 
requiring 
the 
IAEA 
Secretariat, 
in 
consultation 
with 
Member 
States, 
industry 
and 
other 
expert 
parties, 
to 
present 
proposals 
to 
the 
IAEA 
Board 
of 
Governors, 
through 
the 
Director 
General, 
as 
they 
mature 
and 
as 
policy, 
technical 
and 
legal 
issues 
are 
worked 
out. 


IAEA 
Special 
Event 


To 
facilitate 
IAEA 
Member 
State 
discussion 
of 
recent 
proposals 
on 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanisms, 
with 
a 
view 
to 
formulating 
well-structured 
recommendations 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanisms 
for 
the 
consideration 
of 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2007, 
and 
focusing 
in 
the 
first 
phase 
on 
assurances 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
for 
nuclear 
power 
plants, 
the 
Director 
General 
organized 
a 
Special 
Event 
entitled 
ÂNew 
Framework 
for 
the 
Utilization 
of 
Nuclear 
Energy: 
Assurances 
of 
Supply 
and 
Non-
ProliferationÂ 
during 
the 
50th 
regular 
session 
of 
the 
IAEA 
General 
Conference, 
from 
19 
to 
21 
September 
2006 
in 
Vienna. 
More 
than 
300 
participants 
from 
61 
Member 
States 
and 
various 
industry 
and 
other 
organizations 
took 
part 
in 
the 
discussions. 


The 
discussions 
at 
the 
Special 
Event 
indicated 
that, 
in 
order 
to 
move 
forward, 
a 
number 
of 
policy, 
legal 
and 
technical 
issues 
remain 
to 
be 
addressed 
in 
greater 
detail. 
It 
was 
not 
the 
purpose 
of 
the 
Special 
Event 
to 
judge 
or 
rank 
the 
feasibility 
of 
the 
current 
proposals 
put 
forward 
by 
the 
Director 
General, 
States 
and 
non-
governmental 
organizations. 
Instead, 
the 
objective 
was 
to 
constructively 
identify 
the 
possible 
strengths, 
weaknesses 
and 
opportunities 
presented, 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
full 
range 
of 
perspectives 
represented 
by 
the 
Event 
attendees. 


A 
Way 
Forward 


May 
I 
say 
from 
the 
outset 
that 
through 
the 
discussions 
that 
took 
place 
during 
the 
Event, 
great 
care 
was 
taken 
by 
all 
participants 
to 
make 
clear 
that 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanisms 
are 
not 
intended 
to 
alter 
the 
right 
of 
any 
State 
to 
take 
its 
own 
decision 
regarding 
fuel 
cycle 
choices. 
I 
should 
also 
note 
that 
a 
number 
of 
participants 
expressed 
concerns 
about 
implied 
or 
intended 
conditions 
as 
may 
be 
applied 
to 
fuel 
assurance 
mechanisms. 
From 
the 
discussions 
during 
the 
event, 
I 
believe 
the 
following 
issues 
would 
benefit 
from 
further 
elaboration. 


Why 
is 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism 
needed? 


Proponents 
of 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
international 
back-up 
mechanism 
for 
assured 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
power 
reactor 
fuel 
assert 
that 
it 
would 
have 
a 
dual-objective, 
i.e. 
to 
address: 
(a) 
the 
possible 
consequences 
of 
interruptions 
of 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
due 
to 
political 
considerations 
that 
might 
dissuade 
countries 
from 
initiating 
or 
expanding 
nuclear 
power 
programmes; 
and 
(b) 
the 
vulnerabilities 
that 
create 
incentives 
for 
building 
new 
national 
enrichment 
and 
reprocessing 
capabilities. 
Thus, 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism 
would 
be 
envisaged 
solely 
as 
a 
back-up 
measure 
to 
the 
operation 
of 
the 
commercial 
market, 
for 
those 
States 
that 
want 
to 
make 
use 
of 
it, 
in 
order 
to 
assure 
supply 
in 
instances 
of 
interruption 
for 
political 
reasons. 
It 
would 
neither 
be 
a 
substitute 
for 
the 
existing 
commercial 
market 
in 
nuclear 
fuels, 
nor 
would 
it 
deal 
with 
disruption 
of 
supply 
due 
to 
commercial, 
technical 
or 
other 
non-political 
reasons. 
While 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism 
would 
be 
designed 
to 
give 
supply 
assurance 
to 
States 
that 
voluntarily 
choose 
to 
rely 
on 
international 
fuel 
supply, 
rather 
than 
build 
their 
own 
indigenous 
fuel 
cycle 
capabilities, 
a 
State 
availing 
itself 
of 
such 
a 
mechanism 
would 
not 
be 
required 
to 
forfeit, 
or 
in 
any 
way 
abridge, 
its 
rights 
under 
Article 
IV 
of 
the 
NPT, 
in 
connection 
with 
peaceful 
uses 
of 
nuclear 
energy. 


The 
path 
forward 
would 
benefit 
from 
a 
clear 
consensus 
judgment 
of 
the 
proliferation 
risks 
associated 
with 
increased 
diversification 
of 
enrichment 
and 
other 
fuel 
cycle 
capacities. 
Correspondingly, 
Board 
of 
Governors 
consideration 
would 
benefit 
from 
clarification, 
by 
each 
of 
the 
proposal 
sponsors, 
concerning 
any 
explicit 
or 
implicit 
conditionality 
applicable 
to 
eligible 
beneficiaries 
of 
the 
supply 
assurance 
mechanism.

What 
is 
to 
be 
assured? 


From 
the 
discussions, 
it 
was 
clear 
that 
existing 
proposals 
dealt 
with 
assurances 
of 
supply 
in 
different 
but 
complementary 
ways. 
Some 
of 
the 
proposals 
focused 
on 
assuring 
supplies 
of 
natural 
uranium 
and 
low 
enriched 
uranium 
stocks, 
and 
still 
others 
focused 
on 
assurances 
of 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
itself, 
through 
the 
establishment 
of 
a 
series 
of 
interlocking 
arrangements 
among 
major 
suppliers. 
Furthermore, 
it 
was 
asserted 
that 
there 
was 
also 
a 
complementary 
need 
for 
greater 
transparency 
in 
uranium 
markets, 
and 
that 
assured 
access 
to 
a 
broader 
range 
of 
nuclear 
reactor 
technology 
would 
be 
important 
to 
operators 
and 
countries 
seeking 
to 
reduce 
the 
risk 
of 
interruptions 
on 
political 
grounds. 


It 
was 
clear 
that 
a 
fully 
developed 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism 
would 
comprise 
several 
of 
the 
ideas 
advanced 
which, 
taken 
as 
a 
whole, 
are 
considered 
mutually 
supportive 
and 
consistent. 
It 
is 
equally 
clear 
that 
this 
evaluation 
would 
need 
to 
be 
phased 
in 
over 
time. 


What 
are 
the 
modalities 
of 
assurance 
mechanisms? 


The 
discussions 
showed 
that 
the 
modalities 
of 
possible 
fuel 
assurance 
mechanisms 
would 
also 
need 
to 
be 
assessed. 
The 
possible 
modalities 
could 
include: 
1) 
a 
virtual 
reserve1 
of 
natural 
and 
low 
enriched 
uranium, 
based 
on 
binding 
contractual 
agreements 
for 
the 
supply 
of 
such 
material, 
plus 
parallel 
binding 
commitments/assurances 
of 
fuel 
fabrication 
services. 
It 
was 
recognized 
that 
while 
an 
actual 
(physical) 
bank 
of 
natural 
or 
low 
enriched 
uranium 
could 
be 
established, 
it 
would 
be 
impractical 
for 
technical 
and 
economic 
reasons 
to 
have 
an 
actual 
bank 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
assemblies, 
given 
the 
different 
types 
of 
reactor 
designs 
and 
the 
many 
variants 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
required 
for 
them 
Â 
in 
this 
case, 
the 
physical 
bank 
of 
nuclear 
material 
would 
need 
to 
be 
supplemented 
by 
parallel 
binding 
commitments/assurances 
of 
fuel 
fabrication 
services. 
It 
was 
recognized 
that 
the 
complexity 
and 
details 
of 
such 
modalities 
requires 
further 
consideration. 


What 
objective 
criteria 
would 
be 
required? 


The 
discussions 
also 
touched 
upon 
the 
issue 
of 
objective 
criteria, 
i.e. 
the 
conditions 
governing 
eligibility 
for 
benefiting 
from 
assurance 
mechanisms. 
Different 
eligibility 
criteria 
have 
been 
included 
in 
the 
proposals 
discussed. 
Further 
discussion 
is 
required 
regarding 
the 
nature 
of 
the 
non-proliferation 
undertaking 
to 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
qualifying 
criterion. 
It 
was 
recognized 
that 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
IAEA 
Statute, 
an 
Agency-administered 
assurance 
mechanism 
would 
have 
to 
be 
available 
to 
all 
Member 
States 
in 
a 
non-discriminatory 
manner. 
For 
any 
mechanism, 
whether 
or 
not 
it 
involves 
a 
role 
for 
the 
Agency, 
certain 
release 
criteria 
would 
need 
to 
be 
defined 
and 
agreed 
upon, 
either 
by 
the 
IAEA 
Board 
of 
Governors 
or 
the 
supply 
consortium. 
Another 
aspect 
requiring 
further 
assessment 
is 
how 
best 
to 
assure 
that 
the 
application 
of 
the 
release 
mechanism 
is 
demonstrably 
non-political 
and 
based 
on 
objective 
criteria. 


Possible 
role(s) 
of 
the 
Agency? 


Existing 
proposals 
envisage 
different 
roles 
for 
the 
Agency, 
and 
yet 
others 
can 
be 
considered. 
The 
suggested 
roles 
ranged 
from 
Agency 
administration 
or 
ownership 
of 
natural 
or 
low 
enriched 
uranium 
stocks, 
to 
administration 
of 
virtual 
stocks 
and 
associated 
parallel 
fuel 
fabrication 
commitments. 
It 
was 
noted 
that 
the 
IAEA 
Statute 
was 
sufficiently 
broad 
to 
allow 
the 
Agency 
to 
establish 
its 
own 
stocks 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
purchased 
from, 
or 
donated 
by, 
Member 
States 
for 
supply 
to 
another 
Member 
State 
against 
charges 
determined 
by 
the 
Board; 
to 
facilitate 
the 
supply 
of 
nuclear 
fuel 
from 
one 
Member 
State 
to 
another; 
and 
also 
to 
facilitate, 
inter 
alia, 
the 
provision 
of 
enrichment 
and 
fuel 
fabrication 
services 
by 
one 
Member 
State 
to 
another 
or 
to 
the 
IAEA. 
It 
was 
noted 
further 
that 
a 
number 
of 
legal 
arrangements 
were 
needed, 
with 
variations, 
depending 
on 
whether 
title 
to 
the 
material 
concerned 
passes 
through 
the 
Agency 
or 
whether 
it 


A 
virtual 
reserve 
does 
not 
involve 
a 
separate 
physical 
storage 
of 
natural 
or 
low 
enriched 
uranium, 
but 
relies 
on 
its 
availability 
from 
suppliers 
that 
have 
agreed 
to 
be 
a 
part 
of 
the 
fuel 
assurance 
mechanism.

passes 
directly 
from 
the 
Supplier 
State 
to 
the 
Recipient 
State. 
These 
were: 
(1) 
an 
arrangement 
between 
the 
Supplier 
State 
and 
the 
Agency; 
to 
include 
inter 
alia 
consent 
rights 
by 
the 
Supplier 
State 
to 
export 
the 
fuel, 
licensing 
and 
transport 
requirements 
as 
well 
as 
the 
corresponding 
privileges 
and 
immunities; 
(2) 
an 
arrangement 
between 
the 
Recipient 
State 
and 
the 
Agency 
to 
include 
inter 
alia 
the 
issues 
listed 
in 
Article 


XI.F 
of 
the 
Statute; 
(3) 
the 
underlying 
contractual 
arrangements 
with 
nuclear 
fuel 
providers, 
transporters, 
storage 
providers, 
etc.; 
and, 
(4) 
in 
case 
the 
IAEA 
were 
to 
establish 
an 
actual 
bank 
of 
nuclear 
fuel, 
agreements 
covering 
safeguards, 
security, 
safety 
and 
liability 
for 
nuclear 
damage 
with 
the 
State 
where 
the 
fuel 
is 
located 
as 
well 
as 
transit 
agreements 
with 
neighbouring 
States. 
While 
models 
of 
certain 
legal 
arrangements 
already 
exist, 
the 
details 
would 
need 
to 
be 
worked 
out. 
Possible 
role(s) 
of 
the 
nuclear 
industry? 


The 
discussions 
involved 
the 
participation 
of 
representatives 
of 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
and 
showed 
that 
different 
roles 
for 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
can 
be 
envisaged 
or 
have 
been 
proposed 
and 
that 
there 
are 
many 
technical 
and 
other 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
nuclear 
fuel 
that 
need 
further 
discussion 
and 
consideration. 
It 
was 
recognised 
that 
for 
a 
well-functioning 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism, 
whether 
for 
nuclear 
fuel 
or 
for 
reactors, 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
would 
be 
an 
essential 
partner. 
In 
this 
regard, 
further 
consultations 
would 
be 
useful 
with 
the 
nuclear 
industry, 
particularly 
on 
a 
framework 
under 
which 
the 
nuclear 
industry 
would 
provide 
the 
required 
goods 
and 
services 
in 
support 
of 
an 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanism, 
without 
negative 
effects 
on 
the 
diversity 
and 
stability 
of 
the 
existing 
commercial 
market 
in 
nuclear 
fuels. 


Other 
key 
issues 


The 
discussions 
also 
showed 
that 
several 
other 
important 
issues 
concerning 
assurance 
mechanisms 
require 
further 
consideration. 
These 
include, 
for 
instance, 
issues 
related 
to 
sustainable 
financing. 
Other 
unresolved 
key 
issues 
are 
how 
to 
structure 
assurance 
mechanisms 
in 
a 
manner 
that 
does 
not 
result 
in 
a 
real 
or 
perceived 
division 
between 
nuclear 
fuel/reactor 
technology 
haves 
and 
have-nots, 
and 
does 
not 
undermine 
existing 
multilateral, 
treaty-based 
nuclear 
non-proliferation 
norms 
or 
State 
sovereignty/rights. 


Next 
Steps 


Based 
on 
the 
discussions 
at 
the 
Special 
Event, 
it 
is 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Event 
Chairman 
that 
the 
issues 
noted 
above 
require 
further 
detailed 
expert 
examination 
with 
a 
view 
to 
formulating 
well-structured 
recommendations 
regarding 
the 
establishment 
of 
assurance 
of 
supply 
mechanisms. 


It 
is 
also 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
Event 
Chairman 
that 
such 
recommendations 
could 
usefully 
be 
structured 
in 
terms 
of 
policy, 
legal 
and 
technical 
issues, 
and 
that 
proposals 
could 
be 
formulated 
by 
the 
IAEA 
Secretariat 
working 
in 
parallel 
with 
and 
drawing 
upon 
Member 
States, 
nuclear 
industry 
and 
other 
appropriate 
expertise. 
This 
work 
would 
naturally 
take 
into 
account 
current 
as 
well 
as 
future 
proposals 
and 
other 
relevant 
ideas 
and 
studies, 
and 
this 
work 
can 
and 
should 
be 
undertaken 
to 
allow 
consideration 
of 
these 
matters 
by 
the 
Board 
of 
Governors 
in 
2007. 
It 
is 
likely 
that 
these 
undertakings 
will 
evolve 
into 
an 
agenda 
for 
near-and 
mid 
term 
actions. 


I 
trust 
that 
these 
observations 
will 
be 
conveyed, 
along 
with 
any 
recommendations 
in 
this 
connection 
by 
the 
Director 
General, 
to 
the 
AgencyÂs 
Board 
of 
Governors.
